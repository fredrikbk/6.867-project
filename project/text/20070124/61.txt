health and taxes now were getting somewhere the u s has long needed a debate over health care and tax subsidies and president bush got ready to rumble last night with his proposal to make insurance more affordable for most americans for all the griping about our system americans have the most advanced health care in the world in part because we still have something resembling a private market for insurance but it is not a truly efficient market because current tax policy lets businesses but not individuals deduct the cost of health expenditures thus most americans with private insurance get it from their employers which leads to inequities and insulates individuals from the real cost of their treatment decisions mr bushs "standard deduction" for health care would move in the direction of solving both problems instead of giving employers an unlimited deduction and individuals none mr bush would give every family a &# deduction &# for individuals regardless of their insurance source that might mean a slight tax increase for those who currently have the most expensive insurance plans but the average employer sponsored family plan runs about &# annually and about of the million employer insured americans would benefit all americans with employer sponsored insurance would have to report the value of their health benefit as income but they could deduct the full &# no matter how much their insurance cost the million americans who buy their own coverage would be big winners and because the tax deduction would apply to payroll as well as income taxes the benefits would be large even for low income earners so a family making &# would wind up with a tax savings of &# which would offset the cost of acquiring coverage in many states meanwhile a young person making &# could buy a high deductible plan for say &# and actually get a tax break of &# for doing so the treasury estimates the new deduction would add at least five million americans to the ranks of the insured but our guess is that would be higher given the incentives all of this would provide for new private insurance products individuals who buy their own health insurance now struggle because there are so few of them and they can buy only in a single state market that means insurers have little incentive to develop and market innovative products but this will change if the equalized tax treatment convinces enough people that it makes more sense to have their own portable policies than take whatever their boss offers imagine the same kind of capitalist energy devoted to selling health insurance as you now see selling where to roll over your k these new products are also likely to be policies that put individuals directly in charge of more routine spending thats because removing the tax advantage would mean it will make less financial sense to "insure" for predictable expenses like several annual office visits that in turn could put pressure on health care providers to post and actually compete on prices such new price awareness might even generate pressure for states that overregulate their insurance markets new york massachusetts to ease their costly mandates its true that additional subsidies might be needed for some people with chronic illnesses who might have a harder time finding private insurance in this kind of world and wed also like to see a more national insurance market with companies able to sell policies over the internet free of the worst state mandates but the biggest problem with mr bushs plan is that it wasnt offered two years ago when it had a better chance to pass the white house wasted its first term health energies on a failed attempt to buy votes with the medicare drug benefit now the gop is a minority in congress and democrats arent likely to favor mr bushs ideas because they think health care is a winner for them in ways and means chairman charlie rangel was quick out of the box to call the presidents idea "a dangerous policy that ultimately shifts cost and risk from employers to employees " but the numbers show that most americans would have lower costs and in any case the current tax treatment of health care benefits tends to benefit the well to do over the poor figures from the lewin group show that the average tax subsidy under the current system was &# for families earning over &# in while those with incomes below &# got less than &# in aid democrats ought to favor this idea on equity grounds alone but no matter if they dont were fated to debate health care in anyway and mr bush is finally offering a gop reform based on market principles that these pages have encouraged for years most americans can see for themselves that the current employer based system is breaking down as more companies pass along the rising cost of their insurance to employees in higher co pays and deductibles yet the system remains opaque and frustrating because of the underlying tax bias for businesses instead of individuals this status quo wont hold and the political race is going to be between those who want to move to a more genuine market and consumer based health care and those who want to move toward canada europe and more government control the bush plan ought to jump start that debate
