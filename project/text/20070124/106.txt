state of the union immigration proposals reverse party loyalties washington president bushs call for an overhaul of immigration law is largely a reprise of earlier plans but with a twist with his party out of power on capitol hill it could pass mr bush elevated immigration to one of four domestic policy priorities in his state of the union address even while offering an agenda similar to last years plan he proposed a temporary worker plan a path to legalization for some of the estimated million illegal immigrants tougher border enforcement and measures to ensure employers hire only legal workers democratic control of congress clears one big obstacle a republican house leadership focused on a crackdown in part by building a fence along miles of the u s mexico border both houses are expected to take up bills that resemble mr bushs plan senate majority leader harry reid d nev said his chamber could pass a bill by august the house which hasnt held hearings on the most contentious issues will take longer although rep zoe lofgren d calif who heads the house immigration subcommittee said "we can get somewhere " even so immigration is such a volatile issue that passing a bill "is going to be a mountain to climb " said frank sharry of the national immigration forum a coalition of pro immigration business labor and advocacy groups mr bush and congressional democrats agree on the outlines of a bill but they are far apart on details both agree on helping employers fill jobs with temporary workers without that they say the u s economy will remain a magnet for illegals but the president insists those workers must eventually leave a key demand of conservatives who fear the growing hispanic population is undermining american culture generally democrats want to let them stay and eventually become citizens the issue cuts across party lines which will make compromise difficult business groups which generally are friendlier to republicans say making workers go home would be disruptive to employers and create a permanent underclass with no loyalty to the u s mr bushs insistence that workers go home "would be the death knell for bipartisan agreement " mr sharry said labor unions which are generally supportive of democrats and wield more clout after democratic wins in the november elections fear that temporary workers will drive down wages for u s workers mr bush and congressional democrats favor legalizing many of the illegals now in the u s a senate bill last year proposed treating them differently depending on how long they have been in the u s thats seen as unworkable even by house democrats coming up with an alternative will be contentious the president and pro immigration democrats fear that a plan that allows too many illegal immigrants to stay will be branded an amnesty by wary voters while a plan that allows too few to stay wont work the white house wants illegal immigrants to pay a fine and back taxes learn english and hold jobs for a number of years as yet unspecified before they could legalize the approach is popular with democrats passage of a bill in either house will depend on the support of republicans however many of whom complain those measures are a slap on the wrist the november elections have given a boost to supporters of immigration overhaul which could help ease passage hispanic voters peeled away from republicans largely because of the partys hard line stand on immigration and both parties are eager to claim that growing voter bloc employers want a bill that sets worker verification guidelines and protects them from immigration raids the administration stepped up enforcement last year making thousands of arrests that created a furor among employers who say they have no way to know if a worker is legal the issue cuts both ways democrats fear handing mr bush a big legislative victory but they hope he can deliver republican votes still lawmakers are hopeful "this is one issue where theres a lot of overlap between the presidents position and our position " said rep howard berman d calif "what the president hasnt ever been willing to do is spend credits on it i hope he has some left "
