local papers mull their global role the boston globe said it would close all three of its remaining overseas bureaus reflecting a painful issue for larger metropolitan papers in the presence of steep budget cuts do they get out of international and national coverage and focus relentlessly on their local markets advertisers think they should and so do some of the people interested in buying those papers they see a world with wire services like the associated press and a tier of national papers like the wall street journal the new york times and the washington post providing national and foreign news "im not sure local papers need to cover iraq need to cover global events " jack welch the former general electric co chairman who wants to buy the globe from new york times co told cnbc last week "they can be real local papers and purchase from people very willing to sell to you their wire services that will give you the coverage " reducing international staff at big metropolitan papers has become a contentious debate at many newspapers as publishers struggle to redefine themselves overseas coverage can confer prestige and prizes and attract talented reporters and editors but now foreign bureaus are increasingly being considered a luxury "many other regional newspapers some larger than ours have taken similar steps in recent years " globe editor martin baron said in a memo to his staff "all along a guiding principle was to secure the resources required for local coverage and for journalism that has the most direct impact on our readers " the dallas morning news long island n y s newsday and the baltimore sun are among the papers that have announced that they are closing their foreign bureaus a recently completed report from jill carroll the former christian science monitor iraq stringer who was a fellow at harvard universitys shorenstein center notes that the number of foreign correspondents at u s newspapers had dropped to in down nearly from in the number of overseas reporters from all but the five largest papers fell to in from in news magazines too have been hit by the same pressures both washington post co s newsweek and time inc s time magazine have closed down foreign bureaus in recent years focusing instead on more health education and news you can use coverage the issue is at the heart of a long running dispute between tribune co and its biggest paper the los angeles times tribune management sees the l a times as a paper that should focus on its huge local area the staff at the l a times sees itself as one of a small handful of papers in the country that still consistently devotes big resources to international and national events the l a times has resisted efforts to coordinate coverage with other tribune papers such as the chicago tribune for many papers the line between international and local coverage blurs when international coverage is of intense interest to local immigrant populations the globe "will continue to send reporters and photographers abroad on special projects and selected major events " mr baron said in his memo mr baron declined to comment beyond his memo despite being owned by the new york times since the globe takes little content from the times instead relying on wires services from rival organizations such as the l a times and the washington post in focus groups bostonians objected to seeing new york times bylines in their hometown paper according to people familiar with the research now carrying foreign stories from the new york times news service seems more likely al larkin the globes executive vice president said a final decision on carrying more content from the new york times hasnt been made he added that the closures would save the company more than &# million annually the high cost of supporting a reporting infrastructure overseas isnt the only issue cable news networks and the internet flash news and photos from around the world instantaneously nowadays local coverage is less vulnerable to these threats moreover with so many other options for receiving news readers dont necessarily expect their local paper to be their source for international coverage anymore similarly advertisers are more attracted by local coverage metro papers have had trouble attracting much national advertising amid competition from television and the internet although papers are taking steps to correct this in their online ventures many analysts feel that the future of newspaper advertising for these papers is to tap more deeply into their own markets where big local papers can dominate real estate investor eli broad who along with supermarket magnate ron burkle has put in a bid to take control of tribune co has also said he would like to see more local coverage in the l a times particularly of the arts "international bureaus have always been a fat target for corporate boards but theres not much money to be had by closing these things down its more a symbol than anything " said john carroll a former editor of the l a times who retired after butting heads with tribune executives the globes decision affects only four jobs those of the two correspondents in its jerusalem bureau and one each in berlin and bogota but mr baron told his staff that the savings realized were equivalent to a dozen jobs in boston the four staffers will be offered jobs in the u s but the decision wipes out all of the globes international bureaus which were first established in the mid s the move came on the heels of the recent decision by new york times co to offer buyouts to globe employees and cut roughly jobs including in the newsroom and editorial pages corrections &amp amplifications the dallas morning news still has a two person bureau in mexico city a marketplace article wednesday about newspapers shuttering foreign bureaus suggested that the paper was closing all its foreign bureaus wsj jan see related letter "letters to the editor
