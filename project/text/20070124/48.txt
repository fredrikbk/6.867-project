old schmoozefest say the event has become as much about marketing and networking as exchanging ideas with participants and media people attending including heads of state and corporate chieftains the intimacy of earlier years is gone but there are other benefits "you get people trapped for three or four days in a swiss mountain resort when weather is cold and most of the people are middle aged or elderly and dont ski its a great platform " says martin sorrell ceo of marketing firm wpp group plc with global ceos political leaders nongovernment organizations and major media all there "you have all the stakeholders you want to influence " he adds the five star steigenberger hotel is renting out about temporary offices to companies that want a staff at the forum up from one or two years ago "if we had the space wed have customers for or more offices theres a lot of demand " says ernst wyrtsch general manager at the hotel russian companies attribute their big turnout this year to their increasing wealth and interest in expanding globally gazprom specifically is concerned about plans being floated by the european commission to block producers of energy from also retailing it a move that would complicate gazproms plans to sell its natural gas directly to european union customers "we are very sensitive to the process of liberalization in the eu energy market " says a gazprom spokesman "we want to be part of that dialogue " the spokesman also confirms that gazprom is negotiating a major public relations contract with a consortium of pr firms "we want to change the perception of gazprom in the western press which is a bit negative " he says oleg deripaska a russian tycoon was barred from davos in after a racketeering suit was filed against him in the u s but the suit was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds in and this year he is back mr deripaska is waiting for regulatory approval of a merger that would make his company oao rusal one of the largest aluminum producers in the world "were one of the worlds biggest aluminum producers we have to be there " says georgy oganov spokesman for mr deripaska "its to get our message across and to get the feel of our industrial partners in mining and metals and of where business in general is heading " in panels and at other events coca cola plans to highlight projects to improve community water supplies and reduce emissions of global warming refrigerants a new policy to ensure workers rights particularly in areas of conflict where it does business and portfolio diversification to offer healthy drinks along with soda cokes aim in davos is to bring its efforts to a wide audience rather than to try to outflank critics says tom mattia the companys senior vice president in charge of world wide public affairs and communication "for us it really is a platform to get our voice heard far more than it is about trying to respond to something " he says davos also offers coke the chance for its chairman and chief executive e neville isdell along with its president and chief operating officer muhtar kent "to be viewed as executive statesmen " mr mattia says mr isdell who has regularly made the annual trek to davos is also a co chairman of this years annual meeting in a panel on environmental issues mr isdell will describe a new "water stewardship" strategy to improve water supplies and sanitation in poor communities in africa and elsewhere as well as to ensure responsible use of water at its own bottling plants the company which also plans to highlight some of its water work at a reception it is hosting has invested &# million thus far in projects in countries to tap wells for poor communities clean contaminated water and other efforts at a breakfast meeting and then a reception it is hosting tomorrow evening coke also plans to unveil new "ekofreshment" beverage coolers it has developed as part of an initiative with greenpeace and unilever plc to reduce emissions of global warming gases the new coolers have climate friendlier refrigerants and use as much as less energy by adjusting to surrounding temperature coke says national governments also have treated davos as an opportunity to counter unwanted perceptions india last year launched a massive campaign aimed at moving the countrys growth story out of chinas shadow the campaign started with posters in the zurich airport where most participants arrived buses in the ski resort also carried the slogan "india fastest growing free market democracy " in leaders of turkeys ak party which had just won elections also put on a big display they wanted to counter fears in the west about the partys islamic roots the same year and again in there was a big turnout of u s legislators and cabinet level officials at a time when the reputation of the u s was in decline because of its decision to invade iraq this year the u s government will have a handful of high level representatives but not as many as in "fundamentally one has to recognize that when you have top leaders together as we do it will also be a platform for such things " says andre schneider chief operating officer of the world economic forum it is hard to measure the success of a davos campaign after turkeys governing party became a darling of investors and made the changes needed to secure membership talks with the eu how much davos contributed as opposed to actions the turkish government took later is unclear the confederation of indian industry says on its web site that its campaign in davos last year was a success although that is measurable mainly by media coverage the global popularity of the u s hasnt recovered since the invasion of iraq according to annual multinational surveys
