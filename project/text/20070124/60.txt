gap needs a ceo and many qualify will any apply the job pays well and has plenty of perks theres just one hitch you have to be the next chief executive officer of gap inc the successor to former gap ceo paul pressler who resigned monday must contend with unpopular products falling sales and profits anxious investors problematic store leases fleeing executives and rivals gobbling market share theres also an influential founding family that might balk at a restructuring the ceo might favor all or any of which might give a contender pause no simple solutions are at hand for instance the san francisco retailers board has said it wants the new ceo to understand both fashion and finance a rare combination after joining gap in mr pressler demonstrated his financial chops by cleaning up gaps troubled balance sheet but fell short on design matters by contrast his predecessor mickey drexler considered one of retails most creative minds sometimes let operations slide gap with annual revenue of &# billion could try to make its brands more exclusive and appealing by closing hundreds of its u s and canadian stores but its nearly impossible to restructure scores of leases quickly outside a chapter reorganization perhaps gaps biggest problem and the new ceos biggest challenge is that it has lost its way with american shoppers who once flocked to its gap banana republic and old navy stores as the darlings of the mall the gap brand is now so large that it cant be too trendy or it might not appeal to enough customers to keep its stores running but to make its styles attractive to a huge group of shoppers it produces clothes so basic that they cant command a price premium "when you see a gap in every mall in america who wants to shop there " asks cathy palla a year old stay at home mother in bakersfield calif "people wish to be different and shop in stores that at least appear to be special " nevertheless names of candidates began surfacing yesterday jim difilippo a retail industry specialist at recruiters christian &amp timbers in new york suggested vanessa castagna who is stepping down feb as mervyns chairman kenneth c hicks president and chief merchandising officer of j c penney co and ron johnson who runs apple inc s retail business ms castagna declined to comment as did spokesmen for apple and penney a second retail industry recruiter says that other potential candidates qualified but perhaps unlikely include roger farah president of polo ralph lauren corp recently retired liz claiborne inc ceo paul charron and allen questrom who turned around both barneys and j c penney mr farah "doesnt want to live in california " and the two retired ceos are probably too old and too wealthy to be interested in running another public company that retail recruiter says mr charron declined to comment the others could not be reached another retail veteran with the experience to revive gap would be its own former ceo mr drexler who resigned in after several years of weak sales falling profits and mounting debt mr drexler is now chairman and chief executive of j crew group inc which had a successful initial public offering last year and has experienced a sales boom under mr drexler observers credit him with bringing back a feeling of fun and liveliness to the j crew brand restoring its reputation for quality and raising prices commensurately but its unlikely that he would want to return to gap he owns about of j crew stock according to the companys amended registration statement filed last week a spokeswoman for j crew said mr drexler declined to comment one important chicken or egg matter involves gaps continuing "strategic review" of the gap and old navy divisions led by management with the active involvement of the board gap has said it will announce the outcome of that review no later than march when it reports earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter and a spokeswoman said monday that the timetable wont change but its unclear whether gap can get a new ceo in place by then raising the question of whether the new boss could map her or his own strategy a new ceo might be attracted by the prospect of coming in simply to prepare the company for a sale which could reap a handsome reward for an intense but short engagement even a partial sale that would result in a smaller leaner business might make gaps problems more manageable industry observers say but its unclear that gaps board is willing to take any such steps people familiar with the matter say gap has asked goldman sachs group inc to help it evaluate strategic alternatives including a possible sale of the company one of these people also say that private equity firms are evaluating the retailer and may consider teaming up for bids industry observers maintain that the companys size deteriorating cash flow and lack of assets are major obstacles to any deal but a bigger hurdle may be the fisher family which founded gap in and controlled more than one third of its shares outstanding at the time of the companys last proxy filing in april donald fisher now the chairman emeritus still cares deeply about the fate of the company according to people who know him his son robert nonexecutive chairman of the board also is actively involved serving as interim chief executive during the search for mr presslers successor the company has declined to comment on speculation about a possible deal but an acquaintance of robert fishers says its unlikely the family would want to sell "they still love the company " this person says "for them its not about the money its their legacy " some retail executives may be lured by the gaps loyal founding family "having the fishers there and that legacy is a great thing thats very positive and very attractive to a lot of people " says bobbie lenga head of the retail practice for recruiters russell reynolds associates inc in chicago the fishers "are not the kind of people who run the day to day business " and the companys &# billion cash hoard would be an added attraction ms lenga said a new ceo also must decide what to do about mr presslers numerous hires with ties to walt disney co where mr pressler ran theme parks before joining gap the retailers chief financial officer the president of the gap brand the head of e commerce and the head of human resources all have disney on their resumes its unlikely that any of them will be considered to have the deep retail and merchandising experience that the gap board says it wants lazard analyst todd slater called mr presslers resignation "the beginning of the end of the disney era " corrections &amp amplifications gap inc was founded in in some editions tuesday a marketplace article about the departure of chief executive
