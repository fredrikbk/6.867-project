who cares about the poor when control of the u s congress changed hands earlier this month it was clear that a raised minimum wage would be high on the legislative agenda and indeed an increase to &# from &# per hour raced through the house and is unlikely to face much substantive opposition in the senate the democrats have two reasons for focusing on the minimum wage the first is poverty &# an hour is insufficient to support a family according to the congressional budget office about of workers in making between &# and the new minimum wage lived below the poverty line democrats believe raising the legal minimum will help solve this problem the democrats second reason for a minimum wage hike is relative not absolute deprivation they hope that raising the minimum will lower income inequality which has been a concern of the political left for generations the democratic national committee defended the hike by charging "the federal minimum wage is so disgracefully low that now during a period of extraordinary prosperity for the nations corporations and wealthiest families the average ceo earns as much in just a few hours on the first workday of the year as a full time minimum wage worker earns the entire year " the economic chasm between the ceo and the minimum wage worker in this view is evidence of an unjust society while just about everybody left and right agrees that poverty is unacceptable although policy makers disagree as to whether a minimum wage hike would help or hurt the working poor conservatives do not share liberals concern about income inequality according to the maxwell poll on civic engagement and inequality self described liberals are more than twice as likely as conservatives to say income inequality in america is a "serious problem " and while of liberals think the government should do more to reduce inequality only of conservatives agree this is empirical substantiation for the old cliche that conservatives just dont care about the poor right wrong in fact the data do not tell us that conservatives are uncaring they actually tell us that conservatives are optimists conservatives are relatively untroubled by inequality and unsupportive of government income redistribution because they believe the american economy provides private opportunities to succeed liberals are far more pessimistic than conservatives about the possibility of a better future for americans of modest means consider the evidence while of conservatives believe that hard work and perseverance can help a person overcome disadvantage only of liberals think so this difference of opinion contrary to the convention is not because conservatives earn more money in fact lower income conservatives are about twice as likely as upper income liberals to say they think theres "a lot" of upward mobility in america if a liberal and a conservative are exactly identical in income education sex family situation and race the conservative will be percentage points more likely than the liberal to say that hard work leads to success among the disadvantaged naturally well to do liberals must be amazed at the gullibility of the millions of poorer conservatives who still cling to the idea of americas promise of a better future through hard work and perseverance sunny conservatives of all economic classes may very well prefer to see things their way about america are conservatives naive or are liberals unjustifiably dour reasonable people disagree on this question one thing that is clear however is that conservatives lack of anxiety about income inequality and perhaps even their opposition to redistributive government policies is evidence of a light heart not a hard one mr brooks a professor of public administration at syracuse universitys maxwell school of public affairs is the author of "who really cares the surprising truth about compassionate conservatism" basic books
