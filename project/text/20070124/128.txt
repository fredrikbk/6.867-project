nurse and devout christian in cambridge mass stopped chemotherapy on the doctors advice easton shakespeare recalls his wife assuring him that the doctor who prayed with her over the phone was trustworthy mrs shakespeare died in april four months after her first dose of the viscous liquid her husbands complaints triggered a federal investigation of christine daniel a licensed physician and pentecostal minister practicing in mission hills calif investigators say she used religion to sell expensive nostrums that she claimed could cure cancer dr daniels small business is part of a boom in "christian wellness" dietary supplements and herbal formulas sometimes along with diets inspired by biblical descriptions that sell briskly in a lightly regulated industry sales by religiously affiliated companies have surged since the mid s to account for to of the dietary supplements business which had about &# billion in sales says grant ferrier editor of nutrition business journal in san diego the products are heavily promoted on religious tv radio and web sites through ads featuring testimonials akin to those that evangelicals share in church services "rather than sending money to the guy on tv who promised to heal you you now can send your money for a book on diet and a list of supplements " says donal omathuna a chemist and co author of a book on alternative medicine federal authorities have identified at least three dozen people who drank dr daniels mixtures says a person familiar with the matter among those at least eight people died of cancer according to a food and drug administration investigators affidavit some patients bypassed conventional therapies for dr daniels regimen according to the affidavit patients and family members in a brief phone interview dr daniel said she has sold no substances and only provides palliative "end of life" care "the federal government has it wrong " she said describing federal investigators as "nut cases" and "evil " she declined requests for further comment her tarzana calif attorney manuel miller added "obviously it goes without saying we deny anything improper or illegal thats been done by her shes totally innocent " he said dr daniel "would never under any condition" tell a patient to stop chemotherapy he said he wasnt familiar with products patients say they bought from his client "when youve got the last stages of cancer youre looking for anything possible the issue is did she ever say this will cure cancer " according to the fda investigators affidavit on a religious broadcast dr daniel touted cancer cure rates of or better in an interview with the california medical board she denied making that claim the affidavit said it said she acknowledged selling vitamin mixtures but said they had no regulated ingredients a prosecutor said theres no evidence shes still selling the products former patients and the affidavit say dr daniel sold at least six different liquid formulas fda analysis found some of the formulas contained various herbal compounds as well as protein powder vitamins alcohol and beef extract some patients said they paid as much as &# weekly for care at dr daniels wellness clinic while others report paying a similar amount for a monthly supply of her mixtures for some patients office visits were covered by their medical insurance the fda is looking into allegations that dr daniel violated federal law by introducing an unapproved drug into the market misbranding a drug and committing mail and wire fraud the affidavit says prosecutors filed the affidavit under seal in u s district court los angeles in january to obtain a search warrant of dr daniels home and office "there is nothing wrong with a medical doctor claiming that they can cure someone " said lead prosecutor joseph o johns an assistant u s attorney "what is illegal is selling an unapproved new drug and claiming that it can cure cancer " a federal grand jury has heard testimony in the case say lawyers for a witness and for dr daniel who both testified last year mr shakespeare thinks the doctor hastened his wifes death "she was charging us for one thing but selling us another " he says "i think the operation she had was all a scam and it was a well organized scam " mr miller dr daniels lawyer said she had done nothing improper in the case the supplement business has boomed since passage of the dietary supplement health and education act under the law manufacturers of dietary supplements are not required to document that their products are safe or effective the law bars makers from claiming they can treat cure or prevent illnesses without specific fda approval but lets them tout benefits such as "improved digestion " the fda sent letters last year
