style tricks of the trade a skin care expert wards off the sun peter thomas roth is so worried about the suns effects on skin that when he walks around new york city where his company is based he tries to stay on the shady side of the street the year old whose eponymous skin care line is sold at sephora ulta and luxury hotels and spas around the country says men and women alike "have to use all of what modern science has brought to the table to unwrinkle exfoliate and protect" against sun damage mr roth whose parents owned spas in hungary says that rain or shine he tries to apply sunblock three times a day he sticks to spf arguing that higher numbers are a marketing gimmick and dont provide significant incremental benefits during the workweek he focuses on his arms face and particularly the neck an area that "really shows your age " he says if it gets wrinkled at the beach mr roth turns his sun protection regimen up a notch besides applying sunblock every couple of hours he wears a cap and a short sleeved "swim shirt " which blocks out almost of the suns rays he encourages his wife and two young kids to do the same his advice for beachgoing women "if you want to be sexy and cute in a bikini do it after lunch " like most people mr roth occasionally gets lazy or forgets to apply sunblock in the morning in those instances he takes out some loose powder that he always carries with him and quickly brushes the powder which contains zinc and titanium dioxide on his face and hands if hes stuck in traffic while driving to work he focuses on the left side of his face thats because car windows typically block burn causing uvb rays but not uvas which can age the skin over time one of the biggest mistakes sunbathers make is applying sunscreen while they are already in the sun mr roth says thats because chemical sunscreens take at least minutes to be absorbed into the skin and become effective creams containing zinc or titanium dioxide as their active ingredients on the other hand will block the sun right away the drawback they are harder to rub in and can leave "a white haze "
