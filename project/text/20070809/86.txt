overseas profits provide shelter for u s firms as a weak housing market and a credit crunch pose increasing economic risks at home many u s companies are finding shelter in their growing profits from overseas foreign operations contributed to strong second quarter results in recent weeks from a number of companies ranging from giants like general motors corp and citigroup inc to smaller manufacturers like harley davidson inc part of this upswing can be traced to a weaker dollar which creates an automatic gain when a company translates overseas profits back into now devalued greenbacks but the flush profit reports also demonstrate the benefit to u s companies that have intensified efforts in recent years to push into other markets economies in most other parts of the world including china latin america and europe have grown faster than the u s over the past months providing a countercyclical balance for multinational companies overseas growth could provide further support for companies and investors if parts of the u s economy continue to worsen the profit surge underscores the reasons that u s business executives are so keen to see stalled global trade talks revived and are so concerned about the mounting protectionist backlash in the u s and elsewhere globalization reduces companies dependence on domestic markets and can help workers when companies export but can also hurt wages and job security of some current and former u s workers the trend toward u s companies earning more profits overseas isnt new but it has accelerated in recent years and has spread to more types of companies reflecting the growing globalization of u s business says ed yardeni president of yardeni research inc the share of international profits at u s companies has grown steadily since the s when they accounted for about and now accounts for about a quarter of all profits he says citing commerce department data international earnings of u s companies grew in the first quarter compared with a year ago while domestic earnings rose just says joseph quinlan chief market strategist at banc of america capital management using commerce department data the rise stems from both the weak dollar and faster overseas growth though the currency effect is hard to quantify he said that marks the first time in six quarters that domestic earnings didnt grow in the double digits he said "we do seem to be at an inflection point in terms of domestic economic performance " and its visible in corporate profits says robert barbera chief economist at brokerage firm itg inc in new york "if youre selling earthmovers or cellphones in asia your profits have been growing gangbusters " while companies more reliant on u s business face hurdles this overseas strength is helping bolster the broader u s economy the policy committee of the federal reserve in a statement this week pointed to a "robust global economy" as a factor supporting the u s expansion and justifying leaving interest rates steady it was the feds first reference in more than four years to the rest of the world it also contributes to an overall stable global economy as u s softening is counterbalanced by growth elsewhere had europe and japan continued the slow growth they had posted in past years a weakening u s would pose significant problems many policy makers and academic economists long have prescribed a rebalancing of the global economy after years of the u s drawing capital that would fetch thinner returns elsewhere overseas profit growth marks the flip side for companies grappling with higher commodity prices for everything from copper to oil as the same growth trends that drive up raw materials costs also can help the bottom line second quarter results are still trickling in but for many companies they were strong despite economic headwinds in the u s citigroup chief executive charles prince pointed to "record international results" as the primary reason for his companys strong performance in the latest quarter likewise harley davidson pointed to overseas strength in explaining how its profit jumped in the second quarter even as domestic sales at the iconic milwaukee motorcycle maker fell harley reported that its retail sales grew in every major country in europe during the latest quarter resulting in a nearly jump in total european sales sales in japan canada and all other international markets grew at a combined parker hannifin corp a cleveland based industrial equipment maker notched a profit increase in the latest quarter as overseas demand for its hoses and valves more than made up for weaker sales in north america "were no longer just a north american company " says jack myslenski parkers executive vice president of sales marketing and operations support noting that international sales now account for of parkers revenue up from in more importantly parker has steadily pushed up its profit margins on international business he says today the company makes just as much on valves it sells in asia or latin america as it does on those sold in the u s a shift from only five years ago when international sales typically carried lower margins even detroits beleaguered auto makers are benefiting ford motor co and general motors corp both registered surprisingly strong second quarter earnings with the help of thriving overseas units "if you look at ford and gm they both had very weak american sales so thank god they had eastern europe " says mr quinlan of banc of america the u s dollar index a weighted average of the dollar against six currencies has declined so far this year and is down since january but for many companies the weak dollar is less of a factor than stronger overseas growth deere &amp co reported second quarter net sales outside the u s and canada rose but said only of that could be traced to what it called a "positive currency translation effect " mr quinlan says u s companies have grown adept at selling in diverse markets around the world even at a time when the u s faces anti american political sentiments in many of those same markets the trend is expected to continue mr quinlan estimates u s companies international earnings will grow an additional in the second quarter compared with a year ago while domestic earnings will grow in the range of to u s companies with overseas exposure are doing better by many other measures as well a recent study by morgan stanley concluded that companies in the standard &amp poors stock index that receive a quarter or more of their revenue from outside the u s grow faster and are more likely to beat earnings estimates than those that receive less than a quarter from outside the u s shares of companies with a large percentage of sales from outside the u s have also generally been outperforming those that are u s centric merrill lynch &amp co in a series of reports on corporate strategies ranks the top companies in the s&amp p by foreign exposure in the second quarter the top posted a stock market performance of about outperforming other groups with more companies looking overseas its also increasingly tough to make the list while the last company to make the list in september drew about of its sales from overseas the last company in the same report for july of this year posted of its sales overseas to be sure the benefits of this divergence arent always visible caterpillar inc based in peoria ill reported second quarter profits fell as the company grappled with sliding domestic truck sales and the housing slump which curbs demand for its machinery ceo jim owens said the company saw "spectacular sales growth" overseas but it wasnt enough to overcome the negatives at home caterpillar was also hurt by a spike in prices of raw materials during the latest quarter which came faster than the equipment maker could raise prices says eli lustgarten an industrial sector analyst at longbow research in the case of caterpillar "the cost price squeeze overwhelmed everything " including the companys strength overseas he says
