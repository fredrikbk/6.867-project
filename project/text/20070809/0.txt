a &# desktop comes with software backup and too many catches for just &# you can now buy a desktop computer thats preloaded with full versions of popular types of software this computer comes with free automatic online backup of your files and a design that cuts energy use way below that of a standard computer it gets better this new pc called zonbu from a new company of the same name automatically receives free updates of its software when new versions come out it doesnt require antivirus or other security programs because it runs on the linux operating system which has attracted very few viruses or spyware programs and it takes up almost no room its a tiny little box zonbus overall goal is to vastly simplify the process of buying and using a computer the idea is to make it not only more affordable but also much less of a hassle and much more energy efficient ive been testing the zonbu and it does work its software is still in beta or test mode until next month but you can buy it right now at zonbu com with free software updates into the future however theres a catch several catches in fact some have to do with the machines design and pricing and others with its performance taken together they prevent me from recommending this computer despite its intriguing price and concept the biggest catch is that the zonbu computer doesnt include a hard disk for storing files thats one reason it uses so little energy instead all of your files are stored online on the companys servers that offers several advantages such as the fact that the files are automatically backed up but you have to pay for that online storage in fact to get the &# price for the zonbu computer you have to commit to a two year contract at prices ranging from &# a month for a relatively small gigabytes of storage to &# a month for gigabytes if you opt to pay month to month instead of two years in advance the zonbu will cost you &# to get the zonbu for &# with gig abytes of storage it will cost you &# up front after the discount of three free months that the company is currently offering and the zonbu doesnt come with a monitor keyboard mouse wi fi adapter speakers or dvd drive by comparison you can get a dell inspiron s for just &# after rebate it has twice the memory a dvd drive and a much better processor than the zonbu and it comes with a screen keyboard speakers and mouse oh and a gigabyte hard disk that requires no monthly fee to be fair the dell doesnt come with a full fledged office productivity suite while the zonbu has openoffice a competitor to microsoft office preloaded to get openoffice on the dell you must download and install it also the zonbu monthly service fee is offset by some savings the &# machine uses so much less energy than a typical pc that the company claims you could save noticeably on your electric bill and you might also save the cost of subscribing to security software updates because the zonbu stores your files on a remote server you can also use them remotely at no extra cost from another zonbu or from any windows pc to speed things up and guard against an internet service outage the built in programs are stored locally on the computer and zonbu includes a small gigabyte memory card in the machine to cache your documents in my tests this allowed me to keep using the zonbu even when i unplugged it from the internet in addition to openoffice the zonbu comes with the firefox web browser an outlook clone called evolution an itunes clone called banshee the skype internet phone software and a bunch of other programs for organizing photos playing video and more there are also some casual games to zonbus credit the machine is capable of recognizing lots of printers and digital cameras out of the box it worked well with my kodak camera and hewlett packard printer but there are three other big problems with the zonbu problems that belie its goal of eliminating hassles first you arent allowed to install any added software youre stuck with what the company provides and that means for instance no video editing software for now at least second a lot of this linux software is rough below the polished level of windows or mac programs in my tests various programs crashed or froze frequently while the banshee program is supposed to work with ipods it failed to work properly with both of the ipods i tested finally i found that the zonbu crawled much of the time folders took forever to open email took way too long to appear and so forth and i was testing it on a very fast internet connection this may be because of the very wimpy processor zonbu uses to save money and energy i strongly support zonbus goals of making computing simpler cheaper and more energy efficient but this product has too many compromises email me at mossberg wsj com find all my columns and videos online free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
