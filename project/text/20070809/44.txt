enigmatic elgars anniversary year this year britain began changing the design of its gbp note why you might ask should this concern a music critic because while the obverse of the note bears a portrait of queen elizabeth ii since the reverse has shown the composer sir edward elgar and now during his th anniversary year elgar is being replaced by the pioneering th century economist adam smith the timing seemed awkward at least to this yank by telephone from london the bank of englands chief cashier andrew bailey whose signature is on current british banknotes explained that the change came out of the periodic need to outsmart counterfeiters "who tend to target the gbp note because it is the one most commonly circulated " mr bailey assured me however that the changeover from elgar to smith will probably last through at this point he said only to of the billion or billion gbp notes in circulation have been replaced "so you can see that a very large number of elgar notes will remain in circulation throughout the elgar year " thus reassured i turned my attention instead to examining how elgars legacy stands up today certainly the proverbial man on the street knows the composers ubiquitous "pomp and circumstance" march as integral to graduation ceremonies as the mortarboard and gown also known by the title of its sung version "land of hope and glory " it is actually the first of four "pomp and circumstance" marches that elgar composed for the coronation of king edward vii in he added a fifth march in apart from the ubiquitous march a number of major elgar works are comfortably ensconced in the standard concert repertoire in america certainly the "enigma variations" is the most frequently programmed elgar work followed by the wistful introduction and allegro for strings elgars violin and cello concertos are in the repertoire of major soloists while the wonderfully playful and picturesque "cockaigne overture" "in london town" is an edwardian counterpart to gershwins "american in paris " elgars two completed symphonies are among the finest of that era ranking in expressiveness and dramatic power with the greatest orchestral works of strauss and mahler his sketches for a third have been "completed" by several scholars with varying results while these provide a fine representation of the composers oeuvre a lot more elgar is far less familiar to audiences and undeservedly so among these are the tone poems "falstaff " "in the south" and "sea pictures" chamber music including the a major piano quintet and certainly the great choral works especially "the dream of gerontius" whose premiere in crowned his celebrity after "enigma" first thrust him into the international limelight the previous year at age elgar had worked long and hard to achieve this "overnight" success the roman catholic son of a provincial music shop owner in the cathedral city of worcester elgar was essentially self taught as a musician having left school at he learned to play the instruments in his fathers shop and absorbed repertoire by studying the scores and sheet music on the shelves this background made him something of an outsider at the start of his career a sensibility that never quite left him even after he had evolved into a symbol of british music steeped as elgar was in british music from purcell and handel through such eminent victorians as sullivan sir hubert parry and sir charles stanford not to mention a wide range of english literature and poetry many of his compositions sound unmistakably english the sense of stately ceremony we identify with england is obvious in works like his marches and certainly youd never confuse the dignified sonority of "land of hope and glory" or the pageant like movements of the "severn suite" with the quintessentially american ebullience of "the stars and stripes forever" or "el capitan" by his exact contemporary john philip sousa more subtly english are elgar melodies like the primary first movement themes of the two symphonies and the moving climax of the meditation from "the light of life" their wide rising intervals have an expansive arching quality that suggests the rhetoric of a shakespearean soliloquy other themes such as those of the cello concerto the main subject of the "enigma variations" and the concluding portion of "falstaff " convey a haunting introspection that was essential to elgars character wagnerian anguish lends additional fire to elgars invention its searing warmth particularly evident in "gerontius " by world war i the composers fame was such that foreign letters simply addressed to "edward elgar england" actually got delivered to his door and with his luxuriant moustache his magnificent aquiline profile his elegantly tailored appearance like his chief predecessor composer sir arthur sullivan elgar was a natty dresser he looked every inch the eminent edwardian gentleman but for a long time after his death that image worked against him like such contemporaries as rachmaninoff sibelius and richard strauss elgar represented a perpetuation of opulent late romantic aesthetics at a time when stravinsky and schoenberg were keenly honing musics cutting edge moreover during the period when to the world at large british music meant either the modernism of britten and tippett or the folk song influence of vaughan williams elgar was dismissed as an embarrassing relic fortunately this attitude has changed "elgar is part of a musical legacy that has spontaneously attracted greater interest with the collapse of modernism " observes the conductor and scholar leon botstein "because at his core is also that personal and religious revelatory impulse which is now very popular in our culture i think elgar is actually a bridge to the st century return of romanticism " this weekend and next august and as co director of the bard music festival in annandale on hudson n y dr botstein will focus considerable attention on elgar whose music will be performed and discussed along with a great deal of rarely heard music by elgars predecessors and contemporaries such as sullivan parry and stanford www fishercenter bard edu bmf schedule to give full disclosure i myself will be participating in a panel discussion of th century british music elgar scholar byron adams a professor of composition and musicology at the university of california at riverside and the editor of the festival book "elgar and his world" princeton university press observes that "elgar is a particularly resonant composer for americans today because he matured in a period not unlike our own his lifetime witnessed enormous technological advances rampant consumerism war and a general sense that the old world had changed forever " prof adams feels that elgars humanity makes his work particularly appealing now "like mahler even in his supposedly extrovert music he compels his audience to look inward " perhaps bard audiences will emerge from the experience with a real enigma in mind why isnt more elgar performed more often mr scherer writes on classical music for the journal the american edition of his book "a history of american classical music" sourcebooks will be published in october
