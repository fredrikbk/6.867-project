how an empire ended forgotten wars by christopher bayly and tim harper belknap pages &# in his memoirs the late british actor dirk bogarde described arriving in india as a soldier in he had just participated in the allied conquest of germany stepping down from his train in calcutta he saw an indian porter being beaten by a "fat finger haired moustached red faced stocky little major from transport screaming thrashing at the cringing indian with his swagger cane my first sight and sound of the raj at work " for the british these postwar years saw the final spasms of an exhausted empire for the countries of southeast asia they marked the final years of the longest general conflict in the region since the mongol invasions of the th century a series of violent confrontations had begun in prompted by japans aggression and support for anticolonial nationalist movements the confrontations turned into open warfare in china in and during world war ii into a series of invasions and counterinvasions that culminated after the war in the struggles for independence and national identity it is these last "forgotten wars" of that are the subject of christopher bayly and tim harpers compelling book the story of "forgotten wars" begins in the ruins of hiroshima and nagasaki where the remnants of human life scurry like animals across a wasted landscape it then moves to the crescent of land stretching from bengal via burma and thailand to the malay peninsula it was an area seething with prisoners of war starved soldiers violent criminals and sex slaves over the next four years new local powers and the returning forces of empire would clash cooperate and clash again laying the groundwork for the continent we know today britain saw the re establishment of its southeast asian colonies e g in malaya and burma primarily as an economic necessity the regions natural resources would help replenish the empires treasury but it was not a task relished by london which had enough to deal with at home britains postwar attitude toward the colonies in general was expressed by clement attlee the labour prime minister "why should it be assumed that only a few great powers can be entrusted with backward peoples why should not one or other of the scandinavian countries have a try they are quite as fitted to bear rule as ourselves why not the united states " his apathy was reflected in the rickety structures of the new colonialism the british military administration of malaya was staffed by young men who had received as messrs bayly and harper write "only a crash course in local topography the malay language and the indian penal code at a police college in wimbledon " the behavior of this new generation shocked the locals who remembered a more courtly breed of british administrator the authors quote a young malay woman who wrote of the british "they flaunted their bad manners before the shocked eyes of the asian population and we winced at the filthy language we heard even to us the new generation of singaporeans it was clear that these soldiers did not belong to the same world as their pre war countrymen the picture of the english gentleman was shattered " even the few british idealists who aspired to establish a more liberal imperialism were quickly disillusioned victor purcell a senior civil servant in malaya had hoped to embed a form of democracy in the country but his ideals were shattered after a few encounters with the planned recipients of his largess the malay people in he wrote "the ideal human being boils down to the moronic the adenoidal the unwashed the scrofulous the naked the illiterate the dumb and above all the passive and the victimized " an extraordinary cast of characters populate "forgotten wars " when the british move into indochina to help re establish french control they meet adm thierry dargenlieu a former monk said by his staff to have had "the most brilliant mind of the twelfth century " dargenlieu had been assigned by gen charles de gaulle to bring indochina back "into the fold of christian civilization " in java which allied forces occupied after the japanese were forced out in nationalist sentiment was stirred by the pemuda a class of young mostly single men who wore long hair and simple clothes and affected a classless manner their cry of "merdeka " or freedom terrified the overstretched colonial authorities so much that they deployed japanese soldiers captured in to keep the peace in burma the postindependence prime minister u nu would spend three or four hours a day in solitary prayer asked about this the indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru quipped "this seems as good a way of governing burma as any " after years of trouble in malaya the british eventually sent gen gerald templer to sort things out templer was a tireless administrator who drew on lessons learned in the boy scouts to inculcate a culture of "service" among the malay authorities his strategy to win the "hearts and minds" of malays often in strenuous media campaigns has been copied by western forces from vietnam to iraq with varying degrees of success messrs bayly and harper describe the years from to as asias "revolutionary hour " a brief period when the disempowered of society women workers peasants and the young cast off their chains self expression took numerous forms from marxism to maoism and religious revivalism but ultimately conservative forces in their own countries took control in burma these forces morphed into the successive military governments who have led the country to isolation and poverty in singapore lee kuan yew imposed a more successful form of discipline to propel his country forward messrs bayly and harper observe that the british military empire reached its geographic zenith in and stretching over a portion of the globe that "would have dizzied even lord curzon " but by this stage britain was simply filling the postwar void the architecture of empire was already in terminal disrepair by british asia had collapsed the authors write that "the end of empire is not a pretty thing if examined too closely " but when examined so ably it is certainly fascinating mr delves broughton is a writer in new york
