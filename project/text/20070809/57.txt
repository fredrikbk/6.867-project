growing interest when hedge funds meet islamic finance u s firms hire scholars to help design products the rent a sheik issue haymarket va one recent afternoon new york money manager james rickards presented sheik yusuf talal delorenzo with a dilemma could his hedge fund be islamic friendly islam prohibits all kinds of speculative behavior that is embedded in wall streets dna but mr delorenzo a massachusetts born convert to islam is on a mission to meld centuries old islamic law with modern finance in the u s mr rickardss fund couldnt bet on currency futures or some of the shares in the standard &amp poors index mr delorenzo said if he wants observant muslims to invest but some alterations could earn the sheiks approval such as holding currencies instead of futures and buying only s&amp p companies that arent debt heavy or dependent on profit from interest payments "music to my ears " mr rickards said "it sounds like i can still get the effect im looking for " with the middle eastern economy booming partly thanks to soaring oil wealth the islamic financial industry has been expanding at a clip of about a year according to accounting firm kpmg and is on pace to reach &# trillion in two years the money is seeking new outlets and western financial institutions are seeking new clients opening the door for more aggressive methods to reconcile two worlds that dont easily mesh the issue of whats permissible has opened fault lines within islamic finance malaysian adaptations of western style bonds for instance have been condemned then copied in muslim countries in the middle east scholars consulting for western financial institutions are criticized for bending religious laws to serve financial ends the "rent a sheik" argument says one u s bank official vendors profit by "capitalizing on peoples religious insecurities " says mahmoud el gamal a professor of economics who holds a chair in islamic finance at rice university "dont take my duck sprinkle holy water on it and say its a chicken " islamic law or shariah stems from the quran and subsequent interpretations by scholars in the economic realm commerce receives divine approval but several verses speak of a prohibition on interest a practice viewed as exploiting the borrower an association in bahrain is the informal authority on shariah compliance for islamic financial institutions but its standards arent mandatory and dont govern the offerings of western firms which retain their own shariah boards to advise them and issue their own rulings or fatwas top scholars can serve on dozens of boards earning retainers of up to &# to &# a year per client scholars who give their seal of approval sometimes receive a percentage of assets invested mr delorenzo says its rare to get a percentage of assets but that one time he accepted such compensation among his other clients is dow jones &amp co parent company of the wall street journal which retains him and five other scholars to consult on its indexes of shariah compliant companies mr delorenzo receives an annual retainer of &# plus stipends for attending two to three meetings a year western banks say they make more than cosmetic changes to create shariah compliant financial products london based barclays bank plc which worked with mr delorenzo and a firm called shariah capital inc on a platform for hedge funds to trade without violating islamic requirements had to rewrite a odd page brokerage contract the concept of short selling using borrowed shares to bet on a stocks decline was replaced with an islamic down payment structure known as an arboon any reference to a "guarantee" was replaced for instance by a pledge of collateral because islamic rules require shared risk by all parties "there were definitely a few firsts " says kieran mccann a director in barclays capitals prime brokerage group the gap between wall street and islamic financial law can be uncomfortably wide especially amid lingering distrust on both sides after the terrorist attacks on the u s but the u s also is home to several million middle class muslims one of the largest markets in the west a zogby poll for georgetown university found a majority have college educations and earn &# or more a year some early steps in providing islamic alternatives have exposed pent up demand once word began to spread that devon bank in chicago was exploring islamic financial products in there was an immediate response from the local muslim community says bank vice president david loundy "people said can you do houses cars lines of credit and how about my sister in connecticut " some customers went as far as calling scholars in pakistan to vet the acceptability of devons services he said one devon customer ahmed khan a technology executive at dutch based bank abn amro holding nv says he owned a home in the late s but was "very uncomfortable" paying conventional mortgage interest and went back to renting in he took out a devon "shariah compliant" mortgage using a method called ijara the bank bought mr khans condominium and he pays a monthly sum to buy it from the bank over time plus a lease payment for using the property in the first five years his cost of financing is about he says and he paid some fees beyond normal closing costs for the specialized legal structure mr khan had to fill out a standard mortgage application but says its important for u s muslims to accept such compromises to encourage banks efforts "if you dont show that demand there will never be any supply " he says the bank also converts the arrangement to a conventional mortgage for its regulators and the internal revenue service and advises customers to seek tax advice on whether its deductible mr khan takes the deduction mr delorenzo years old is at the center of the push to develop islamic financial products in the u s he also serves on boards of islamic scholars that rule on their acceptability as do a cadre of less than top scholars globally only a couple of them in north america who advise banks and financiers mr delorenzos clients have included morgan stanley brown brothers harriman &amp co royal bank of scotland plc and frances societe generale sa an islamic mortgage that mr delorenzo helped develop here is serving as a blueprint for a venture in saudi arabia he worked with a lebanese investment bank to structure the first ever islamic bond from a u s company issued last year by a small texas energy firm mr delorenzo acted as "a cultural bridge between us and the rest of the scholars " says ibrahim mardam bey of bemo securitisation the lebanese bank he can read banks term sheets as well as the quran and has another advantage says mr mardam bey "very few of the other scholars care to read their email " mr delorenzo named anthony at birth is a grandson of sicilian immigrants whose family was half catholic half methodist and was raised in neither religion he says he uses the islamic honorific "sheik" that religious scholars are free to claim for themselves but favors business suits and has a trimmed white beard he was interested in finance from the age of when he asked his mother to buy him shares in studebaker motor co he says as a cornell university student he hopped a trans atlantic freighter to study in spain but tired of the trip early and got off in casablanca there he became fascinated with arabic and arab culture and began to read the quran he never returned to cornell instead studying in cairo and karachi he changed his name married a pakistani woman and in the s became an adviser on education to the pakistani government after attending a conference on islamic economics held in pakistan he began collecting fatwas on islamic banking issued by religious scholars across the muslim world in amid escalating violence in karachi armed men attempted to shoot their way into the home where mr delorenzo his wife and their three children lived one of the familys servants was shot in the head the case was never solved he says mr delorenzo quickly moved his family to virginia and his interests turned to the challenges faced by observant muslims living in the u s the islamic financing options here small scale efforts by cooperatives rather than financial heavyweights left him unimpressed "they were charging people too much making them stand in line for six months to a year demanding down payments of on a house and didnt have very good shariah advice if any " he began to establish his reputation as an expert in the late s after publishing a collection of english translations of the islamic banking fatwas in he began working with what would become guidance financial group a company founded by mohamad hammour a former economics professor at columbia university the goal to offer u s muslims a competitively priced islamic mortgage it took a year and a half to hammer out a solution that they believed could not only comply with shariah but also clear the various home finance regulations of individual states it also needed to be eligible for financing by mortgage giant freddie mac "we had to essentially reinvent the entire mortgage process from the day you talk to the consumer to the day the mortgage gets sold on wall street " says dr hammour guidance offers a co ownership agreement known as a musharaka a slightly different strategy than that of devon bank the customer and guidance jointly form a new corporation to own the home part of the customers monthly payment goes toward buying out guidances share and part is a "utility fee " which the home buyer pays in exchange for using the asset guidance says it keeps the fees roughly competitive with the market in year mortgage interest rates though there are added fees connected with the co ownership venture by the end of the term the home buyer has completely bought out guidances stake and wholly owns the house guidance reports the transaction to the irs as a conventional mortgage like devon bank and says its customers generally take a regular deduction guidance says it reached &# billion in such financing in june and is now operating in states and washington d c the firm contends the market for shariah compliant mortgages in the u s could top &# billion a year another member of guidances shariah board is a former pakistani judge muhammad taqi usmani whose expertise is a major selling point for guidance customer ferzana mir a doctor from pakistan who lives in plano texas mr usmani also serves on the dow jones shariah board dr mir refuses interest on her u s bank accounts and says some u s muslims she knows are skeptical of a mortgage like hers because they view its substitutions for interest as "just a play on words " she disagrees "as you delve into the finer points you understand how this is different " she says mr delorenzo is pushing the envelope with an even more complex product the islamic trading system for hedge funds he helped develop with barclays and greenwich conn based shariah capital in the summer of shariahs ceo eric meyer was a hedge fund manager looking for a new venture he was impressed by mr delorenzos writing on islamic finance he sought him out and the two men talked for more than five hours about how to create an islamic hedge fund mr delorenzo had his doubts hedge funds variety of complex investment strategies including "short selling" stocks by selling borrowed shares to bet their price will drop poses a problem in islamic finance investors arent allowed to sell what they dont own because it represents an unacceptable form of speculation there are other prohibitions too because of the ban on interest payments investors must avoid companies like banks that rely on interest for their income for the same reason they are required to steer clear of firms that carry high levels of debt defined in different rulings as around one third of either market capitalization or assets and thus pay a significant amount of interest those are obstacles that would stop some experts monzer kahf an economist and consultant in islamic finance who lives near los angeles says he generally supports islamic finance efforts but draws the line at trying to make hedge funds shariah compliant "what are hedge funds other than advanced forms of speculation " mr delorenzo and other well known scholars began by breaking down the entire process of the traditional short sale "in excruciating detail " recalls mr meyer some of the scholars questions stumped even seasoned short selling pros one example if an investor borrows shares in a company and that company goes bankrupt who has voting rights questions like that were "just exasperating " mr meyer says "youre thinking its bankrupt what does it matter but in islamic finance you always need to know ownership and control" to make sure the risk is shared among the parties after months of meetings in london and new york mr delorenzo and his fellow scholars adapted the arboon contract akin to a down payment that enables the short seller to take ownership of the share rather than just borrowing it to address avoiding companies with too much debt or other issues under islamic law shariah capital developed new screening software it taps directly into the quarterly reports that companies file electronically to the securities and exchange commission and weeds out businesses that carry high amounts of debt or reap significant income from interest payments mr delorenzo now holds the title of chief shariah officer for the company and can tap into the software and monitor whats being traded at any time two u s hedge fund firms have signed up to use the trading platform so far and mr rickards the new york hedge fund manager is considering joining them mr delorenzo says he hopes adapting islam to modern finance could eventually influence other areas of islamic law shariah has "essentially been in a coma for several centuries " he contends "it desperately needs reviving " he says he wants to expand his own small group of colleagues but encounters cultural obstacles he recalls a meeting earlier this year in dubai where a scholar lectured a group of visiting executives from a multinational investment firm about the sinfulness of conventional finance "it was worse than bad " mr delorenzo says
