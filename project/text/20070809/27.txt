bush aims to pacify investors touts economy washington president bush shrugged off concerns about stock market turmoil saying wall street is adjusting to a flood of liquidity and is beginning to "readjust its assessment of risk " mr bush seeking to reassure jittery investors who have watched the market gyrate wildly said the volatility is natural but the economy is strong and there is enough liquidity to absorb the ups and downs "if markets are given a chance they will adjust in a way that is a necessary reaction to a flood of liquidity that came into the market over the last couple of years " the president said during a briefing with reporters at the treasury department investors have been spooked as they try to discern whether a shakeout in the market for risky mortgages will lead to credit tightening throughout the economy the flood of credit to which mr bush was referring fueled a boom on wall street providing loans for homeowners including some with poor finances and sparking a wave of corporate takeovers financed with debt there is concern that a tightening in lending standards could hurt the broader economy asked whether he was concerned that the shakeout could spread mr bush said it "all depends on if youre a glass half full or a glass half empty kind of guy " he said the u s economy is strong and that wall street will "look at the fundamentals of the economy " such as low unemployment and low inflation he added that the correction in the housing market appeared to be heading for a "soft landing " he also dismissed a proposal by some democratic lawmakers to allow fannie mae and freddie mac to increase the amount of mortgages and related securities they can hold as a way of ensuring theres enough money to fund home loans mr bush said hed "rather see their role reformed" before allowing them to expand their investment portfolios the bush administration has long argued that fannie and freddies portfolios should be limited mr bushs comments came after a meeting with his economic advisers and a speech in which he said americans are benefiting from a strong economy in the form of low unemployment and an increase in real wages mr bush fielded economic questions for about minutes despite the presence of treasury secretary henry paulson and edward lazear chairman of the council of economic advisers mr bush dismissed recent polls showing that u s citizens are feeling sour about the economy a recent wall street journal nbc news poll showed that more than two thirds of u s citizens believe the u s economy is either in recession now or will be in the next year he said he understands "theres disquiet out there" but attributed much of the economic anxiety to concerns about the war in iraq "i happen to believe the war has clouded a lot of peoples sense of optimism " separately mr bush said he is considering proposing legislative changes to the u s corporate tax code because the current system "makes us less competitive" with other countries such a proposal could include lowering the corporate rate which many executives say is too high and provides a disincentive to do business in the u s "we may be able to devise a simplification that will enable us to have a tax code thats more competitive and that doesnt decrease revenue to the treasury " mr bush said however he said it would be a tough sell on capitol hill where democrats are in control indeed the suggestions of mr bushs own tax reform commission went nowhere even though republicans were in control of congress at the time
