toyota delays next hybrids on safety concerns toyota motor corp which used the green image of its gasoline electric toyota prius to propel a u s sales surge has decided to delay by one to two years the launches of new high mileage hybrids with lithium ion battery technology because of potential safety problems the slowdown could offer general motors corp and other rivals a chance to narrow the gap in the race to define future clean vehicle technology until recently toyota was preparing to roll out a dozen new and redesigned hybrids using new lithium ion battery technology in the u s between and its hybrids now use nickel metal hydride batteries but safety concerns with the lithium ion technology have forced toyota to back away from that timetable people familiar with the companys strategy say the rollout critical to toyotas goal of selling hybrids a year in the u s by early next decade up from nearly last year is on hold according to toyota executives knowledgeable about the companys hybrid product plans for the u s market toyota also postponed plans for hybrid versions of its big and fuel thirsty tundra pickup and its sequoia sport utility vehicle though the executives added there is a chance toyota would revive big truck hybrids and come out with them by or gm and chrysler llc owned by cerberus capital management llp plan to launch hybrid large suvs next year using a system developed jointly by gm chrysler daimlerchrysler ag and bmw ag the batteries toyota is trying to develop use particles of lithium cobalt oxide but such batteries have shown a tendency to overheat catch fire or even explode tomomi imai a toyota spokesman in tokyo declined to comment but according to toyota executives similar problems with lithium ion batteries for laptops made by japans sony corp sounded an alarm because the chemistry of the sony batteries was similar to batteries toyota was trying to use for future hybrids toyota became the industrys first auto maker to introduce a vehicle that taps gasoline electric hybrid propulsion technology in late when it launched the prius in japan while rivals like honda motor co and ford motor co have matched the company with their own hybrids gm has taken nearly a decade to catch up late last year the detroit auto giant launched its first full fledged hybrid using the nickel metal hydride battery the model year saturn vue green line crossover lithium ion hybrids expensive in comparison to standard gas combustion autos wont likely sell in high volume in the near term still if gm can field a plug in hybrid ahead of toyota it could help the detroit auto maker move beyond its reputation in the u s for old technology and poor fuel economy an image gm executives say is undeserved toyota hit the brakes on the newer technology hybrids because of problems with the safety of lithium ion battery technology which the auto maker was counting on to make hybrids even more fuel efficient and more affordable packing more electricity into the same space and weight as current systems using nickel metal hydride batteries lithium ion batteries would allow hybrids to achieve to miles a gallon in normal operation compared with the to miles per gallon the prius gets now toyota had planned to use lithium ion batteries starting with the next generation prius originally scheduled for launch in late but has decided not to because of safety concerns say toyota executives familiar with the companys plans the company will instead use the conventional nickel metal hydride batteries it has been using in the prius since its launch the next generation prius using conventional batteries is now expected to launch in early the first toyota hybrid that uses lithium ion battery technology wont arrive in the u s until early when a derivative of the prius a wagon comes out company executives say a delay of at least a year from the original plan tony posawatz gms vehicle line director for the chevrolet volt and related hybrid vehicles said gms first lithium ion hybrid will be the saturn vue green line plug in hybrid which individuals knowledgeable about gms product plans say could hit dealer showrooms as soon as late so called plug ins recharge batteries by plugging into the electric grid gm also plans to launch a plug in lithium ion hybrid car called the volt by mr posawatz said in an interview he is confident that gms lithium ion hybrid strategy is on track gm is counting on a different kind of lithium ion technology a systems a watertown mass start up that has come up with a lithium ion battery based on iron phosphates which it says is more chemically stable than others is one of a handful of likely candidates to supply lithium ion batteries to gm a senior toyota executive said the timing for the launch of toyotas first lithium ion battery hybrid model is close to being finalized though the companys medium term hybrid plan is "still very very fluid in some aspects " the executive said the lithium ion prius will most likely hit the market in early but that there is a force within toyotas engineering and product development division that is insisting on launching the model by the end of in that case it could be a horse race between toyota and gm delays to the next generation toyota hybrids also offer an opportunity for rivals that have bet on clean diesel honda for example is pursuing a multipronged approach to alternative technologies including a newly developed diesel engine as toyota grapples with lithium ion technology john mendel a senior honda executive in the u s said the delays will likely provide honda and others "a big break" to build up awareness of diesels honda still sees long term potential in lithium ion technology said company president takeo fukui but mr fukui said he is skeptical the technology can be made reliable enough for vehicles in the next few years by honda plans to launch in the u s a subcompact hybrid with improved nickel metal hydride batteries a hybrid version of the civic now costs about &# more than a comparably equipped gasoline engine civic model with the new subcompact mr fukui says honda is trying to cut the hybrid premium to less than &# volkswagen ag bmw and the mercedes benz unit of daimlerchrysler also plan to field modern diesel engines in u s models starting next year the challenge for diesel is meeting tough u s clean air rules european auto makers say they now have the technology to do that although it will be costly at first fearful of being left behind toyota last year bought a stake in isuzu motors ltd to gain access to the latters clean diesel technology toyotas move to slow hybrid launches comes as the companys president katsuaki watanabe decelerates the companys breakneck expansion pace which vaulted it past gm to be the worlds no auto maker by vehicle sales volume this year toyotas financial resources give it an advantage in developing more fuel efficient vehicles aside from the planned lithium ion prius wagon toyota now plans to launch as many as nine other lithium ion battery hybrids in the period among them are a new wagon style crossover with three rows of seating and a wagon derivative of the camry
