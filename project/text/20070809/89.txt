politics &amp economics korean leaders to meet but agenda is unclear seoul south korea north korean dictator kim jong ils decision to meet south koreas president is another sign that he may be ready to change his countrys isolationist ways and also promised to fuel debate in the souths presidential election campaign mr kim will host south korean president roh moo hyun in pyongyang aug the countries announced yesterday in what will be just the second summit since the two countries went to war in envoys will meet next week to set a formal agenda south korea will push for a stronger show that the north is committed to giving up its pursuit of nuclear weapons and moving toward a formal peace treaty the presidential blue house said although fighting ended in with a cease fire agreement the countries technically remain at war and share the most heavily guarded and fortified border in the world a significant step toward peace would influence public opinion in south koreas presidential election this december conservative opponents of mr roh who are leading his center left party in opinion polls yesterday criticized the timing of the summit and its still ambiguous agenda mr roh cant run for office again but a successful summit could hurt the conservatives and boost his party which hasnt settled on a candidate yet "if he can get something concrete from the north with regard to the nuclear program and military security then the timing doesnt matter " says park young ho senior research fellow at the korea institute for national unification "if not the timing will look like it was politically motivated " north korea in a deal reached in february with south korea and four other nations agreed to begin shutting down its nuclear weapons program in exchange for energy and financial aid the deal marked the first sign in years that mr kim might be willing to make big changes in his country where his father built a dictatorship in around doctrines of race based nationalism and economic isolationism because mr kim is rarely seen or heard in public the summit may yield the most information in years on what his current goals are and how much he might change north korea most signs since february havent been encouraging mr kim moved slowly to implement the denuclearization deal north korea only last month took the first significant step by shutting off its nuclear power plant that provides weapons fuel the country is now resisting the removal of fuel rods a step that would make it harder to restart the plant but for mr roh who had been eager to stage a summit since his election in late the norths initial step is enough in a statement mr roh said the meeting "will not only help resolve the north korean nuclear issue but also enhance inter korean ties " mr roh has repeatedly said he wanted to build on the first inter korean summit staged by his predecessor kim dae jung and the norths mr kim in june the souths mr kim won the nobel peace prize for paving the way to that meeting by reshaping south koreans decades old animosity toward the north but the meeting itself yielded more symbolism than results since then the two countries have had only limited links they have staged reunions by videoconference for long separated families and created a small industrial park in the north funded by a south korean corporation the summit was later tainted by the revelation that the south korean government had funneled several hundred million dollars to mr kims regime to make it happen yesterday a spokesman for mr roh said no money was changing hands to stage the second summit north korea issued a shorter statement than the south to announce the summit it said the discussion would proceed "in the spirit of by our nation itself " a phrase that reflects the nationalism at the heart of the north korean regime but the summit marks a rare moment when the two koreas will try to shape their future outside the view of powerful neighbors japan colonized the korean peninsula from to after that korea was divided in a war between the north which was backed by china and the south which was backed by the u s and other countries "on a larger scale this is a step in the process of the two koreas taking a leading position in their destiny " says kim ki jung political scientist at yonsei university in seoul "theyve always been passive and complied with the bigger countries " u s diplomats involved in the six nation discussions over north koreas nuclear program the talks also included china japan and russia have said that the two koreas eventually will have to break away from the other countries and decide their future together in a statement yesterday the u s state department said "we have long welcomed and supported north south dialogue and hope this meeting will help promote peace and security on the korean peninsula and fulfill the goals of the six party talks " lina yoon contributed to this article
