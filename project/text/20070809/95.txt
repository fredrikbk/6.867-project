sarbox was the right medicine as sarbanes oxley turns five this summer the controversial act is once again being put under a high powered microscope has it been the transformative law that supporters prominently including treasury secretary henry paulson claim has restored investor confidence and helped corporate america move out from the ugly shadow of enron worldcom and other epic sized scandals or as detractors argue is it a roadblock to the competitiveness of the u s capital markets by virtue of its outsized cost of compliance the last five years have made it irrefutably clear sarbanes oxley sarbox is a textbook case of how regulation should ideally work in a democracy a scandal is addressed through strong legislative reaction followed by fine tuning by relevant agencies in this case the sec and the public company accounting oversight board is it any wonder that variations of sarbox and its rigorous internal controls are being adopted in japan france china canada and other countries around the world a powerful argument for sarbox can be made simply by examining the performance of financial markets since the landmark act was passed though sarbox certainly cant take full credit the u s stock market as measured by the s&amp p has increased or about &# trillion in market value between july and june even john thain ceo of the new york stock exchange nyse and no great fan of sarbox concedes "there is no question that broadly speaking sarbanes oxley was necessary " no appraisal is complete however without a hard nosed look at section the infamous two paragraphs tucked into the page act which require management to establish internal control structures and procedures for financial reporting as well as to report on and attest to the effectiveness of these controls in their annual reports considerable attention has been given to the fact that u s companies spent an estimated &# billion in complying with the provisions of sarbox according to amr research thats not an insignificant expense but critics should weigh this against another incontrovertible fact the cost of compliance pales in comparison to the &# billion stockholders lost on enron alone equally revealing is a report from moodys showing that section is having a positive impact as evidenced by the dramatically fewer companies experiencing weaknesses today in their internal controls and procedures companies after three years of sarbox versus after the first year as for the cost of section a survey by cra international found that audit fees declined more than in the second year of sarbox while another survey by financial executives international fei found that section compliance cost less in year three than in each of the first two years another key measure of sarboxs effectiveness past and future is that its not set in stone both the sec and the public company accounting oversight board recently adopted changes to designed to make implementation more attentive to those risks which are material while achieving a more appropriate balance of benefits and costs finally theres the oft heard charge that sarbox is an insidious threat to the u s financial markets how else to explain the fact the u s has been steadily losing ipos to other countries the facts tell a different story truth is the u s continues to be the worlds leading financial market commanding of global mutual fund assets and of global hedge funds notwithstanding this robust position a recent goldman sachs report points out that as global markets have matured the u s has actually been losing market share this process began however well before sarbox and over the last decade the capitalization of nyse and the london stock exchange has actually grown at comparable rates whats more recent statistics show a record number of foreign companies executing ipos on the nyse and nasdaq companies during the first six months of compared to companies in the first half of before sarbox was even enacted as sarbanes oxley prepares to mark its fifth anniversary theres only one valid conclusion to draw this milestone in responsible corporate governance and accountability has more than fulfilled its mission to the public mr healey is a retired partner of goldman sachs &amp co and currently a senior fellow at harvard universitys kennedy school of government he was assistant treasury secretary under president reagan
