politics &amp economics u s arab alliance aims to deter terrorism iran plan seeks to secure supplies of energy arms role criticized washington with iraqs future an open question and irans regional clout likely to keep growing the bush administration is forging a long term strategy to secure energy supplies that relies on drawing arab governments into an alliance to coordinate defenses of oil related infrastructure combat terrorism and thwart tehrans nuclear and regional ambitions the pentagon hopes the tens of billions of dollars of new weaponry for middle east allies announced last week will underpin various regional defense initiatives but the administrations ultimate goal is to push a much more ambitious security agenda in concert with the six countries that make up the gulf cooperation council as well as jordan and egypt next month the u s and the "gcc plus two " as the group is called will hold their sixth meeting of the year pentagon and state department officials have been crisscrossing the middle east recently to promote what they call a gulf security dialogue one u s official involved in the diplomacy said it seeks to build a consensus on iraq and fighting al qaeda as well as "deterring an increasingly hegemonic iran " in addition to saudi arabia the gcc is made up of kuwait oman the united arab emirates bahrain and qatar yemen is in negotiations to join the organization the strategy is one of washingtons principal initiatives in the middle east alongside its efforts to broker a regional conference this fall to tackle the palestinian israeli conflict critics however argue the move has led washington to sacrifice its calls for political change and liberalization in countries such as saudi arabia and egypt in pursuit of its desire to contain iran secretary of state condoleezza rice last week said long term democracy promotion and the defense of the arab states were compatible initiatives many security strategists say washington has misidentified the challenges while the u s is backing large scale armies they say tehran has expanded its influence in places such as lebanon iraq and the palestinian territories through backing militias such as hezbollah and hamas iran has also improved its strategic position through the effective use of charities social services networks and public diplomacy "the u s is far superior to iran in the sense" of military strength already while "iran trumps washington in the use of soft power " says emile el hokayem a middle east analyst at washingtons henry l stimson center "you can pump more high tech weaponry into these arab regimes but its not going to change the fundamental dynamic much " analysts also warn the strategy risks perpetuating decades long u s policy of propping up authoritarian regimes in the middle east have squelched any political opposition that has provided propaganda for islamist and other extremists groups such as the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda to attract recruits and fuel anti americanism in general critics of the new policy argue in contrast that the u s should be promoting steps toward democratization and a region wide dialogue with iran while also maintaining deterrent forces in the middle east it also isnt clear the gcc plus two predominantly sunni muslim states is willing to act as a broader counterweight against shiite muslim iran say middle east analysts and diplomats many arab leaders are reluctant to overtly challenge the iranian regime fearing it could fuel an arms race and states within the gcc such as saudi arabia and qatar have historically been at odds on some key strategic issues saudi arabia which has a sizable shiite minority in its oil rich east oversaw the establishment of the gcc in in response to the islamic revolution that swept iran two years earlier in its early years the gcc focused on shoring up the internal security of its member states against the possible spread of islamic fundamentalism and shiite activism washington began engaging the gcc in the early s seeking support for its policy of containing iran and saddam husseins sunni led government in iraq during the first persian gulf war the administration of president george h w bush worked with gcc countries to reverse the iraqi armys invasion of kuwait some u s initiatives such as energy security could become top gcc priorities in response to threats posed by al qaeda and irans strategic position along the persian gulf the u s has been quietly pushing allied gulf states to beef up oil related defenses saudi arabia and kuwait in particular have spent heavily to fortify oil related infrastructure against terrorism after a thwarted attack by gunmen against a major saudi facility in u s officials started offering advice to exporters to help make their defenses more robust the state department has started a project enlisting big oil producers to boost oil infrastructure security in the gulf and other oil producing countries officials decline to name the cooperating countries in the gulf where oil is often enmeshed in nationalist sentiments officials on both sides are reluctant to discuss any energy security cooperation the united arab emirates is looking at projects that would provide alternative routes for shipping gulf oil including building new pipelines and storage facilities those projects however are still on the drawing board in addition the treasury views the gulf states as central to its attempts to cut off funds for iran and its regional activities u s officials in particular see the emirate of dubai as a key financial center supporting irans theocratic regime treasury officials have regularly visited dubai in recent months to enlist the support of its bankers against tehran u s diplomats say washingtons cooperation with the gcc isnt the start of a formal alliance but rather an augmentation of military relationships the pentagon has already established with many gulf states still at a conference in sharm el sheikh egypt last week ms rice and defense secretary robert gates worked with arab diplomats to endorse a policy statement that talked of a mutual defense initiative among gulf states iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads government criticized the statement and the arms deals claiming they were aimed at inciting broader tensions between sunni and shiites states
