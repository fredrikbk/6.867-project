the bernanke call wall street cynics sometimes refer to ben bernanke as "helicopter ben " as in the kind of federal reserve chairman whod shower dollars from helicopters to keep the economy growing he earned that moniker back when he was a mere fed governor during the phony "deflation" scare circa there may be fewer such snarky references going forward however now that mr bernanke did the right thing on tuesday and refused to pander to the many pleas to rescue credit markets by printing more money tuesdays fed statement turned out to be just about right restating that inflation is the feds main current concern while also reassuring everyone that it believes the economy is fundamentally sound despite the recent credit turmoil equity markets seemed to like it too rallying around the world tuesday and strongly yesterday in the u s after the fed statement the greenback also firmed on tuesday and has stayed stable against gold apparently "armageddon" has not yet arrived notwithstanding the meltdowns of certain famous analysts maybe the world will end next week instead the feds other main job is regulatory i e to guard against systemic financial risk and wed feel better on that score if we saw a more energetic treasury and new york fed trying to understand the risks that remain in the credit and derivative markets where the weak spots are and getting out ahead of any problems last fridays market rout might have been avoided had someone advised bear stearns not to publicly blame its woes on everyone else president bush wasnt wrong to say yesterday that the credit markets are adjusting after a period of abnormally low risk spreads but his financial lieutenants still cant afford to be complacent
