underplaying a bill that undercuts underpaying in your aug editorial "a backpay bonanza " you assert that under the bill the house passed on july to undo the supreme courts ruling in ledbetter v goodyear tire &amp rubber employers would "face potentially unlimited liability" for "alleged discrimination " including "decades" worth of backpay to the contrary the house bill clearly states that an employee who proves that her employer has discriminatorily underpaid her can recover backpay going back no more than two years before she filed her case even if she can prove that her employer started discriminatorily underpaying her years ago she still cant get compensation for anything that happened more than two years before she started litigation the house bill does not allow liability to "balloon " as you suggest equally misleading is your contention that there is no reason employees should be allowed to file a case based on underpayments that began decades earlier because "most of us know what we take home on payday " sure we do but most of us dont know what you take home how could an employee know she is being discriminatorily underpaid if she doesnt know what her colleagues are getting this is why the houses bill is a necessary corrective to the supreme courts ruling in ledbetter the bill would allow an employee to file a case against her employer within days or depending on the state of the day she finds out that her employer is discriminatorily underpaying her the house bill would merely restore employees statutory protection against pay discrimination piper hoffman new york
