the schip revelation congress has left town for august thank heavens but not before passing bills that set up some important debates for the autumn one of the biggest ought to be over the plans to expand the state childrens health insurance program schip which is a dress rehearsal for the health care fight in schip was supposed to help children from low income families but democrats are now using the program to expand government control of health care and undermine private insurance to see this plan in action look no further than the page schip revelation that democrats muscled through the house last week schip was created as a program that needs to be reauthorized every decade the house plan makes it a permanent entitlement schip was supposed to help the uninsured the house plan is consciously designed to "crowd out" private coverage and replace it with federal welfare the bill goes so far as to offer increasing "bonus payments" to states as they enroll more people in their schip programs to grease the way the bill re labels "children" as anyone under and "low income" as up to above the poverty level or &# for a family of four as if this all werent blunt enough the houses schip bill also includes a new tax on private insurance policies assessed at &# million in its first year and increasing thereafter this so called "fair share" tax will fund a new government agency to study the "comparative effectiveness" of certain medical treatments and kinds of insurance unremarked is that health insurance is already more expensive than it needs to be because of mandates like this one to finance its schip largesse the house would eviscerate medicare advantage an innovative program that allows seniors to choose among various private health plans its growing rapidly and currently serves some million seniors or about of the eligible population according to the centers of medicare and medicaid services most are the urban poor seniors in rural areas and minorities no doubt they are attracted by the additional benefits increased access to specialized medicine and coordinated preventative services that advantage offers over the traditional version the house bill will eliminate &# billion in medicare advantage funding over the next five years and &# billion through according to the congressional budget office the funding cutbacks will likely result in three million people losing their advantage coverage and the rest facing reduced benefits and higher out of pocket costs politically its ironic that democrats are funding "free" health care for the middle class by dinging poor seniors who will have no other options besides normal medicare and all of its gaps the seniors probably have another word for it democrats claim that medicare advantage is "overfunded " but the program is available because of a deliberate subsidy which is being phased out over time it was designed in part so the program could penetrate rural regions and part of the subsidy is returned in the form of increased benefits and supplemental coverage that seniors would otherwise have to pay for as "medigap" insurance in any case the subsidy seems to be a good investment as ken thorpe of emory university has documented the average overall savings from medicare advantage plans exceed reasonable estimates of the higher government payment traditional medicare is only comparatively cheaper because it is scheduled to cut payments to doctors by next year which the house legislation delays the democratic goal isnt cost saving in any case their hostility to medicare advantage is because it allows for competition in the private sector and is an experiment that could serve as a model for reforming medicare in the future democrats are trying to repeat what the clinton administration did to medicare+choice in the late s starving that private experiment of funds until seniors fled the good news here is that the house legislation is so egregious that it barely passed and president bush has promised to veto a major expansion of the schip program the senate has also passed an expansion albeit somewhat more modest and without looting medicare advantage democrats think they have a political winner in the guise of helping "children " but the house bill shows that their higher priority is expanding government see related letters "letters to the editor schip shoulders childrens health care in u s " wsj august see related letter "letters to the editor schip shape health care" wsj august
