genzymes hit turns headache drug for rare disease has been in demand but fda blocks factory its usually good news when a biotechnology company reports strong demand for one of its new and expensive drugs but in the case of genzyme corp the rising use of its treatment for pompe disease a rare and sometimes fatal enzyme disorder is creating unexpected problems that is making some investors skittish the cambridge mass company says it cant meet demand for the drug called myozyme because the food and drug administration has refused to approve a boston factory where the company is hoping to produce the bulk of the medicine that means genzyme isnt allowed to sell the drug from the factory to u s patients fda approval initially expected later this year likely wont come until the first half of next year at the earliest the company says genzyme says some new patients will have to delay the start of their treatment while existing patients may be forced to skip some infusions the company has sent letters urging u s patients to enroll in a program that allows it to give them doses of myozyme from the unapproved facility on an experimental basis those patients will get the drug free a potential hit to revenue considering a yearly treatment regimen of myozyme for an adult can exceed &# as of monday before genzyme shares began to dip in part on concerns about its manufacturing problem the stock was up nearly for the year while the dow jones biotechnology stock index was down genzyme shares yesterday fell &# or to &# on the nasdaq stock market bullish analysts abound for the stock largely because of the oomph that myozyme would bring to a mature product line facing increased competition "myozyme is huge the single most important way this company will grow " says bear stearns analyst mark schoenebaum who rates the stock a "buy " he believes the company can overcome the production issue speaking on the sidelines of the world economic forum meeting in davos switzerland last year genzyme chairman henri termeer said the drug has the potential of reaching sales of between &# million and &# million "my expectation is that this is a very important product " he said first half earnings rose from a year earlier to &# a share revenue rose to &# billion but others see the production stumble as indicating larger problems and offering a reason to avoid the stock "we remain concerned about long term growth " says navdeep jaikaria an analyst with rodman &amp renshaw in new york the myozyme problem "certainly endorses our lack of enthusiasm for the stock " approved last year myozyme works by replacing an enzyme that is deficient in pompe patients reducing their ability to break down a stored form of sugar called glycogen the accumulation of glycogen leads to fatal heart and respiratory ailments in infants and severe muscle problems in adults fewer than people in the world are estimated to be afflicted about patients are taking the drug genzyme says genzyme has offered few details on why the fda balked at approval the problem according to a person familiar with the matter is that the company cant produce a version of myozyme at its large boston plant that is the same as that produced by the much lower output bioreactors in nearby framingham mass that were used in clinical trials and have been supplying the u s the fda requires companies to prove that any new manufacturing plants produce the same drug as the original one used to gain approval with protein drugs like myozyme this can be tricky because slight differences in the manufacturing process can change the structure of the carbohydrates attached to the proteins producing potentially different outcomes in patients the difference in the myozyme being produced at the two genzyme facilities concerns the amount of a carbohydrate attachment that is believed to be key to the drug being absorbed by skeletal muscle cells according to the person familiar with the matter genzyme last month pulled its fda application to manufacture in boston while it works on the problem it plans to resubmit the application later this year but that move hinges on how fast the company can fix the problem a factor that could affect sales well into next year when analysts expect sales of the drug to approach &# million genzyme spokesman dan quinn says the fda process is confidential and declined to discuss specifics of the production problem genzyme says it is sticking by its outlook this year for sales of myozyme reaching &# million to &# million in the first half sales totaled &# million the company says the myozyme produced by the larger facility is being sold in other countries and is safe and effective but the differences in production worry some experts alfred slonim a new york physician who treats several pompe patients says he is concerned the drug produced in the larger bioreactors isnt as good as the original "it really leaves me uncomfortable " dr slonim said another worry is a trial required by the fda to prove the drugs effectiveness in treating adults when it was approved the fda indicated myozyme was effective in treating infants nonetheless doctors have started many adults on the therapy and insurers have agreed to pay for many of those treatments earlier this year genzyme said it was extending the trial to months for some that signaled the drug wasnt having an effect at the one year mark and was being extended to try and detect one genzymes mr quinn says the extension was standard and didnt indicate how the trial was
