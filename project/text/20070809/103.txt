style fashion journal the psychology of the &# handbag how luxury brands alter shoppers price perceptions buying a keychain instead what is too much to spend on a suit the question weighed on barry schwarz as he scanned the racks at boyds mens store in philadelphia which were laden with &# brioni suits "their prices were just out of the world " recalls mr schwarz a professor of psychology at swarthmore college weve all been there a window display or a recommendation lures us into a store and we face unexpectedly astronomical price tags it seems to happen more often these days as many luxury brands selling everything from &# ralph lauren handbags to &# bugaboo baby strollers and &# beefeater barbecue grills push their top price points higher than theyve ever gone before whats priced below falls into that ever expanding category "affordable luxury " some people cut and run when confronted with prices that seem crazy but many of us experience a sudden emotional mathematical transformation we set a new ceiling for a "reasonable" price disinclined to go all the way to buy the trophy we instead settle for a consolation prize mr schwarz a jeans wearing type walked out of boyds with a suit that cost merely &# the most hed ever spent on an item of clothing "if youre in that world long enough &# stops even feeling like a lot of money " mr schwarz says this concept is one of the reasons for the proliferation of &# designer sunglasses these days the fact that ralph lauren is charging &# or so for an alligator "ricky" handbag makes it easier for a consumer to justify in her mind paying &# for a rather simple sweater many chanel sunglass owners are actually would be owners of chanel suits something similar has happened to many owners of tiffany keychains prada legwarmers coach wallets and frette tea towels when shoppers are confronted with prices they cant afford a smart retailer will "move you right along to where you can salvage your pride " says dan hill president of sensory logic a minneapolis consulting company that helps companies explore their sensory and emotional connections with customers pride mr hill points out "is a mixture of anger and happiness " that pretty much describes the whole shopping experience at those moments when were outpriced anger then soothe ourselves with a smaller splurge happiness in mr hills case this played itself out in the purchase of a sweater when what he actually wanted was a certain pair of jesus jeans a friend of mine remains sheepish about a smashing pair of high waisted black prada pants that seemed sensibly priced at &# only after she had spent an hour eyeballing more expensive versions with the encouragement of a salesman at barneys and yes its time to concede to my husband that i spent &# on that t shirt at lost &amp found in los angeles because i couldnt bring myself to spend &# on a certain dress given that accessories like sunglasses fragrances and logoed belts drive the sales of companies like gucci and louis vuitton such consolation prizes account for a very sizable chunk of the luxury business these days indeed this ploy is the soul of las vegas a town built on people who roll in on southwest airlines expecting to play &# blackjack until they see the high rollers at the &# tables next thing you know they wake up in the baccarat lounge with their own private casino host and a stack of ious after a while it just doesnt seem like real money as for prof schwarz with his &# suit "i got sucked in and i knew what was happening " he says mr schwarz has since written and spoken about this phenomenon to roughly industry groups with audiences of as many as over the past three years he has found eager apostles in microsoft google the national restaurant association general electric the marines time warner the dutch government several health insurers and lehman brothers mr schwarz calls the top priced goods "anchors " anchors he says set the ceilings on prices of objects that dont have a clear value that is just about everything in luxury goods and fashion in fact thats one reason why some in the luxury fashion industry are irritated with retailers like target and zara theyre seen as setting the ceilings too low retail consulting guru paco underhill says "this has been a strategy that goes back to the th century you sold one thing to the king but everyone in court had to have a lesser one " today we have hermes fendi louis vuitton and gucci "theres the &# bag in the window and what you walk away with is the t shirt " says mr underhill "its the same strategy as putting the sports car in the window to sell the sedan in the back " still luxury brands today have fine tuned the strategy the folks at coach are masters of this look for a notably expensive bag in one of the companys flagship stores only one or two of them are available for sale a company spokeswoman pointed out to me but scores of similar smaller less elaborate bags are nearby primed to walk out the door and if you cant even go that far try the wallet or the keychain as convenient as it might be to accuse these manufacturers of gouging when they set prices so high on their top goods theres nothing nefarious going on here clothing is one of the most democratic marketplaces around theres always another store another pair of pants to turn to email christina binkley wsj com
