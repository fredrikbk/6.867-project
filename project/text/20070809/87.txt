politics &amp economics forum reflects gays clout democratic courtship stops at same sex marriage all the major democratic presidential candidates and none of the republicans will be in los angeles tonight for what was billed as a nonpartisan forum on issues important to gay lesbian bisexual and transgender americans the televised event showcases the status that gays votes and money have earned them in the democratic party but also the continued controversy of their cause writer and gay rights advocate david mixner recognizes this as much as anyone two decades ago the presidential campaign of democratic nominee michael dukakis fearful of controversy declined an offer by mr mixner and three wealthy friends to raise &# million from the gay community in he raised &# million for bill clintons campaign now he is backing former north carolina sen john edwards and doesnt know how much he has raised but says "ive done real well " the entire democratic fields support of gay rights is so similarly strong that mr mixner picked mr edwards based on an unrelated matter his opposition to the iraq war all the major democrats favor civil unions for gay couples and repeal of the militarys "dont ask dont tell" policy against openly gay service members that front runner sen hillary rodham clintons husband initiated their republican counterparts dont former new york mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov mitt romney have pivoted away from their previous stands favoring gay rights as they seek the nomination of a party in which social conservatives hold sway still the democrats courtship of gay voters goes only so far none of the democrats except for two dark horse candidates supports what is for many in the gay community the top goal marriage rights in large measure this reflects democrats fear of an issue republicans used effectively in to put them on the defensive and mobilize republicans conservative ranks behind president bushs re election tonights event is co sponsored by the human rights campaign foundation a gay rights activist group and viacom inc s logo network which will broadcast it on cable tv and its web site at p m edt it is titled "the visible vote a presidential forum" reflecting the gay communitys sense of its increased prominence in the democratic party a similar forum was held for democratic candidates four years ago but didnt have a media sponsor because democrats have aired their general positions on gay issues in previous wide ranging debates "were going to be able to use the opportunity to ask more in depth questions about how they actually came to their positions and how they might implement them as president " says joe solmonese president of the human rights campaign he will be one of three questioners including lesbian recording star melissa etheridge who will quiz the candidates one at a time for about minutes each measures of gay americans votes and political contributions are hard to come by given the difficulty of identifying who is gay but democrats have come to believe such support is significant especially given this communitys increasing activism since the s and its overwhelming pro democratic tilt as the republican party grew more socially conservative "republicans have walked off the field and so that magnifies gays power in the democratic party " says steve elmendorf a gay democratic strategist an editorial on the human rights campaigns web site recently admonished gay people not to rely simply on "checkbook activism" but to speak out and take action as well "we must remember that civil rights cant be bought " it says surveys suggest that gay people have higher incomes than the population as a whole and are more likely to make political contributions a recent poll by community marketing inc a san francisco firm specializing in gay and lesbian market research found that of gay men and of lesbian respondents said they had given money to a political party in the previous year in a recent wall street journal nbc news poll of adults surveyed said they had donated to a campaign attempting to quantify "gay dollars " last week the washington blade a gay newspaper in the nations capital reported its analysis of the presidential candidates campaign contributions from the "gayest" neighborhoods in the nation using zip codes in the candidates financial reports to the federal election commission the zip codes including for washington d c s dupont circle provincetown mass and west hollywood were picked based on census data of same sex households rankings in gay market surveys and a survey of editors in major cities the blades analysis found that nearly half of the contributions from those enclaves went to new yorks sen clinton second with was illinois sen barack obama who has been her chief rival in fund raising and poll standings overall mr edwards was next with their total contributions from gay areas while not insignificant werent a major share of the candidates overall fund raising according to the blade mrs clintons &# million for january through june is about of her total it said while mr obamas &# million and mr edwardss &# is about of their respective totals mr edwardss total fell short of the &# that mr giuliani received from "the gayest zip codes " the blade said the north carolinian faced a question in an earlier candidates forum about his statement that his southern baptist upbringing leaves him conflicted about gay marriage his wife elizabeth this year publicly came out in support of gay marriage at a san francisco gay pride event and has been something of an ambassador to the gay community for her husband mr mixner says the blade analysis shows that contributions to mr edwards from mostly gay neighborhoods were up in the second quarter earlier this week days before the los angeles gay rights forum he alone among the democrats issued a statement decrying mr bushs threatened veto of pending legislation for a federal hate crimes law that gay activists support as for republicans patrick sammon president of the gay political group log cabin republicans says he remains optimistic that his party wont always be opposed to gay rights "our party to be a majority has to get independent voters and using antigay politics is a sure way to turn those voters against it "
