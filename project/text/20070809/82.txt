olympics who cares rutgers slashes its teams while the rutgers university board of governors voted on july to raise annual tuition by and mandatory fees by the additional funds will not be enough to restore the hundreds of classes and jobs that were lost due to less money coming from the state of new jersey or to save any of the six varsity teams cut by the public university the increased cost to students a total of &# million will instead go to help cover the &# million shortfall in state funding some faculty searches will resume but no further plans for restoration have been determined according to rutgers spokesman greg trevor decisions made at that meeting ended a yearlong struggle to save teams competing in olympic sports it was a rare defeat in rutgers magical sports season the football team upset no louisville en route to its record and the womens basketball team made it to the championship game of the ncaa tournament an event marred by shock jock don imuss on air ridicule of the womens appearance leading to his dismissal the glow of athletic successes made cutting six teams all the darker mens swimming and diving and tennis mens and womens fencing and mens lightweight and heavyweight crew have all ended their tenures at rutgers as varsity sports they will continue as club sports a change not unlike going from baseballs majors to little league athletes were stunned "i found out last summer when i was at work and i got hysterical " says fencing captain cindy jorgensen "i couldnt drive home i had to call my parents to come get me " rutgers athletes have a rich olympic tradition especially rowing appearances and the teams that were cut are fed by active state high school involvement new jerseys fencing is "the pre eminent high school program in the country absolutely without peer " according to u s fencing head michael massik that regional base constitutes a strong support system of parents and alumni who look to rutgers as a place for new jersey kids to attend college and compete in their sport and they quickly kicked into action with the creation of the coalition to save our sports "its a travesty " says coalition member lisa pantel whose son adam just completed his freshman year on the fencing team "weve met with the board of governors with the president and athletic director and countered every argument they presented for cutting the teams they werent listening " the coalition created an email network and reports &# in pledges to save the teams but the university refused to change its plans legislative efforts led by state sen bob smith and assemblymen patrick diegnan and peter barnes failed at least partly according to sen smith because of strong messages from rutgers that the money would be refused "if the legislature passes money for one year what are you going to do next year or the year after that " says rutgers athletic director bob mulcahy "as far as all those pledges nobody ever said here is a list of money that they had in hand " womens basketball and especially mens football form the other side of the rutgers sports picture their recent success imbued a sense of identity denied a state caught in the shadows of new york and philadelphia and electrified the campus "after we beat louisville the streets were filled with students slapping hands with one another strangers with this great togetherness " recalls jessica durando editor of the student newspaper the daily targum "there was even a targum selling on ebay i think it sold for &# " rutgers showed its appreciation by increasing the pay of womens basketball coach c vivian stringer in a package that could yield her &# a year and boosted the compensation of mens football coach greg schiano to a reported &# million a year both raises of about such increases in light of cutting six teams with a combined operating budget of &# angered coalition members "the cutting of these teams has nothing to do with the extra money put into football " counters mr mulcahy who says that the university was simply operating more sports than it could with success cutting the teams brings rutgers down to more than most schools in its big east conference which saw another member syracuse cut mens and womens swimming and diving teams in june "football is a separate issue i look at it differently from the rest of the sports it raises far more money and ultimately the success of football can carry the rest of our programs " ultimately is the key word football does not now pay its own way but mr mulcahy is betting that it will he says he was charged when he was appointed in to "fix football" after years of losing his model he says were the "big good" programs of the big and calls his legacy tied to mr schianos success "you look at schools where football has been successful for or years and it can carry an athletics program " says mr mulcahy adding that the last two years of football success head rutgers in that direction perhaps but those most familiar with "big good" programs know this to be dangerous territory "when you read accounts about the revenue that football generates theyre really full of holes ignoring capital expenditures and debt financing " says james duderstadt president of the university of michigan from to "i think people close to michigan with all of its visibility regard football at this level as more of a headache than a benefit to the institution " the headache says mr duderstadt is getting worse "weve seen more institutions going heavily into debt to pay coaches over a million dollars and more programs eliminated in order to feed the beast " while this is a story about budgets it is essentially about different visions of intercollegiate athletics rutgers emphasizes success in revenue producing football and basketball another view supports a broader range of students athletic interests "once colleges had athletics as part of the equilibrium of teaching people beyond the classroom creating well rounded individuals physically and intellectually " says glenn merry head of rowings national governing body "at some point it became more of a business sports had to earn their way it puts any sports at risk that arent a huge media attraction " if this is really about todays changing values americans olympic future is in trouble along with whatever remains of balance in college
