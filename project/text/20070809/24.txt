capital accountability state colleges prepare to measure their own performance the american medical and higher education systems regularly boast with some justification that they are the best in the world but in recent years they have been forced to confront tough questions how do we know were getting our moneys worth how do you know youre doing such a good job is there some way to measure your performance that the rest of us can understand in health care publicly available measures of quality are increasingly common some were forced on doctors and hospitals by insurers some were promoted by those who want americans to shop for health care the way they shop for cars some were pushed by insiders looking for levers to improve quality then the spotlight moved to colleges president bushs education secretary margaret spellings and texas investor charles miller whom she picked to lead a commission on colleges beat the higher education establishment with a bat having imposed testing on k schools through the no child left behind act ms spellings and mr miller a few years ago began pushing colleges to measure and report performance "if the academy doesnt do it " mr miller says "its going to be done for them " colleges have so far successfully fought laws or regulations that prescribe testing but they know they need an offense now the state schools the national association of state universities and land grant colleges big research universities and the american association of state colleges and universities the rest of them are about to take a significant step full disclosure the national associations president is peter mcpherson who is also chairman of the board of dow jones &amp co publisher of this newspaper the state schools are designing a template for college web sites that for those that opt to use it shows in standard format details about admission rates costs and graduation rates to make comparisons simple results from surveys of students designed to measure satisfaction and engagement and results of tests given to a representative sample of students to gauge not how smart they were when they arrived but how much they learned about writing analysis and problem solving between freshman and senior years the last one is the biggie participating schools will use one of three tests to gauge the performance of students with similar entering sat scores at tasks that any college grad ought to be able to handle one test the collegiate learning assessment gives students some circumstance and a variety of information about it and asks for short essays no multiple choice on solving a problem or analyzing a scenario under the state schools proposed grading scale of the schools will report that students did "as expected " given their sats an additional will report they did better or much better than expected and will report students did worse or much worse than expected even mr miller is impressed "theyre focused on the right thing doing it the right way " he says it was a forced conversion for many "i dont think this would have occurred without external pressure for greater transparency and accountability " says william kirwan chancellor of marylands university system there are issues faculties remain suspicious that this is a step toward slavishly teaching to the test or constraining what they can teach available tests are young and not completely proven persuading students particularly seniors to take the tests and take them seriously is challenging many private colleges less accustomed to scrutiny from legislators argue that no test can meaningfully measure whats going on in institutions that range from small church colleges to ivy league powerhouses but former classics professor w robert connor now head of the teagle foundation which is helping finance the state schools effort says "a year ago or even six months ago the idea of greater accountability had little traction in higher education the status quo was just fine now a consensus seems to be emerging that colleges and universities need to provide more information about the outcomes " dan fogel president of the university of vermont and an early advocate for greater accountability argues that all this is a necessary response to widespread public concern "that higher ed costs a lot and nobody is sure its really worth it " but he argues that isnt the sole reason "we have a profound ethical obligation to ensure that our students learn most things that we are trying to teach them " thats a hard one for skeptical faculty to rebut lawrence summers harvard universitys former president is also a fan not only are these measures "a counterweight to what is otherwise the overwhelming tendency for universities to be accountable only to their faculties " but they are crucial to self improvement "unless you have some way of noticing when you are doing a better job of educating youre not likely to do a better job of educating " he says assessing individual performance of course isnt new to universities thats what exams are supposed to do but measuring a colleges performance and publishing the results is a change one that might prod the best higher ed system in the world to get better "few universities sit still with consistently bad football teams " mr summers says "why should they sit still with consistently bad results in educating and satisfying students " corrections &amp amplifications the teagle foundation didnt directly fund state colleges and universities accountability initiative the lumina foundation did yesterdays capital column incorrectly said otherwise teagle helped to fund the collegiate learning assessment one test the state colleges plan to use wsj aug
