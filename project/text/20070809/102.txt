states boost scrutiny of drugstore clinics prodded by doctor group some limit patient visits require physician ownership getting a strep throat diagnosis in the same place you purchase greeting cards and shampoo is undeniably convenient but is it safe that question is gaining urgency as the number of health clinics in retail stores multiplies at more than retail clinics nationwide nurse practitioners now treat patients with common ailments such as rashes red eye and allergies cvs caremark corp s minuteclinic is the industry leader with facilities in states those numbers are expected to rise dramatically even by the end of the year with large efforts planned by cvs wal mart stores inc walgreen co and target corp physician groups including the american medical association contend that the in store clinics increase the risks of infection for both patients and shoppers they also question the quality of their care noting that most are staffed by nurse practitioners instead of doctors retail clinics argue that the safety concerns raised by groups like the ama are overblown and motivated by financial concerns after all they point out primary care physicians stand to lose business if patients with minor ailments head to cvs instead of their regular doctors now state health regulators who have typically granted the clinics extensive waivers from hygiene and safety restrictions are taking a closer look at the business rhode island has balked at allowing retail clinics despite repeated efforts by minuteclinic california passed a law this year that retail clinics must be owned by physicians florida now requires health clinics to post a sign indicating whether a physician is present and medical personnel must disclose their credentials to patients texas and wyoming have gone the other way loosening some restrictions on medical treatment by nurse practitioners yesterday massachusetts proposed new rules governing retail clinics including a limit on how often a patient could go to one reviewing cvss plan to open the first retail clinic in the state state regulators expressed skepticism that high standards of care could be maintained in retail settings more accustomed to vitamins than vaccinations "this is a whole new ballgame " said philip c nasca a member of the state public health council and associate dean for research at the university of massachusetts amhersts school of public health he and others argued that "this kind of commercialized setting" might not result in optimal patient care drugstore chains like cvs are eager to establish retail clinics because patients are likely to fill their prescriptions at pharmacies already on site the clinics typically offer basic medical care with no appointments and prices far lower than most primary care doctors at a checkups clinic in the back of some wal mart stores patients can get treatment for a urinary tract infection for &# or an insurance co pay instead of a waiting room minuteclinics provide chairs for customers outside the exam rooms they also dont have their own bathrooms so patients who need to provide urine samples must use the regular cvs bathroom older minuteclinics didnt include a hand washing station for nurse practitioners they used a hand sanitizer instead but sinks were added at the behest of regulators "patients have never had a problem with the design of our clinics " says michael c howe founder and chief executive of minuteclinic another issue is space the current regulations in massachusetts require that rooms where patients are treated include at least square feet of floor space and an exam table minuteclinics have no exam table patients are treated in chairs and at most square feet of floor space in documents submitted to state health regulators minuteclinic argued that the space is sufficient for its "limited scope of services " regulations proposed yesterday by the state and being considered by the public health council would allow the clinics to operate with as little as square feet of floor space no waiting room and no separate bathroom "youre crowding people who may be sick not to mention potentially exposing someone whos just trying to buy doritos " says bruce auerbach president elect of the massachusetts medical society and chief of emergency medicine at sturdy memorial hospital in attleboro mass dr auerbach has raised a litany of other concerns about patient safety he contends that nurse practitioners while capable of providing the care that retail clinics offer need supervision from on site physicians who might catch early signs of a more serious disease "every patient who presents with a sore throat does not have streptococcus pharyngitis " also known as strep throat dr auerbach testified before state officials last month "every patient presenting with red eye does not have simple conjunctivitis " minuteclinic provided an abstract for a study slated to be published this year in the american journal of medical quality that found it was giving appropriate care for sore throats the most common malady among the clinics customers of patients who arrived at a minuteclinic with a sore throat were given the proper treatment the study found patients though are more apt to use a retail clinic for the convenience rather than the care a survey this year by forrester research inc found that retail clinic users were very satisfied but just thought the care was better than a typical trip to the doctors office see related letters "letters to the editor drugstore clinics and the
