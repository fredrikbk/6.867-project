is high speed internet growth slowing as dial up upgrades level off operators offer new services the rapid expansion of the multibillion dollar high speed internet business may be slowing threatening one of the major growth engines for cable and phone companies the four largest phone and cable operators at&amp t inc verizon communications inc comcast corp and time warner cable inc added a total of million broadband subscribers in the second quarter fewer than they added during the year earlier quarter and short of wall street analysts projections while second quarter results are typically weak mainly because college students are disconnecting the results suggest that the market is maturing until now cable and telephone companies have primarily been focusing on persuading dial up internet subscribers to pay more for faster speeds that market is getting tapped out prompting cable and telephone companies to eye each others customers more hungrily operators are competing against each other aggressively with offers of faster speeds and new services such as video messaging "we still see growth but we are going to have to approach it in a different way " says landel hobbs chief operating officer for time warner cable the broadband deceleration comes after years of being on fire with growth more than of households in the u s or about million homes currently subscribe to a high speed internet service an additional million or so households have dial up connections industry watchers predict broadband growth will continue but statistics indicate the u s will remain well behind other countries that have adopted broadband more quickly the u s is ranked th in broadband penetration behind countries including south korea where penetration is and canada where it is analysts note the broadband growth rate may pick up later this year some companies and analysts believe that the dip in the last quarter was because the overall market is substantially bigger this year than last making seasonal swings more pronounced also some telephone companies have slowed their use of discounts to attract customers for example at&amp t last year offered introductory broadband rates as low as &# a month but canceled the promotion late last year to reduce the number of consumers who canceled service when the discount expired according to a spokesman at&amp t now charges &# a month for the same bundle but introduced a slower tier for &# a month after aggressive discounting phone and cable companies are starting to "throttle back" and be more prudent in the types of customers they are going after suggests bruce leichtman president and principal analyst of leichtman research group in durham n h "the market grew too quickly in and " mr leichtman says and may be entering a new phase some analysts say the lower growth rate could worsen by weakness in the housing market if fewer people move to new houses fewer may be in the market for new internet service a number of broadband dependent industries such as online video sites and internet calling services could feel ripple effects if the number of high speed subscribers begins to level off some have business plans built on the assumption that broadband adoption would continue apace starting in the late s cable operators took an early lead in rolling out broadband services initially capturing a two thirds market share telephone companies had a tough time competing partly because the digital subscriber line or dsl technology they used wasnt as fast as cable modems telephone companies fought back using price with introductory offers below &# a month compared with the &# to &# a month rate many cable companies charge these discounts were effective for a while telephone companies began adding more than of the new customers signing up for broadband dsls share of net additions to the broadband market has been declining for more than a year according to craig moffett an analyst with sanford c bernstein &amp co mr moffett says customers are opting for cables faster speeds because they feel its better for watching the millions of videos that are flooding the web "in a world of youtube and joost dsl just isnt good enough " he says meanwhile cable operators have been holding the line on price in the second quarter for example comcasts average monthly revenue from a broadband subscriber was &# compared with &# the previous year the broadband battle is far from over because phone companies are scrambling to offer higher speeds as well verizon is deploying a fiber optic network called fios that is delivering speeds of up to megabits per second far faster than the to five megabits common for most dsl connections operators also are trying to boost broadband sales by offering unique content and features comcast has compiled thousands of news sports entertainment and other videos in a feature it calls "the fan " which is available only to its subscribers at&amp t
