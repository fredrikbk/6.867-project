katrina survivors face new threat city demolition some salvaged homes end up on condemned list ms deboses due process new orleans idabelle joshua worked hard to take care of her two story house in the lower ninth ward even after hurricane katrina flooded it up to the roof and exiled her miles away she spent &# to have the brick house gutted &# to clean it and then went to city hall on july to make sure forstall st wasnt on a list of derelict properties here facing demolition because of storm damage two city employees assured her that the house was safe she says two days later her nephew called he had gone by to mow the lawn but the house where ms joshua and her late husband had raised three children was gone it had been knocked down by the city since then she has been trying to get an explanation but with no luck "im a year old senior citizen crippled and cant travel and i cant pay anybody " she says "i will be dead and gone by the time i get any recourse from the city its a travesty " nearly two years after katrina city officials are toughening enforcement of an ordinance giving them the power to bulldoze homes and businesses that remain smashed moldy or abandoned last month the city published more than notices filling newspaper pages in the times picayune the tiny print announced that the properties had been classified as a "serious imminent and continuing threat to the public health safety and welfare" and would be demolished after business days city officials trying to step up the struggling citys comeback have said they plan to flatten hurricane ravaged properties this year but the bulging list of doomed buildings includes some that werent damaged much by katrina or that have already been significantly repaired with building permits to prove it often these property owners dont even know theyre on the demolition list because warning letters that are supposed to be mailed to them never arrive city officials also are required to post a sign at every property on the list but some owners say that hasnt happened the result is a bewildered scramble to save historic narrow shotgun houses creole cottages and a hodgepodge of other buildings officially deemed unsalvageable owners race to city hall send pleas to preservationists and erect "do not demolish " signs that they hope will look convincing to bulldozer crews for many the effort comes on top of months spent wrestling with soaring insurance costs searching for a building contractor and the frustrating slog of post katrina life in the still devastated city conspiracy theories are swirling including the claim that tracts of land are being lined up for real estate developers to buy on the cheap city officials deny that and no evidence of sweetheart deals has emerged still new orleans does have a financial incentive to speed things up after this month the city may have to start putting up its own money for demolitions for now the federal emergency management agency directly picks up all the costs razing a house costs &# to &# "was i supposed to get some kind of notice " mary harrison said into her cellphone last week after stepping outside the citys housing department where she was trying to get some answers she had heard from a neighbor that a demolition notice appeared for the house she is renovating with her husband donald a prominent jazz saxophonist it already has a new roof and theyre working on the wiring and plumbing no one at city hall could confirm that mrs harrisons house might be flattened even when she pointed to the address on a page from the citys web site then she called fema which reviews demolitions in certain historic areas that was of no help either "they cant find me on the list to take me off " she said with a sigh it isnt unusual for cities to knock down neglected properties as a last resort and new orleans has long gone after some of its most dilapidated housing but the current get tough approach enacted by the city council in february streamlined the process "we get horror stories all the time " says robert brown president of the preservation resource center which promotes historic architecture the group mails green "demolition alert" postcards to people on the demolition list leading to frantic calls from some people who had no idea there was a problem karen gadbois who wondered why houses in her neighborhood with little damage were listed in the paper has taken up the fight on a blog called "squandered heritage " she drives around in her green honda element eyeballing houses and trying to track down their owners eric oliver person a lawyer says one woman he represents but wouldnt identify claims her house in new orleans east was knocked down by mistake acorn an advocacy group says it knows of at least three such cases "of course youre going to have mistakes but now its clear that weve got to slow things down " says stacy head a member of the city council she plans to complain about the snafus at a council meeting today brenda breaux chief deputy city attorney acknowledges some people have slipped through the cracks but owners need to show theyre repairing not just complain to get off the list "we dont want to demolish anything if the owner is taking action but the onus is on the property owner " she says michael dezura was having lunch in houston last month when a friend called with news that workers were disconnecting the electricity and gas lines to a brick building he owns it is boarded up but has a new roof the stained glass window on the second floor part of a traditional st joseph altar used by the italian family that lived there and ran a grocery store downstairs survived katrina intact "if i didnt know anyone who lived in the area this building would be down " mr dezura says william and shirley colomb spent a sweltering night camping out in their italian renaissance revival house in broadmoor which has no electricity and was inundated with feet of floodwater the only light in the kitchen comes from two candles in a small glass mrs colomb says they had to stay overnight after arriving june to see yellow crime scene style tape giving demolition crews "right of entry" to the house where mr colomb grew up "i could just see a wrecking ball coming to get all this " she says after neighbors intervened the colombs were told by a fema employee at city hall not to worry she says for many though getting off the demolition list is an exercise in futility owners are told to object in writing but the city hasnt spelled out its rules for granting a reprieve or proof a house is safe from bulldozers ms breaux says the city is about to put more information on its web site including a search engine so owners can keep track of their propertys status officials also plan to increase staffing in the city hall department in charge of demolitions after &# in post katrina repairs the granite kitchen countertops at chanel deboses house at washington ave are gleaming again workers just scraped the front porch for a new coat of paint but her house also wound up on the demolition list when the storm hit ms debose and her husband rescued about people in his fishing boat before giving it away and trudging out of the city on foot she is angry that anyone trying to save new orleans could have so much trouble fighting city hall "theres no due process here " she says "its their process "
