birds of a feather visitors to the offices of high ranking officials in robert mugabes beleaguered government in recent weeks have noticed the same book open for study "juche the speeches and writings of kim il sung " according to one zimbabwe insider "some may actually believe this stuff but its more that they want to understand where the president is coming from " mr mugabes canute like attempt to order inflation of to be halved and to subordinate the economy in general to his political will is not just acting blindly he has a model north koreas "great leader " who though he died in is still enshrined in that countrys constitution as "president for eternity " mr mugabes fascination with kim il sungs ideas is nothing new and it involves far more than economics because joshua nkomos rival zapu movement in the s was aligned with south africas african national congress and thus with the orthodox moscow led soviet bloc mr mugabes zanu perforce had to find its foreign funders and arms suppliers elsewhere in beijing and pyongyang this was a rare breakthrough for kim il sung so when zimbabwe became independent in it immediately became north koreas most ambitious diplomatic objective hundreds of north korean military advisers arrived not only training but equipping much of mr mugabes army particularly the notorious fifth brigade what particularly appealed to mr mugabe however was that the north koreans were experts at political indoctrination having honed their skills by "brainwashing" u s and british prisoners in the korean war the essential principle was that if by physical torture isolation and relentless humiliation you could break down someones personality it was then possible to remold him along more "acceptable" lines the full horror of such techniques was revealed only in the mid s when mr mugabe ordered the fifth brigade to repress political opposition in matabeleland using north korean terminology mr mugabe explained that "the people there had their chance and they voted as they did the situation there has to be changed the people must be reoriented " some people died in the resulting campaign of torture and murder it was not just repression pure and simple what the villagers grew to fear most were the dreadful all night sessions in which they would have to sing zanu songs with cheerful enthusiasm while being savagely beaten they would not only have to watch as friends or family members were tortured or shot but would themselves have to assist in the process to achieve their utter humiliation and incrimination re emerging at the end as mugabe loyalists kim first announced his philosophy of juche self reliance in whereafter north korea cut itself off from almost all foreign trade and defaulted on all its foreign debts steps which zimbabwe has now emulated kim also would have strongly approved of mr mugabes expulsion of foreign media his crackdown on the independent press and his slavish broadcast media indeed mr mugabes herald newspaper has carried laudatory articles about juche mr mugabes first visit to north korea as prime minister of newly independent zimbabwe had an enormous impact "he came back almost a different man " one of his former party stalwarts says "he was tremendously impressed by the stadiums full of people doing mass calisthenics he came back wanting to become president like kim there was no more primus inter pares about him after that " nicolae ceausescu the romanian dictator was similarly affected by his visit to pyongyang and returned to bucharest to launch his "systematization" program knocking down old buildings and churches in order to build marching lines of apartments north korean style mugabe and ceausescu became close friends thus the downfall and assassination of the ceausescus in were a trauma in harare where news of this terrible event was quickly snatched off air when kim died in zimbabwe set up a committee to honor the memory of kim il sung chaired by vice president joseph msika this committee holds a special month of mourning for kim every year with lectures seminars and a memorial service "praying for his eternity " mr mugabes party now called zanu pf also has its own juche committee the birthday of kims son the "dear leader" kim jong il is celebrated effectively as the north korean christmas mr mugabe whose birthday feb falls only five days later has now copied this he too is celebrated as "our dear leader" with the same mass synchronized dancing by women in traditional dress and army parades the st february movement also holds feasts and food distributions for as in north korea the faithful are often near starvation the central idea is that everything including the economy can be commanded by the leaders will in north korea anyone unable to live with that idea ended up in its gulag or fled as refugees to china so that everyone left in the country was totally obedient mr mugabes ambition is the same but juche like mr mugabes radical socialism was a fraud in reality north korea depended utterly on soviet aid just as liberated zimbabwes economy depended completely on a few thousand white farmers when soviet aid ceased in north koreas income halved and mass starvation ensued just as it has in zimbabwe following the eviction of the white farmers around a million north koreans died but kim jong il simply denied the facts of starvation and at first turned away food aid mr mugabe did the same when the world food program offered to help starving zimbabweans in he asked "why foist this food upon us we do not want to be choked we have enough " in the end both regimes have become massively dependent on foreign food aid zimbabwes parliament now faces a proposed constitutional amendment enabling mr mugabe to choose his own successor and impose him without an election just as kim il sung designated his own successor but zimbabwe may be just a bit luckier there is no young mugabe waiting to succeed the "dear leader " mr johnson is emeritus
