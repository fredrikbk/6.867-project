bill jeffersons constitution weve been defending the bush administrations executive privilege claims and liberals are crying foul a year ago we were defending congress and louisiana democrat william jefferson in their claims of legislative privilege and conservatives were howling theres a lesson here in the separation of powers one that was reinforced late last week in a decision by the d c circuit court of appeals upholding much of mr jeffersons claim partisans tend to view separation of powers issues as nothing more than political cover for policy disputes sometimes theyre right but other times the disputes are about preserving core powers that allow a democratic government to function properly legislators need to be able to do their business without fear of prosecutorial intimidation from the executive while executive branch officials need to deliberate without fear that their advice will be broadcast to all the world by congress so its notable that the d c circuit found that the justice departments raid on mr jeffersons capitol hill office violated the constitutions speech or debate clause the decision stopped short of requiring the fbi to return all the documents seized in the raid as mr jefferson had sought but it did recognize that the executive branch could not "compel disclosure" of privileged legislative branch materials even when backed by a search warrant from the judicial branch of government the speech or debate clause includes a "non disclosure privilege " the court said which is intended to protect the confidentiality of legislative deliberations at the time this dispute surfaced there was much conservative shouting that congress is not "above the law " well sure and mr jefferson isnt an easy case to defend investigators had already found &# in cash in his non interest paying home freezer and he has since been indicted on bribery charges even without the evidence in his office which has been under seal since the raid but there are ways that justice could have protected both legislative privilege and the cause of justice under the law such as by negotiating terms of the office search with the house counsel and leadership as it is the fbi barred mr jefferson and house officials from entering his office once agents were inside no sooner had then speaker of the house denny hastert risen to defend mr jeffersons rights than someone also leaked that mr hastert was himself under investigation this was a clear attempt to impugn one of justices critics via a false accusation and was itself an abuse of power the d c circuit did at least give prosecutors a break by letting them keep documents related to their case citing supreme court precedent on the exclusionary rule the judges did so because they said the fbi and justice had made some effort in drafting the search warrant and in reviewing documents to minimize the impact on congresss official business in other words the executive branch acted in good faith even though it acted in error but allowing the executive branch to review the documents and make its own judgments about privilege is like allowing congress to pass judgment on the limits of executive privilege unilaterally something this newspaper has also long opposed although congress is once again trying to do precisely that whatever mr jeffersons fate the lesson is that privilege is not a partisan issue or shouldnt be conservative constitutional principles include the defense of core congressional as well as presidential powers properly understood
