growing up as states tackle poverty preschool gets high marks new lobbying strategy fuels national move for universal classes in washington and statehouses across the country preschool is moving to the head of the class florida and oklahoma are among the states that have started providing free preschool for any year old whose parents want it illinois and new york plan to do the same hillary rodham clinton wants to spend &# billion over five years on universal preschool funding federal reserve chairman ben bernanke calls preschool one cure for inequality the movement represents one of the most significant expansions in public education in the years since world war i when kindergarten first became standard in american schools it has taken off as politicians look for relatively inexpensive ways to tackle the growing rich poor gap in the u s they have found spending on children is usually an easy sell it took a well orchestrated campaign to put pre k on the top of political agendas and new tactics that didnt rely on do gooder rhetoric among those working on the issue are the research director of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis a billionaire oklahoma oil man and a foundation executive in philadelphia their winning pitch making pre k as prevalent as kindergarten is a prudent investment early schooling they say makes kids more likely to stay in school and turn into productive taxpayers "politicians have a choice to make they can do things like build sports stadiums that offer virtually no economic return or they can invest in early education programs with a rate of return " says art rolnick the minneapolis fed official who came up with that number after reviewing a three decade study of youngsters growing up in ypsilanti mich so far few organizations are pushing the case against preschool but the argument does exist some skeptics predict the hefty return claimed by mr rolnick would quickly shrink if states rush to make preschool universal they cite some studies suggesting that head start the federal program for disadvantaged preschoolers gives children little edge when entering elementary school "the current full scale head start program is having a disappointing impact on kids " says douglas besharov of the conservative american enterprise institute "pre k is an important part of the tool chest for reducing the achievement gap but will the return on investment be as great as people say i dont think so " until recently preschool was for a minority most american children began school at age in kindergarten in lyndon johnson created head start for disadvantaged children as young as age part of his war on poverty today about low income children are enrolled in head start which also includes programs in nutrition and health care in all of and year olds are now enrolled in a school of some sort the best off are most likely to send their children to pre k in families with incomes of about &# of and year olds are enrolled according to the pew charitable trusts national institute for early education research the new pre k advocates want more children in some cases all children in others all low income children to be in school before age to the extent head start has fallen short of its goals they argue it is because federal and state funding is inadequate and the staff is sometimes poorly trained thirty eight states now help localities finance pre k they plan to spend &# billion in the year ending sept up from two years ago according to pre k now a group that advocates universal pre k this year governors have called for increasing pre k spending including massachusetts gov deval patrick who endorsed the idea in june after a five year push by advocates there have been setbacks virginias republican legislature this year rejected a universal preschool plan by the states democratic governor calling the cost too high in california filmmaker rob reiner led a high profile campaign to fund universal preschool last year with higher cigarette taxes it failed amid concerns that it was a boon for the teachers union and accusations that a state commission headed by mr reiner improperly used public funds to lobby for the measure the state auditor later rejected that allegation and at the time mr reiner denied any impropriety preschool isnt mandatory and states sometimes have trouble predicting how many parents will sign up for programs one result is a shortage of funding in some states where demand has been greater than expected staci hamlin a mother of two in knoxville tenn couldnt get her year old son blake into state funded preschool because the familys income of slightly more than &# a year was too high the state has been trying to expand its program but at the moment its available primarily to families with annual income below of the federal poverty line which is &# for a family of four "ive heard that the program is excellent and gets kids ready for kindergarten and i really wanted to get him enrolled " ms hamlin says a forerunner to the current nationwide push is oklahoma which has offered preschool to all year olds since advocates often point to the state as a model one study they cite by georgetown university researchers in said tulsa children who went through preschool saw a increase in test scores and improvement in cognitive skills the program has received key backing from george kaiser owner of tulsa based kaiser francis oil co mr kaiser has committed about &# million of his family foundations money to early education and child care including employing two lobbyists in the state legislature he says he got interested in the issues about eight years ago as he became "more and more frustrated that all of the billions of dollars we were throwing at the problem of endemic poverty was having little demonstrable impact " in conservative oklahoma his pitch is pragmatic "the most effective argument among conservative republicans is that the folks we are helping are already in day care so that we are not taking them from a loving home " he says "the kids will end up as productive citizens rather than in the correctional system " in the pew charitable trusts a philadelphia foundation reviewed its efforts over the years in k education and found little to cheer it considered dismantling the program then the foundations new director of education susan urahn urged the pew board to look at preschool childrens minds were like sponges at age she pointed out three long term studies suggested that children who went to preschool were less likely to be held back in higher grades and more likely to graduate and pre k was an easier playing field for policy entrepreneurs most preschool teachers dont belong to unions and curricula are less entrenched "the fact that there is no well organized system of early education at this point has its advantages " she wrote in a presentation to the pew board in september urging it to take advantage of "an unusual opportunity to influence public policy " says ms urahn "the response from the board was two words do it " pew established its pre k now advocacy group to support activists in states it funded the national institute for early education research to date pew has spent about &# million on the campaign a substantial sum for a foundation that spends about &# million a year altogether one of pews grants in provided &# to columbia universitys hechinger institute on education and the media to "build media knowledge" of preschool a pew analysis said reporters had the perception that "early childhood education was not a big time story " the institute set out to change that with seminars to give journalists story ideas and tips on how to win prominent placement for the subject a may hechinger report boasted that "just three days after the hechinger seminar" a reporter for the richmond times dispatch wrote a story about the virginia governors plan to give public funding to child care providers about two years into pews campaign the minneapolis feds mr rolnick became an unlikely ally a fed economist since mr rolnick had studied pre civil war banking and done research suggesting that governments are wasting money subsidizing sports stadiums while he has two children "i thought education started in kindergarten " he says in mr rolnick heard a minneapolis early education group argue that government should spend on preschool mainly because its the right thing to do he scoffed "policymakers need more guidance than that " he says the group asked mr rolnick to help make the case he says he loves to dive into data so he scrutinized some of the research that helped persuade ms urahn particularly a study of low income black children in ypsilanti half were sent to preschool and half werent after tracking the students over three decades researchers found those who went to preschool were less likely to need special education and had higher test scores mr rolnick and a colleague crunched the data calculating that for every &# invested in preschool there was a &# return from lower crime fewer welfare payments and higher earnings the magnitude surprised everyone mr rolnick asked economist james heckman a nobel laureate at the university of chicago to check the work the results matched mr rolnicks among those intrigued was robert dugger a former democratic staffer on capitol hill he was working at the hedge fund tudor investment corp as a political and global risk analyst using his own money &# so far mr dugger started his own think tank and commissioned a paper by mr heckman the paper argued that extending preschool to the four million children under then living under the poverty line would produce a net benefit to the economy of more than &# billion disadvantaged children who start schooling early are more likely to attend college and "less likely to be teenage mothers and foster a new generation of deprived children " mr heckman wrote the paper helped persuade mr duggers boss hedge fund magnate paul tudor jones to contribute &# million mr duggers project has grown from a handful of people sitting around a table in his office to a group of more than who gather some in person some on a phone link in washington for two hour presentations monthly pew has kicked in &# million some remain cautious about the research grover j whitehurst director of the federal institute of education sciences says the studies used to calculate rates of return are too small to be "a basis for generalizing what the economic benefits would be if this was rolled out in various states " still the experience of new york state shows how the publicity is having a practical impact a group called winning beginning ny had been agitating for universal pre k for years when it received an initial &# grant from pews pre k now in winning beginning led by former state health official karen schimke used the money to start lobbying in albany later the group commissioned research and used pew money to put out a "spiffy four page document" on the "pre k payback" for new york says ms schimke the work paid off in when the group met with aides to eliot spitzer then the democratic nominee for governor "spitzer bit and he began to talk about universal pre k " says ms schimke mr spitzers budget which he signed in april includes an additional &# million in pre k funding which will be used to accelerate efforts toward offering preschool for every year old in new york by the governor wants to spend &# million more over the next four years among advocates theres a split over whether state funded pre k should be available to all as in oklahoma or should be targeted at low income children economist steven barnett of the national institute for early education research says pre k benefits not only the poor but also middle class children who are at risk of falling behind in school "most of the children who drop out of school or fail a grade are middle class " says mr barnett the university of chicagos mr heckman counters "scarce resources should be directed to the problem areas " despite his role in pushing the pre k cause mr heckman cautions against overdoing it "theres a great danger here that people are going to rush out and with blind enthusiasm endorse very superficial programs " he says
