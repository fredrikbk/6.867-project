google news offers rebuttal time articles subjects sources allowed to post comments verifying identity an issue google inc began allowing individuals and groups cited in stories it carries to post comments about the articles through the google news service a move that is raising questions in the media industry the mountain view calif internet companys google news posts links and excerpts to articles from more than english language news sources in an experimental project google this week began soliciting comments from subjects and others in the stories working to verify their identities and displaying the comments alongside links to the articles the company said it is doing so to make available additional perspectives on the news announcement of the feature on a google blog late tuesday attracted attention among media organizations which have at times had uneasy relationships with the internet company including fights over its right to excerpt their content in google news without paying some media watchers questioned whether google is effectively setting itself up as an ombudsman to field gripes with their coverage and whether that is an appropriate role other news sites allow anyone to comment on stories without requiring that the person have a direct link to them and carry links to blogs with such commentary one key issue concerns who google allows to comment on a given story and how it authenticates their identities "i think there are a lot of reasons to do it but a lot of ones to tread carefully " said dan gillmor director of the nonprofit center for citizen media which is affiliated with the university of california berkeley and harvard university law school "what if someone fakes them out and compounds some problem thats in a story " google says it allows people who are quoted in articles or affiliated with organizations in them to comment as well as reporters and editors responsible for the articles google employees verify the identity of individuals who submit comments josh cohen business product manager for google news said its methods for doing so vary case by case but include contacting companies and organizations and independently trying to verify email addresses and phone numbers using the web and phone directories google employees are also soliciting comments from participants in news stories though it hopes that such comments arrive unsolicited once the feature gathers steam the more labor intensive approach marks something of a departure for google news which relies on computers rather than human editors to select which stories to display most prominently the company says the amount of labor required to handle comments is one thing it is examining closely as it experiments with the feature it says it doesnt have intentions to become a news organization however "were not creating it were not reporting it were not editing it " said mr cohen "we see it more as a corollary to whats being done out there " mr cohen said google has discussed letting news organizations post comments google collected about articles on the organizations own web sites the associated press which is paid by google to license unspecified content awaits the new feature "with interest " a spokesman said jim brady executive editor of washingtonpost com called the new feature "a cool idea " adding that its less likely to affect news sites such as washingtonpost com that already allow commenting "its a typical google idea its an interesting concept and im not sure how theyre going to do it technically but because its google its worth watching " he said some media experts argue that the google feature gives individuals a valuable additional means of responding to articles in which theyre quoted or otherwise mentioned beyond letters to the editor and lawsuits they said it could help further loosen a traditional media gatekeeper role in presenting information to the public something that blogs and other internet outlets are already contributing to "what google is doing as far as i see it is just enabling another path for exercising the right of response " said jeff jarvis a media consultant who is consulting editor of news start up daylife inc mr gillmor added "whats really a shame is news organizations have not made this effort long ago and waited for yet another disruptive move by an online company " googles mr cohen said the company will not accept comments from google employees or comments about the company and markets where it competes in order to avoid any controversy about that he also said that google wont edit the comments which "bypasses any concerns that googles legal department might have" about the companys liability for them vic strasburger a professor of pediatrics at the university of new mexico said google asked him by email to comment on an associated press article about a fast food study in which hed been quoted dr strasburger submitted a comment expanding on what he was cited as saying in the article "ill do a to minute interview and two sentences will appear about what ive said " he said in an interview "so the google feature is really a chance to flesh out those two sentences "
