mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q in various past columns you have complained that windows vista boots slowly and that it is incompatible with some software and hardware is this situation improving a microsoft claims that neither complaint affects most users and that the minority of cases where they do is being whittled down steadily i expect that the incompatibility issues at least will diminish over time but i am still receiving reader complaints about incompatibility so i have to assume that this issue remains real at least for some people the slow start up issue will be harder to cure as it involves factors like add on trial software called craplets that are beyond microsofts control officials at a number of windows pc makers tell me they are beginning to get the message that people hate craplets but i am still observing slow boot times in new vista pcs i test and still see plenty of craplets q if i run windows on a mac do i need two copies of antivirus software one to run in the windows environment and one to run in the mac operating system a you need only one copy to run in the windows environment macs have essentially no virus problem and thus dont need antivirus software however some mac users install it to be extra safe or to kill viruses that they fear might be passed on via email or over networks to people using windows q in last weeks mailbox you advised someone that he could copy a gigabyte file from a mac to a windows pc using an external hard disk formatted for the windows fat file system but i believe that wont work do you have another solution a you are correct that i erred i forgot that the fat file system the only windows format to which macs can save files is limited to file sizes of up to gigabytes this is almost never a problem except in the case of extraordinarily large files i did offer several alternate solutions last week including using a network or cable transfer but heres another you can use a mac formatted external hard disk or a mac formatted ipod acting as a hard disk to transfer the file provided you have installed on the windows pc special software that allows windows to read mac formatted disks this software is called macdrive costs &# and can be purchased at mediafour com you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online free at the all things digital site http walt allthingsd com
