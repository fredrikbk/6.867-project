falling dollar takes investors for a ride as the once mighty dollar continues to wane its proving a source of both risk and opportunity for investors the dollars long slide has become a fixture of financial markets in recent years against the currencies of a broad group of trading partners the dollar now stands at its weakest point in more than a decade the situation is even more dramatic with certain individual currencies earlier this month the dollar hit a modern day nadir versus the canadian dollar and a year low against the british pound this past week it touched a fresh record low against the euro one euro now buys roughly &# compared with just &# five years ago meanwhile last week a new factor emerged to weigh on the dollar talk that oil rich nations in the persian gulf which have pegged their currencies to the dollar for years are reconsidering those arrangements the dollars recent slide is part of a broader worrisome mix that includes slowing economic growth and soaring oil prices and mortgage related turmoil at financial institutions these factors helped send both the dow jones industrials average and the nasdaq composite index down last week for the year to date the dow industrials are up and the nasdaq up a weak dollar has obvious consequences for travel overseas as anyone who has traveled to europe recently knows here at home though the consequences have so far been largely positive american exporters goods are cheaper for foreign buyers making u s products more competitive overseas earnings of u s companies are also worth more when converted back into dollars which has boosted profits the problem is that the weaker the dollar gets the higher the likelihood that the downsides will kick in eventually an enfeebled currency could spur higher inflation as imported goods become more expensive it might even cause investors around the world to rethink their purchases of u s government bonds purchases the country needs in order to finance its deficit in that case the federal reserve could be forced to raise u s interest rates to attract investment thereby raising borrowing costs for u s consumers and businesses and potentially punishing stock prices the likelihood of such action depends not so much on the magnitude of the dollars decline but on whether it begins to tumble in a more rapid disorderly way says russ koesterich head of investment strategy at barclays global investors "if the dollar starts to go down very quickly it will impact monetary policy at a time when investors have a very benign view of how the fed will behave " the dollar is laboring under a double burden at the moment the u s economy is slowing at a time when many economies elsewhere continue to shine which can make investing in the u s comparatively less attractive reducing demand for dollars at the same time the drags on u s growth from housing woes to turmoil in the credit markets have led the fed to reduce its key interest rate twice in two months so far other major central banks have held their main rates steady or even raised them that gives investors less incentive to hold dollars relative to other currencies last week the fed released new economic forecasts suggesting that u s growth will proceed at a crawl in which will provide little comfort to the dollar "in some fashion the dollar will continue to decline " says adnan akant a currency specialist at new york money manager fischer francis trees &amp watts but going forward the dollar may weaken against different currencies than it has in recent years he says for instance most of the dollars decline to date has occurred against major currencies such as the euro and the british pound and not against asian currencies mr akant says currencies like the euro may not rise very much further versus the dollar the euro "might already be in overshoot territory " he says for investors the weaker dollar world presents certain choices if you believe the dollars decline still has a ways to go one way to take advantage of the trend is to own stocks or bonds denominated in other currencies if the dollar weakens the returns will be worth more when converted back into dollars jack ablin chief investment officer of harris private bank in chicago says that for a traditional stock investor hed recommend increasing the weighting of foreign stocks in a portfolio but also look to "rely on u s companies that can exploit a weaker currency " big companies like those that comprise the standard &amp poors stock index often generate a large portion of their revenue outside the u s some of the best performing large u s stocks this year like mcdonalds up so far in get more than half their sales from overseas an easy and cheap way to get exposure to large stocks is through an s&amp p index fund such as those offered by vanguard group fidelity investments and charles schwab keep in mind though that the vast majority of a stocks return comes from factors other than currency gains or losses bonds denominated in foreign currencies are a more direct way to bet on such fluctuations a number of companies offer funds that buy bonds globally among those that have received the highest rating from morningstar are templeton global bond tpinx and oppenheimer international bond oibax email forum sunday wsj com
