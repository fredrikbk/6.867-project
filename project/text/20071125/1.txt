dispatches from iraq the answer to so many questions remains well wait and see online edition you hear the phrase "wait and see" a lot these days when it comes to iraq is iran honoring its pledge to try to stop support of militia groups in iraq "well have to wait and see " is the security situation here sustainable "well have to wait and see " u s and iraqi officials say the security situation is improving but they always caution that the fight isnt over yet they are just being pragmatic because they know how easily it could move backward if anti american shiite cleric moqtada al sadr decides to end his cease fire or another mosque bombing ignites sectarian tension for instance the violence could easily flare up again u s military spokesman rear admiral gregory smith said about two weeks ago that based on recent weapons cache discoveries it seemed like iran was honoring its pledge to stop munitions from entering iraq but after a pet market bombing in baghdad on friday admiral smith said on saturday that the group responsible for that explosion had iranian support today brigadier general james yarbrough head of the iraqi assistance group said he was taking a "wait and see attitude" to see if iran was going to honor its pledge "the willingness of iran to stop the fighting helps but its too early to tell " he said one of the first things you learn about iraq is how quickly the situation changes an iraqi colleague of mine said he always laughs when he sees a western commentator or western analysis piece that predicts what will happen in iraq "i was born here and lived here for more than years and i cannot predict what will happen tomorrow " he says with a big grin "in iraq anything can happen " gina chon nov guests in our own country at a press conference today to discuss security improvements in diyala province an iraqi journalist brought up an unrelated topic he told u s military officials of being mistreated at a checkpoint to get into the international zone formerly the green zone where the press conference took place he said the guards gave him a hard time and were rude to him another iraqi journalist raised his hand and said he faced similar treatment a u s military official said he would look into it and take care of it foreigners do seem to get better treatment than iraqis in the international zone we are trusted more than the locals guards are more polite to us a u s official told me he never meets iraqis at the u s embassy compound because its humiliating for them to go there waiting in long lines to be searched in their own country i asked an iraqi friend who often has to come to the international zone for work how he feels about that he answered that he feels like a criminal like the americans think all iraqis are bad "we are guests in our own country " he said "actually we are worse than a guest because at least you are nice to your guest we are like slaves " of course the american military has reason to be cautious there have been infiltrations of u s military bases and the international zone like the suicide bomber who blew himself up in the parliament building last april so the searches and the long lines are a necessity but with that comes resentment part of the anger from the blackwater shooting that killed people in september comes from iraqis feeling helpless and not in control in their own country at a recent lunch with journalists the blackwater shooting came up government spokesman ali al dabbagh said there is anger among the iraqi people he said there must be iraqi regulations for foreign security companies operating here but there is a question of whether the companies will accept those rules he added that iraq is supposed to be a sovereign nation "there must be some sense of accountability " he said "even the americans wouldnt accept a situation like that " gina chon nov write to gina chon or sarmad ali
