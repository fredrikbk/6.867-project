love &amp money the christmas trip does it count as a gift holiday season officially began on friday so i figured nows a good time to note that this year amy and i are trying something different when it comes to giving gifts to our kids this christmas were giving our kids a trip to lake tahoe where we have family friends it will be an opportunity for our year old daughter to play in the snow for the first time and for our year old son to go snowboarding with dad something he has wanted to do again since our last trip to snow country in canada two years ago this will be a fairly expensive trip exceeding &# because of that cost i hesitated for weeks before booking the vacation my concern is that were piling this big expense on top of whatever we spend on the kids christmas presents amys solution we told the kids the trip is their major christmas present from mom and dad this year problem solved or is it can a trip you might have taken anyway really be a christmas gift or does it seem like the scrooges way out and does it really count as a gift if you tell your children about the gift weeks before christmas actually arrives every year i complain about the proliferation of gift giving among adults around the holidays i earn a decent salary and if theres something i really want i can go buy it for myself i see no need for others to buy stuff for me or for me to buy stuff that others can purchase for themselves kids are different this is their time of year i know from my own childhood just how much fun it is tearing into that wrapping paper on christmas morning to find the cool toys you circled in the sears catalog way back in november or included on the list you dispatched to the north pole now as a parent i get that same thrill watching my kids excitement but can a vacation everyone already knows about offer that same level of holiday cheer i understand that family holiday trips have a long tradition and certainly travel offers some compelling advantages as a present it removes some of the angst of figuring out what to buy your kids when they have pretty much everything already its far better than another gadget that is put permanently in the closet within days and it creates family memories that will last far longer than most tangible presents ever will but there are also some major drawbacks to the whole concept that for me potentially change the equation for instance does the trip diminish the traditional holiday experience for your kids who are assuredly expecting their usual bounty in our case our tahoe adventure is slated for the week after christmas to fit various school and work schedules and the kids already know this is their gift so how does that play out on christmas morning we certainly cant give the kids a picture of a snowy mountain and say "remember that trip we told you about well its almost here " and theres another point our kids had no say in whether this vacation is what they want for christmas its something amy and i want to do and we think the kids will enjoy it but they didnt ask for it and i worry it could ruin the best part of a kids christmas the anticipation if you already know what youre getting whats the point of making a wish list that however leads to a major flaw i already see in our strategy im not sure any of us believe it the kids nodded when we told them this was their big christmas present but i dont think it registered they still believe that there will be plenty to open under the tree despite what we told them about the trip im also not sure it registered with me or amy i know us well enough to suspect that our kids will find more than lake tahoe brochures under the christmas tree in fact i feel like we might have painted ourselves into a corner if we scale back the presents as dramatically as we plan were bound to disappoint the kids but if we dont scale back well blow our budget amy though insists she will follow through on our strategy "packaging this trip as a christmas gift is the only way i could get you to buy into it from a budget standpoint " she says besides she says theres nothing wrong with labeling it as the kids major christmas present "theyre excited about this " she says "and we can present it in a way that its just like opening a gift on christmas morning so yes we can place pictures in their stocking of where were staying and maybe put a small camera in there that they can use to take their own pictures when were there its a gift tied to the vacation " maybe ill ultimately be proved wrong but im going into this prepared for the possibility that as fun as a trip to the snow will be our kids may think theyve unwrapped a lump of coal in their christmas stockings this year jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal email lovemoney wsj com
