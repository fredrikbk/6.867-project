insuring the unthinkable what government can and should do holman jenkinss aug business world column "terror insurance is here to stay" misses the point on why the terrorism risk insurance act tria should be extended and why it must remain a vital component for our nations economic security the threat of terrorism is real not manufactured for political expediency despite efforts over the past six years by private insurers to grapple with this risk the reasons that made terrorism an uninsurable risk following havent changed these reasons include the fact that terrorism risk cannot be satisfactorily quantified because terrorist events are willful acts undertaken by parties who wish to confound those who study them hence the historical data on these events are scant and of little relevance and there is no reliable model that measures terrorism risk in addition terrorists coordinated large scale attacks can cause losses to be correlated over time and across business lines which makes the risk difficult to diversify and last but not least the vast loss potential of terrorist events might exceed the insurance industrys financial resources because of tria terrorism insurance is broadly available to businesses that want and need it this is a reason to praise the program not argue for its demise if a federal backstop didnt exist availability would drop substantially and fewer businesses would be insured moreover tria should reduce the post event appropriations referenced in the piece given that private insurers are responsible for substantial losses before any federal money is spent we agree with mr jenkins that there should not be an expanded federal role for insuring against natural catastrophes unlike terrorism however natural catastrophe risks are insurable they can be quantified diversified and there is enough reinsurance capacity available to cover them which make a government role redundant fmr gov marc racicot president american insurance association pierre ozendo member of the executive board ceo americas property &amp casualty swiss re new york regrettably mr jenkins minimizes the need for extending the federal terrorism insurance backstop congress enacted the original tria in when a global shortage of terrorism reinsurance caused by the financial devastation of the attacks in which insurers paid nearly &# billion in claims resulted in a national economic malaise that put jobs on hold and stalled or canceled nearly &# billion in real estate transactions tria created a federal financial backstop that allows insurers to determine "how high is up" when it comes to predicting the size and frequency of future terrorist attacks in essence tria allows insurance companies to put a price on an uninsurable risk and provides a &# billion "deductible" for the federal government thats the amount of losses from a future attack that would be paid by private insurers not a bad deal moreover commercial insurance consumers have embraced the program more than of all commercial buyers opt to purchase terrorism coverage the bottom line is that tria works for consumers for insurers for taxpayers and for the federal government many of the provisions of the legislation to extend the program passed by the house financial services committee would enhance the terrorism insurance market reducing the trigger from &# million to &# million will allow more small and medium sized insurers to provide such coverage without the threat of one attack which they can do nothing to predict or prevent bankrupting their companies but a requirement that insurers "make available" coverage for attacks using weapons of mass destruction nuclear biological chemical and radiological will undermine the foundation of the program threaten the solvency of many insurers and leave commercial consumers with fewer choices and higher prices while the issue of protecting our economy from the threat of nuclear terrorism must be addressed mandating that insurers provide such coverage is not the most effective way to do so we expect the senate to debate this in much more detail when it considers this legislation this fall terrorism attacks our nation our people and our economy insurers are more than willing to do their part to provide the financial safety net businesses rely on to expand their operations with confidence and to rebuild after a catastrophe however the federal government must play a critical role in not only preventing future attacks but also in providing the financial backstop that makes our economy resilient to even the most diabolical act of terrorism june holmes interim ceo property casualty insurers association of america des plaines ill
