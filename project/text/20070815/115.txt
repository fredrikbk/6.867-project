"specially designated global terrorist" designation will be made under an executive order that lets the u s "block the assets of terrorists and disrupt operations by foreign businesses that provide support services or assistance to or otherwise associate with terrorists " the washington post says while discussions about the move continue and the bush administration hasnt decided when to announce it officials tell the post they would prefer it to come before next months u n general assembly meeting when washington plans to ratchet up pressure on iran the decision signals an aggressive step for the administration which the new york times says has seemed conflicted "over whether to take a harder line against tehran over its nuclear program and what american officials have called its destabilizing role in iraq " european diplomats tell the times that secretary of state condoleezza rice warned her european counterparts of the planned move recently saying the administration had little choice but unilateral action because of a delay in u n efforts to impose further sanctions on iran for ms rice the move would help pacify hawks within the administration who are pushing for possible military action and at the same time increase pressure on u s allies to support stronger sanctions the times adds however the post notes that some analysts worry the move could backfire "it would greatly complicate our efforts to solve the nuclear issue " said joseph cirincione a nuclear proliferation expert at the center for american progress "sanctions can serve as a prod but they have very rarely forced a country to capitulate or collapse " the "global terrorist" designation has been used frequently since it was introduced by president bush in as part of post sept measures to cut

terrorist organizations the post notes since iran has done little business with the u s since the revolution the designation is mainly intended to increase political and psychological pressure on iran administration officials tell the times "by using the designation to persuade foreign governments and financial institutions to cut ties with iranian businesses and individuals " still the guard has a vast business network the post notes and "many of the front companies engaged in procuring nuclear technology are owned and run by the revolutionary guards " ray takeyh of the council on foreign relations tells the paper "theyre developing along the lines of the chinese military which is involved in many business enterprises its a huge business conglomeration" mr takeyh adds asian and
