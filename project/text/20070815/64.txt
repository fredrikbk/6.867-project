iran stirs mixed feelings about military aggression i consider myself a pacifist but after reading amir taheris commentary on irans disturbing domestic crackdown "domestic terror in iran " aug i am ashamed to say i am being lured by thoughts of war a few years ago when i proclaimed my anti iraq invasion stance to anyone who would listen my persian parents would simply respond "i hope iran is next " i would argue but to no avail they felt in their hearts that justice would never exist for the iranian people without intervention especially those iranians who like my parents are in the minority i was born and raised in southern california free to wear flip flops and tank tops and sit next to a boy on the school bus without a second thought my parents were not they lived in iran during what was generally a prosperous time under the shah during their childhood the country made wild strides toward modernization and equality yet they are bahais a quiet peaceful religious minority with few rights in the country and knew their lives were based on a very fragile order when iran fell into the hands of fundamentalists my parents left my paternal grandfather a high ranking military officer was not so lucky while attending a bahai meeting in tehran he was arrested and disappeared my father never saw him again he was among the more than bahais that have been interrogated tortured and killed in iran since now those same indignities are happening to activists and students men women and children all being forced to suffer the same fate as my grandfather shabnam mogharabi washington
