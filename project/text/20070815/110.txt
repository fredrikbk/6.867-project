the cheney imperative dick cheney sat transfixed by the images on the small television screen in the corner of his west wing office smoke poured out of a gaping hole in the world trade centers north tower john mcconnell the vice presidents chief speechwriter sat next to him and said nothing then a second plane appeared on the right hand side of the screen banked slightly to the left and plunged into the south tower "did you see that " mr cheney asked his aide a little more than an hour later mr cheney was seated below the presidential seal at a long conference table in the presidential emergency operations center better known as the bunker when an aide told mr cheney that another passenger airplane was rapidly approaching the white house the vice president gave the order to shoot it down the young man was so surprised at mr cheneys immediate response that he asked again mr cheney reiterated the order thinking that mr cheney must have misunderstood the question the military aide asked him a third time the vice president responded evenly "i said yes " these early moments and all that followed from them will define mr cheneys vice presidency he was aggressive in those first moments of the war on terror and has been ever since mr cheney flew from the white house that night to camp david where he stayed in the aspen lodge usually reserved for the president it was his first night in the "secure undisclosed location" that would eventually provide fodder for late night comedians when he woke the next morning mr cheney asked himself two questions when is the next attack and what can i do to prevent it they were the questions on the minds of many politicians immediately following "when not if" quickly became one of many cliches to emerge from the national trauma of that day democrats and republicans alike spoke of further terrorist acts on u s soil with certainty sen bob graham a democrat from florida who has since retired but at the time was chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence described the intelligence after a cia briefing days after "there is evidence that tuesdays attack was the first phase of a multi phase series of terrorist assaults against the united states all under one umbrella plan " he said "its critical that we move with what capabilities we have today and strengthen those capabilities so that the next acts of this horrendous scheme against the people of the united states can be interdicted before it is executed " no wonder then that a time cnn poll taken in september found that four out of five americans believed another attack within a year was either "somewhat likely" or "very likely " that was nearly six years ago to many the threats no longer seem urgent critics speak of "the so called war on terror " and accuse the administration of exaggerating the threats zbigniew brzezinski a leading indicator of democratic conventional wisdom recently argued that the "culture of fear" created in response to the attacks has done more damage than the attacks themselves but mr cheney has not moved on he still awakens each day asking the same questions he asked on sept then as he sips his morning coffee he pores over the latest intelligence on his own before receiving an exhaustive briefing on the latest threat reports after that he joins his boss for the presidents daily intelligence briefing all of this happens before a m he mentions the war on terror in virtually every speech he gives and in a letter he wrote to his grandchildren he acknowledged that his "principal focus" as vice president has been national security the way that he has gone about his job has won him many critics his approval ratings are low a small but growing group of congressional democrats is mobilizing to impeach him respected commentators from respected publications have suggested that his heart problems have left him mentally unstable others have called on him to resign some conservatives have joined this chorus of criticism with one prominent columnist labeling the vice president "destructive" and another dismissing those who share his views as "cheneyite nutjobs " this past saturday protesters near his home outside jackson wyo tore down an effigy of mr cheney in much the way iraqis famously toppled the statue of saddam hussein so president bush should ignore mr cheneys advice and the white house communications team should keep him hidden from public view right nonsense with intelligence officials in washington increasingly alarmed about the prospect of another major attack on the u s homeland and public support for the bush administrations anti terror efforts reclaiming lost ground we need more dick cheney the policies he has advocated have been controversial but they have also been effective consider the procedures put in place to extract information from hardcore terrorists mr cheney did not dream up these interrogation methods but when intelligence officials insisted that they would work the vice president championed them in internal white house debates and on capitol hill former cia director george tenet a clinton era appointee and certainly no cheney fan was asked about the value of those interrogation programs in a recent television appearance his response ignored by virtually everyone in the media was extraordinary "heres what i would say to you to the congress to the american people to the president of the untied states i know that this program has saved lives i know weve disrupted plots i know this program alone is worth more than the fbi the central intelligence agency and the national security agency put together have been able to tell us " and what about the national security agencys terrorist surveillance program immediately after the attacks president bush instructed his top intelligence officials to be aggressive in their efforts to track terrorists and disrupt their plots michael hayden nsa director at the time took that opportunity to propose changes to the ways his agency monitored terrorist communications a little more than a year before the attacks while bill clinton was still president mr hayden dramatized the nsas dilemma in congressional testimony "if as we are speaking here this afternoon osama bin laden is walking from niagara falls ontario to niagara falls new york as he gets to the new york side he is an american person and my agency must respect his rights against unreasonable search and seizure as provided by the fourth amendment to the constitution " once president bush took office messrs hayden and tenet took the problem to dick cheney the vice president walked them in to see mr bush and in short order the changes were implemented the results were almost immediate the new york times article that exposed the surveillance program in december also reported that "the eavesdropping program had helped uncover a plot by iyman faris an ohio trucker and naturalized citizen who pleaded guilty in to supporting al qaeda by planning to bring down the brooklyn bridge with blowtorches what appeared to be another qaeda plot involving fertilizer bomb attacks on british pubs and train stations was exposed last year in part through the program " in the most recent battle over reforming the foreign intelligence surveillance act mr cheney did not spend much time on capitol hill seeking support for the white house backed changes as he had during the debates over detainee interrogations and earlier versions of the nsa programs instead mr cheney pushed and prodded inside the white house insisting that the legislative affairs team approach the issue with the same urgency mr cheney feels as the white house enters a critical domestic phases of the war on terror with a heightened threat environment and the coming report from gen david petraeus on progress in iraq mr cheney may be called on to play a more public role that may seem counterintuitive if mr cheneys approval ratings are so abysmal why increase his visibility the answer is simple because his low poll numbers are the result of his low profile mr cheney likes to work in the background and he does not care much about being loved "am i the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole " mr cheney said in "its a nice way to operate actually " but this reticence has a price where there is an information vacuum people move to fill it particularly in washington a town that operates on appearances more important mr cheney understands these issues as well as anyone in the bush administration "he really does get it " says former iraq administrator l paul bremer no cheney acolyte "from his time in congress on the intel committee to his time as secretary of defense i saw him every now and then in the s when we were both out of government he really is a student a international security matters " before he accepted his current position michael mcconnell the director of national intelligence was critical of mr cheneys use of intelligence but he nonetheless argued that the vice president was underutilized as a spokesman "he has such a way of making it simple and compelling " mr mcconnell is right mr cheney can be a very effective communicator that doesnt mean he never makes mistakes he does his prediction in that the insurgency in iraq was in its "last throes" comes to mind but recall his impressive outings in debates against joseph lieberman in and john edwards four years later or his appearance on "meet the press" shortly after an interview that even the new york times called "a command performance " mr cheney has given some thought to the bush administrations difficulties communicating on the war "the notion that somehow weve got to get across to people is they just cannot think of this as a conventional war " he says "this is not desert storm its not korea its not world war ii this is a struggle thats going to go on in that part of the world for decades i dont know that youre going to be involved for iraq for decades i dont want to say that but just think about it we just have to have people understand that and understand that the alternative is not peace the alternative is not that we go back to the way the world was before you cant turn back the clock " mr hayes of the weekly standard is the author of "cheney the untold story of americas most powerful and controversial vice president" harpercollins
