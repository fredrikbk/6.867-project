the afternoon report no clear comfort online edition new price data out today shouldnt set off any inflation alarms at the fed but bernanke &amp co still face a tough call on interest rates as credit market woes force them to reconsider their inflation fighting focus government inflation data released wednesday mirrored expectations from wall street and other fed watchers as the labor department said retreating gas prices helped rein in the headline consumer price index it ticked up just in july down from junes increase of course the more important figure is the core cpi which strips out volatile food and energy prices and that number rose as it did in june on a year to year basis the core inflation rate was where it has been for three straight months federal reserve chairman ben bernanke might be pleased that inflation hasnt gained steam recently but that number is still at the high end of the oft cited yet somewhat murky "inflation comfort zone " the fed chief has clearly stated that inflation remains the risk his band of rate cutters are most concerned about but the feds longstanding bias toward fighting inflation has been challenged by events in the subprime mortgage sector that have sent financial markets careening in recent weeks the fear is that fallout from the credit markets could slow the economys momentum which in turn would put pressure on the fed to lower rates other data out this morning could also complicate mr bernankes efforts to get a clean read on the economy as industrial production increased a more than expected last month after junes reading was revised upward slightly to the federal reserve said in its monthly report on a less salubrious note the national association of realtors reported today that sales of existing homes fell in states and about one third of the metropolitan markets surveyed during the second quarter although there was also some firming of prices economists analyses of todays numbers were all over the map which suggests just how tough a call the fed faces when it next considers interest rates at a sept meeting in a research note goldman sachs analysts voiced "slight disappointment" with what it called a "high" uptick of in underlying inflation but added that "this is not a barrier to easing if other events point in that direction " for his part economist joel naroff thought the most recent inflation numbers should help smooth some of the furrowed brows at the fed saying inflation "is slowly easing back and there are few reasons to think it will pick up anytime soon whether this report eases some of the fomc members fears is unclear but it should " bear stearns analysts looked at a component of the industrial production release in light of inflation numbers saying "capacity utilization is beginning to creep into an area that would add to the feds concerns about inflation risks this report contains no economic justification from the feds perspective for changing the inflation bias in the last fomc statement " and with the markets still whip sawing wildly wednesday morning rbs greenwich capital economists noted that inflation is probably still above the magic comfort level but didnt venture a guess on what it might mean for the fed "in more normal circumstances this would have been a pretty important report in todays context it probably means next to nothing " they wrote
