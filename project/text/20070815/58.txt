diapers kleenex facial tissue kotex feminine products and scott toilet paper the consumer products giant has never had a chief marketing officer until recently looking to improve and expand its efforts to build its brands kimberly clark late last year appointed consumer products veteran anthony palmer to the newly created job his task is a formidable one he has to help kimberly clarks brands differentiate themselves against the growing array of private label goods that usually sell for lower prices and he has to do so with divisions used to running their own show kimberly clarks businesses have largely been run along brand or market lines with little communication between them as cmo he is charged with building cooperation across the company whats more he has to do all this as marketing is adapting to the impact of the internet and other digital technologies on the media industry mr palmer a native of australia and the son of a sheep shearer is no stranger to the consumer products industry prior to kimberly clark mr palmer held posts at coca cola co mars inc and most recently as managing director for kellogg co s operations in the united kingdom below mr palmer discusses how hell tackle his new role fight off private labels and compete against marketers with fatter wallets the wall street journal what benefits do you think a cmo can bring to a company do you think the role of a cmo is changing mr palmer to me the role of a cmo is really pretty simple you cant ever lose sight of the fact that your role is to sell more stuff to more people for more money more often that has got to be the ultimate goal you also have to inspire the organization to take calculated risks and inspire the organization to love winning more than theyre afraid of losing the pace of change is pretty quick right now weve got an industry that has been built around positioning a brand and then shooting a second ad at kimberly clark were re engineering how we think about that you need to have a view of what your brand stands for that is very media agnostic and business model agnostic we are also re engineering the way we work with ad agencies to make sure it supports this new way of thinking wsj any examples mr palmer the target for our brand depend is people with incontinence but it addresses the issue with the idea of preserving relationships because people who are incontinent tend to withdraw from society theyre embarrassed so preserving your dignity through discretion should drive a lot of your thinking you certainly wouldnt shoot a second ad and scream about incontinence you wouldnt have bright packaging that yells "im depend and youre incontinent " at the checkout but you do want to say "i want to build a relationship " with the consumer you look for ways to do that wsj kimberly clark is increasing its marketing spending this year how are you allocating those extra funds mr palmer were growing our spending in terms of focusing on new news driving the promise of the brand innovating on the delivery of that promise and driving a dialogue with the consumer in new and interesting places were also focused on emerging markets our tv spending is about of our marketing budget it was in print hasnt moved much its been around but nontraditional marketing activities are now about of our spending mix versus in our digital spending is up fourfold we are much more focused on alternative media wsj many of kimberly clarks products such as toilet paper facial tissue and paper towel have increasingly faced the risk of commoditization especially as private label versions improve in quality how do you plan to approach this marketing challenge mr palmer you have to go back to the simple point that a brand is a promise and the product is a delivery of that promise if you make that promise and deliver it better than the competition youll build brand equity i believe brands are more salient today to consumers than they ever have been they are a simplifying mechanism in a world where there are many more options private label is declining in some categories my belief is where brands are weak the people who are stewarding those brands arent spending as much on communication therefore theyre not telling consumers about the promise of the brand wsj how are you building communication across brands at kimberly clark mr palmer historically the businesses have been managed by region as many companies have done the huge opportunity is to drive common language across the business in terms of how you go about positioning brands and the growth architecture you have of the idea having that common language means you can make those ideas travel from one business to another the role of cmo is to build a way to make that happen weve been doing a lot of work around making sure everyone is speaking the same language and the ideas are traveling wsj kimberly clarks main competitor procter &amp gamble is the largest advertiser in the u s yet some of kimberly clarks brands are neck and neck or ahead of p&amp gs how do you maximize your ad spending against a company with much deeper pockets mr palmer first by being very focused on what the brand idea is focusing all of your spending on the pinhead of the brand idea and breaking down the barriers to participating in the brand you can take on a bigger harder spending competitor if you spend more wisely the root cause of great performance is great talent and thats the other thing the cmo can do be sure you have great talent who are trained and supported but also know how to win and believe who they win great sporting teams take the field expecting to win will love winning more than theyre afraid of losing great marketers are confident marketers
