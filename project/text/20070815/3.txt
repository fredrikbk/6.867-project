it was the obvious choice says mr colin none of them wanted to move back to their hometowns in virginia ohio and maine and they werent attracted to manhattans frenetic pace the three rented an apartment just south of san franciscos mission district a popular destination for young adults attracted to the neighborhoods copious dive bars cafes restaurants and music venues "its easy living " said mr colin speaking from his cellphone as he rode the bus home from work "at a taqueria you can get a gut busting meal for under &# the weathers not extreme and i just sold my car because im trying to be more green " but now two of his roommates are planning to leave town and mr colin whos is considering it "its a little bit bleaker than we thought it would be as far as job prospects " he says san francisco has long appealed to twentysomethings who want an urban lifestyle without the sprawl of los angeles the cold of chicago or the hectic competition of new york city in the s aspiring hippies flocked to haight ashbury between and it was the second most popular metro area after new york for young single college educated people to move to but from to almost twentysomethings left following the collapse of the dot com bubble in they started coming back drawn perhaps by the tech resurgence people aged arrived in the city that year from another state according to the u s census but will they stay while jobs in management consulting and software engineering grew in san francisco in of those positions were filled by self employed people working on a project basis according to the bureau of labor statistics these arent the kinds of contracts that new grads with suitcases in tow and few connections are likely to nab almost every job sector in san francisco from law to retail to insurance has hardly grown at all or shrunk in the past years according to data from the state of california one of the few bright spots has been the hospitality sector which added jobs since ted egan san franciscos chief economist says that nearly half of all san francisco jobs held by year olds are in either hospitality or financial and professional services the result many college graduates wind up waiting tables or making lattes "so many of the people i know just work in restaurants and coffee shops who are brilliant people and came here with the hopes that they could find meaningful work " says mr colins roommate jean klasovsky the year old looked for a full time position at a nonprofit for a year while working two part time jobs six days a week at a bookstore and an after school tutoring center now she works at a nonprofit management consultancy but she says its not a career that interests her and wants to become an elementary school teacher she will soon choose between several teaching fellowships and graduate programs in boston and new york why not san francisco "theres a huge contingent of young people who arent really doing anything here and ive somehow fallen into that crowd " says ms klasovsky adding that at least a third of her friends have either moved or decided to move in the last year mr colin a photography major says he was laid off from his first job at a photo lab he revised his career goals and sought work in a nonprofit thats focused on environmental conservation after a handful of interviews he had no offers he hasnt given up but hes broadened his search and recently interviewed for a job at a media start up he was rejected in the meantime hes doing temporary data entry and administrative work at local companies "im getting less and less young and its kind of a depressing situation " he says hilary konrad the third roommate says she plans to move to boston in the next six months for graduate school a painter from portland maine ms konrad worked in a coffee shop to pay the bills but she just quit she says she was shaken after discovering that a homeless person had spent the night in the cafe bathroom "the coffee shop wasnt people coming in for coffee it was a lot of homeless people im a sensitive person and i got very sad from it " "young creative people have been moving to san francisco since the s because its known as a place where you can experiment both artistically and personally " says beth lisick a bay area native who wrote a column about youth culture the arts and nightlife for the san francisco chronicles web site from to when she was in her late s and early s in the city she says "theres not the pressure to be a success of course this is totally ironic because san francisco is an extremely expensive place to live and if youre not succeeding at least somewhat financially then youve got to figure out somewhere else to go " chris van pelt originally from iowa is someone who moved there with a job while living in san diego the year old was recruited by a friend to come north and work at a search engine start up called powerset the software engineer never had a dream to live in the
