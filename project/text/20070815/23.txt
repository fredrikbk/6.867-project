business why google inspires diverging case studies what a run for google inc in its first nine years it has built the dominant internet search engine redefined advertising world wide and jolted dozens of old media companies when microsoft corp was this age it hadnt yet gone public by contrast google already boasts a &# billion market capitalization now for the hard call is google rewriting the rules of good management from top to bottom in ways that every executive ought to study or is it just enjoying the rewards of a single well timed breakthrough whose success cant camouflage the typical headaches and missteps of a fast growing young company expect that debate to be thrashed out in grand style over the next few months two high profile thinkers management consultant gary hamel and harvard business school associate prof thomas eisenmann have been scrutinizing google their perspectives differ sharply in "the future of management " a book due to be published this autumn mr hamel argues that googles innovations go beyond the fine points of search engine algorithms extending into big enduring aspects of general management the mountain view calif company is packed with intriguing distinctive ways of running itself he says these include radical decentralization small self managing teams a just try it approach to rolling out new products before they are fully finished and a willingness to let engineers spend sizable chunks of time on offbeat projects put it together mr hamel contends and google is committed to building a company that can evolve as fast as the web that is crucial in todays turbulent business climate old ways stop working powerful new rivals pop up in the most unexpected places many well established companies even renowned ones thrash helplessly as traditional strategies lose their potency such arguments come naturally to mr hamel who has built his consulting career on urging companies to take a fresh look at innovation he is a visiting professor at the london school of business he also is a well known author or co author of previous strategy books including s "competing for the future " we dont know for sure that google can keep adapting mr hamel acknowledges and its a mystery which of its many quirky habits matter most google after all is famous in silicon valley for lavish employee perks which include top flight chefs in the cafeteria and free massages for stressed out engineers those treats might help loyalty and inventiveness they might simply indicate how easy it is to spend wildly during boom times still mr hamel sees many signs google is on the right track look at its rapid entry into new markets such as photo file management mapping and news aggregation he argues even if only a few of those ventures pan out the winners gains will greatly outweigh the relatively trivial costs of the failures not so fast retorts prof eisenmann he has written one of harvards most popular business school cases examining what googles next big move should be as much as he admires googles accomplishments to date he warns "theres a potential mismatch between where they could go with their strategy and where they want to go with their management approach " the problem prof eisenmann explains is that googles biggest opportunities exist in huge markets such as desktop office applications electronic commerce or "middleware" that could take the place of microsoft windows conquering such markets he believes will require lots of old fashioned leadership from the top and a disciplined hierarchy to carry out big tasks right now he says google just isnt set up to master such situations googles freewheeling culture can create lots of interesting little ideas he observes but that is no guarantee they can be developed into massive revenue generators in fact with googles world wide head count now topping its small autonomous teams may start bumping into one another as they try to push their projects to prominence whatever google executives think about this debate they are largely keeping mum "were happy to have folks do case studies on their own " says google spokeswoman sunny gettinger "but we focus on our core business and generally dont actively participate in them or seek them out likewise we dont monitor the results closely " history suggests that it is perilous to seek long lasting inspiration from young companies when they are riding high in the early s experts lauded people express for developing an upbeat winning approach to employee relations unfortunately that couldnt protect the airline from financial troubles and an eventual sale of the company on distressed terms in the late s dell inc was championed as a trailblazer in web based sales and marketing car companies studied dell hoping to graft its magic into their operations today dells growth is stalled while the company remains a formidable player in the computer industry it no longer is seen as miles ahead of its competitors even mr hamel concedes he is stepping into dangerous territory "success is a very complex thing " he said in an interview last week "its extraordinarily difficult to tease out the factors that make it happen "
