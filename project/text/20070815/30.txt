credit tremors crop up in cash funds turmoil in the credit markets is spreading to one of the most conservative kinds of investments causing a small money management firm to freeze its clients assets that move sent tremors through stocks as well as commodities until now one of the few markets relatively untouched by recent worries yesterday sentinel management group inc citing "panic" conditions in the market prevented its clients from withdrawing money from their cash accounts sentinel manages money for hedge funds and commodities traders in what are loosely akin to money market accounts short term investment vehicles that are supposed to behave something like a bank account sentinel said in a letter to clients dated monday that an inability to easily buy and sell securities in the credit markets was making it tough to price its holdings "we are concerned that we cannot meet redemption requests without selling securities at deep discounts to their fair value and therefore causing unnecessary losses to our clients " the letter said sentinel didnt respond to requests for comment it is the latest sign that the bond market turmoil is hurting even investments considered among the most conservative places to temporarily park cash buyers for some debt instruments particularly in asset backed securities and some subprime securities have dried up in recent weeks a general lack of liquidity such as this in global markets is what prompted central banks in the u s and elsewhere in recent days to open up emergency lending windows to help investors that suddenly found themselves squeezed by a shortage of cash the illiquidity is also hurting a handful of institutional funds and mutual funds that are marketed as "enhanced" money market products or funds that are slightly riskier than regular money market funds and aim for higher yields for instance state street global advisors limited duration bond fund a &# billion fund catering to institutional investors fell for the month of july one of state streets mutual fund offerings the ssga yield plus fund is down for the three months and since the start of the year through monday according to morningstar inc both products hold asset backed securities including subprime mortgage securities a spokeswoman for the company a unit of state street corp said "market driven events occur from time to time such as the current liquidity constraints that can affect segments of our investment portfolios and we actively address these events working closely with our clients " sentinel manages about &# billion according to cme group inc parent of the chicago mercantile exchange it invests clients short term cash holdings in a myriad of securities ranging from u s government bonds to short term bank time deposits firms such as sentinel play an important role in the commodities markets it is one of a few niche providers of short term cash management services for clients in the commodities futures trading business it took in clients that included so called futures clearing firms which are institutions that execute a clients trades on an exchange and stand behind the clients obligations clearing brokers give futures traders confidence that they will be paid if they are owed money when a contract expires the chicago mercantile exchange confirmed that some of its clearing firms were sentinel clients sentinels clients also include a variety of firms that manage pooled commodities funds for investors jeffrey d barclay a partner at schuyler roche &amp zwirner who specializes in regulatory issues in the commodity futures industry said that some of his clients invested money with sentinel and arent able to get it out in commodities traders and their clearing firms need to keep a large amount of cash on hand traders can make wagers by putting up only a small amount say of the value of a trade but they have to be prepared to cough up much more cash if their bets go the wrong way their clearing firms demand cash collateral known as "margin " that changes daily based on the changing value of their position sentinel managed some of that cash for clearing firms and commodities traders if commodity traders or clearing firms need cash that sentinel is unwilling to give over they could be forced to liquidate other investments to raise cash yesterday the chicago mercantile exchange said all the clearing firms registered with its exchange were in good financial standing the liquidity problems affecting sentinel have also caused pain at some mutual funds as well as funds that cater to institutional investors these so called enhanced cash funds also known as "ultra short" or "yield plus" funds have about &# billion in assets including investment from governments institutions and mutual funds according to research firm imoneynet inc still thats only about a third of the total assets invested in traditional money market funds unlike basic money market funds they dont aim to maintain a &# net asset value but some say in their prospectuses that "preservation of capital" is one of the stated goals "i cant recall a time when you saw losses like this in the ultra short category " says russel kinnel director of fund research at morningstar these products usually have the ability to steer into varied securities such as mortgage backed securities and other asset backed securities among other similiar funds that have been hurt the fidelity ultra short bond fund which is down about in the one month and year to date through monday and the dreyfus premier yield advantage fund which is down for the one month and since the start of the year a fidelity spokeswoman said several factors have affected the funds recent performance including its subprime mortgage securities which are very highly rated and other fixed income securities about of the dreyfus fund is invested in subprime securities of which are a rated or higher a spokeswoman said it is "not a money market fund" and "we expect that the value of the investment may fluctuate " the fischer francis trees &amp watts u s short term fund which caters to institutional investors is down around for the one month ended monday and for the last three months according to morningstar data according to sec filings the fund had about of its assets in asset backed securities as of march and in subprime mortgage loans a company official says the funds holdings are primarily rated triple a and double a and they have no credit problems they are being hurt in the short term
