yahoo banks on smartads to lift display business in the middle of yahoo inc s plan to reinvigorate its big sluggish display advertising business lies a new breed of diminutive chameleon like advertisements the ads which the internet giant began offering to travel industry advertisers a month ago change colors images and messages in response to what yahoo knows about the web surfer viewing them a woman in new york who researched plane tickets to miami on yahoo travel could be shown two days later an airline ad in a feminine hue including a fare quote for flights there dubbed smartads the ad type could help make yahoos display inventory more competitive and lucrative that is because targeted ads are more effective at engaging consumers and therefore more attractive and valuable to advertisers if smartads are a success yahoo could also use them to bolster two other display ad initiatives the right media ad exchange it recently acquired and a budding business providing display ads to partner sites such as ebay inc "people love it " said david karnstedt head of north american ad sales at yahoo of advertisers who have tried it "we will extend it everywhere we can " the sunnyvale calif internet company is under increasing pressure to reaccelerate growth in its business selling ads that make heavy use of graphics such as banners yahoos display ad revenue rose year over year to about &# million in the june quarter according to jefferies &amp co analyst youssef squali significantly slower than the first quarters rate the business accounted for more than a third of yahoos june quarter revenue of &# billion excluding commissions paid to publisher partners the display business typically an area of strength for yahoo has become more challenging amid rising competition from social networking sites for nonpremium ad dollars pressure seems poised to worsen as google inc and microsoft corp move further into the display arena with both making threatening acquisitions recently the display slowdown has become a new source of angst for investors concerned about the performance of yahoos search ad business and recent changes in senior management the worries deepened when yahoo reduced its financial targets last month ruined any chance of a near term share price recovery that might have come from early signs of search improvement and the fresh air of a new chief executive yahoos stock has sunk from its week high in early may and is down since the start of the year investors see little hope of improvement during the third quarters summertime doldrums no one tool or initiative will turn things around for yahoos display business and it is too early to know how successful smartads will be marketers said their targeting capabilities are exciting but that adoption will be limited if the technology behind the ads doesnt handle large volumes of ads well or is difficult to use there also is a danger consumer online privacy concerns could derail them since yahoo makes heavy use of data about its visitors to target ads including information users supply during registration location data from their computers and insights into their interests gleaned from their online "behavior " such as where they have gone within yahoo and their keyword search history yahoo said its display strategy doesnt rest on smartads and involves several initiatives however it also clearly believes the ad type represents a breakthrough and proof it isnt as innovation challenged as it is often portrayed by analysts and the press it claims the technology is easy to use and that the company is balancing user privacy and ad relevance appropriately using smartads advertisers provide yahoo with sets of backgrounds images and text that can be mixed and matched on the fly to create an all but unlimited number of different ads the approach combines technologies yahoo developed itself with others it acquired bringing together this creative zip with the ability to target users based on interest and location brings to display advertising the flexibility and direct response qualities that have fueled the boom in search advertising yahoo hopes smartads will help it gain ground in the rapidly expanding market for behaviorally targeted ads which is expected to jump to &# billion in the u s in from &# million this year according to emarketer "this is kind of combining the best of search and the best of display together " said david kenny chief executive of digital advertising company digitas inc a unit of publicis groupe sa "people want display that can work like this " he and other marketers said yahoo competitors are working on similar ad concepts but that yahoo has an edge because of the rich data it has about its users "my sense is that it probably is a pretty good competitive advantage and it definitely gains share of ad dollars " likely from typical media mr kenny said in early tests yahoo ran to promote farechase its own air travel search engine consumers clicked on smartads two to three times more often than on typical display ads the company said an increase in ad efficiency typically yields an approximately equal increase in the price an advertiser is willing to pay said kevin lee executive chairman of search marketing firm did it com llc yahoo declined to estimate how much rates might rise but said it does expect a financial benefit "the person that drives the most effectiveness for the advertiser is going to get more budget " said todd teresi yahoo senior vice president of display marketplaces showing consumers ads that are relevant to them and documenting improved results has become a core task of the online advertising industry the launch of smartads "proves that yahoo is thinking about innovation it proves that relevance is going to be a foundational element " mr lee said "its pretty safe to say they will create more value for advertisers and yahoo " yahoo said it could show smartads across its sites including on premium pages like the home page marketers said they could be particularly important as a way for yahoo to increase the value of its nonpremium ad space that is because these ads will no longer be shots in the dark on an email page yahoo can deliver a prius ad with local dealer information to a man in san francisco who was earlier researching hybrid cars yahoo said smartads could make the inventory it sells on the right media ad exchange more valuable moreover right media could offer smartads as an added value service such moves could lift advertiser interest and participation in the exchange an open marketplace that pairs advertisers with publishers which could help it cement a leadership position exchange before competition heats google has agreed to acquire display ad serving company doubleclick inc which has said it plans to build an ad exchange microsoft said in late july it would buy adecn inc if ebays experience in the auction arena is any guide yahoo could build a barrier to entry if it quickly establishes right media as the biggest best marketplace for advertisers and publishers to find each other smartads if they prove more lucrative could become a benefit to web publishers that link up with yahoo driving more publishers to join yahoos nascent display ad network yahoo currently has deals to provide display ads to ebay a consortium of newspaper companies comcast corp and at&amp t inc with whom it shares ad revenue
