the mossberg solution the new ilife we test upgrade of apple suite apple inc last week introduced a redesign of its elegant imac desktop computer the machine that packs a powerful beautiful consumer pc into the back of a generously large bright screen the new models are even thinner than their slim predecessors sport an aluminum skin instead of white plastic and have a new flat keyboard more power and lower prices but apples bigger change was a major update to its ilife software suite which comes loaded on all its macintosh models not just the new imac and can be purchased by existing mac owners for &# the suite includes iphoto imovie idvd iweb and garageband programs that help average people organize edit share and publish photos videos and music these uncluttered and intuitive programs have been best of breed so apples decision to update ilife is intriguing if for nothing other than to see what major improvements could really be made this week i tested ilife on a new imac the midrange &# inch model with a gigahertz intel core duo processor and a gigabyte hard drive i focused especially on iphoto and imovie the anchors of the suite and the programs that got the biggest overhauls one significant change in iphoto is its new method of organizing photos by sorting images into "events" according to their dates rather than by the batch in which they were uploaded to your computer the imovie program underwent a more drastic overhaul adding a library for storing all of your video clips and a new interface for organizing those clips into a movie that dispenses with the traditional timeline design long used in digital video software both iphoto and imovie now use "skimming " a rich feature that lets you scan through photos or videos just by passing your cursor over a thumbnail and if you have an account on apples online mac service &# annually both programs offer effortless one click photo or video uploading to a "web gallery " where you can share your content videos can also be uploaded directly to youtube without a mac account before delving into the software a quick word about the new imac is in order its an improvement on an already stellar computer with beefed up specs there are four models from &# to &# in two screen sizes inches and inches the base inch model costs &# a price cut of &# from the prior inch model the base inch model now costs &# down &# from the old model of the same size the biggest adjustments for users will be the screen and keyboard which took me a few days to get used to the new imac comes with a glossy screen which makes colors pop but also reflects more background light than a traditional matte display the keyboard is radical looking its much flatter and sleeker than typical desktop pc keyboards i found it easier to type with but in an attempt to make it more like that of a laptop keyboard apple rearranged some built in key functions which was confusing at first if you hate it you can still use an older mac keyboard or any usb keyboard even those meant for windows computers for now the new imac offers only a wired keyboard a small wireless model is due in a few weeks i quickly picked up on how to use the new features in iphoto and imovie thanks to unintimidating self explanatory icons the events feature in iphoto might be a pain for users who are transferring numerous already organized albums from the previous version of iphoto into this one as not all albums will perfectly translate into events but its a great improvement over the old method and over windows photo programs ive tried for organizing newly shot photos the new version of iphoto will look familiar to anyone who used the older version its layout is the same with a list of your photo library on the far left and a large display area to the right of this list i uploaded a couple of albums at once and each was automatically sorted into its own event because the photos from each were associated with two different dates a few new features stand out at a glance when photos are grouped into events these are neatly marked with one large thumbnail image that is selected to represent the entire pile of photos by passing my cursor over this top thumbnail i skimmed through all of the images in that event in mere seconds a button labeled web gallery instantly uploads images to a mac account and a list of photos that are shared online appears in iphoto rather than deleting images that i didnt want in a particular event i selected the new hide icon which takes marked images away from view but notes the number of hidden photos at the top of the event as a reminder hidden photos can also appear within the event denoted with red x marks double clicking on any image now magnifies it without opening editing functions letting users quickly see larger versions of each shot editing in iphoto was already straightforward but new options provide more customization for example red eyes can be removed with a cross hairs like the old iphoto or by using a circle that manually adjusts to match a subjects pupil size the new version of imovie is deliberately designed to steer away from the familiar interface most consumer video editing programs use which was borrowed from professional grade software instead of the usual timeline of clips imovie employs a more free form canvas where clips and effects can be assembled apple knows that this may irk people used to the traditional method but believes it will make video editing much less intimidating for casual users to test imovie i used a high definition panasonic video camera to capture amusing moments around my office and brought it with me to boston for three days so i could document my sisters move into her new place the moving guys were thrilled in both places i turned the camera on and off numerous times capturing short clips my video camera was instantly recognized when i plugged it into the imac prompting imovie to generate thumbnail images of each clip times when the camera was turned on or off were clearly marked and i chose the clips i wanted to import transferred content appeared in the new imovie library at the bottom half of a screen and i dragged and dropped clips to the top half of the screen to add them to a project clips can be selected by using your cursor to draw a yellow box around the whole clip or just a part of the clip that youd like to use skimming through content is helpful here as i moved my cursor from left to right through clips the audio and video played in the top right of the screen letting me see and hear footage so as to select exactly where to trim a clip after dragging various clips to the top half of the screen i added special features like music sound effects and title slides to my project these were all added the same way my clips were by dragging and dropping to put the right thing where it needed to go music from itunes can be used with videos or apple provides over different sound effects and tunes still photos can be incorporated into imovie using a "ken burns" effect panning across a still image to keep the videos pace moving along and any videos captured on a digital camera that were uploaded into iphoto can be retrieved and used from within imovie if footage is too dark it can be automatically or manually adjusted like images in iphoto in just about minutes i created a short movie that mashed together various clips from three days of moving i added titles to introduce the movie and transitions in between each clip that looked really polished i uploaded photos and videos to the mac web gallery checking off the privacy option passwords can be set to limit who sees the content other options to check include showing titles of photos enabling a feature that lets others upload images to my gallery via a set email address and letting other people download high resolution versions of my content in one step videos can also be uploaded to youtube com or transferred to your itunes library where they can be viewed on a pc or mac or moved over to an ipod or iphone the new programs in ilife are a pleasure to use and the new imac is a great way to experience them edited
