an olympian web war in china official internet sponsor plays hardball with rivals over beijing games ads hong kong a war is raging among chinese web sites over who will reap millions of dollars in online advertising revenue inside china during the olympics behind the battle is a debate over the role for a new kind of corporate player in the games the sponsor of internet content services in chinese web company sohu com inc outbid fierce competition to become the exclusive internet sponsor of the beijing games for an estimated &# million sohu bought the right to create the official web site for the beijing organizing committee and to use the beijing games logo of a runner in the companys marketing and earlier this year ad agencies say sohu started telling them that online ads from other sponsors that carry the beijing olympics logo can appear only on sohu com sohus olympic coup gives the company a leg up on its rivals which include chinas three most popular online destinations sina com netease com and tencent "the sponsorship for the beijing olympics is exclusive " says chen luming olympic project manager for sohu which is traded on the nasdaq stock market "of course this applies to online ads with the running man olympic logo " others contest some of sohus claims and the beijing committee hasnt clarified its stance on exclusivity with all its uncertainties the flap has advertisers in a quandary as they put finishing touches on their olympic plans "those issues are definitely of grave concern for all involved " says lawrence wan the china digital director of omnicom group media buying agency omd which is working for several partners including johnson &amp johnson general electric co and visa international advertisers are currently in the middle of planning for the olympics and "there is mass confusion about this " he adds sohus ad claim extends only to partners and sponsors of the beijing committee and not to international participants in the olympic partner top program who can use the olympic rings in ads around the world it also affects only web sites based in china including the localized versions of yahoo inc google inc and microsoft corp s msn because only the beijing committees sponsors are allowed to use the running man logo inside china still chinese internet ads are a valuable commodity the country is home to some million internet users according to chinas government a group second in size to that in the u s nielsen netratings estimates that advertisers spent &# million on online ads in the first half of this year based on published figures and that total is growing fast because the web offers a unique way to reach elite chinese with money to spend "we will see a big growth in online ad spending before during and after the olympics " says cao junbo vice director of shanghai based iresearch adding that the chinese portals are also likely to increase prices around the event several beijing partners and sponsors who could be affected by the flap have been loath to comment adidas ag johnson &amp johnson and china mobile ltd didnt answer questions a spokeswoman for united parcel service inc said that "because of the sensitivity of the issue and our status as a sponsor we prefer not to comment " the worlds biggest media event has long struggled to adapt to an increasingly online world tv has been the biggest stumbling block because the ioc makes most of its money by selling rights to broadcast the games until the games all video and audio transmissions of the competitions were banned from web sites even after the events were over more recently the ioc has bundled internet and mobile broadcasts with tv rights or since in some markets even sold them separately general electrics nbc has both rights in the u s and its video content isnt supposed to be viewed in other countries an nbc spokesman says the networks use of the internet was "very minimal" during the games in salt lake city more extensive in athens in and very extensive in turin in "which included the first time we streamed an event live the gold medal hockey game " in march the ioc began a tender for internet and mobile rights in china but hasnt yet announced a winner now even text and image internet content is becoming a contentious issue until the games the official web site was created by top information technology partner international business machines corp which negotiated separate contracts with the hosts of the and games to build the olympics web site in however ibm parted ways with the international olympics committee partly over a disagreement about being the internet sponsor since ibm didnt have an internet content business it hadnt ever made special claims over online ads aside from keeping away ads from direct competitors today the web remains a largely unexplored medium for the olympics says fred steinberg a professor at the new york laboratory institute of merchandising who has also served as a consultant to olympic sponsors such as ibm "as media merge i could well see the internet category melded into the broadcast category after current broadcast and games city contracts are completed " he says complicating matters further in china sohu is also saying that its role in creating the official beijing games web site will give it special access to cover the events on its site although the beijing organizing committee has promised that media coverage of its games will be "open " the chinese government doesnt recognize most journalists from web sites and they say they havent been offered ordinary accreditation to cover the games like newspapers and tv stations instead sohu is tapping a loophole through which the employees granted work licenses by the beijing committee to run the official web site inside olympics venues will also feed content to sohu com already sohu says it has a staff of working at beijings olympics headquarters if sohu can claim better access to information that can drive more traffic to the site and advertising dollars too sohu says that its role in preparing the official web site will give it an advantage in covering the games however a spokeswoman for the the international olympic committee says that "the olympic games are covered by a number of media outlets " being a partner of the beijing organizing committee she says "does not grant exclusive or special editorial rights to cover the beijing games " a spokesman for the beijing committee didnt reply to questions in chinas dog eat dog online world sohus competition isnt taking any of this sitting down in july several web sites launched an "olympic coverage alliance" which could eventually jointly create blogs news reports and email alerts about the games the alliance could also jointly sell ad space around that content splitting the revenue among them from an initial group of three web sites founding member sina com says the alliance now has members making up the vast majority of the market including tencent netease com inc msn china and yahoo china "sohu only got the right to run the official web site and except for that they have no other exclusive rights " says chen tong rival sina corp s executive vice president and chief editor sina which operates a heavily news driven site claims the alliance already has a team putting together content about the games yahoo china operator alibaba group confirms it is a member of the alliance but declined to answer further questions msn also declined to answer questions "we believe that our partnership strategy and vision will lead to the development of a very healthy and vibrant internet ecosystem " said msn in a statement one member which asked not to be identified said it would work with the alliance but was also willing to join together with sohu if there was an opportunity to do so sue feng in beijing contributed to this article
