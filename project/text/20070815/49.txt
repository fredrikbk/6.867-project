flight course in africa u n food agency leads air safety crusade after fatal crashes group took on mission to transform industry nairobi kenya africa accounts for less than of global air traffic but about of the worlds plane crashes flying is so dangerous that it even impaired the united nations world food programs efforts to deliver aid to suffering populations around the continent after a spate of crashes killed several wfp workers the agency five years ago ordered a broad review of safety conditions on its flights today the wfp is delivering more than food in africas most troubled countries by holding contractors to high standards on maintenance and flight operations it is helping to avoid accidents at the small carriers it hires for humanitarian flights the rigor wfp officials impose on their contractors is in turn feeding back to the national aviation regulators who oversee those operators as a result it is helping improve air safety across the continent "the wfp is lifting the bar for everyone " says njuguna mungai director of operations at kenyan commercial airline als ltd and a former official at the kenyan civil aviation authority making africas skies safer means more than saving lives in a continent already ravaged by war and disease air travel is the only transport option for people and goods across much of africa because roads rail networks and waterways dont exist in many places at the root of africas dismal air safety record are low investment crumbling infrastructure and lax national authorities across much of the continent there is minimal air traffic control or regulation and pilots often fly without basic navigational aids like radar national air authorities in many impoverished sub saharan states struggle to pay their bills retain good staff and meet the minimal air safety standards set by the u n s international civil aviation organization in some lawless regions almost anyone with an airplane can fly with no oversight in countries like sudan and congo unpaved airstrips often double as soccer fields where children mark goal posts with piles of rocks into which planes hurtle upon landing according to wfp safety officials "the air safety record in africa is worrisome " says harold demuren director of the nigerian civil aviation authority who is becoming a leading voice for air safety in africa according to airclaims ltd a london aviation consulting firm africa has suffered roughly six fatal accidents per million passenger and cargo flights since compared with under per million in north america where skies and airports are far more congested africas record is probably even worse than the data indicate because tallies dont include planes seating fewer than people the type of aircraft that comprise most of africas fleet national air regulators in much of sub saharan africa lack funds to track these small planes and their accident rates "around flights take off each day in africa nobody knows what they are or where they are going and people are dying " says cesar arroyo a former fighter pilot from peru who is spearheading the wfps air safety efforts the u n began thinking about air safety when its aid efforts in africa grew to unprecedented scope amid humanitarian crises in angola ethiopia and sudan in the s as the number of war victims and refugees needing shelter food and medicine surged u n agencies began chartering planes from across africa the former soviet union the middle east or wherever they were available around the world u n officials usually hired the lowest priced carriers often through brokers they generally knew little about the safety record or the quality of equipment and crews of the hired planes on many u n chartered flights crews received little training or oversight and planes flew overloaded pilots worked far longer than the hours per month that regulators world wide generally allow aviation officials say "pilots would think if i dont fly ill lose my job " says capt george kamau chief pilot at kenyan carrier east african safari air express who flew cargo in somalia during the s the dangers of such badly regulated flights gradually became clear in june a top u n official in angola and seven others were killed when their small plane crashed in the ivory coast due to pilot errors according to south african investigators months later when mr arroyo was running wfp aid flights in angola which was in the grips of civil war a peacekeeping plane was shot down minutes after unloading a shipment of food the people onboard died because the pilot ignored regulations eight days later another u n cargo plane also crashed because again the pilot broke standard safety rules killing another nine people "i was devastated " mr arroyo recalled recently in an interview at nairobis wilson airport "but it also showed me that you need to teach safety through harsh and unfriendly decisions " mr arroyos bosses soon also realized that the u n couldnt continue ignoring the hazards facing its workers months after the angola crashes a u n chartered plane smashed into a mountain in kosovo in former yugoslavia killing u n top brass and aid workers then u n secretary general kofi annan immediately ordered an investigation into how the u n was conducting air operations around the world the result was an order issued in to tighten standards for airlines chartered by all u n agencies the wfp which has one of the u n s largest air operations and strong economic leverage got the job mr arroyo was appointed in to lead the new safety unit which officially began its work in mr arroyo brought with him both aviation and humanitarian aid experience while flying supersonic mirage fighter jets for the peruvian air force in the s he had also trained as a crash investigator and subsequently flew as a test pilot in brazil after joining the u n in mr arroyo spent four years with peacekeeping operations in western sahara and angola before running air operations there for the wfp the immediate goal of the new wfp unit was to set rigorous quality standards for contractors mr arroyos team first insisted that carriers the wfp regularly hired or might hire keep detailed maintenance records limit the hours pilots could fly and train staff regularly the chartered planes also had to carry advanced navigation and collision avoidance electronics to cut the risk of operating in dangerous places carriers that didnt comply with all the new requirements lost their contracts mr arroyos effort soon turned to helping carriers adopt the new safety measures through on the ground training and regular surveillance by regional wfp officers across africa conny akerstrom is mr arroyos deputy in nairobi a year old swede who had previously worked in afghanistan mr akerstroms task is to train and monitor airlines across east africa on a recent morning mr akerstrom checked the safety procedures of kenyan carrier als which is based at wilson airport the wfp and other aid organizations hire als for humanitarian flights and the carrier also has a regular commercial business high on mr akerstroms agenda maps and flight information in most countries crews fly with charts from jeppesen a subsidiary of boeing co that publishes the latest updates provided by aviation authorities but national air authorities in much of sub saharan africa lack the resources to map airspace and airfields in detail so pilots for decades have flown around much of the continent using road maps landmarks and memory the wfp has urged als and other carriers to create their own maps and charts informally known as "jungle jepps" using reports and measurements from pilots on the field in alss offices decorated with photos of george clooney and other celebrities the airline has taken on safaris mr akerstrom leafed through a binder to assess the airlines progress "do not overfly rwanda " reads one note on the airstrip chart for goma congo the chart for el berde somalia reads "airport is difficult to distinguish from surrounding area big birds over the town and around the field " many accidents happen across africa simply because planes arent properly repaired or readied for flight says mr akerstrom so another issue he stressed that morning was maintenance he surveyed alss hangar with nilesh somaia who has been alss safety officer since the airline created the post three years ago at the wfps behest the swede opened a long red case and pulled out a sophisticated torque wrench used to tighten bolts on landing gear and other critical points on a plane the wrench requires regular adjustment to remain precise "how do you know its properly calibrated " mr akerstrom asked a manager in the hangar who quickly flipped open a log book to show a certification document "how do you it refers to this tool " mr akerstrom continued looking for information linking the paper to the wrench in his hands the manager pointed to identical serial numbers and mr akerstrom nodded "you need to put labels on the tools " he instructed "were getting there " sighed mr somaia in much of the western world the requests made by mr arroyos team would have barely met air safety regulations but the wfp requirements were far more stringent than the rules set by most african civil aviation authorities much of the blame for africas aviation woes lies with a patchwork of national regulators who are meant to ensure safety but many lack the resources or political will to enforce global rules and often fail to cooperate over the years weak or corrupt aviation authorities in countries including sierra leone equatorial guinea and swaziland have imposed little oversight allowing scores of barely regulated airlines to sprout with insufficient funding the european union last year banned carriers from those three and two other african countries on the grounds their regulators didnt adhere to global safety rules "it is absolutely imperative that the wfp sets the standards because they cannot rely on the civil aviation authorities to do it in most of africa " says steve wybenga technical director at south africas executive turbine holdings an airline that works for the wfp another key element of the wfps current effort is no blame incident reporting aviation officials in the u s and europe latched onto this idea years ago when then realized that humans would always make mistakes so they developed systems for people in the industry to reveal glitches anonymously and report slip ups without fear of retribution that openness is one of the major reasons aviation has become much safer over recent decades it has allowed regulators to collect mountains of safety data from which they have extrapolated dangerous trends and identified hidden threats to aviation safety u s aviation regulators for example receive hundreds of safety reports each week but in africa this type of information rarely flowed when mr arroyos team started on their safety project in they collected only around reports about unusual incidents accidents and crashes from carriers and national authorities across the continent they knew the number was far higher "the culture before was too punitive if you found a problem with a superior it was seen as insubordination " says harry ikumi the quality assurance manager at east african safari air express and a former kenyan civil aviation authority official a spokesman for the kenyan caa says the agency is now lifting its own standards and those for operators and supports all efforts to improve safety the reporting efforts by als and other airlines have yielded results in the first nine months of mr akerstrom collected reports on significant incidents or accidents in kenya and five neighboring countries a notable improvement over wfp officials acknowledge that although data indicate improving safety serious safety breaches still occur over just the past year one plane in east africa crashed because it was overloaded according to recent report compiled by mr akerstrom on another flight the crew decided to land on an airfield even though a disabled plane blocked the runway another problem remains lack of funds as wfps safety requirements are expensive for most african airlines to implement sending mr somaia to a safety course in sweden for example was a financial burden for als the airline also had to take out a loan to buy new safety equipment still investing in safety does yield financial results "clients who have safety in mind will pay more " said als managing director aslam khan higher fares mean als can then invest more money in good equipment and safety benefiting both passengers and the airlines thats the cycle mr arroyo hopes to create across africa beyond wfp aid flights he says "we want to be a catalyst" for a better culture of aviation safety
