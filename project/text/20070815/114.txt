the man who changed sculpture richard serra sculpture forty years museum of modern art through sept new york ask people why they go to museums and they probably wont say "for the threat of bodily harm " yet on the surface at least that is just what the museum of modern art is offering this summer with its retrospective of minimalist sculptor richard serra the show is dominated by works consisting of sheets of steel weighing thousands of pounds each resting on one edge and tilted as if ready to topple over yet adults and children are happily milling around and through these daunting environments delighting in their expansive forms and the accompanying frisson of danger "richard serra sculpture forty years" is indeed an exhilarating event curated by kynaston mcshine the museums chief curator at large and comprising works dating from through the show brilliantly showcases the achievement of an artist who has not only expanded our idea of what sculpture can be but has made the often hermetic language of abstract art speak to the widest possible audience mr serra came of age in the mid s when reacting to the lofty emotionalism of abstract expressionism and the paris hilton frippery of pop younger artists stripped art down to something more rigorous elemental and "real " this new ethos is most clearly visible in his first really mature work the group of "prop pieces" from the late s assemblages of flat and rolled up sheets of lead they differ in one crucial respect from previous metal sculpture earlier artists had welded their disparate parts together but mr serra relied on gravity his sculptures held together only by the weight of each element counterbalanced against the others "house of cards one ton prop" for example consists of four sheets of lead each four feet by four feet and weighing pounds standing on edge and leaning against one another like the playing cards of the title to form a cube this simple technical change might seem merely a minor "look ma no hands" act of artistic bragadoccio but it had a transforming effect on the language of art in the past sculptors had bent their materials to their artistic will making stone look like flesh for example or steel appear feather light mr serra reversed that allowing his materials in particular their weight to tell him what he could do and thus to determine the final form of the artwork even that change might have been of only parochial interest were it not for the way it altered the relationship between artwork and audience into something more immediate intense and even fraught than ever before each sculpture is the protagonist in a drama in which we become willing if wary participants poised in precarious balance suggesting imminent collapse mr serras "prop pieces" charge the space around them with a powerful aura of danger that is as integral to their meaning as it is inescapable to the viewer reminded at every turn by the threats it poses to your physical safety you dont so much look at this sculpture as feel it so its a pity that liability concerns have forced moma to surround several of these "prop pieces" with a protective barrier not only does it sever that unique and vital bond between artwork and viewer it turns the sculptures into precious objects to be admired from afar just the kind of art experience mr serra was trying to get away from mr serra soon upped the ante with sculptures large enough to absorb the viewer "delineator" invites the visitor to walk between two by feet steel plates one on the floor and the other attached to the ceiling and in "circuit" four equally large plates standing on their long edges project from the corners of a room leaving just enough space in the middle for a standing person what begins as an inviting experience the broad flat planes funnel you into the room culminates at the center into a psychologially oppressive even threatening one you feel pinned and isolated the four pieces of steel pointing at you like the rifles in a firing squad had mr serra continued in this vein he would have been remembered as an important though narrow gauge artist but an encounter in the early s with the dynamic interiors of baroque architect francesco borromini in rome prodded him to up the ante yet again moving now to architectural scale mr serra began working with steel plates that tower over the viewer curving and twisting the plates so that when they were stood on edge singly or in combination they formed environments the viewer was invited to enter there are five such sculptures at moma they range from the relatively simple "torqued ellipse iv" which resembles a giants starched collar to the dizzyingly complex "sequence" a by feet steel maze they are extraordinary sculptures massive commanding presences that shift and change shape as you walk around them yet while as with his previous work their forms are determined by the weight of the steel and what it would allow him to do they seem weightless so many billowing ribbons of steel matisse cut outs writ large but they are also more than that they convey through the sculptors vocabulary of manipulated mass volume surface and contour the experience of architecture we enter and move through spaces some enclosed like the interior of a building others like the one at the center of "intersection ii" more open like a piazza or garden and our experience takes place over time this being mr serra however they are not neutral environments the steel walls twist turn and undulate while the spaces inside swell one moment only to shrink to almost nothing in the next the sculptures instill a range of emotions tranquility exhilaration unease an intense claustrophobia sometimes all in the same work clearly mr serra intends his audience as much as steel to be as putty in his hands for the layman to make sense of "house of cards" and other works from the early part of mr serras career it helps to have some background knowledge what otherwise is one to make of four lead plates leaning against each other the same isnt true of the sculpture of the last decade which one reacts to instinctively viscerally mr serra has taken a private language and made it universal mr gibson is the journals leisure &amp arts features editor
