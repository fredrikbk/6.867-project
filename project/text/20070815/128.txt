when buyers snub sellers valuing debt holdings turns tricky as funds struggle to find market the seizing up of some debt markets because of the subprime mortgage shakeout has left some investment funds wondering how to value their holdings last week frances bnp paribas sa said it would stop the flow of money into and out of three of its investment funds because it couldnt "fairly" value securities in the funds that the bank said made it impossible to come up with a net asset value for the funds that would allow investors to get in or out when the bank for example recently tried to sell about &# million of bonds backed by u s mortgages it couldnt find any buyers among the brokers it called "some of them werent even answering the phone " says alain papiasse head of bnps asset management and services division similarly frustrated with shaky market prices last month french insurer axa sa opened its wallet to cash out investors of two funds rather than sell securities at fire sale prices the oft repeated problem is that the funds and even some companies cant get prices for many debt securities and derivatives with direct or indirect links to loans made to homeowners with spotty credit histories given that they ask how are they supposed to mark holdings to market when there is no market typically to "mark" or estimate the value of a holding funds use market prices quotes from broker dealers values tallied by third party pricing services internal models or some combination of all four sometimes funds will block redemptions of their securities in an effort to prevent having to sell into a market that they think is below reasonable values still funds have an obligation to estimate the value of their holdings to reflect market realities but without a market doing so can get tough especially when markets take a dive how to do so is open to debate and in some cases the methods may be pretty unpalatable for managers dealing with the turmoil now gripping markets one answer is that everything has a price if it is low enough that is tough for many managers to swallow if they think the long term value of a holding isnt impaired trading at such a price is also a difficult prospect if a manager wants to avoid selling into a distressed market the key point with bnp for example was the use of the word "fairly " but if there are no buyers to be found there may be an even worse alternative "then the price is zero " says jack ciesielski editor of the analysts accounting observer newsletter "if theres a bid out there then theres a price take your pick " marking holdings to zero would be an extreme move bnps mr papiasse says the problem was that there simply was no market or price for the assets others are sympathetic to managers plight "you need securities to trade before you can price them " says michael youngblood portfolio manager and managing director of fixed income research at fbr investment management of arlington va the market for existing bonds lacks transparency and so isnt helping set prices and "with the primary market frozen we have no effective reference for determining value " he says that logic is rarely cited when markets are soaring fund managers didnt complain that they were marking the value of their assets too high mr ciesielski the newsletter editor says to see how funds have marked down their holdings consider regions morgan keegan select high income fund a high yield mutual fund run by birmingham ala based regions financial corp it invested &# million in one bond based on a series of mortgage backed securities issued in called terwin mortgage trust by the end of march the fund listed the bonds value as &# million according to its most recent portfolio report to regulators valuations for this and the funds other mortgage backed bonds have likely fallen since its most recent filing due to the turmoil the funds shares are down nearly over the past month compared with a loss for its average peer says morningstar inc yesterday in a securities and exchange commission filing the fund said the market instability had made it difficult to obtain realistic values for the funds securities from brokers and that it had hired a consultant to assist in evaluations the fund said many of its securities may be difficult to sell at a fair price to pay for redemptions from the fund a spokeswoman said the morgan keegan fund manager wasnt available to comment first trust advisors lp a lisle ill fund manager lists a mortgage backed bond issued in called soundview home equity loan trust in its first trust strategic high income fund on a portfolio report filed last month the fund invested &# million in the bond in according to past filings it marked the value of its investment at less than &# million at the end of april according to a first trust securities filing in july a first trust spokeswoman declined to comment complicating valuations a mortgage backed security can be backed by thousands of home loans to come up with a price for a given holding investors often look at prices for similar bonds or they simply pick a price in the middle of a wider than usual gap between offers to buy and sell for instance the value of new subprime securities coming onto the market plummeted in july to &# billion from &# billion in june according to fbr the monthly average is &# billion trading volumes for existing bonds are down too given such conditions some managers like bnp argue that they cant sell on the cheap because they cant put a rational value on their bonds they have a point says stephen ryan an accounting professor at new york university "the whole idea of fair value is the price you could expect to receive in a nonforced transaction " he says but if there is a market price even a distressed one funds should be looking to that he adds
