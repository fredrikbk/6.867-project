cost control for dummies reducing health care spending isnt hard just give the government control over the national health care budget and youll see spending decline access to physicians and hospitals the newest technology important therapies and the best medications will also decline over time but thats the trade off society makes when the government controls health care spending its remarkable how gullible people are who claim "canada or england or france etc manages to provide universal coverage for much less than the u s spends on health care " they seem to think these other countries have reached some sort of economic nirvana these countries spend less usually between to of gdp versus nearly in the u s simply because health care spending isnt a function of consumer demand its a function of political demand politicians in single payer countries where the public pays higher taxes and the government pays most bills decide how much the country will spend on health care and the prices that will be paid since they have to consider education welfare defense etc as well as the need to keep taxes low enough to encourage economic growth there is never enough money to go around there is not one government run health care system that is considered adequately funded by those who have to deal with it in some countries the rationing lack of access and waiting lines are worse than others but they all face these problems and virtually any u s reform proposal promising "universal coverage" will do the same thing why because congress has a long and sordid history of support for health care price controls medicare reimbursements to hospitals have been price controlled since and to physicians since if medicare represented or of the health care market as the va does with respect to prescription drugs price controls would create distortions but they would likely be manageable however medicare is the dominant insurer in the country its price controls become the benchmark whenever the government controls prices it arbitrarily determines who it will pay how much and for what vendors that is providers of goods and services generally begin to work the system in order to maximize their gain or more accurately when referring to doctors in medicare minimize their losses when medicare distorts a price and virtually all government set prices are distorted the reverberations are felt throughout the health care system consider physician reimbursements every year doctors face a cut in medicare reimbursements even though their costs for providing care continue to rise the american medical associations lobbying effort has managed to keep current reimbursements about the same as they were in in part by backing the medicare modernization act in thats six years without an increase and unless congress acts doctors face a cut in reimbursements in and a cut by at this point we dont know where doctors medicare reimbursements will land that issue has become a political football in the battle over reauthorization of the state childrens health insurance program schip democrats are dangling a slight increase in reimbursements instead of that cut in exchange for the amas support for their massive expansion of schip however democrats also want to cut reimbursements to health plans operating in the quickly growing medicare advantage program and they are trying once again to give the federal government the ability to dictate prices which they inaccurately describe as a "negotiation" for prescription drugs all of this is being done in the name of "controlling costs " but does anyone really believe those price controls wont hurt access to quality care increasingly doctors are refusing to see new medicare patients a recent ama survey found that of responding doctors said they would stop accepting new medicare patients if the cut is imposed even if that figure is inflated by currently angry doctors it could represent a significant decrease in seniors access to care the situation is worse under medicaid it reimburses even less than medicare which will lead to more and more access problems for the elderly and the poor it can also lead to doctors trying to see ever more patients in a given time period in order to keep the income from falling less time for each patient reduces the quality of care because politicians want to keep health care spending as low as possible they have very little incentive to raise those reimbursement rates much easier to rail against "greedy physicians" or use them as pawns when they want to pass other pieces of legislation you can expect even more political maneuvering if health care "reform" gives the government increased control over prices and spending either the market will set prices based on supply and demand or the government will set prices based on budget priorities and bureaucrats best guess at what specific goods and services should cost that process may undermine the access to and quality of care but at least government run health care advocates can claim it keeps costs down mr matthews is director of the council for affordable health insurance and a resident scholar with the
