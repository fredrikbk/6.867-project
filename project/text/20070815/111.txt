the daily fix columnists remember phil rizzuto a legend on diamond and in booth online edition phil rizzuto the scrappy new york yankees shortstop turned goofily iconic broadcaster died yesterday morning at bringing tributes from columnists who recalled both his on field skills and his loopy presence complete with "holy cow " huckleberries and ww for "wasnt watching" on yankees telecasts in the new york daily news bill madden has an excellent rizzuto primer covering the scooter from his underrated playing days to his one of a kind broadcasting career at foot and pounds mr rizzuto was a rather unlikely mvp and world series hero just as he was a rather unlikely play by play man but as bob klapisch writes in the bergen record "rizzutos legacy was about beating the odds after a tryout with the brooklyn dodgers then manager casey stengel told rizzuto to get a shoeshine box he was too short to be a ballplayer after beginning his broadcasting career howard cosell told rizzuto hed never succeed he looked like george burns and sounded like groucho marx and cooperstown sent its rejection notice too over four decades but in the veterans committee finally honored rizzuto putting a bright light on a fine career " "scooter had a way of personalizing the game that was so old fashioned and un hip it was impossible to dislike him " mr klapisch writes adding "holy cow who would dare say that on the air anymore but from rizzutos lips it was a measure of his honesty he was a broadcaster without a gimmick scooter didnt hide his affection for the yankees openly rooting for them nor did he make a secret of his desire to be home before the last out beating the traffic onto the george washington bridge by the ninth inning on his way home to hillside thing is scooter would tell viewers about it the next day it was part of the ongoing dialogue about his life that made yankee broadcasts as unpolished as they were irresistible " in the new york post mike vaccaro praises a human sized icon "most of our heroes are larger than life they do things so spectacular so sublime we can only marvel at them sinatra at a microphone a rod digging in a batters box de niro filling up a cinema screen tiger woods lofting a golf ball toward heaven we cannot relate to them or to any of the things they do we do not live in their world because that world is reserved for people with otherworldly gifts with extraordinary talent we can ponder we can wonder we cannot relate but we could always relate to phil rizzuto " in the newark star ledger jerry izenberg looks at the decades long friendship of mr rizzuto and yogi berra who along with joe dimaggio made the yankees the default rooting interest for generations of new york area italians "they won world championships and mvp awards " mr izenberg writes "yogi became one of the toughest outs in a lineup of tough outs and rizzuto became to the shortstop position what miles davis was to the trumpet they and their teams owned the summer they gave us golden nights to be young to be alive and to be a baseball fan " back to the daily news where mike lupica writes that "he was born in brooklyn and came out of richmond hill high and the sandlots of his city and dies as famous a baseball name as the city has ever produced there were better yankees than him some of the greatest ballplayers of them all never better company in this world he came out of the time when there werent this many baseball voices in the summer came out of a new york when people said you could walk down the street in brooklyn on a summer afternoon and hear red barbers voice before barber went with the yankees and not miss a pitch phil rizzuto was a character without trying to be one the way so many modern announcers do he was unforgettably and spectacularly himself " and from the daily news a collection out of about a million possibilities of rizzuto quips quotes and gaffes turned into laughs barry bonds the lord voldemort of baseball has prevailed in the end rapping the enchanted no and for the moment closing a complex tale that has held us too long and here in eastern daylight time at least way too late thats roger angell and thats all the fix needs to say does anyone want to win the nl central the milwaukee brewers hot start is long gone the chicago cubs erased bitter memories of their poor start with a hot stretch but have now gone cold again losing nine of actually one team might want to win the central the beat up left for dead world champion st louis cardinals who are still four games under but suddenly just games out of first "the cardinals postseason hopes were a virtual no chance at one point given all of the injuries infighting turmoil and tragedy " writes bernie miklasz in the st louis post dispatch "and perhaps all of this scar tissue will be to their benefit compared to the relatively easy rides of the brewers and cubs the cardinals have had to endure a brutal set of circumstances in from the death of josh hancock to chris carpenters elbow surgery to the trips to the disabled list to the players who push on while playing hurt to disappointing individual performances and the controversies no team has had to deal with more nasty stuff than the cardinals " and thats earned mr miklaszs respect "they had reasons to fold many times this season and didnt i admire their stubborn streak more than anything " this may be the most breathtakingly cynical column the fix has ever read the fixers are also pretty sure it will be proved correct its by the san francisco chronicles ray ratto and its about michael vick specifically mr vicks prospects for future employment which mr ratto thinks are a lot brighter than you might imagine "were all on the clock with vick seeking the answer to the complicated mathematical equation hc m ts " writes mr ratto "that is heinousness of crime minus marketability squared divided by time served and the answer to that is not infinity and rarely more than months in short we have confidence in vicks ability to do the perp walk and in sportsworlds ability to look the other way when circumstances require the seemingly irreparable damage caused by the details of his arrest and indictment will be minimized just enough to make him publicly serviceable again not because we value dogs less but because we value quarterbacks more " mr vicks return he writes "will be termed as our generosity of spirit of course and his willingness to see the error of his ways wrapped in the unbridled power of redemption because thats what makes the story sound better for everyone involved what it is though what it always has been is americas ability to hear a dollar bill fluttering in the breeze " football coaches are a paranoid lot in the lexington herald leader john clay begins with virginia techs frank beamer who recently intimated to a paper that the hokies surrendering a lead to georgia in last years chick fil a bowl was the fault of spies as mr clay writes mr beamer isnt alone in such imaginings "it goes with the territory " he writes "football isnt war its just treated that way inside information is protected like state secrets playbooks are regarded as nuclear codes injury reports are classified documents " mr clay closes on an entertaining note recalling the reaction of alabamas gene stallings to auburns pat dye deciding to ban the media from practices "im sure pat has a good reason but if you guys who come to our practices can tell me what were doing then ill hire you " tip of the fix cap to reader don hartline found a good column from
