local police faa tangle over unmanned aircraft local law enforcement officials should step up their efforts to overcome federal regulators reluctance to allow wider use of unmanned reconnaissance aircraft a florida police chief says donald shinnamon public safety director in holly hill fla said the federal aviation administration has stonewalled talks with police and fire departments seeking to add small drones to their resources these aircraft could provide invaluable scouting assistance during forest fires manhunts and searches for missing children he said in a speech to the association of unmanned vehicle systems internationals annual conference in washington recently the faa counters that its caution has been warranted before local law enforcement agencies can take to the skies en masse regulators need to ensure the drones are safe reliable and wont interfere with other aircraft said faa spokeswoman laura brown the faa would like to let firefighters and search crews use unmanned aircraft when needed and has begun to authorize flights on a case by case basis she said but an oregon rescue effort showed the risks when new kinds of aircraft take to the skies she said "in a recent search for missing hikers on mount hood conditions were extreme and out of of the uav unmanned aerial vehicle flights that they attempted to launch crashed " ms brown said the faa says it is working with state and local law enforcement groups to work out policies and procedures for the new aircraft similar efforts are under way at the federal level for example the faa and the air force have been working for months to resolve air traffic control issues for big global hawk surveillance drones at californias beale air force base small drones pose different problems these aircraft often hand launched fly less than feet off the ground military officials say the drones have been a big help in iraq and afghanistan but they also describe problems with midair collisions and airwaves crowded with conflicting data broadcasts police and rescue crews wouldnt have trouble adding a handful of small aircraft to their fleets argued mr shinnamon who leads an aviation committee for the international association of chiefs of police a pound drone seems unlikely to overpower other communications equipment or take up too much airspace he said particularly since most local law enforcement agencies cant afford to keep helicopters and surveillance planes on standby mr shinnamon said the faa regulates small drones more strictly than it does the surplus military helicopters already flown by state and local agencies he questions the faas jurisdiction and has also sought congressional assistance in breaking through what he sees as a bureaucratic logjam "i really think the issue with the faa is they dont have time to deal with this right now and they dont really understand public aircraft law " mr shinnamon said but the faa sees a different set of constraints the agency says it will stay focused on the safe introduction of unmanned aircraft to protect others in the skies and on the ground below "our approach to unmanned aircraft follows the philosophy of do no harm " ms brown said
