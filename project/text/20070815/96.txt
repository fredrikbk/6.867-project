politics &amp economics miners fate underscores safety overhaul failures the bleak outlook for six coal miners trapped underground in utah is exposing shortcomings in last years efforts to overhaul mine safety regulations including a delay in mandating better emergency two way communications technology that some companies argue isnt yet feasible the new regulations part of the miner act were adopted last year when coal miners were killed in a string of accidents including the sago mine disaster in west virginia that killed miners a key provision gave operators three years to install wireless two way communications which would need to penetrate through earth and layers of coal and better withstand fires or cave ins the time extension was allotted to develop and refine the wireless technology the utah mine operated by closely held murray energy corp of cleveland didnt have two way wireless communications devices robert murray company president chief executive and co owner of the mine said in an interview such devices "could have" helped in the rescue operation but added "theres absolutely no technology today that allows you to communicate with those trapped miners " safety advocates argue that existing technology being adopted by other mines might have benefited rescuers "theres current technology that could have been applied in this case " says davitt mcateer former chief of the federal mine safety &amp health administration under the clinton administration "what this potential disaster suggests is that we really need to redouble our efforts on communication " the incident is focusing attention on the adoption rate of such technology as well as the laws mandate jeffery kohler director of the office of mine safety and health at the national institute for occupational safety and health says a pure wireless technology faces major hurdles including power source and signal strength he said the group is "making significant progress" in technologies that combine a wireless system with cables some such systems are already available in june the house and senate both introduced supplemental legislation to the miner act that would require companies to adopt new communications technology such as a combined wireless cable system that is more readily available than a completely wireless system the legislation hasnt yet passed some companies have already adopted such devices mr murray said the utah mine has wireless communications technology that can transmit brief text messages to a device worn by miners but doesnt allow two way communication it hasnt been useful in locating the missing miners as of yesterday eight days after the accident the company had been forced to try to locate the miners who are feet below the surface by a slow process of drilling holes the first two attempts were drilled "by trial and error " targeting a location in the mine where the men had been working prior to a massive cave in mr murray said "now weve speculated where the men may have gone based on their training " industry officials acknowledge that some companies have been slow to adopt two way communications systems due to the expense and deadline "its tough to tell you as a businessman to go out and spend a lot of money on a device that you have to replace in a few years " says bill caylor president of the kentucky coal association meanwhile some big companies like consol energy inc in pittsburgh are moving to add new systems as quickly as they can it hopes to install a cable and wireless system by the end of the year in all its underground mines and decided to outfit all of its miners with radios following the deaths of two miners last year at another company when they became separated from their crew after an accident "there was no way to contact them and say youre going the wrong way " says consol energy spokesman thomas hoffman
