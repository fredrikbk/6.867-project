business world a backdating jury decides he didnt get the acquittal last week he was seeking but the backdating defense mounted by former brocade ceo greg reyes at least served the purposes of clarity his team settled on an argument that using so called "lookbacks" to create in the money options had been a routine open procedure at brocade innocently aimed at winning and keeping valued employees a story that seems to square with the facts his lawyers also said he left accounting to others and didnt understand the implications here a jurys guilty verdict points to a hole in his story and one that applies equally to apples steve jobs namely then why did he imagine his company had institutionalized the baroque artifice of "lookbacks" to obtain in the money option prices the answer youll never hear spoken in court or anywhere else we thought the then regnant accounting distinction between "in the money" and "at the money" options was stupid and in any case inconsequential at worst we figured we might one day be asked to restate our results to comply with somebodys strict interpretation of the rule we never dreamed in a million years anyone would make a federal criminal case out of backdating mr reyess other argument likely to be heard on appeal and at his sentencing hearing is that investors werent harmed because the markets view non cash stock option charges as immaterial again this fits the facts note were talking about the abstract "expense" assigned to newly issued options not the true cost of options compensation which is something investors must and do care about most of the major paydays that so infuriate the media beginning with disney ceo michael eisners &# million payday in were made with "at the money" options that were never required to be expensed yet these payouts had exactly the same cost to shareholders as if mr eisners gain had come from options that were "in the money" by some amount when issued for those with a taste for the tragedy of life mr reyess argument that option expense is immaterial to a companys share price while correct points to a poignant irony of the entire backdating scandal if "in the money" options were a useful tool then why not just issue "in the money" options and take the expense and rely on the markets to see through it here we reach a question without which a historical verdict on backdating if not a legal one isnt complete and a related question given the immateriality of options expensing why did so many tech companies fight tooth and nail to oppose it for so long yes expensing would have meant tiresomely highlighting for analysts and investors the purely notional non cash nature of the charge but guess what thats exactly what thousands of companies now do as matter of routine since expensing became mandatory and the markets have digested the change without a hiccup it seems likely that during the bubble and its aftermath tech companies their investors and analysts were in consensual alignment on the undesirability of introducing confusion into quarterly reports by expensing some options and not others but theres also the fact that the then raging battle over whether options should be expensed was driven partly by a motive to demonize options rather than by the pros and cons of accounting logic recall the report by the conference boards commission on public trust and private enterprise consisting largely of companies with stagnant share prices and little options issuance bleating post enron that the failure to expense options had contributed to business scandals intel chairman andy grove himself a commission member issued a scathing dissent to the boards report tech companies rightly saw a political attack on their entrepreneurial culture not merely an accounting debate thats one of the unexamined threads of the backdating story in talking to the san jose mercury news mr reyes himself noted that expensing would have caused brocade to report a nominal &# million loss in rather than a &# million profit adding "we would never do this adopt expensing voluntarily " a final note brocade began correcting its options accounting and mr reyes stepped down in january more than a year before this newspapers big backdating investigation before the term "backdating" was even applied to the phenomenon and before various canards infiltrated the media the most egregious being that backdating led to "inflated" pay packages i e the categorical fallacy of presuming that the alternative was the same number of options at a less favorable price the sec had already launched a formal investigation of brocades option accounting its hard not to see the subsequent decision by a u s attorney to bring criminal charges as more a product of the sudden notoriety of the backdating phenomenon than by any unique facts in the brocade matter in any case executives at or so other companies must now look upon the reyes verdict as a potential harbinger of their own fate its too bad these miscreants cant all crowd into the courtroom at the same time letting a judge and jurors see just how much backdating was a matter of conforming to a widespread practice that had evolved out of two kinds of competitive necessity to attract and keep investors on the one hand and to attract and keep talent on the other no that doesnt mean contempt for accounting rules is justified but any historical verdict would be incomplete without also noting the role played by an incoherent and mischievous set of accounting rules see related letter "letters to the editor backdating is just another word for bad accounting" wsj aug
