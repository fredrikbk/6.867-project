mattel does damage control after new recall toy maker pledges to boost inspection at chinese plants sarge cars barbie affected mattel inc battled on two fronts to contain the fallout from a widening recall of toys moving to quickly revamp safety measures at chinese manufacturing plants even as it sought to protect the companys reputation among consumers and investors ahead of the holiday season with two big recalls in as many weeks the second was announced yesterday chief executive robert eckert filmed a video apology to parents that was distributed online "i cant change what has happened in the past but i can change how we work in the future " he said noting that he has four children of his own mattel also pledged to significantly increase the frequency of its paint inspections testing every batch delivered to every vendor in order to prevent lead paint from being used in its toys and it sought to assure wall street that its new quality control regime wont adversely affect holiday sales yet even as mattel tried to soothe various constituencies it warned that further recalls could be announced and the steps it has taken so far havent stopped some experts from questioning the fate of the mattel brand in the wake of the bad news "this could be the time that consumer perception begins to change in relation to mattel and barbie " said doug hart a partner at bdo seidmans retail and consumer products practice who follows toys mattels latest u s toy recall includes a quarter million "sarge" toy cars from the walt disney co movie "cars" that are believed to contain dangerous levels of lead paint four other items involving more than nine million toys sold over the last four years were also recalled primarily because they include millions of tiny magnets that can be deadly if swallowed the magnets were included in barbie batman doggie day care and polly pocket toy lines internationally nearly million toys are being recalled the company said yesterdays recalls follow a world wide recall aug of about million mattel toys believed to contain lead contamination including items featuring such popular characters as elmo and big bird an estimated of the toys were imported into the u s and a third of them found their way onto store shelves mattel is trying to combat the bad news by assuring parents that it understands what is at stake in his video posted on the mattel web site and yahoo yesterday mr eckert said that "absolutely nothing is more important than the safety and well being of our children " the company also purchased full page ads in the new york times and the wall street journal "parents want to know whats going on " mr eckert said in an interview yesterday "but no system is perfect " in contrast to the first recall mattel quickly identified both the manufacturer and the paint vendor involved in the sarge toy car recall the assurances left many consumers on edge partly because they followed a spate of recalls of chinese made products in recent months involving toothpaste tires and dog food in fact even as mr eckerts video was being circulated on the internet other clips emerged on youtube mocking the companys efforts in one video a man calling himself kevin nalts said that the recall involved "tickle me lead mo" a reference to mattels hit toy elmo the issue of high energy magnets introduced into toys in recent years after being used primarily in industrial settings has been particularly disquieting if eaten by an infant the tiny magnets can bond together in the stomach that is what happened to kenny sweet a redmond wash toddler who died in after swallowing several magnetic bearings in a building set produced for the magnetix brand of mega brands inc of montreal after they were ingested the magnets drew together ripping through the childs stomach tissue in the u s consumer product safety commission recalled about million building sets that had been sold for nearly three years at locations that included big name retailers like wal mart inc target inc and toys "r" us inc last october mega brands which had inherited the problem when it bought rose art industries inc agreed to an out of court settlement of &# million for families of young children harmed by the building sets among the settled cases were those of a four year old whose injuries required the removal of a portion of his intestine and a three year old who had undergone surgery to repair holes in his stomach intestine and colon the case of the toddler kenny was also settled so far investors havent punished mattel while the companys shares fell cents yesterday to &# in p m trading on the new york stock exchange mattel overall is down just since the first recall was reported mattel previously announced a &# million charge for second quarter earnings in conjunction with the first recall the second recall involving millions more toys is likely to hit the &# million mark for polly pocket alone said independent analyst chris byrne in china mattels recalls already seem to be having a ripple effect through the industry in response to the spate of safety scares ian anderson who oversees toy safety in the asia pacific for the swiss testing and quality control company sgs says that all of the major testing companies including his "are having more people coming to them to ask what can be done " but the fallout for toy makers like mattel could be somewhat muted even going into the holiday shopping season judging from the way the company has weathered similar recalls in the past "mattel has had its share of recalls but its also been very quick to take action " mr anderson says about million polly pocket dolls were recalled in november over concerns about potential intestinal perforation similar to those of yesterdays announcement but sales of the toy didnt fall says mr byrne and rather than abandoning a tarnished brand mattel was able to expand the polly pocket line a major lead recall announced earlier this summer has generated mixed results for rc corp of oak brook ill in june it recalled about million toys from its popular "thomas &amp friends wooden railway" product line but sales of the toys have actually increased recently according to jim silver the editor of toy wishes a consumer toy magazine published in new york after the recall was announced on june rc shares on the nasdaq held

shares of rc closed at &# yesterday hovering near the stocks low for the year of &# apiece for consumers concerns over chinese made products are likely to persist as it becomes increasingly evident that long supply chains can lead to continuing dangers "my daughter may have sucked on those toys you know kids " said arthur lin a mechanical engineer from fremont calif who bought four of the "thomas" items that were recalled this summer though mr lin said he will still buy toys this holiday season he added that he has developed a new awareness of the global toy business mattel said the manufacturer of the lead tainted sarge cars the chinese subcontractor early light says it subcontracted the painting of the cars to a nonauthorized supplier "consumers have no way of knowing what comes from where " said rachel weintraub the director of product safety at the consumer federation of america
