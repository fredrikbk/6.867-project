common sense despite the recent bumps nows not time to panic smartmoney its time for all of us to take a deep breath last week was one of the strangest if not the strangest that ive ever witnessed as an investor and at age ive seen a lot it wasnt just the sudden credit squeeze or that the federal reserve and european central bank had to inject liquidity it wasnt the panic that seemed to grip some investors it wasnt that volatility hit its highest levels in four years it wasnt that the dow jones industrial average lost points on thursday ive seen all of that and then some what made it so strange is that high quality stocks got hammered while risky low quality heavily shorted stocks gained with the mortgage market in turmoil youd think anything with exposure to the housing market would have been hard hit yet home builders were among the best performing stocks on thursday two mortgage real estate investment trusts on which i put out a midweek sell recommendation thornburg mortgage and newcastle investment also fared relatively well with newcastle gaining on thursday and thornburg falling only modestly since then both have dropped again as investors seem to have come to their senses no wonder the so called quantitative funds were hard hit since surely no one would program a computer to buy bad stocks and sell good ones i doubt that human directed funds that invest in both long and short positions fared much better the market has once again shown its amazing ability to defy probability by unleashing a scenario that all the experts and computer models said was so unlikely as to be all but impossible didnt anyone remember the collapse of long term capital management the equivalent of the year flood has struck again for now ill leave it to others to sort out just how and why this improbability happened as it did im sure its a ripe subject for a ph d thesis no doubt the rapid reduction of leverage and the collapse of risky credit markets forced many to sell their high quality assets to meet margin calls at the same time they had to buy low quality stocks to unwind short positions whatever the explanation the important thing is that this anomaly shouldnt have any long term effect on those of us who are fundamental long term investors in case you didnt notice during all the excitement stocks pretty much ended the week where they began it which is up for the year since peaking on july the standard &amp poors index was down a little more than through friday which doesnt even qualify as a correction let alone a bear market the nasdaq is still above my next buying target which is if you were fortunate enough to have spent the past few weeks in an isolated vacation spot cut off from all communication and returned to civilization today then youd surely be wondering what all the fuss was about i think fed chairman ben bernanke pretty much got it right in the feds calm reassuring statement of last week "financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses and the housing correction is ongoing nevertheless the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy " some traders were disappointed the fed didnt cut the target interest rate i find it reassuring the fed is telling us that theres nothing happening in the broad economy that calls for any shift in monetary policy despite whats going on in the rarefied precincts occupied by certain hedge fund and private equity managers im not saying the fed is infallible or that market turmoil is over on the contrary there are some serious misallocations of capital now being worked out in the markets and there will likely be another shoe to drop it has taken months for the subprime mortgage crisis to develop and its far from over private equity funding is being curtailed which is likely to ripple through the system in ways that will take considerable time to become clear now the quantitative hedge funds are being hard hit and its much too soon to know the extent of the losses or who will suffer them i would be especially wary of financial sector stocks even though many are starting to look like bargains none of this has shaken my fundamental long term optimism about the economy and the markets the collective rediscovery of risk that has taken place in the past few weeks while painful for some is healthy as are occasional corrections as individual investors we cant prevent turmoil all we can do is stay the course and take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
