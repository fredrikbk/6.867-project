business bookshelf employed and unhappy the three signs of a miserable job by patrick lencioni jossey bass pages &# brian bailey the wealthy retired ceo of a fitness equipment manufacturer decides on a whim to take a job as the weekend manager of a down and out pizza joint in lake tahoe nev after three months of experimenting he comes up with a recipe for improving employee morale that dramatically lifts performance and revenues at the restaurant then he tests out his theory on a flailing sporting goods retailer that he has been hired to turn around it works wonders there too improbable yes but thats ok its fiction specifically its the plot of "the three signs of a miserable job " the latest management fable from consultant and writer patrick lencioni mr lencioni is best known for his books on leadership and team building particularly "five dysfunctions of a team " he has said in interviews that his ideas often come from observing the behavior of big corporate clients like southwest airlines and at&amp t the inspiration for "the three signs of a miserable job" apparently came from watching glum workers at an airport fast food shop in "three signs " mr lencioni tackles the question of why so many people are unhappy at work the issue is a hot one in management consulting circles with many companies citing high employee turnover as one of their biggest problems firms from gallup consulting to towers perrin argue that higher worker motivation among other things improves productivity staff retention and ultimately business results but readers looking for hard core research and case studies on how to tweak say employee incentive plans wont find them in "three signs " instead mr lencioni takes readers on a thought experiment with the fictional mr bailey as guide how can i get the nine lackluster staffers of gene and joes italian restaurant to care about their jobs should i raise their wages do i need to start over with new workers the resulting story is entertaining easy to read and seems real enough to resonate with readers although it occasionally strains credulity the root cause of job dissatisfaction mr bailey decides is that the basic social needs of employees are not being met people dont go to work merely to perform a function or get paid mr bailey tells joe the owner of gene and joes they go to "get a sense of accomplishment self esteem sanity and community " workers are unhappy mr bailey decides if they feel that their bosses dont know or care who they are if they cant figure out why their job matters to others and if they have no way of measuring that effect of their work he calls these problems "anonymity " "irrelevance" and somewhat clunkily "immeasurability " all three can be fixed by applying the proper techniques of attentive management and mr bailey proceeds to do just that he gets to know his workers attending a soccer game that his dishwasher is playing in he tells staff members how much their colleagues and customers need them and he comes up with sometimes quirky ways of measuring work accomplishment such as asking the worker in charge of the drive in window to count the number of times he makes customers smile in a night mr lencioni takes full advantage of the freedom fiction gives him to test his theory he creates skeptics and cynics like a hard nosed investment banker and a surly employee and lets mr bailey struggle with them "its all about the money mister " growls owner joe when mr bailey explains that there is more to motivating employees than the size of their paychecks mr bailey acknowledges the importance of money but eventually wins joe over "im a friggin pizza delivery guy driving a chevy impala " argues one employee who resists the you make a difference message "this aint rocket science and it sure aint the center of my life " mr bailey fires him then there are the characters who feel that all the talk about how much they mean to others is too touchy feely for the workplace "there is way too much love in this room right now " jokes a cashier when hes told how important his check totaling skills are mr bailey laughs along with the cashier but doesnt back down mr lencioni it is true gives short shrift to working conditions that are commonly thought to boost job satisfaction such as autonomy a pleasant environment and opportunities for advancement but mr bailey notes that there are plenty of lawyers actors and professional athletes who enjoy exactly such conditions and still feel unhappy besides another lake tahoe restaurant with roughly the same working conditions as the one mr bailey is trying to turn around has happier employees clearly working conditions by themselves dont determine employee satisfaction of course the reader needs to remember that neither restaurant is real so mr lencioni can make everyone behave as he likes indeed his fable loses some of its persuasive power when it seems too neatly self serving its hard to believe for example that many real life workers would respond as readily as the staff of gene and joes to an appeal that their jobs are meaningful especially if theyre working under harsh conditions for low wages and its too convenient for the story that both mr baileys pizza joint and the mediocre sporting goods chain he takes over later experience rapid improvement in morale and results after his miserable job theories are applied the sporting goods example feels particularly unconvincing seemingly tacked onto the end of "three signs" to show how the theories might work at a bigger and more complex company whether mr lencionis recipe for curing workplace misery can work in real life is hard to say but he tells a fun tale and he offers a welcome reminder that there is more to work than the job you do ms dvorak is a journal reporter based in san francisco
