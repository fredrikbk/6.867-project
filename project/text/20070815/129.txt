why chinese firms are circling tiny transmeridian small deals viewed as a way to avoid political firestorm beijing in a time when big western oil and natural gas companies are spending billions of dollars on projects around the globe transmeridian exploration inc might escape notice the small houston oil company which trades on the american stock exchange last year posted &# million in revenue and has yet to show a profit but thanks to its holdings in oil rich and strategically important kazakhstan transmeridian is attracting attention from chinese energy companies chinas zhenhua oil whose parent company is an arms maker against which the u s has issued sanctions and cnooc ltd have signaled to chinas national development and reform commission their interest in bidding for transmeridian people familiar with the matter said it is unclear whether the interest will result in a bid transmeridian chief financial officer earl mcneil declined to comment chinas oil consumption is growing rapidly and stagnant domestic crude output has prompted its state oil companies to seek access to overseas reserves through acquisitions but beijings economic and political clout has intensified concerns in the west that the second largest energy consumer is using its state companies to lock in resources at the expense of the energy security of western countries cnooc withdrew its &# billion offer for californias unocal corp in after encountering a critical storm in u s congress clearing the way for a lower bid from chevron corp to win the auction in part as a response to that chinas oil companies have focused on smaller deals often with less prominent western companies that are less likely to draw political fire chinas citic group last year agreed to acquire the kazakh assets of canadas nations energy co for &# billion two years ago china national petroleum corp paid &# billion for petrokazakhstan a canadian oil company whose main asset was a field in kazakhstan this year cnpc the state owned parent of petrochina co bought rights to fields in canada with a view to exploring and developing the technically challenging oil sands there "transmeridians oil assets in kazakhstan are extremely interesting because there arent many oil assets available in the market at present thats why chinese companies are prepared to battle each other for them " said an official at one of the chinese companies weighing a bid that leaves them circling companies outside the oil patch establishment that often have shallow financial resources thinly traded shares or lack a track record in developing new resources transmeridian has a interest in caspineft which holds the license to the south alibek field in western kazakhstan the field had total proved reserves of million barrels of oil at the end of on its web site transmeridian valued the field at &# million but the company and the property face challenges transmeridian has been selling its oil at well below world market prices last year when light sweet crude was trading at roughly &# to &# a barrel the companys crude fetched an average price of about &# a barrel in its filings with the u s securities and exchange commission the company blamed its need to ship oil via rail or sell oil direct from the field and said it started to export oil via pipeline on better terms this year the company is also working under a significant amount of debt it has about &# million in long term debt due in according to its annual sec filing stemming mostly from privately sold debt that it says carries restrictions on whether it can sell assets or make other corporate moves another sec filing this month showed that transmeridian had a net working capital deficit of &# million at the end of june last year it reported a net loss of &# million its volatile shares have lost most of their value so far this year and at p m yesterday were trading at &# compared with a week high of &# reached aug it has a market capitalization of &# million its capital structure includes convertible preferred stock that could significantly add to shares outstanding despite the numbers speculation has swirled in asia where both china and india are looking for deals to add to oil reserves in july the chairman of indias oil &amp natural gas corp r s sharma declined to confirm media reports that its ongc videsh ltd unit was interested in transmeridian transmeridian effectively put itself up for sale in april when it announced a strategic review of its assets while retaining jefferies randall &amp dewey a unit of jefferies &amp co as its financial adviser jefferies declined to comment disclosing the decision to evaluate the companys strategic alternatives in april transmeridian president and chief executive lorrie olivier said it was because "the current market value of our common stock does not adequately reflect the value of the companys investment in the south alibek field " chinese interest is likely to be stimulated by strategic needs given the proximity of kazakhstan to china and the likelihood that a mile missing link in the central asian countrys pipeline network from kenkiyak to kumkol will be built so it can connect with an existing cross border crude pipeline to china chinas interest in kazakhstan has spurred a political response there in a time when oil rich nations are taking a greater say in the ownership and terms of developing reserves within their borders chinas recent deals there spurred the kazakh government to change the law to allow it to step into any deal concerning the transfer and sale of assets involved in mineral production with state oil company kazmunaigaz usually taking as much as of the assets it is unlikely that chinas oil companies would go head to head in bidding for transmeridian the national development and reform commission chinas economic planning agency discourages domestic companies from competing for foreign assets because it drives asset prices up and exposes the companies to the risk of overpaying transmeridian has said proposals for its acquisition are expected in early september zhenhua a state owned oil trader that already has some assets in kazakhstan lodged its interest with the ndrc before chinese rivals although the ndrc has asked it to work with its rivals to construct a bid consortium the people said zhenhua is an oil trader whose parent is state owned arms maker china north industries group co known as norinco a major supplier to the peoples liberation army of china norinco had sanctions imposed on it twice in by the u s government for allegedly selling missile technology to iran norinco says the sanctions are "unreasonable " renya peng in beijing and john m biers in houston contributed to
