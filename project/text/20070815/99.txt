politics &amp economics womens march into office slows pelosi clinton mark clear gains but numbers seem to be dwindling sen hillary rodham clinton could be elected president next year and rep nancy pelosi will likely retain her perch as speaker of the house but otherwise womens long steady march into public office could stall in and possibly even retreat women will surrender two of the nine governorships they now hold and face stiff competition over a third all three women up for re election in the senate can expect withering opposition including louisianas mary landrieu whose seat is considered the democrats most vulnerable the nonpartisan cook political report lists women among the most vulnerable house members including eight women who won office with less than of the vote in and although women hold a quarter of all seats in state legislatures "weve hit a plateau " says debbie walsh director of the center for american women and politics a public policy institute at new jerseys rutgers university the bottom line while women will cast about of the votes next november based on the past two presidential elections their share of elective offices seems to have leveled off at about one in six at the federal level and one in four in the state capitals the outlook for women isnt entirely gloomy niki tsongas widow of former democratic massachusetts sen paul tsongas has the apparent lead in one of the first races of the political cycle a sept primary to fill a vacant house seat democrats are pinning their hopes on women to fill the open governors seat in north carolina and take the senate seat in new hampshire from republican incumbent john sununu but even more seats have no female challengers and although it is fairly early for most candidates to announce their plans there is also little hint that many women are even thinking of a run moreover the issues likely to dominate the campaign iraq national security and immigration generally have worked against women candidates in the past "any issues that require toughness rather than compassion women candidates have trouble with " says democratic pollster celinda lake the main reason for the apparent slowdown women remain less likely to run for public office than men they first need to be recruited and assured of their qualifications research shows "women tend to run because theyre concerned about an issue they dont wake up thinking they want to be governor the way men do " says jeanne shaheen a former three term governor of new hampshire who is now the director of harvard universitys institute of politics women are also still less likely than men to enter highly competitive races and more likely to enter a race only if they know they will face a woman rather than a man says jennifer lawless a brown university political scientist her research also shows that when a woman does decide to run she is as likely to win office as a man the mixed outlook for contrasts with the increasingly pivotal role of women voters who outnumbered men voters by million in womens votes historically have trended democratic but the republican party aggressively targeted them with issues such as education in and homeland security in president bush failed to win a majority of womens votes in either of those elections but his share of their votes increased enough in to enable him to win the popular vote in female voters supplied the margin of victory in three senate races missouri montana and virginia where republican defeats enabled democrats to take control of the chamber womens biggest advances in politics came in the early s particularly in when the number of women in the house and senate jumped to seats from last year women won a record seats in the senate and in the house out of total in both chambers even so womens advocates found it a disappointing year of house seats that switched from republican to democratic control only four went to women with months before the election it seems possible the number of female officeholders will hold even at best and could well drop with control of the senate in the balance that chambers three women up for re election will face tough races new orleans voters provided ms landrieus base in her two previous senate victories but no one knows how many of them remain in louisiana after hurricane katrina wrecked the city maine republican sen susan collins has distanced herself from mr bushs policy on iraq but if voters are as irate about the war next year as they were in "there may be nothing she can do " says jennifer duffy who follows senate elections for the cook political report that same wave could hit north carolina republican sen elizabeth dole who also catches flack from republicans because their party lost senate control in when she headed their campaign committee and if sen clinton were to win the presidency she would give up her new york senate seat one potential senate bright spot for women so far is new hampshire where democrats are hoping to recruit ms shaheen the former governor to challenge mr sununu who also is vulnerable because of iraq in the house five first term lawmakers four democrats and one republican squeaked into office by such narrow margins that they face rough re election campaigns already republican male incumbents defeated by democrats nancy boyda of kansas and carol shea porter of new hampshire last year have said they will run again at least six other republican women also could be in danger though four of them heather wilson of new mexico deborah pryce and jean schmidt of ohio and marilyn musgrave of colorado are expected to face female democratic challengers as for governors seats louisiana democratic gov kathleen babineaux blanco isnt running for re election this fall for a term that ends january delaware democrat ruth ann minner will leave office in january because of term limits neither race has yet attracted a woman candidate washington gov christine gregoire could face dino rossi the republican candidate she defeated by votes in among the eight other governors races this cycle a female candidate has come forward only in north carolina where democratic lt gov beverly perdue is running for an open seat on a pledge to bring more defense related industries to the state
