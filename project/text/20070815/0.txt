a vaccine doesnt treat hpv a vaccine to prevent infection with two types of a virus linked to cervical cancer doesnt help women get rid of the viruses if they already are infected the findings from a study of more than women infected with the human papillomavirus or hpv in costa rica appear in the current issue of the journal of the american medical association the study sponsored by the federal national cancer institute examined cervarix a cervical cancer vaccine from glaxosmithkline plc glaxo has filed for food and drug administration approval of cervarix and hopes to bring the cancer vaccine to the u s next year there has been confusion about whether patients who have already been exposed to hpv could benefit from vaccination said allan hildesheim an nci scientist who was one of the studys principal investigators cervarix and gardasil merck &amp co s cervical cancer vaccine that is available in the u s arent designed to rid patients of hpv instead both vaccines aim to prevent patients from becoming infected with two types of hpv types and that are thought to cause of cervical cancer cases world wide both companies suggest that it makes sense to vaccinate people who have become infected with hpv because tests arent widely available to tell patients whether they have specifically types or the companies say the vast majority of patients dont have either type let alone both at any one time they say the vaccines can prevent infection with the types they havent acquired however dr hildesheim said it is unclear how beneficial it is to vaccinate patients after they have been infected with hpv the longer patients wait to get vaccinated after they have become sexually active the more likely they are to have acquired either type or at some point "the question that has not yet been answered is whether protecting a woman from re infection of a virus that she has previously been infected with and successfully cleared will in fact reduce that womans risk of getting cervical pre cancer and cancer " he said the study involved women aged to in costa rica who were infected at the time with any one of many types of hpv most hpv infections regardless of type clear spontaneously over six months to two years the study says the risk of cervical cancer increases when the infection lingers longer cervarix didnt accelerate the clearing process and shouldnt be used to treat infections the study found merck says it has sought an answer to a similar question about gardasil with a similar result both companies say they werent surprised by the results for their own vaccines because they were designed to prevent infection
