demand fuels refineries as margins begin to fall americans love to drive but new oil refineries arent being built in the u s to satisfy the demand for gasoline this driving obsession demands these economic realities have given rise to a golden age of refining and forestalled the decline in sector strength that some have expected every year since an analyst coined the phrase in late for those turning crude oil into fuel gasoline and diesel the growth in demand that has outstripped refiners spare refining capacity has made pure play refiners stars on wall street and consistently lifted earnings for the integrated oil majors recently however stellar refining margins the sectors earnings driver have been sliding and prompting some consternation among investors margins which made the rising tide that lifted all companies in the sector arent likely headed back to their former seasonal extremes moderate in the runup to high demand heating and driving seasons and then falling to break even or negative they may ease even seasonally but the growth potential of refining companies appears promising "the fundamentals have fundamentally changed and wall street hasnt figured that out " said ken kam chief executive of marketocracy inc in san mateo calif "prospects for the refining industry are better than the average s&amp p company so a refiners p e ratio should be above average but is half and a bargain at that " said mr kam portfolio manager for the &# million marketocracy masters fund the golden age hasnt been without some tarnish despite refiners consistently optimistic outlooks refining margins the sales price of products less the cost of crude and refining operations have shed about two thirds of their value since their most recent peak because crude oil prices have risen to record highs at the same time that gasoline prices have declined share prices for pure play refiners such as valero energy corp sunoco inc and tesoro corp have followed suit as have integrated oil companies like conocophillips and marathon oil corp refining companies remain upbeat "we see many of the underlying supply and demand factors in place for many more years which makes us bullish about our future " valero chief executive and chairman bill klesse told analysts during a post earnings conference call last month "of course our business will continue to be seasonal with plenty of volatility as weve seen lately " he added even with the recent fall in margins as measured by market prices on any long term historical basis valero is still achieving excellent margins mr klesse said the force pushing gasoline prices lower is one of two that sent them soaring in the spring and has punctuated the past several years with price increases refining capacity whole refineries and a number of individual processing units have been ramping up production after several months of outages from fires floods prolonged scheduled maintenance and the usual array of unanticipated operating problems inherent in an industry as technically complex as refining fuel production levels that are closer to seasonal norms and a steady flow of foreign gasoline imports have eased the supply crunch but for how long falling gasoline prices discourage marketers abroad from chartering tankers bound for the u s and routine refinery maintenance here and in europe will be under way by october the june nov hurricane season is entering the historically more active second half and the oil market could see disruptions like those experienced in and meanwhile demand the other force influencing fuel prices and consequently margins is higher than it has ever been growth in gasoline demand has slowed as the national average gasoline price has hovered near &# a gallon but it is healthy at to in addition growth in demand for diesel has remained strong at least double that of gasoline smaller independents such as holly corp and frontier oil corp whose share prices have also declined as margins have come off have growth advantages their larger peers dont "the companies have fewer refineries but leverage to very high growth markets in the southwest las vegas phoenix albuquerque " said one longtime but newly relocated analyst not yet authorized to speak for an energy investment firm "population growth there is strong and not surprisingly company growth has gone with it " he added but the most bullish aspect of margins and strongest argument for refining company value is the lack of spare refining capacity while the total amount of crude oil and other feedstocks that can be processed at refineries and production has risen steadily for years stronger growth in demand for gasoline and diesel have put the u s fuel supply system on a knifes edge now it isnt just extraordinary events like hurricane katrinas shutdown of gulf coast refineries that sends fuel prices soaring routine refinery maintenance necessary for safe and efficient operation and sometimes difficult to schedule because of labor constraints can also cause short term increases "if your investment horizon is a few weeks yes you should worry about falling margins " says marketocracys mr kam "but over two years what drives margins is capacity utilization and thats not being added " the construction of new refineries in addition to the expansion of existing plants would significantly boost capacity but its not happening strong inflation in engineering and construction costs long project timelines and difficult to obtain permits have discouraged investment of three projects currently on the table one obtained key federal and state permits several years ago but has failed to secure commitments from investors the project has been in the works since another in louisiana exists only as a memorandum of understanding with kuwait to study the construction of a plant backers of a just announced third project in the upper plains region havent disclosed financial details or a final location the result has been to raise the value of the refiners primary asset existing refineries "refineries used to sell at to of replacement cost " says malcolm turner a houston based industry consultant who advises companies on refinery deals "now if you sell at less than replacement somethings wrong " mr kam sees only two things endangering refining margins a more effective government refinery permitting process or an economic recession that would cause fuel demand to contract neither is very likely he says a prospect that further enhances future refining company value "why invest in new refineries when you can buy existing companies at eight times earnings " he asks
