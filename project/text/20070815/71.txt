lilly s long term health depends on heart drug eli lilly &amp co s long term prognosis hinges on whether its experimental heart drug is better than a current blockbuster and an answer is expected soon by early november the indianapolis pharmaceutical company hopes to release results of a large patient trial of prasugrel the most important experimental drug in its pipeline prasugrel is a blood thinning agent designed to prevent recurring heart attacks and strokes in people with cardiovascular disease the market opportunity is huge the leading blood thinner plavix generated nearly &# billion in sales last year for its co marketers sanofi aventis and bristol myers squibb co lilly and its japanese development partner daiichi sankyo co hope their drug will prove superior to plavix and if it receives regulatory approval begin to take away market share from plavix "if prasugrel really is demonstrably better it can get a major share of that business " said stephen laveson an analyst with becker capital management a portland ore investment firm that owns lilly shares wall street analysts predict annual prasugrel sales could approach &# billion earlier studies have suggested prasugrel is more potent than plavix in blocking blood platelet activity which is a mechanism that helps ward off heart attacks the latest trial of nearly patients in countries will show whether that potency translates into a reduction in cardiovascular deaths heart attacks and strokes in people undergoing a certain heart procedure but for a blood thinning agent potency could come at a cost a side effect is bleeding the latest trial must also show that the risk of serious bleeding with prasugrel isnt significantly worse than that for plavix if prasugrel is to gain regulatory approval and market acceptance "one of the questions is whats the trade off " said christopher granger director of the cardiac care unit at duke university medical center "how potent can we get before we go too far and have caused intolerable bleeding " lilly executives have said an earlier study showed no statistically significant difference in overall bleeding rates between the drugs also a committee of experts met periodically to monitor safety issues in the latest trial and cleared it to run to completion trial investigators are now examining data from the new lilly funded study which began in and ended in july lilly hopes to present the data at a medical meeting in early november but hasnt ruled out publicly disclosing preliminary results before then if the data are positive lilly hopes to submit prasugrel for food and drug administration approval by the end of this year if the drug gets timely fda approval it could hit the market in initially the approved uses for prasugrel would be narrower than those for plavix but lilly and daiichi might seek additional approvals later prasugrel is crucial to lilly because its current best seller the antipsychotic zyprexa is set to lose u s patent protection in zyprexa generated more than one fourth of lillys total revenue last year or about &# billion lilly needs another big seller on the market before much of zyprexas sales are lost to cheaper generic competition if prasugrel fails lillys newer products and other experimental drugs may not be enough to fill the void lilly has suggested it isnt overly dependent on prasugrel "while its a very important compound in late stage development its not the only product in late stage development " chief financial officer derica rice said he said the company is developing an inhaled form of insulin for diabetics as well as an injectable form of zyprexa still the company has had pipeline setbacks including a delay in regulatory approval of a drug for diabetic eye disease investors seem to be taking a cautious approach in advance of the release of the new prasugrel data "i dont think investors are making a big bet on it" ahead of the trial data said deutsche bank analyst barbara ryan if successful prasugrel would follow in the footsteps of plavix and before that aspirin all are known as antiplatelet agents which work by blocking the formation of dangerous blood clots that lead to heart attacks and strokes studies have shown aspirin and plavix reduce the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events other companies are developing antiplatelet agents including astrazeneca plc and schering plough corp one limitation of plavix is that its effect on blood platelets is variable and some patients dont respond to it dr granger the duke cardiologist said prasugrel appears to have a more consistent effect on platelets the effect of plavix is predictable across the patient populations for which it is approved said john tsai vice president of cardiovascular and metabolics research at bristol myers "it strikes a good balance between efficacy and safety " he said dr granger thinks prasugrel needs to demonstrate at least a reduction in risk of cardiovascular events compared with plavix if prasugrel is to be a success the prasugrel study has important implications for bristol myers the new york company recorded &# billion in plavix sales last year or about of its total revenue sales growth could slow if prasugrel reaches the market "we are taking prasugrel seriously but we believe it will be focusing on a much smaller set of patients " lamberto andreotti bristols chief operating officer of world wide pharmaceuticals told analysts on a conference call last month he added that bristol is waiting to see the late stage prasugrel data before making a final assessment of how plavix might be affected
