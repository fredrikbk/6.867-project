boss talk power pair builds beijing and a life zhang and husband find middle ground to develop chinese real estate empire with the olympics a year away beijings construction boom is in overdrive some analysts and government officials even fear a real estate bubble yet zhang xin chief executive of developer soho china says the company will post its highest growth this year and next ms zhang and her husband pan shiyi are one of chinas best known business couples renowned for their funky aesthetic their first project soho new town for "small office home office" attracted wide attention with its multicolored buildings in contrast to beijings grayness today soho china has switched its focus to retail and office spaces where ms zhang says margins are the highest with more than million square feet its the leading developer in the capitals central business district the couple plans an initial public offering in hong kong next month in which they hope to raise &# billion a former investment banker with goldman sachs in new york ms zhang grew up in bejing and hong kong mr pans rags to riches tale is legendary in china before the offering was announced last week ms zhang spoke with the wall street journal about how they share running the business and balance it with life at home with their two children excerpts wsj how have you been able to get parcel after parcel of land in beijings central business district theres a perception you must have very good political connections ms zhang we dont i can honestly tell you we dont spend any time cultivating anyone as a private company in this country we are neither government owned nor communist by nature the only way we can work is under the law our contracts have to be governed and supported by the law our behavior has to be in when we wanted to buy this piece of smelly land soho new town which replaced a rice wine factory and we talked to the government no developer wanted it as for jianwai soho in the central business district i spent two years trying to get serious developers outside china to come in with us but we couldnt get anyone so we did it alone wsj in the past year the government has taken some tough actions with real estate developers such as restricting bank loans and land supply for them fearing a property bubble why havent you been affected ms zhang we dont focus on the size of the land bank were a commercial developer so we focus on the quality of the land a massive land in heilongjiang means nothing to us but land in the central business district means a lot to us wsj how do you and mr pan work together ms zhang if you look at our two backgrounds i come from a more consultative background having been western educated and wall street trained pan comes from a more traditional chinese way i think his mentality was more like the head of the family makes the decision on behalf of everyone for the goodness of everyone wsj who changed whom ms zhang weve come to a middle ground i have certainly brought him to see the world outside china and how people think how people work he has brought me to see how the core of the chinese system works wsj at least in the chinese media your company is associated more often with pan shiyi the farmer who grew up so poor he had to beg for food than with you are you jealous of that association ms zhang no after all he is my husband but the founders of soho are mr pan and ms zhang its very hard for two people to do the media you almost always have one image he does it so well so why not people love the story of this nong min farmer from gansu province who has come a long way and still keeps a humble attitude and still has a lot of drive wsj yet you are the cambridge graduate with the economics degree and the wall street veteran why have you focused on the softer aspects of business like aesthetics and design ms zhang pan is by nature a better businessman i am not as intuitive as he is in terms of smelling where the market is today wsj in terms of picking a site and pricing it who has gotten it right more of the times ms zhang so far we have done only one development that we stopped half way through it just didnt sell that well it was my instinct to do it it was his instinct to cut it wsj mr pan has been quite open about his criticisms on recent government actions to slow real estate development are you concerned that he is so public with his remarks ms zhang no i think this is a good way of communicating with the government it needs to hear our opinions where would we talk to the government if it wasnt through the media the most powerful channel youll be surprised how much attention they pay to the media china is a different place today wsj mr pan keeps a very popular blog which he uses to comment on chinas real estate industry whose idea was that ms zhang his idea i should give credit to him because when he started it i said this was such a waste of time and he should be running a company not writing a blog but he kept writing and it came to a point where the blog has become an important speaking place for us wsj you were against mr pan appearing as the chinese donald trump in a local version of "the apprentice " and he didnt do the show why was that so important to you ms zhang i didnt think the association was right for him i have a bit more exposure to the western world to know what should be the right association for him pan was a poor peasant who came to where he is today he is such a socially conscious person and very compassionate wsj are both of you very concerned not only with how foreigners see soho china but also how they see china ms zhang absolutely yes im a ceo im a wife im a mother when i go to conferences when i talk to the media im also seen as a window to china the reporting doesnt have to be all good but it has to be with justification wsj how do you balance your work with home ms zhang i am very strict in dividing my work hours and home hours my colleagues all know that i dont work on weekends i feel like the weekend is for my role as a mom and a wife evenings too i hardly ever go out wsj then how do you network ms zhang i dont work hours are work hours lets meet in the office and we can have lunch together i dont need to go out for dinner pan doesnt either wsj in may mr pan addressed a conference in hong kong on taoism have both of you become more spiritual ms zhang when i met him he was already reading a lot of taoism he got me interested and together we became more advanced in our research wsj have you picked a religion ms zhang i have been a bahai for two years i think hes still investigating
