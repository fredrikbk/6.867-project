funds struggle with pricing pitfalls the markets swings are making it harder for some mutual funds to answer a basic question what are their holdings actually worth the securities and exchange commission is raising concerns about how funds price certain holdings including subprime mortgage related debt it has gotten tougher to trade this kind of debt amid the market turmoil and therefore tougher to know its precise value one worry in some cases funds might be using outdated prices to value their portfolios or unrealistically favorable prices quoted by friendly brokers known as "accommodation quotes" according to douglas scheidt of the secs investment management division for investors flawed mutual fund prices have consequences if a fund doesnt know how to value holdings accurately investors dont know if they are paying a fair price faulty pricing also opens the door to "market timers " who rapidly trade fund shares seeking to profit when prices get out of sync with the broader market that practice which can hurt long term shareholders erupted into an industry scandal in when some major fund firms were accused of letting some of their favored investors engage in market timing mutual funds are required to price their holdings at least once a day but there can be considerable wiggle room valuing u s stocks is usually simple you use the days closing price other securities can be trickier if a reliable market quote isnt readily available often the case for some kinds of debt and derivatives mutual funds can use various methods to estimate a "fair value " there are no detailed rules on calculating fair values so some money managers argue it can be too arbitrary "two independent observers calculating the price of a mutual fund should come up with the same price per share " says jim atkinson of guinness atkinson asset management "fair value pricing takes that away " many funds are still struggling to find the best way to value their holdings in a deloitte &amp touche usa llp survey released last month of fund firms said they had made changes in their valuation policies in the past year valuation policies can vary substantially from fund to fund valuations may be based on prices supplied by an outside pricing firm the funds own internal calculations or quotes collected from broker dealers some funds fair value their holdings every day while others apply fair value only if it makes a significant difference in the funds nav or when a certain "trigger" is met this can occur for instance when funds hold foreign stocks which can be tough to accurately value during the u s trading day when the foreign market may be closed in that case the trigger for fair value use might be a or greater move in the standard &amp poors stock index after asian markets close whereas many funds once applied fair value largely to foreign stocks more funds are now calculating fair values for other types of holdings like derivatives funds are also increasingly using smaller triggers meaning they fair value their holdings more often yet funds often still rely on market quotes to value u s small and microcap stocks even though they can trade infrequently and have out of date prices about half of fund firms still use the last available market price to value these holdings even when they have determined the price is stale according to the deloitte survey fund firms arent likely to change their valuation methods for these holdings until regulators prod them to do so experts say by the end of the year the secs staff plans to present guidance for the commissions consideration that would address questions on how and how often funds should use fair value prices the last sec guidance focused on fund fair value pricing was issued in and new accounting rules taking effect in coming months require funds to disclose more information about how they value various holdings fund pricing gets tougher as the market becomes more volatile as has been the case recently even some pricing firms say recent market conditions have presented challenges in valuing securities though they remain confident their prices are fair "were creating evaluations using fewer market data inputs" because of the volatility and lack of trading activity in some securities says liz duggan of interactive data pricing &amp reference data eric zitzewitz associate professor of economics at dartmouth college in new hampshire has studied funds"dilution rate " or the reduction in long term shareholders returns because of trading at faulty fund navs while dilution rates decreased substantially since the market timing scandal they have started to creep back up recently as volatility increases he says though the trading scandal was focused largely on foreign stock funds these funds are still having trouble fairly valuing holdings some experts say mr zitzewitz says some of the highest dilution rates are in emerging market and asian stock funds which are also among the most volatile categories fair valuation is key for these funds because market moving news breaking during the u s trading day long after many foreign exchanges have closed can make foreign stock prices on local exchanges "stale " yet some foreign stock funds still perform in predictable ways for example rallying on the day after a late day surge in u s markets which suggests that theyre still using somewhat out of date prices "you shouldnt be able to predict the price change of a fund today based on what happened yesterday if theyre valuing things correctly " mr zitzewitz says some firms running foreign stock funds still have strong reservations about fair valuation saying it introduces a disturbing element of uncertainty into mutual fund prices for several years guinness atkinsons asian stock funds used an early trade cut off time instead of fair value pricing to prevent traders from profiting from stale prices to trade the fund on any given day investors were required to place orders by a m eastern time but that system unraveled late last year because it wasnt friendly to shareholders and brokerage firms had trouble with it mr atkinson says the funds started using fair value pricing early this year he says "with extreme reluctance "
