international events ever hosted in china and boasts its own opening ceremony and a host of corporate sponsors the games also come at a pivotal time in terms of chinas recognition of people with disabilities in china as in other developing countries officials say that people with disabilities have often lived in isolation either because they arent given proper care or because of social stigmas special olympics chairman timothy shriver says china is "the biggest nation on the planet for us in terms of the potential number of athletes current number of athletes and potential impact its our chance to prove a developing nation can put disability rights at the center of its agenda " the special olympics was founded by eunice kennedy shriver in as a continuation of her work through
