boeings tall order on time suppliers say dreamliner delivery could hit may target if all goes right boeing co s top leaders say it is possible to overcome a nearly four month delay in the dreamliner program and deliver the first jet on time in may industry observers and a number of the planes suppliers say it would be the aerospace equivalent of hitting a hole in one on a golf course after running into a critical shortage of aerospace fasteners to hold the airplane together boeing was forced to delay the first flight of the dreamliner from august to what now looks like sometime in mid november to mid december company officials surprised many people in the aerospace industry including some of boeings suppliers when they said two weeks ago that they nevertheless still plan to deliver the first airplane on time suppliers say boeing can still make the deadline but that would mean everything goes right a rare occurrence in the process of developing a new aircraft "we looked at each other and said are they kidding " said a senior boeing supplier who listened in on the conference call in which boeing broke the news to wall street analysts and reporters boeing still must install hundreds of parts including the pilots controls and instruments into the first airplane suppliers such as honeywell international inc must finish writing their portions of the more than six million lines of computer code that will run everything on the plane from the flight controls to the electronic window shades after that a complex web of electrical wiring and computer equipment must be checked to see that all of the various systems on the airplane work in unison this milestone known as power on isnt expected to occur before mid october according to people familiar with the situation that leaves roughly four to eight weeks for safety engineers to work out the bugs and declare the plane safe for its first flight this task took three months during the s when boeing was preparing for the first flight of the although boeing says its production troubles are limited to the first few airplanes it is critical for the company to get the program on track as soon as possible significant delays in the first steps could ripple through the rest of the s schedule potentially jeopardizing the scheduled delivery of airplanes by the end of the schedule is so tight that boeing officials say they need to have about airplanes mostly ready for delivery by the time the test flight program is completed if that doesnt happen delays could cascade through the production schedule for as long as two years potentially undermining boeings credibility with its customers and exposing it to costly penalty payments for missed deliveries "were down to the program having to go by the book " boeing chairman and chief executive jim mcnerney said while answering questions last week during a morgan stanley analysts conference in california boeing officials said they plan to provide an update of their progress in late october and will have a better idea then about whether the feat is still possible indeed boeing is entering one of the most complicated parts of the airplanes development in which something as simple as a stubborn piece of measuring equipment can keep a test flight airplane grounded for days most of the components have been tested for hundreds of hours in laboratories but flight tests almost always bring out surprises "thats why they call it flight test " said mike bair the boeing vice president in charge of the dreamliner development program during a briefing in july mr bair said boeing is spending much of its attention on getting the production system ready to churn out multiple airplanes "because thats whats important delivering airplanes " according to people familiar with the program suppliers at factories in italy japan and the u s continue to experience chronic parts shortages that have slowed the completion of another six flight test airplanes that must be finished no later than late january or early february boeing said it rescheduled delivery deadlines so that suppliers would gain an additional days to get the flight test airplanes into shape boeing confirmed it also has sent hundreds of engineers to help smaller third tier suppliers in places such as israel meet the demand for components such as vertical frames that the larger suppliers need to complete their sections of the planes fuselage the dreamliner with more than orders from airlines has been the hottest selling wide body jet in the world since boeing began taking orders for it in made largely of carbon fiber composites the airplane is being advertised as more fuel efficient more comfortable and easier to maintain than any commercial airplane in its class according to interviews with several suppliers boeing was as much as eight months late delivering detailed specifications to the companies that were expected to do the bulk of the manufacturing of the airplane and its systems boeing officials acknowledge that they contributed to the initial delays but they said "recovery plans" had largely eliminated those setbacks vought aircraft industries of dallas which had problems in the summer said it is "making steady improvements with boeings help and support " general electric co s systems division said that the main computer system it is delivering "supports the current aircraft schedule " even though it had to add more processing power than originally anticipated john plueger president and chief operating officer for los angeles based international lease finance corp said he isnt that concerned about a modest delay "nobodys going to care if the plane turns out to be two or three months late as long as it does everything boeing has promised " he said with more than planes on order ilfc a unit of american international group inc is the largest dreamliner client a spokesman for japans all nippon airways co which ordered dreamliners and is scheduled to take the first delivery in may said that while the airline is still planning for an on time delivery "a delay wouldnt affect us that much" because it is scheduled to replace an existing fleet of boeing s "wed just keep flying the s until the plane was ready " he said
