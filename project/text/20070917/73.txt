world has had mixed results reports the los angeles timess josh meyer al qaeda had to sever connections with the outlying parts of its networks after the invasion of afghanistan deprived the group of its headquarters it is looking to regain its former presence in central asia africa egypt and europe using a restored network of mid level managers in northern pakistan says mr meyer citing unnamed counterterrorism officials as well as terrorism experts these managers have discussed closer ties with groups in somalia north africa southeast asia and even with tribal chiefs in the middle east in some cases the effort has led to what amounts to a takeover of a group al qaedas most successful acquisition has perhaps been the north african group islamic maghreb in its former incarnation the group had eager recruits but few resources and little know how al qaeda offered those things and in a matter of months negotiated a takeover with the islamic maghrebs leader according to bruce riedel a senior cia counterterrorism official until late last year since al qaeda announced its alliance last year islamic maghreb has taken credit for as many as four bombings a week in others cases al qaeda has been rebuffed or decided that the group wasnt a good fit after all al qaeda dropped a plan to forge an alliance with palestinian group fatah al islam according to fawaz gerges a professor of middle eastern studies at sarah lawrence college he says al qaeda choked on fatahs criminal activity and suspected ties to syria in southeast asia some groups have also rebuffed advances from al qaedas affiliates meanwhile al qaeda in iraq remains largely independent of the larger organization al qaedas outreach effort has made it difficult to determine its influence on terrorist attacks the

qaedas orbit the los angeles times sept society paper says married couples may make bad neighbors although marriage is often considered a cornerstone of any community it tends to draw people away from communal activities say two sociologists in a paper last year naomi gerstel of the university of massachusetts at amherst and natalia sarkisian of boston college analyzed two surveys one from the s and the other from that asked thousands of americans about their daily lives and attitudes they found that married couples were less likely than single people to call or visit relatives and also less likely to help neighbors or friends the boston globes chris berdik reports on how the so called greedy marriage theory has attracted criticism since its publication last year in contexts a sociology journal kay hymowitz a fellow at the manhattan institute says its authors ignored that raising children is itself a contribution to the community married couples are also more likely to volunteer than single people according to a bureau of labor statistics survey however both sides agree that the modern emphasis on marrying a soul mate has isolated married couples in earlier times marriages were communal events throughout the th century that communal sense of marriage faded a study found that the number of people with whom americans discussed important matters dropped by a third from to the only relationships in which such discussions increased were marriages dr gerstel and dr sarkisian say they arent criticizing marriage indeed they say their research shows that the arrival of children tends to push married couples to re establish ties with friends relatives and neighbors they say their goal is to show how romantic ideals serve to separate married couples from the community around

heritage says economics columnist tim harford in slate export bans "replace the logic of the market with the logic of the black market " he says smugglers conceal the origins and destinations of important artifacts and also are less likely to sell them to museums mr harford endorses a solution proposed by michael kremer a harvard economics professor and tom wilkening a graduate student at the massachusetts institute of technology a poor countrys government could lease a museum the right to display whatever cultural artifacts it can find on condition that it return them a few decades later this way wealthy countries foot the bill for excavating protecting and preserving antiquities poor countries can then spend the money on more pressing social needs and still keep a legal grip on their
