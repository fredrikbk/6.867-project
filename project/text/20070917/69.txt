we will also refer those involved to iraqi judicial authorities " mr khalaf said iraq said it would prosecute any foreign contractors found to have used excessive force in the incident although it remains a legally murky matter as to whether the private contractors could face prosecution while the incident was still under investigation mr khalaf said witness reports pointed to the involvement

proposal by democratic virginia sen jim webb requiring troops to have as much time at their home station as they do deployed to iraq on sunday secretary of defense robert gates called the measure a dangerous "backdoor way" to draw down additional forces adding that he would recommend president bush veto it "if it were enacted we would have force management problems that would be extremely difficult and in fact affect combat effectiveness and perhaps pose greater risk to our troops " he said supporters of mr webbs measure say it has at least of the votes needed though it needs votes to
