why cbs has so much riding on eclectic lineup cbs isnt accustomed to showing its vulnerable side the first place networks heroes are the stoic dna analysts of "csi " the self possessed navy special agents of "ncis" and the cutthroat contestants on reality show "survivor " but this year with some of its strongest programs showing signs of wear the network and its similarly stoic and self possessed chief executive leslie moonves are taking a risk on a new batch of shows that depart from the typical tough guy offerings full of singing dancing philandering cavorting biting backstabbing and crying whether that risk works will be crucial to the vulnerable networks no status and to its parent companys bottom line the stakes are high for all the broadcast networks in the competitive prime time ratings race but unlike walt disney co s abc or general electric co s nbc the cbs networks programming is a major force driving its parent cbs corp accounting for around &# million of the companys &# billion in operating income in according to analysts prime time programming is at the heart of the companys television business helping drive profits for the companys large tv station group including the stations and other tv businesses such as syndication cbss television division generated &# billion in operating income last year a slip out of first place could reinforce investors recent doubts about the companys prospects repeated stock buybacks and increases in the companys dividend have kept cbss stock price strong but some on wall street wonder how long that can continue given the anemic growth in the companys earnings cbs corp s operating income in the first six months of was down compared with the same period a year ago hurt by declines in both television and radio the network ended last season first in total viewers but suffered a drop off in younger viewers the to year olds advertisers most want to reach and whom cbs historically has struggled to attract "csi " the long untouchable thursday night juggernaut still won its p m time slot last season but lost in younger viewers to the abc soap "greys anatomy " though it drew an audience of around million per episode "csi" had around fewer viewers last year than the year before according to nielsen media research wall street will be watching closely to see whether cbs manages to develop new hits particularly ones attractive to the younger viewers who have fled to news corp s fox and abc so cbs is taking some chances while its established hits are still dominant hoping to find the next generation "survivor " the network has chosen some new shows that dont fit snugly into its core brand "shows do naturally age " says kelly kahl the networks senior executive vice president for strategic planning "if you look at history what happens to networks that are on top they fall because they rely on too much of the same were trying to stay away from that " theyre trying with an assortment of programs the first of which begins this week "kid nation " an experiment in controlled anarchy with kids under age premieres sept but has found itself in a controversy with some parents saying supervision was lacking cbs held early screenings for advertisers next week the network will roll out three less controversial new offerings "cane " a drama about a cuban american rum and sugar dynasty starring jimmy smits "the big bang theory " a nerd sitcom in the middle of the networks strong monday night comedy block and "moonlight " a vampire love story scheduled next to "ghost whisperer" friday night coming in october is the hotly anticipated "viva laughlin " a serialized gambling musical starring hugh jackman which the network scheduled in one of the most competitive time periods of the week sunday at p m eastern and pacific time it goes up against "extreme makeover home edition" and "nbc sunday night football" with the unlikely news oriented lead in " minutes " nina tassler the president of the networks entertainment division said "viva laughlin" has a core theme in common with the networks new and returning shows "its a classic story of an underdog you root for this guy hes seeking redemption those elements are very appealing to the cbs audience " her boss mr moonves has been deft at appealing to both viewers and investors "hes that rare combination of a hollywood executive and a wall street executive " says steve mosko president of sony pictures television mr moonves a former actor is famously hands on in the acquisition casting and development of shows when cbs decided it wanted "viva laughlin " a sony corp project mr mosko said mr moonves tracked him down at a london hotel and telephoned well past midnight "to make it clear to me" how much the network wanted the show whether that hot pursuit yields a hit cbs can still rely on the strength of its old steadies while some of the networks strongest shows including "csi" and "survivor " lost viewers last season cbs still had eight of the most watched shows on broadcast television advertisers continue to love the network because it draws a big broad audience every night and its shows have a loyal if aging viewership andrew donchin the director of national broadcast advertising for media agency carat usa says he likes the networks schedule even though "there was nothing that blew us away " where fox and abc have isolated megahits "american idol " "" and "house" for the former "greys anatomy " "desperate housewives" and "lost" for the latter cbs is seen as having a safe balanced schedule perhaps the most curious entry on the historically prudish networks lineup is "swingtown " a show about naughty suburban shenanigans in the sexually liberating s scheduled to premiere midseason "its set in a time when taking risks and being daring was part of the culture " ms tassler says
