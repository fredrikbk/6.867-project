let taiwan join the u n tomorrow the united nations will consider taiwans application for membership it has formally sought admission every year since but this years application is different first the country is applying under its own name "taiwan" rather than its official appellation "republic of china" second it is applying to the u n general assembly the organizations comprehensive body of member nations despite the rejection of its application this summer by u n secretary general ban ki moon and his legal office third the application may be followed by a national referendum on whether taiwan should apply for u n membership under its own name a plan that has elicited a sharp rebuke by the bush administration the u n s lawyers argued that having transferred chinas seat from taipei to beijing in the u n should reject taiwans latest application because taiwan "for all intents and purposes" is "an integral part of the peoples republic of china " taiwan presents a more compelling legal case it meets all of the requirements of statehood under law it is already a full and productive member of international organizations such as the world trade organization and asia pacific economic cooperation forum it has never been a province or part of the local government of the peoples republic of china taiwans recent transformation into a modern democratic state supersedes any decades old determination that gives the prc a united nations seat even as the u n failed to determine that taiwan is part of the prc or bestow upon it the right to represent taiwan taiwans political case for u n membership is equally strong it is the th most populous country in the world its economy is the worlds th largest its gross national product totals &# billion or &# per capita with &# billion in foreign exchange reserves it is one of the worlds three largest creditor states taiwan is therefore poised to be a significant contributor to the u n s operations and play a constructive role in the organization unfortunately the united states and the other major powers discourage taiwan in its quest for de jure international recognition of its de facto sovereignty this is because they do not want to raise the ire of the prc which as a member of the u n security council can block any significant u n action and as a global power can interfere on a host of issues important to the u s and europe thanks to exponentially increased trade with the u s and europe beijing feels less compelled than ever to seek political accommodation with taiwan or to decrease its military threat against the island nation expanding economic relationships may be good in and of itself but predictions that this would produce political cracks in chinas authoritarian regime have proved wrong today beijing is using its newfound economic might to isolate taiwan still further in international organizations and attempt to persuade the two dozen countries that recognize taiwan diplomatically to switch their ties to china meanwhile the people of the prc enjoy fewer political rights and civil liberties than in all but a few of the worlds countries a few short years ago the u s seemed determined to change this during his election campaign and the first months of his administration president bush and his team vowed to fashion a new foreign policy in which u s national interests particularly in asia were advanced less exclusively through the prism of beijing in other words the u s wanted to be less beholden to the communist regime one of the casualties of and the subsequent war in iraq was that this policy agenda became less of a priority our cooperation with pakistan in the effort to topple the taliban find osama bin laden and eradicate terrorism in the region meant that we focused less on developing a higher tier relationship with india we also concentrated less on drawing out japan by encouraging it to play a more active political and military role on the global stage equally important we were unable to increase our promotion of democracy in the region by fostering closer ties with countries such as taiwan and south korea and escalating pressure on beijing to reform the current u s administration still has time to correct this omission having been an advocate for taiwan during my time in the senate and today as part of a law firm that represents taiwans interests in the u s i believe that president bush should support taiwans application for u n membership this should be quickly followed by active or tacit support for taiwans plans for a popular vote on this issue in march our close asian friend and ally needs and deserves this recognition and support which would at the same time advance americas regional and global interest in promoting democratization mr dole a former senate majority leader and the republican candidate for president in is special counsel to alston &amp bird
