sign up for the e mail here microsoft this morning lost its appeal of the european unions precedent setting antitrust decision and it lost big in march the european commission ruled that microsoft was illegally abusing the dominant market position of its windows operating system by refusing to share "interoperability information" with rivals who needed that information to make their software able to compete with microsofts on the windows platform and by bundling its windows media player in ways that unfairly gave microsoft an edge over competitors like realnetworks the commission imposed a million euro fine on the u s software giant thats &# million in todays dollars and three months later microsoft appealed the luxembourg based european court of first instance today essentially upheld the commissions decision siding with the company only on one important issue the commissions order that a trustee be named to monitor microsoft with essentially carte blanche powers and that microsoft pay the bill in this the court said the commission went beyond european law and its own authority and instead the court ordered microsoft to submit a new proposal for a monitoring trustee but on the two factual issues of alleged wrongdoing the court seemed as eu competition commissioner neelie kroes put it to set "an important precedent in terms of the obligations of dominant companies to allow competition in particular in high tech industries " the court backed the commissions judgment that microsofts refusal to supply the interoperability specs was "abusive " it rejected the companys claim that the commissions remedy forcing microsoft to share that information but not far more sensitive source code would let rivals clone or reproduce microsofts products and it rejected the argument that microsoft would be sacrificing intellectual property rights to the extent that the companys incentives to innovate would be hurt without the ability to work with the windows domain architecture rivals software just cant be viably marketed the court said "the absence of such interoperability has the effect of reinforcing microsofts competitive position on the market and creates a risk that competition will be eliminated " the court added the court also backed the commissions judgment that by bundling and closely integrating media player with windows microsoft obtained "an unparalleled advantage with respect to distribution of its product and to ensure the ubiquity of windows media player on client pcs throughout the world thus providing a disincentive for users to use third party media players" and for computer makers to pre install rival media players on their pcs in its appeal microsoft failed to justify that bundling the court said adding that the judges saw no reasons why microsoft couldnt simply create an alternative version of windows for consumers that doesnt include media player the remedy ordered by the commission microsoft lawyer brad smith declined to say what microsoft would do next though the wall street journal says an appeal of the ruling to the european court of justice europes highest tribunal is likely the journal notes todays ruling moves eu antitrust jurisprudence further away from the legal environment in the u s where regulators have been less quick to judge dominant companies as abusive last week u s district court judge colleen kollar kotelly who presided over microsofts settlement with federal and state governments in the u s said that while windows is still dominant reducing microsofts market share wasnt the intent of the settlement as the seattle post intelligencer reports "her comments provide a glimpse of her mindset as she decides whether to let a big piece of the antitrust agreement expire in november " the paper adds bush to name mukasey as attorney general president bush this morning plans to nominate retired federal judge michael mukasey to succeed alberto gonzales as the highest ranking law enforcement official in the country the associated press reports an appointment already welcomed by some democrats on capitol hill but one that may alienate some conservatives "unlike mr gonzales mr mukasey is not a close confidant of the president nor is he a washington insider " the new york times reports "but people in both political parties say he possesses the two qualities that mr bush has been looking for in a nominee a law and order sensibility that dovetails with the presidents agenda for the fight against terror and the potential to avoid a bruising confirmation battle with the democrats who now run the senate with months left in office mr bush can ill afford a drawn out confirmation fight " still the year old mr mukasey "would be a nominee who stands firm on the administrations legal assertions on national security and broad presidential power " the wall street journal says "moreover his reputation as a legal conservative who has spent little time in washingtons partisan maelstrom would make him an asset in working with democrats on the administrations biggest legislative priorities which include a permanent rewrite of the foreign intelligence surveillance law " astrazeneca to rely on outsourcing british pharmaceutical giant astrazeneca plans to outsource the manufacturing of its drugs within years and become a pure research and marketing company senior executive david smith tells the times of london "manufacturing for astrazeneca is not a core activity " mr smith said "astrazeneca is about innovation and brand building there are lots of people and organizations that can manufacture better than we can " mr smith said astrazeneca could possibly find significantly cheaper contract manufacturers including many in the far east "we are looking to access china and india in a much more meaningful way " new ceo at nestle successor for time warner a pair of looming chief executive appointments appear set to shake up two huge companies nestle and time warner or do they people familiar with the situation tell the wall street journal that nestle on thursday will name chief financial officer paul polman to replace peter brabeck mr polman who spent years at procter &amp gamble before joining the swiss company last year would be the first nestle ceo who didnt rise up through the companys ranks mr polman has been credited with increasing transparency at the food giant and has pushed managers to scrap weak selling products and meet aggressive profit targets but as ceo he might find difficulty squeezing more growth out of the lumbering company and could risk a culture clash if he tries to impose too much of p&amp gs management style the journal says further along on the calendar jeffrey l bewkes is expected to get board approval for ascending to time warners no spot in coming weeks and take the helm as soon as jan people familiar with that situation tell the paper mr bewkes the president and chief operating officer is considered the mastermind behind hbos transformation into a profitable cable network and "many on wall street view mr bewkes as something akin to a corporate action hero likely to break up time warner jump starting its long stalled share price " the journal writes but the paper adds there is no guarantee that mr bewkes a successor hand picked by chief executive richard parsons will take such a big step like some investors he may believe that the real factor weighing on time warners stock is uncertainty over the future of media companies at large also of note detroit news negotiators from general motors and

process of building support for language that would give troops longer rest periods between deployments to iraq and sponsor sen jack reed said he hopes enough votes can be found to override a presidential veto the measure would require troops to get as much downtime at home as they spent in iraq and a consequence of the legislation democrats hope will be that the current troop levels in iraq cannot be sustained new york times senate and house negotiators said they agreed on a framework for a compromise bill that would provide health insurance to four million uninsured children while relaxing some of the limits on eligibility imposed by the bush administration a compromise that sets the stage for a battle with president bush who has denounced similar legislation as a step "down
