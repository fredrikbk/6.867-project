cementing power a lebanese militant group launches rebuilding project as election nears hezbollah gains clout across sectarian lines beirut lebanon last fall hezbollah leader seyed hassan nasrallah delivered an unusual business pitch to residents of dahiya a shiite enclave on the south side of town large swaths of the neighborhood had been razed by bombs during the summers monthlong war with israel in front of residents the black turbaned cleric said his islamic shiite group would rebuild but he needed those who had lost homes or businesses to hand over their government issued war compensation checks "you have two choices " mr nasrallah said according to people who attended "either build yourselves or let us do it for you but we promise to build it ever prettier and better than before " after mr nasrallah answered questions for several hours hezbollah officials passed out slips of paper for a poll nine out of residents voted to fork over their cash hezbollah officials named mr nasrallahs new venture waad or "promise " in arabic the outfit recruited urban planners and prominent beirut architects who quickly drew up blueprints for the destroyed and damaged buildings in the neighborhood in july local construction firms broke ground on the neighborhoods first new buildings waad is helping cement big political gains that hezbollah won during last years war with israel and the subsequent reconstruction race with the lebanese government that followed the fighting after a united nations cease fire hezbollah and the government of prime minister fouad sinoria set off to win popular support by repairing war damaged areas the competition to claim credit for rebuilding turned into a battle for political influence the reconstruction race could impact the near term political future of lebanon where christians sunni and shiite muslims share power in a complex sect based system parliament is set to elect a new president in september both the lebanese and the hezbollah led opposition have threatened to name their own leader splitting the government in the process if consensus isnt reached such a division threatens a deeper constitutional crisis here and some observers warn civil war that could breed fresh instability across the region hezbollah which is supported by iran and syria has been officially labeled a terrorist organization by the u s its critics accuse the group of carrying out terrorist attacks including the beirut bombings of the u s embassy and a marine corps barracks and for targeting israeli civilians but it is increasingly viewed as a viable and indispensable part of the political structure here last december when the group decided to confront the u s backed government for more parliament seats hezbollah made a strategic alliance with a christian opposition party hezbollah thus could claim it was a legitimate national movement with the support of a significant number of christians it dispatched supporters to the streets of downtown beirut for peaceful demonstrations when on occasion those demonstrations turned violent with clashes between rivaling sunni supporters of the government and shiite supporters of hezbollah mr nasrallah immediately recalled the crowds from the streets "hezbollah has become very image conscious because the movement is more and more about domestic politics rather than resisting israel or serving the interests of iran " says timur goksel an expert on hezbollah who teaches political science at the american university of beirut "it has been nasrallahs personal mission to move the party forward into politics and we are seeing that play out now " the waad program is further evidence of the groups political evolution hezbollah waited for the lebanese government to announce its reconstruction plan and then articulated its own it has avoided putting up illegal buildings and plays strictly by the rules requiring owners to diligently follow up on disputed deeds and documents the waad project notably includes architects and companies across the sectarian divide giving the project a decidedly nationalist tone "with the reconstruction project hezbollah has shown that it has initiative its flexible and reactive " says yasser akkaoui editor in chief of executive an independent business magazine that has followed the dahiya project closely in a televised speech last month marking the one year anniversary of the cease fire mr nasrallah renewed his pledge to rebuild war torn areas by next year and he praised waad at waad headquarters geopolitical concerns seem far removed fresh paint and blueprints cover the walls of hallways and conference rooms in the companys tidy five story building in its main reception a scale model of dahiya dotted with miniature trees and cars spreads over a large table chocolates wrapped in waad logo gold paper fill a crystal bowl across the street the scale of waads project is clear a row of half collapsed apartment buildings lean against each other spilling plaster and plumbing fixtures into the street a large crater covers an area nearby where a prominent clerics home and a public library once stood "by next year all these will be replaced by beautiful modern structures " says hassan jeshi a beirut architect tapped by hezbollah as waads general manager "when this project ends hezbollah will definitely be stronger " he says looking out a window as bulldozers clear rubble below mr jeshi is a shiite muslim from the neighborhood and a hezbollah supporter but he says he isnt a member of the group he says he left his own small architectural firm after hezbollah officials asked him to lead waad he oversees a staff of over paid workers and dozens of volunteers and updates mr nasrallah regularly on the companys progress hezbollah was created in the early s as a paramilitary movement trained by irans elite revolutionary guards its mission was to resist israels year occupation of lebanon over decades of civil war the group built up social networks to fill voids left by the countrys semifunctional state but it has also kept true to its military roots on july last year hezbollah fighters crossed the lebanon israeli border and kidnapped two israeli soldiers israel responded by pounding lebanons airport roads and bridges it also targeted neighborhoods such as dahiya hezbollah fired back bogging down israeli tanks and troops as they pushed into southern lebanon during the day aerial and ground battle over lebanese were killed most of them civilians israel lost mostly soldiers in lebanon which had just begun an economic rebound after decades of civil war more than homes were destroyed the lebanese government estimates the conflict cost the country about &# billion beiruts southern shiite neighborhood of dahiya took the brunt of israels bombs after the u n brokered cease fire the government turned to arab and western allies for funds to help rebuild officials set up a commission to disperse aid but funding delays and bureaucracy hobbled efforts to quickly infuse damaged neighborhoods with cash meanwhile hezbollahs nimble social network sprang into action it doled out &# to displaced families as well as other aid such as food and clothes that effort was funded by a gift from iran hezbollah officials said but faced with the scale of the damage in dahiya hezbollah officials realized that iranian cash wasnt going to be enough its reconstruction wing jihad al bina had overseen rebuilding efforts in war damaged areas for almost two decades but previous work had mostly been in small villages fixing or reconstructing a handful of buildings one at a time officials recognized that to rebuild the densely populated and urban area of dahiya they needed a new approach and more help by october a group of prominent lebanese architects urban planners and university professors had already begun to meet informally to discuss how to help rebuild rahif fayad a christian and president of the arab organization of architects wrote two articles for a beirut newspaper in them he proposed that lebanons architects form a consulting committee and come up with a reconstruction plan he hoped the government would take up the idea instead hezbollah came knocking within days hassan hijazi a top jihad al bina engineer called mr fayad and then paid a visit to his small office in the posh neighborhood of verdun mr hijazi asked mr fayad to join hezbollahs efforts to repair dahiya the architect agreed and convinced a handful of colleagues to join him waad was born "its every architects dream to participate in such a grand project of rebuilding your country after the war " says mr fayad "waad has given us that opportunity and we are grateful " with a framework for the project in place mr nasrallah made his pitch to dahiyas residents many still dazed by the war mariana khazaal a year old mother of four and a worker at a jewelry factory said her apartment and all the familys belongings were demolished when a bomb landed on their nine story residential tower she eventually expects to receive about &# in government compensation when she gets her check she plans to hand it over to waad "seyed nasrallah said one word i promise " she says "we believe him and trust him he is the only one who delivers his promise in this country " mr fayad formed a six person supervisory committee which meets every week on thursday afternoons to hammer out an urban vision for dahiya they work as unpaid consultants but mr fayad and others in the group have won design work from waad for the project they say their commissions are significantly below market prices by december the group came up with a three pronged plan waad should stick to the basic layout of the old neighborhood it should limit construction to pre existing residential and commercial blocks but it should also try to solve some of the neighborhoods old urban headaches the committee has drawn up plans to add parking green space and tree lined avenues as well as handicapped amenities like ramped sidewalks waad made sure to involve residents from each of the damaged buildings a group of them meets regularly with waads public relations officers and offers suggestions among their concerns the number of bathrooms for each unit and whether a building will have balconies or not waad filed building plans with municipal authorities and by february had won approval from residents and city officials the company divided the neighborhood into zones and handed out design work to architectural firms across the country it says it awards contracts for construction work through public bidding by local contractors after dahiya residents sign a power of attorney waad can draw compensation checks and use the money for the project compensations range between &# and &# per housing unit waad has begun construction work on buildings and more are expected to break ground soon waad executives say they expect to finish rebuilding by late and estimate costs at some &# million what they cant finance with compensation checks hezbollah says it will draw from its own coffers built up over the years by donations and funding from iran but waads cash flow has been strained by delayed payments from the government in dahiya just compensation checks have been issued and cashed according to the government which says payments are slowed down by lack of proper legal documents proving ownership waad says of dahiyas residents have turned over their checks in the south the government has issued for a total of &# million after the cease fire arab and western governments pledged &# billion in aid but much of the western money came with strings attached such as government reform and lebanon hasnt seen any of it yet arab countries have sent some &# million so far and countries like qatar and iran are leading their own projects indonesia recently sent &# million and &# million more came by way of private donations some western countries like the u s italy and france have adopted rebuilding a bridge instead of paying cash to the government for reconstruction most of the cash earmarked for dahiya residents and being diverted to waad is coming from saudi arabia and kuwait two staunch u s allies who have worked in the past to check hezbollahs influence in the region mr sinorias government says it isnt competing with waad to rebuild individual homes or neighborhoods instead it is concentrating on big infrastructure projects like bridges and sewer lines officials say they wont stand in hezbollahs way if residents want to turn over their cash to waad "waad is a private initiative if people want to give their money to a third party to rebuild for them thats their right " says finance minister jihad azur at a recent thursday meeting waad officials mr fayad and other committee members munched on peaches and cherries and debated new designs in one proposed balconies for a row of commercial buildings didnt seem the right fit they decided to send the drawing back to the designer meanwhile mr jeshi the general manager railed about the funding delays "the government had a responsibility to this region " he said "no one told it to stay out but it did hezbollah has stepped in "
