recruiters with demand growing for m b a graduates it is a sellers market out there making it tough for many companies to meet hiring quotas using old tried and true recruiting methods at a time when career opportunities are so plentiful that students can afford to turn down even six figure offers from investment banks it is especially difficult for traditional manufacturers to make an impression so to improve their odds recruiters are visiting business schools earlier and more often raising starting salaries and touting their companys dedication to work family balance whats more some also are breaking from the traditional routine of on campus presentations and cocktail receptions and trying something new virtual recruiting they are mining for resumes online arranging video interviews and using instant messaging to cast a wider net and connect more effectively with todays tech savvy students "m b a recruiting is a dinosaur " says greg ruf chief executive officer of mba focus a consulting firm that promotes an online resume database to corporate recruiters "to be successful in the future recruiters will need a different skill set rather than being event planners who are transaction oriented theyll need to become more adept and comfortable with technology and the online world " consider appliance maker whirlpool corp of benton harbor mich the company continues to do on campus recruiting at its "core schools" duke university harvard university indiana university the university of notre dame michigan state university ohio state university northwestern university

this year mr ruf says that while "millennial generation students want to be contacted virtually " online recruiting needs to be personal and engaging to work given the deluge of information students receive daily they may consider a generic corporate pitch to be nothing more than spam he suggests that corporate recruiters reach out to top prospects with a personalized email that might include a link to the companys career web site the best career web sites mr ruf says provide a sense of the corporate culture and a look at specific jobs often through video interviews with employees alumni profiles case studies virtual tours and podcasts some companies are updating their career web sites to get more in tune with todays students whirlpool for example is launching a chat feature on its site assigning employees from different departments to answer questions at designated times "todays college graduates want someone right there when they have a question " says ms voglewede "many college students have expressed their preference to communicate interactively with someone rather than just read someones observations about the company " technology companies not surprisingly are

not sure second life and other new technologies will ever totally replace traditional recruiting " ms calo says "you can only see students intellectual curiosity excitement and body language in a face to face situation " while some companies arent ready to give virtual recruiting a try most understand the need to go beyond formulaic techniques to succeed in todays hot job market nearly two thirds
