b a recruiters who hire full time business school graduates all interviews were conducted online from dec to march the recruiters who were asked to rate schools with which they had recent experience provided a total of school ratings to qualify for a ranking a school needed a minimum of recruiter ratings the schools the universe of u s schools was based on information from aacsb international the major accrediting organization for business schools the universe of non u s schools was created through discussions with experts in the field of m b a recruiting only schools with traditional full time programs that graduated at least students from those programs in were eligible for the survey the final sample included u s schools and non u s schools which were invited to submit lists and contact information of individuals who recruit their students schools that didnt send recruiter information but still met our eligibility criteria were ranked by recruiters submitted by other schools these include harvard business school the university of pennsylvania and the university of toronto the recruiters the wall street journal and harris interactive contacted recruiters by email and or regular mail recruiters were asked to identify all schools with which they had recruiting experiences since september recruiters identifying more than three schools were randomly assigned three of those schools to rate so that a single recruiter could rate a maximum of three schools recruiters identifying three or fewer schools were asked but not required to rate all schools identified this year more recruiters than in years past rated all three schools they were eligible to rate of recruiters rated one school rated two schools and rated three as in previous years business schools didnt have control over which schools recruiters chose to rate to ensure that only qualified recruiters participated we conducted a detailed audit of the results recruiters who provided unusual ratings were removed from the overall sample ratings from those who didnt qualify as a recruiter were also removed from the results among the recruiters were company employees or managers who engaged in m b a recruiting were human resources professionals and were either executive search firm recruiters or independent consultants the three rankings of the eligible schools received the necessary minimum of recruiter ratings we are publishing three separate rankings national ranking u s schools regional ranking u s schools international ranking schools u s schools european schools three canadian schools and two latin american schools the national and regional rankings group schools according to the recruiters they share which is based on where recruiters say they tend to recruit to create these two groups we conducted a multivariate analysis known as hierarchical clustering based on the schools that recruiters said they had had contact with since september the international ranking comprises schools grouped according to the number of recruiters that placed graduates in positions outside of the u s or equally inside and outside the u s the ranking components and calculating the year rank the ranking components for all schools measured in the year survey include three elements perception the perceptions of the school and its students on attributes for more on the attributes please go to wsj com bschools supportive behavior future plans to recruit at the school and hire its graduates based on two attributes mass appeal for national and regional schools the number of recruiters indicating that they recruit from the school for international schools the number of recruiters that place graduates in jobs outside the u s or equally inside and outside the u s each of these three components accounts for one third of a schools overall rank its final year rank is based on an average of its year and year rank for new schools american university tulane university the university of missouri columbia essec business school and the university of oxford the final rank is based on year results only interpreting the results when interpreting the results of the entire sample to the wall street journal harris interactive recruiter year survey differences of plus or minus three percentage points can be considered statistically different at the confidence level ratings for each school however are based on smaller sample sizes though we believe the final sample of recruiters rating each school can be considered representative of recruiters for that school the results based on these smaller sample sizes may prevent conclusions that include statements about statistically significant differences online today for a more detailed explanation of the surveys methodology go to
