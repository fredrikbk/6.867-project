overhaul at time warner bewkess rise to top may bring little shift despite streets hopes for most of this year investors have been waiting impatiently to hear when time warner inc s no executive jeffrey l bewkes would be confirmed as the successor to chief executive officer richard d parsons many on wall street view mr bewkes as something akin to a corporate action hero likely to break up time warner jump starting its long stalled share price mr bewkes president and chief operating officer is finally poised to get the top slot but it is far from certain that his appointment will usher in a period of drastic change and that means any hopes of a sustained rally in time warner stock could be misplaced time warner is expected to confirm mr bewkes as the next ceo before the end of the year people familiar with the matter say he is expected to take the reins as early as jan five months before mr parsonss contract expires mr parsons is expected to retain the chairmans title time warners board has yet to vote on mr bewkess appointment but that could happen in the coming weeks these people say the announcement will be cheered by investors time warner stock is down nearly this year partly reflecting concerns the company has fallen into a state of limbo with a conservative board and a lame duck ceo the recent decline has wiped out nearly all the gains the stock made after activist investor carl icahn mounted a campaign for a breakup of time warner in late mr icahn dropped his campaign early last year when mr parsons agreed to a big increase in the companys stock buyback program some analysts see a buying opportunity in the recent slump last week lehman brothers reinstated coverage of the stock with a "buy" recommendation citing a "compelling valuation" and the potential for a sweeping restructuring under mr bewkes in p m composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange time warner shares were down cents to &# giving the company a market value of about &# billion the shares trade at times estimated per share earnings for slightly richer than its peers seen as the mastermind behind hbos transformation into a hugely profitable cable network mr bewkes is regarded as more open than mr parsons to the kind of radical restructuring sought by investors wall streets dream scenario calls for a spinoff of the time warner cable division along with aol and the time inc magazine unit that would leave time warner as a "pure play" content company owning cable networks and a film studio "people want a change of structure " says bernstein research analyst michael nathanson who rates time warners stock a "buy " but there isnt any guarantee that mr bewkes will take such radical action say people close to him associates say he is worried that a major restructuring may have little or no effect on the stock price undermining one of the principal reasons for a breakup some investors say mr bewkes has good reason to hesitate they believe the biggest factor weighing on time warner stock as on other media shares is anxiety about the impact of new technology not only are digital video recorders making it easier for television viewers to skip commercials but investors worry that internet upstarts such as video sharing site youtube are hurting the ability of media companies to resell their films and tv shows in different media one "overarching concern is what youtube might portend for the profitability of these media companies " says henry berghoef a fund manager at harris associates one of time warners biggest shareholders with about million shares he cautioned that restructuring the portfolio "would only make sense if you can derive some kind of benefit from doing it " he believes that in its current form time warner is sufficiently transparent for investors to calculate the value of each of its divisions "would shareholders be better off if aol were spun off its hard to make that call right now " he says "at the end of the day what really matters is that theyre doing a first rate job operating the company and allocating capital" through share buybacks mr bewkes also has a precedent to consider two years ago viacom inc chairman sumner redstone frustrated with the companys lagging stock price split his media empire in two his slow growing broadcast assets became cbs corp while the mtv and nickelodeon cable networks and paramount pictures film studio were placed in a slimmed down viacom since the split viacoms stock price has fallen while cbs has risen a viacom shareholder before the split would have a net gain of about compared with a rise in the s&amp p stock index the trajectory of viacom and cbs shares since the split has given mr bewkes pause people close to him say another reason mr bewkes might hesitate about doing anything radical he will still have to contend with his current boss as chairman mr parsons would likely have the power to hinder such moves which would seem a rejection of his custodianship that said mr parsons has told some colleagues that he wouldnt block mr bewkes from running the company however he sees fit mr parsons is credited with healing the companys wounds after the merger with aol and streamlining the companys portfolio of businesses such as by selling warner music one of the companys oldest businesses but some investors complain that he has been unwilling to take more radical measures if mr bewkes does shy away from a breakup investors are likely to want answers on how he will deal with challenges facing some of the companys businesses the biggest question concerns aol mr bewkes presided over a major overhaul of the online unit last year deciding to offer the subscription service for free to people with high speed internet services but an unexpected decline in aols advertising growth in the second quarter forced time warner to lower guidance for aols revenue the first time in several years that the company has missed a target if mr bewkes fails to address such problems quickly the pressure for a breakup will likely become too great for him to withstand already some major investors who opposed mr icahns plans two years ago have concluded that a split up is the only option to get the stock price higher "the sooner it happens the better " says one
