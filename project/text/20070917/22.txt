chinas one child mistake if china could take a single decision today to enhance the nations long term economic outlook it would be to recognize that coercive population control has been a tragic and historic mistake and to abandon it immediately such a call might surprise the casual observer for on its own terms chinas population program has been a superficial success in the early s chinas then current childbearing patterns implied nearly five births per woman at the start of the "one child policy" in chinas total fertility rate was nearly three births per woman today chinas fertility rate is far below the "net reproduction rate" by many estimates just births per woman nationwide in some major population centers beijing shanghai and tianjin among them the average number of births per woman today has fallen below one baby per lifetime this "success " however comes with immense inadvertent costs and unintended consequences thanks to a decade and a half of sub replacement fertility chinas working age population is poised to peak in size and then start to decline more or less indefinitely within less than a decade a generation from now chinas potential labor force ages will be no larger than it is today perhaps smaller this presages a radical change in chinas growth environment from the generation just completed during which time the countrys working age population expanded by over "composition effects" only make the picture worse until now young people have been the life force raising the overall level of education and technical attainment in chinas work force but between and chinas age group is slated to slump in absolute size with a projected decline of over in store in fact the only part of the working age population that stands to increase in size between now and is the over cohort will they bring the dynamism we have come to expect from china in recent decades on current trajectories chinas total population will start to decline around even so china must expect a "population explosion" between then and now one entirely comprised of senior citizens between and chinas plus age cohort will likely more than double in size to million or more from about million now and because of the fall off in young people chinas age profile will "gray" in the decades ahead at a pace almost never before witnessed in human history china is still a fairly youthful society today but by by such metrics as median population age the country will be "grayer" than the united states "grayer " that is than the u s of not the u s of today how will chinas future senior citizens support themselves china still has no official national pension system up to now chinas de facto national pension system has been the family but that social safety net is unraveling and rapidly until very recently thanks to relatively large chinese families almost every chinese woman had given birth to at least one son under confucian tradition their first line of support but just two decades from now thanks to the "success" of the one child policy roughly a third of women entering their s will have no living son in such numbers one can see the making of a slow motion humanitarian tragedy but the withering away of the chinese family under population control has even more far reaching implications in beijing shanghai and other parts of china extreme sub replacement fertility has already been in effect for over a generation if this continues for another generation we will see the emergence of a new norm a " family" composed of four grandparents but only two children and just one grandchild the children in these new family structures will have no brothers or sisters no uncles or aunts and no cousins their only blood relatives will be their ancestors it is no secret that china is already a "low trust society" personal and business transactions still rely heavily upon guanxi the network of personal relations largely demarcated by family ties what exactly will provide the "social capital" to undergird commercial and economic development in a future china where "families" are increasingly little more than atomized households and isolated individuals one final consequence of chinas population control program requires comment the eerie unnatural and increasingly extreme imbalance between baby boys and baby girls under normal circumstances about to baby boys are born for every baby girls shortly after the advent of the one child policy however china began reporting biologically impossible disparities between boys and girls and the imbalance has only continued to rise today china reports baby boys for every girls over the coming generation those same little boys and girls will grow up to be prospective brides and grooms one need not be a demographer to see from these numbers the massive imbalance in the "marriage market" in a generation or less how will china cope with the sudden and very rapid emergence of tens of millions of essentially unmarriageable young men all of these problems just described are directly associated with involuntary population control scrapping this restrictive birth control policy would surely ease chinas incipient aging crisis its looming family structure problems and its worrisome gender imbalances some in chinas leadership may worry that the end of the one child policy might mean the return to the five child family but in reality modern china is most unlikely to return to pre industrial fertility norms in the final analysis the wealth of nations in the modern world is not found in the ground or the forests or in other natural resources the true wealth of modern countries resides in their people in human resources chinas people are not a curse they are a blessing the chinese people like people elsewhere are rational calculating actors who seek to improve their own circumstances not heedless beasts who procreate without thought of the future trusting chinas people to act in their own self interest not least of all trusting their choices and preferences with respect to their own family size may very well prove to be the key to whether china ultimately succeeds in abolishing poverty and attaining mass affluence in the decades and generations ahead mr eberstadt is a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute this essay is excerpted from remarks delivered at the
