business schools the recruiters picks a special report just for you as executive education classes become almost commodities schools find it pays to offer companies customized programs when autodesk inc decided it needed to sharpen its management teams financial sophistication the software company shopped around for the best possible executive development program but the many off the shelf choices it found even those at top flight business schools didnt seem quite right "as i looked at the content of the canned programs at different schools so much of it was manufacturing focused and not very relevant to autodesk " says al castino chief financial officer eventually autodesk collaborated with dartmouth colleges tuck school of business to craft a custom program that addressed the companys particular needs "tucks professors used case studies specifically about software companies " says mr castino "and discussed stock valuation return on investment and accounting principles as they relate to our industry " many schools are finding that such customized offerings promise the most growth in the increasingly competitive executive education market while open enrollment programs still generate plenty of revenue some common courses such as finance for nonfinancial executives or advanced management have become almost commodities with little distinctive marketing value executive education programs grew fast during the s but companies cut back sharply in the recession especially after the terrorist attacks of sept since then spending for executive development has gradually rebounded but now the prime target market of to year old managers is shrinking as the baby boomers age whats more business schools are facing greater competition not just from within their ranks but also from corporate universities and private firms specializing in management training "the days of easy growth are over " says stephen burnett associate dean of executive education at the kellogg school of management at northwestern university "to be successful you have to be far more strategic smarter and devote more resources to the business " in addition to custom programs for individual companies schools are competing in this crowded market by offering more courses on timely topics like managing the new work force and understanding asia theyre also targeting certain niches such as women re entering the workplace managers in the life sciences industry media and entertainment executives and minority owned businesses and theyre entering new international markets from china to the middle east but its custom programs for individual clients that schools are focusing on most companies want to ensure a solid return on their educational investment and programs tailored to their particular problems and strategies generally provide a bigger more immediate payback than open enrollment courses "in the past companies were less worried about the roi on the learning dollar but now theyre much more concerned about bang for the buck " says eric weber associate dean of iese business school in barcelona spain which is working with abbott laboratories on global business issues and nissan motor co on innovation and risk taking "in a custom program companies can send more of their people for training and drive the agenda by developing course materials that will help solve some of their problems " while some custom programs focus on technical business skills schools are increasingly being called on to groom future leaders thats why constellation brands inc wanted to collaborate with tuck on a custom program "we found we had some people at very senior levels who were going to retire or change positions soon creating a gap in our succession plan " says gigi lamb senior vice president and chief human resources officer for the alcoholic beverage producer "we wanted to develop our people and increase the bench strength for our top key positions " more than of constellations senior vice presidents and vice presidents participated in the one week program last march at tuck honing such leadership and general management skills as strategy communications finance and marketing as well as learning to motivate teams and become "facilitators of change " at the end of the course teams were assigned seven "action learning projects" on critical issues facing constellation and they will report their findings to top management this month "were becoming learning partners with companies and taking on almost a quasi consulting role " says anant sundaram faculty director for executive education at tuck "with projects like constellations a company ends up with something very actionable we also can do individual coaching to maximize leadership development and conduct follow up work with the talent development folks at companies " most executive education programs last a few days or a week as companies try to minimize managers time away from the office but some schools are designing longer more intensive courses columbia university this summer drew more than newly promoted deutsche bank ag investment banking associates from around the world to its new york campus for a two week boot camp on strategy finance capital markets and interpersonal leadership skills it was also an opportunity for the young associates to meet and network for the first time with colleagues from other countries "right now were benefiting in executive education from the tight labor market " says troy eggers associate dean for executive education at columbia business school "companies are investing more in their people not only to develop their management abilities but also to cement the bond with them and hopefully retain them " some long term custom programs reach beyond the business school and draw in professors from other parts of the university statoil asa the norwegian oil company has formed a partnership with the university of california at berkeley for a one year interdisciplinary program to prepare managers for projects in africa the middle east and other parts of the world in addition to business school professors the statoil program brings in experts in engineering international studies sociology and psychology to teach classes that participants attend for one week each quarter statoils own executives also teach in some classes and a statoil representative is even stationed at berkeley to work regularly with the schools administrators and professors "were helping prepare statoils people for managing in uncertainty communicating in cross cultural environments and understanding the sociopolitical history of other regions of the world " says whitney hischier assistant dean of the center for executive development at berkeleys haas school of business "we have also brought in psychology professors who study microfacial expressions and show how style and physical appearance affect power and negotiations " while companies are their major customers business schools are designing customized executive education programs for nonprofit organizations and government agencies too northwesterns kellogg school has helped u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies with strategy management post columbia is developing a program in basic business skills for museum curators and the university of north carolina at chapel hill is working closely with the defense department some professors even went aboard aircraft carriers and to training facilities to understand better the business operations of the military "we do programs with the military on leading organizational change supply chain issues and finance " says james w dean jr senior associate dean for academic affairs at uncs kenan flagler business school "our marketing professors have also worked with military recruiting " at many schools custom programs now account for more than half of their executive education revenue but some deans warn that its risky to become overly reliant on them when business prospects suddenly worsen or a company is acquired custom programs often get canceled schools learned just how vulnerable custom programs are after "back then it was ugly a lot of custom stuff just evaporated " says dr burnett of northwestern currently he estimates that about of kelloggs executive education revenue is from custom programs and about from open enrollment courses "id like it to be closer to from open " he says "because custom can be here today gone tomorrow "
