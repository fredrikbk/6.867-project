theory &amp practice how teams can work well together from far apart international business machines corp programmer rob nicholson has never met most of the colleagues on three continents with whom he collaborates on writing software but mr nicholson feels part of a team from the moment he logs on each morning in hursley england colleagues in india alerted that mr nicholson is online fire questions then mr nicholson checks notes on interactive bulletin boards or wikis that his team shares one recent day he found notes from teammates in india suggesting changes to a proposed software design that he had posted the previous night he revised the design that day mr nicholson says the constant communication helps him feel there are "lots of people attacking the same hill " ibm uses high tech tools to grapple with an increasingly common problem making far flung teams work well together a growing number and variety of companies divide work globally semiconductor maker intel corp designs chips in israel and india as well as in the u s carpet maker tai ping carpets international ltd recently asked design directors in new york paris and hong kong to jointly choose colors for residential carpets but managing disparate teams is tricky says arie lewin a professor at duke universitys fuqua school of business in durham n c co workers often find it hard to monitor one anothers progress coordinate efforts or share information he says global teams must overcome language and cultural barriers often members in one location dont know or trust those in other places engineers in the u s who feel their jobs are threatened by colleagues in china may hoard information rather than share it mr lewin says "the big problem is organizational " he says mr lewin says successful teams seek a common understanding of their task set firm ground rules and encourage members to get to know one another preferably in person ibms task is particularly daunting most companies assign different tasks to teams in different locations but mr nicholson shares tasks with colleagues in india and canada around the clock work gets done faster patty dudek says her person group which includes mr nicholson can revise its main product called websphere in four months down from to months for an equivalent product update a few years ago but sharing tasks this way requires strict rules and constant communication so team members dont get in one anothers way programmers keep tabs on what is going on through the wikis to which they post progress reports and comments they get automatic alerts when important pieces of their project change and they keep in touch with faraway colleagues through instant messaging and phone software which display photos and personal details of co workers one key to smooth teamwork is dividing projects into small pieces mr nicholson says the team of charged with making ibms websphere software work with code written in other programming languages breaks projects into two week chunks each chunk is further split into tasks designed to take one programmer a day or two to complete that means mistakes or miscommunications are caught quickly and there is little waiting for others to finish work programmers keep their task list on a wiki that can be seen and edited by everyone on the team which includes about people in hursley in bangalore india and in ottawa each morning mr nicholson typically takes an unassigned task from the top of the list and puts his name on it when he is done generally by the end of the day he notes on the wiki that he has completed the task and puts additional documentation in a shared database "with this method youre always progressing checking your sanity constantly " mr nicholson says when the software fails a test which could stall work around the globe all stop what they are doing to diagnose the problem says noel odowd the hursley based leader of the person group that mr nicholson is in at the hursley office team members rigged to the testing machine a light that turns red when there is a serious problem other teams are thinking of following suit "the light almost becomes a call to arms " mr odowd says clear and frequent communication is important says kalpana margabandhu who oversees bangalores websphere developers ms margabandhu tells new programmers to learn about the other members on their team so they know where to go for help she also encourages developers to contact colleagues immediately with questions an important message for indian programmers who tend to be reluctant to interrupt others she says mr nicholson says that openness is essential in order to keep the information and work flowing "dont lock stuff up " he says working together managers and experts offer these keys for productive global teamwork have a common understanding of the task clarify roles and responsibilities set firm ground rules get to know other team members communicate often source wsj research
