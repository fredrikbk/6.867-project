its managers around the globe arent used to being pressured by headquarters to work harder and faster in the past year mr polman has brought in some p&amp g techniques to try to force nestle managers

cream and u k candy businesses to report their progress each month backed by mr brabeck mr polman hasnt met much resistance so far in the top job though the year old mr polman may risk a culture clash if he tries to impose too much of p&amp gs management style also having already gone after the low hanging fruit he could have a tough time squeezing more growth out of the huge company still mr polmans european experience he was born in a small town in the netherlands and has spent most of his career working in europe will help him understand what will work at nestle says wade miquelon chief financial officer of tyson foods inc and formerly p&amp gs finance director for western europe where he worked closely with mr polman "he brings a lot of energy and ideas with him and that should help him gain a following there particularly with the younger generation of managers " mr miquelon says mr polmans main rival for the top job has been paul bulcke executive vice president for the americas

polmans chances as an eventual successor to p&amp gs ceo dimmed when the company named four others as vice chairmen he had been hurt in part because he had spent virtually his entire career in europe
