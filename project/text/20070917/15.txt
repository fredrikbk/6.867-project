business schools the recruiters picks a special report recruiters top schools in the annual wsj harris interactive survey two familiar faces and a newcomer head the rankings its an eclectic mix atop this years wall street journal harris interactive rankings of m b a programs an ivy league college in new england that created americas first graduate business school a mormon university in utah whose mission is to develop "men and women of faith" into outstanding leaders and a spanish school that was established by a group of jesuits and local businessmen in the journals seventh annual survey of recruiters favorite m b a programs dartmouth colleges tuck school of business is back on top for the second time in the national u s ranking joined by brigham young universitys marriott school of management which placed first for the first time in the regional u s ranking and barcelonas esade business school in its second consecutive no finish in the international ranking while they are three very different schools in many respects recruiters praised them all for their collegial ethical and hard working m b a graduates in fact when asked which schools graduates demonstrate strong ethical standards recruiters named dartmouth most often followed closely by brigham young this year recruiters took an online survey between dec and march and rated full time m b a programs on different attributes including students leadership potential and strategic thinking their previous work experience the faculty and curriculum and the career services office of all the attributes recruiters said interpersonal and communication skills a teamwork orientation personal ethics and integrity analytical and problem solving abilities and a strong work ethic matter most to them to be eligible for the rankings a school must receive at least ratings from survey respondents who recently recruited there what differentiates each ranking is the type of recruiters the schools attract but the ratings of all schools across the three rankings are based on how recruiters evaluated them on the same attributes as well as the recruiters intention to return and hire a schools graduates over the next two years in addition the rankings include a "mass appeal" factor which is the number of recruiters that the national and regional schools attract for the international ranking the mass appeal measure is different in that it reflects the global reach of the m b a program schools can qualify for the international list only if they attract enough recruiters who place a large number of their graduates in jobs outside the u s the highly competitive market for m b a talent clearly affected the rankings this year some schools received lower ratings because recruiters failed to hire as many m b a graduates as they had hoped and because they said they encountered more "uppity attitudes" from students and less cooperation from career services offices "i felt the students were very lax and carefree similar to what you would have expected during the technology boom when everybody received a dozen job offers " a management consulting recruiter complained in his assessment of a major u s business school "i did not see the eagerness the passion and the drive that students really need to demonstrate in order to be successful in the fast paced consulting environment " national ranking dartmouths tuck school of business in hanover n h resumed its winning streak as survey respondents repeatedly praised its students for being down to earth team players tuck received its highest ratings this year for its "well rounded" students their personal integrity interpersonal and communication skills and teamwork abilities "tuck students live and breathe teamwork " says douglas asano a survey respondent and director inside sales for j m huber corp in charlotte n c "the admissions process requires applicants to have a demonstrated excellence in teamwork and then the faculty curriculum and culture inculcate a practical understanding of teamwork at every step of the tuck experience " many recruiters also cited tuck for excellence in teaching strategy and general management like tuck the majority of the schools in the national ranking are private universities they were chosen for this ranking because they share many of the same recruiters from major companies banks and consulting firms that typically pay the biggest salaries and bonuses the most unexpected change in the national ranking this year the university of michigans drop to seventh place from no last year michigan had rivaled tuck with its consistently strong showing in the survey in previous years but some recruiters now complain about both the students and the career services office one survey respondent said more michigan students are demonstrating a "whats in it for me " attitude than in the past while another recruiter urged the career office to "be more customer friendly " "students werent as prepared for interviews and were somewhat more arrogant than in the past " says david gallon a survey respondent and senior strategic research consultant truck and suv for toyota motor corp in torrance calif "overall i would say the students seemed ultra relaxed and felt that they didnt need to try to impress the interviewers but rather that the interviewers should try to impress them " he adds that students he talked with werent nearly as knowledgeable about the auto industry or toyota in particular as he would have expected several recruiters also complained about the disruptions caused by construction of a new business school building on the michigan campus in ann arbor northwestern university is another school that tumbled in the ranking to th place from sixth after a number of years near the top of the ranking recruiters said they were displeased with the pompous attitudes of some students at northwesterns kellogg school of management some students also proved disappointing in their financial knowledge while he found very qualified students at kellogg shad driggs a survey respondent and economic evaluations manager for bp plc in chicago says he was concerned that some students could not answer one of his questions about depreciation "it is a question every m b a should nail " he says "we were very surprised to see students near the end of their m b a program still lacking a rudimentary understanding of such a basic accounting principle " the sloan school of management at the massachusetts institute of technology made a notable gain in the ranking jumping six places to no it also moved up three places in the international ranking to no recruiters gave mit its highest marks for students analytical skills and work ethic and named it more than any other school for excellence in teaching information technology and operations management "sloan students are more street smart and come across as team players and collaborators and thats what we want " says anurag harsh a survey respondent and director of corporate and business development at cnn in new york also noteworthy was the university of california at los angeles which rose to no after three straight years in the cellar recruiters said they are most impressed with uclas anderson school of management for its diversity and energy and for students strong leadership interpersonal and teamwork skills harvard university and stanford university two schools that typically rank low despite reputations for academic excellence again were criticized for what recruiters said were their students inflated egos and excessive expectations nevertheless their graduates still end up landing some of the highest paying jobs regional ranking the first place crown for brigham young in provo utah comes as no surprise given its consistently strong performance in previous journal rankings year in and year out recruiters rave about graduates maturity competitive drive integrity and international experience especially from their missionary work for the church of jesus christ of latter day saints academically the marriott school receives high marks in the journal survey for its accounting program some recruiters also are finding that more brigham young m b a s make a good fit for investment banking "byu has put much more emphasis in preparing their students for investment banking " says steven potter a survey respondent and managing director at banc of america securities in new york "at both the b a and m b a levels they have had outside firms come to the school to give a course on valuation techniques that is much more practical than theoretical " he notes that one of the students his bank hired took a three week investment banking crash course in london over the christmas holiday at a personal cost of &# in hopes it would give him an edge "byu students are hungry and aggressive but easy to work with " mr potter adds "they seem to have a greater desire to prove themselves and their school " thunderbird school of global management last years top rated regional school experienced quite a turnabout slipping spots in recruiters said the school produces some stars but that it admits too many students who lack enough work experience survey respondents also were critical of the many international students with weak communication skills and the need for visa sponsorships to work in the u s "thunderbird attracts good students who want ex pat careers but also average students who can afford the steep price and want to ride thunderbirds above average reputation " says tom kondo a survey respondent and human resources manager for loreal paris in new york "often times the average students will claim interest in international or ex pat careers but dont really have the skills or desire to follow through when we interview there we always have to weed these students out " thunderbird also fell five spots to no in the international ranking even so recruiters said they still consider it the top school in the world for teaching about international business unlike the national schools the regional m b a programs a mix of public and private schools spread across the u s tend to attract recruiters based primarily in their home area or neighboring states as the largest of the three rankings the regional tally usually has the biggest swings from year to year if several schools make significant gains in their ratings other m b a programs will get pushed lower in the ranking even though their scores may remain relatively stable the entry of three new m b a programs into this years regional ranking the university of missouri in columbia american university and tulane university also contributed to the reshuffling of the schools among the biggest gainers this year were three boston area schools boston university boston college and babson college babson placed highest of the three at no up spots from last year some recruiters said babson best known for its entrepreneurship program deserves credit for creating stronger relationships with companies through its career services office three new schools broke into the top indiana university the university of florida and emory university indiana jumped places to no this year as recruiters noted that students are more polished and sharper especially in their marketing skills and that the career services office has become more responsive the survey respondents awarded indiana higher scores this year for incorporating experiential learning into the curriculum faculty expertise and course content and overall recruiting value "indianas graduate career services office is increasingly partnering with corporations such as johnson &amp johnson to identify high caliber students that meet the companys needs " says scott kleman a survey respondent and senior financial analyst at j&amp js ethicon endo surgery unit in cincinnati the school promotes "real life projects that allow companies and students to work together in a pseudo internship the companies have another channel to meet and evaluate talent while students are able to apply their learning to a practical problem and make a good impression on a potential employer " several other big ten schools lost significant ground this year including michigan state university the university of iowa and purdue university in fact purdue which fell to th place from fourth last year had been no in the and regional rankings but this year recruiters were more critical particularly about students limited work experience international ranking overall the international ranking was quite stable with only small changes in the positions of most schools esade and switzerlands international institute for management development imd held on to first and second place again this year while no london business school and no ipade business school in mexico swapped places this year esade was rated highest for students personal integrity their teamwork abilities and the career services office "i like recruiting esade students because they have true internationalism and a teamwork orientation that are invaluable at my company and so difficult and time consuming to develop " says sanae parra a survey respondent and business management associate for adidas ag in herzogenaurach germany "the school does not promote cutthroat competition among peers " the international ranking includes a mix of european canadian and mexican schools along with nine u s schools from the other two rankings two european schools made their first appearance in the international ranking this year essec business school in france in seventh place and the university of oxford in the u k at no two u s schools northwestern university and new york university also are newcomers among the schools in this years international ranking essec with two campuses in the paris region debuted quite high as recruiters cited the students"open minded entrepreneurial spirit " essec received its top scores for students teamwork focus recruiters success with past hires from the school graduates fit with the corporate culture and their personal integrity another french school the hec school of management near paris made the biggest jump in this years international roster rising to no from th last year what makes hec shine recruiters said is the growing international diversity of its m b a students some recruiters also found interviewing at hec refreshing in this hot job market as one survey respondent observed "hec students are more motivated and hungry than at some of the other leading m b a programs "
