greenspans dismay extends both ways washington former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan spent much of the past years as an influential economic adviser to both republicans and democrats but today feels estranged from both news coverage of his memoir has focused on his criticism of republicans for forsaking their small government principles but in an interview with the wall street journal mr greenspan expressed just as much dismay with the democratic party mr greenspan a self described libertarian republican said he was "fairly close" to president clintons economic advisers treasury secretaries robert rubin and lawrence summers and deputy treasury secretary roger altman "the clinton administration was a pretty centrist party " he said "but theyre not governing again the next administration may have the clinton administration name but the democratic party has moved very significantly in the wrong direction " he said referring to the democratic partys populist bent especially its skepticism of free trade mr greenspan told cbss " minutes" in an interview broadcast last night that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton is "unquestionably capable" and "very smart " but still his "tendency would be to vote republican " yet in his interview with the wall street journal he said he isnt sure how he will vote "i doubt if i would vote democrat " he said "i just may not vote at the moment its extremely hard to say "im saddened by the whole political process and its not an accident that republicans deserved to lose in it wasnt that the democrats deserved to win " he said "when it came time to rule all of a sudden their ratings collapsed and the reason they collapsed is theyre just as negative as the republicans " in the journal interview mr greenspan also said he had put the odds of a national decline in housing prices at less than at least until a couple of months ago based largely on the experience of britain and australia his book notes that in both countries home prices after sustained booms have "leveled out or declined slightly but at this writing have not crashed " but he says he has become less optimistic since his book was finished when it became clear the construction industry was unable to reduce the number of housing starts below the rapidly falling level of home sales there is now a "very large" inventory of unsold newly built homes whose condition is deteriorating more rapidly than say a steel mills and that puts pressure on builders to sell them quickly he said as a result "we have the capability of far bigger price declines " which will pinch home equity lead to more defaults on subprime mortgages and pressure consumer spending the probability of a recession which earlier this year he put at one third is now "slightly more than a third " he said mr greenspan was appointed fed chairman by president reagan in and served through early "i was brought up in the republican party of barry goldwater he was for fiscal restraint and for deregulation for open markets for trade " mr greenspan said in the interview "social issues were not a critical factor the republican party which ruled the house the senate and the presidency i no longer recognize its fundamentally been focusing on how to maintain political power and my question is for what purpose " he also expresses puzzlement over mr bushs and mr cheneys continued advocacy of antiterrorism policies that have the effect of curtailing civil liberties if there had been additional terrorist attacks in the u s after sept he said "cheneys and bushs view would be now far more prevalent" in the u s but "when events changed they held the views that they previously held " he adds that while he doesnt like their stance "i dont know what should have been done otherwise" because he lacks the access to classified information that they have a spokeswoman for mr cheney said he "has enormous respect for alan greenspan and considers him a good friend he looks forward to reading the book " mr greenspan was himself a behind the scenes advocate of overthrowing former iraqi leader saddam hussein he says he felt "getting saddam out of there was very important " not because of weapons of mass destruction but because he was convinced the iraqi dictator wanted to control the strait of hormuz through which a sizable portion of the worlds oil passes that would enable him to threaten the u s and its allies he said he conveyed that view to both mr cheney and then defense secretary donald rumsfeld another friend from the ford administration but doubts that played a part in the bush administrations decision to invade iraq he recalls one administration official telling him such an argument couldnt fly politically which mr greenspan assumed to mean because of mr bushs and mr cheneys background in the oil industry yesterday defense secretary robert gates appearing on abcs "this week " rejected the assertion in mr greenspans book that the iraq war "is largely about oil " mr gates said "its about stability in the gulf its about rogue regimes trying to develop weapons of mass destruction "
