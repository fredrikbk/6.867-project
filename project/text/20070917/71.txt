the evening wrap another shot online edition hillary clintons new health care proposal marked the new york senators return to the territory where she suffered a high profile defeat more than a dozen years ago when she was a white house resident speaking in iowa the democratic presidential candidate unveiled monday a broad health care plan which at its core would require everyone to have health insurance and offer federal assistance to help cut the cost of coverage as part of the program which would cost an estimated &# billion per year ms clinton added that the rich should pay higher taxes to defray the cost for those less able to pay for it the plan builds on the current health care system letting those who get their insurance through employers continue to do so it would require that companies offer insurance to employees or contribute to a government run pool that helps pay for the uncovered there would also be a tax subsidy available for small businesses to help them afford to offer coverage the plan pitched by ms clinton which follows other health insurance ideas from both republican and democratic rivals is not as ambitious as the plan she pushed during her husbands presidency between and back then the proposal centered on a complicated and strongly regulated system based on a requirement for employers to provide insurance to all workers as well as the creation of powerful insurance purchasing agencies as go betweens for consumers and health providers that plan died in congress in and in promoting her new approach ms clinton clearly wanted to keep it from being cast as heavy handed government involvement "i know my republican opponents will try to equate health care for all americans with government run health care dont let them fool us again this is not government run " she said though she has a longer history of involvement in the health care arena than some of her political rivals ms clinton and other politicians are responding to an upsurge in interest in health care as a political issue this shift mirrors the surging and inflation topping costs of health care that have become a problem for both private companies and consumers alike indeed

turnstile then kept pushing while he straddled the crate eventually managing to get stuck "i was stuck like a worm my eyes were as big as grapefruits " he said "i cant describe the feeling in my stomach i cant move up or down " mr hanna eventually managed to wriggle free though the box stayed jammed until he walked to a nearby fire station for help it took three firefighters to get the flamingo out of the predicament the associated press contributed to this report write to matt phillips at matt phillips wsj com
