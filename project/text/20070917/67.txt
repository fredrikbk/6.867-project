sexuality sex crimes and the single unsuspecting college student christian c sahner understates the real problem in his critique of princetons entry in the freshman orientation industry a "university organized student performed play designed to warn about sexual assault and alcohol abuse" "sexed up sex ed " editorial page sept these programs ubiquitous today in higher education are not aimed at redressing real problems nor answering questions that the typical student actually asks they are instead geared toward inculcating freshmen with particular social political or cultural viewpoints they fall under the category of mandatory sensitivity or social training where post modern academic concepts seeking to define and regulate the relationships between different genders races religions and nationalities are forced upon freshmen who typically do not even have the option of failing to show up college students as legally presumptive adults should not be treated like elementary school students in need of the most basic social training until college administrators understand that college is not the modern day equivalent of a north korean pow camp with forced political and social indoctrination for new arrivals our freshmen are going to have to put up with these kinds of tendentious intrusions into their minds and very beings colleges need to return to the task of educating as peter berkowitz brilliantly argues in his essay "our compassless colleges" in the same issue rather than training students harvey a silverglate princeton class of cambridge mass the writer is co author of the shadow university the betrayal of liberty on americas campuses mr sahner mischaracterized a princeton university sex crime prevention program and used quotes an administrator gave to another newspaper two years ago about a completely different subject to misrepresent the universitys position on the issues addressed in the article the freshman orientation play "sex on a saturday night" is not princetons version of sex education its not a play about sexuality but rather about crime because it is vital to provide incoming students with information and resources regarding sexual assault and prevention under federal campus crime laws universities are required to provide such sexual offense awareness information and programs however more important than this requirement is princetons commitment to communicating to the newest members of our campus the standards and expectations the university has including fostering a collective responsibility for each others well being the point of the exercise is to help students parse the distinctions between consensual and non consensual sex and to think clearly about how their own behavior might fall in relation to these distinctions "sex on a saturday night" emphasizes that consent is the principal legal consideration before and during sexual activity and it emphasizes that approximately of female college sexual assault survivors know the perpetrator to some extent contrary to the commentators implications religious and cultural beliefs alone are not protective factors against sexual assault and we want to arm students with knowledge and resources that can help them janet smith dickerson vice president for campus life princeton university princeton n j no education about sex is necessary although it is promoted in schools human beings like all animals know how to reproduce without any instruction formal education should be for what we do not know by birth reading writing arithmetic history science including biology etc so called "sex education" is a waste of money and teaches that the purpose of sexual activity is pleasure like teaching that the purpose of eating is pleasant taste in addition it is not necessary for princeton to inform students that rape is a crime anymore than it is necessary to inform anyone that assault robbery embezzlement murder etc are crimes nor even that cheating and plagiarism are wrong judy wubnig waterloo ontario mr sahners report from the heart of princetons required class to freshman titled "sex on saturday night" was excellent its time this kind of smut masquerading as do gooding "education" is brought into the public eye higher education spare me perhaps princetons trustees and their granddaughters should sit in together on the mandatory attendance play in order to check its message kenneth e dubose sugar land texas
