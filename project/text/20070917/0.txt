americas calderonomics as young mexicans have poured across the southern u s border in recent years looking for work a common american refrain has been to blame mexican economic policy even many of us who welcome the new labor for the u s economy have also noted that the mexican governments failure to deepen the economic restructuring begun some years ago has spurred migration imposing a heavy burden on mexican society this reality has not been lost on president felipe calderon he campaigned in the lead up to last years election on a platform that emphasized jobs promising to deliver the policy changes that would bring them about unfortunately mr calderons national action party pan is only a minority in congress and judging by the "reforms" passed there last week his vision of a modernized mexico is still a long way off its bad enough that the governments fiscal reform falls so far short of the pro growth agenda mr calderon promised but to make matters worse opposition parties made passing it contingent on a heavily politicized "electoral reform" and a no strings attached tax cut for the monopoly state owned oil company pemex if there is one lesson from this latest legislative struggle between modernizers and mexicos old guard in the institutional revolutionary party pri its that timidity when confronting dinosaurs doesnt pay mr calderon has been carefully choosing his fights in his first year in office his biggest achievement to date is the reform of the public sector pension system a measure that in the medium term will remove the obligations of the large entitlement program from the budget having one win under his belt mr calderon moved this summer to introduce a fiscal reform designed to close revenue shortfalls a better course of action with oil topping &# a barrel would have been opening the oil market to private investment but this would have challenged the theology that says that the inefficient state owned oil monopoly pemex is sacred mr calderon apparently has decided for now against questioning that taboo instead he chose to go after the productive private sector of the economy where at least some large companies are known to take advantage of a complex exemption ridden regime to dodge tax payments the choice has not been fruitful as i reported in my july column hacienda minister treasury secretary agustin carstens formerly of the international monetary fund chose not to seek growth through lower corporate tax rates and simplification instead he crafted a plan to create a corporate alternative minimum tax the proposal raised the cost of labor on some part of the work force and complicated the code an email i received from the mexican office of a large multinational investment firm insisted that the plan was not biased against skilled labor that conclusion implied that the hacienda proposal was so complicated that even some mexican experts couldnt figure it out john a mclees tax partner at the law firm baker mckenzie collaborated with his mexican counterpart in tijuana on a study that argued convincingly that the proposal did indeed raise the cost of labor for salaries between approximately &# &# middle range pay in mexico when workers cost more companies hire fewer for a president who ran on an employment platform it was a disappointment if the amt is intended as some have speculated to be an end run toward the goal of a single low flat tax not many are buying it most businesses view it as a tax hike and few seem confident that a new tax once adopted would ever be abolished thus the administration normally considered market friendly found itself without even its natural allies in negotiations with congress meanwhile some of the worst elements of mexicos corporatist past were preparing to extract a pound of flesh for their support the bill that finally passed last week sets the amt at increasing it to in three years those rates are lower than originally proposed and the burden on labor has been significantly reduced the government forecasts a revenue increase of billion pesos &# billion to be used for infrastructure investment and social programs for the poor but no one expects it to spur much growth hacienda forecasts that without the reform mexico would have grown at in and with the reform it will grow at still an anemic rate for a developing country what is yet unknown is how the tax changes might affect investment decisions some tax experts are already warning that for u s investors paying the amt could mean double taxation because it is not an income tax and the tax treaty with the u s only covers income taxes as part of the bargain in congress the pri opposition forced the government to hand pemex what amounts to an annual tax cut of billion pesos to grow to billion pesos by a reform minded negotiator might have asked for something in return pemex is highly inefficient and not likely to improve without competition since there is nothing in the mexican constitution that gives pemex the right to the monopoly it has in trading energy products like petrochemicals and gasoline some competition could be introduced without a constitutional amendment this was also an opportunity to force reform in pemexs bankrupt pension plan the government also had to give up important ground in an electoral reform it agreed to fire luis ugalde the head of the supposedly independent federal electoral institute ife and the entire board the hard left revolutionary democratic party wanted this in order to delegitimize mr calderons victory last summer the pri dinosaurs wanted it to extract revenge against political rivals who worked with former president vicente fox to name mr ugalde now they have a say in putting their own nominees on the board the bargain also tightens restrictions on the use of campaign tv and radio spots outlawing "negative" advertising which the ife will judge subjectively and prohibiting private sector issue ads in other words free speech takes a hit in this reform and the ife board is politicized now the only hope that this constitutional change might be defeated is if more than half of mexican states refuse to approve it if not mr calderon will have won his watered down fiscal reform but at a high cost mexicans have to hope that he starts to think bigger and bolder this nibbling around the edges of reform is only going to get him eaten alive by the dinosaurs
