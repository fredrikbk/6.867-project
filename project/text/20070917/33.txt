gms labor talks show progress retiree care fund remains big issue unions fine line general motors corp made significant progress in labor talks with the united auto workers yesterday evening according to people familiar with the negotiations but differences remained over proposals that detroit hopes will help it close the gap with asian rivals teams from gm and the uaw are bargaining over a wide range of issues to replace a four year contract that expired friday most significantly talks include a proposal to unload from gms balance sheet more than &# billion in debts owed to uaw retiree health care and place them in a union controlled trust gm says that burden a legacy of past labor deals adds as much as &# to &# a car to its costs compared with those of rival toyota motor corp by early evening yesterday negotiations over such a proposal were in advanced stages said people familiar with the matter uaw and gm negotiators were studying "a substantive proposal that closes a lot of gaps for both sides " one of these people said despite the progress the situation remained fluid one sticking point emerged late last night over economic concessions proposed by the auto maker said a person familiar with the matter uaw locals and people familiar with the negotiations had said the union had hoped to reach a deal before the end of the day yesterday gm spokeswoman katie mcbride confirmed the parties are negotiating but declined to comment on specifics the uaw picked gm as the so called strike target on thursday a process that usually means the union will negotiate a new national contract first at gm and then use the terms of that deal as the pattern for contracts with ford motor co and chrysler llc the auto makers came into talks demanding cuts capable of helping close the nearly &# per hour labor cost gap between u s auto plants organized by the uaw and the nonunion plants run by asian competitors people close to the negotiations say the uaw is walking a fine line in these talks because it wants to show u s workers for asian auto makers that it has the ability to negotiate without causing big disruptions but it also needs to show its shrinking membership that it is standing tough in the face of detroits demands the uaw is trying to organize asian auto maker plants in the south while winning support for its next contract from current workers as negotiations in detroit have crawled along the threat of a strike seems to have eased on thursday for instance uaw officials at gm plants received phone calls telling them to prepare for a potential strike if the two sides failed to sign a new agreement by the expiration of the current contract at around midnight on friday yesterday key plants in gms manufacturing web were telling workers to plan on showing up for work today at the bargaining table debate over the construction of a new uaw trust or veba for retiree health care liabilities is the key issue the auto maker and the union are haggling over how much money gm and its rivals will pour into the veba in order to make it a viable source of benefit funding for hundreds of thousands of retirees and family members if the uaw goes ahead with setting up a veba it would almost assuredly open the door to benefit reductions because the trust would probably not be designed to fully absorb double digit medical cost inflation the creation of a veba is one of several issues standing in the way of a contract between the uaw and gm at this point people close to the negotiations say gm which is in close contact with ford and chrysler officials has shown willingness to compromise on its demands related to wages and other issues people familiar with the process say but uaw officials including president ron gettelfinger have had heated debates internally over how much the union should give some people briefed on the progress say
