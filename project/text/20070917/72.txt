the feds alibi the federal reserves open market committee meets tomorrow and anyone who thinks its decision on interest rates will be simple hasnt been paying attention the last week as expectations of fed easing have risen so too have such inflation sensitive signals as gold and oil while the dollar has hit record lows against the euro contrary to the dreams of wall street theres no free monetary lunch you wouldnt know this from most financial commentary which assumes that chairman ben bernanke and the fed can ease and credit markets shall be healed like the infirm at lourdes it worked during the financial crises of and under alan greenspan goes the argument and so it shall again the problem however is that the fed doesnt have the same running room now in large part because of the mistakes that it made in chairman greenspans final years the feds easy money policies helped cause the housing bubble and subprime crisis and now its being asked to solve them with more of the same with that in mind its hardly reassuring that both messrs bernanke and greenspan are now offering their own defenses of fed policy they take different forms but they are both in essence alibis for the feds current predicament mr bernanke made his attempt in a speech last week on the "global savings glut " which seems to be his full field explanation for just about everything the rise of excess savings in china the mideast and elsewhere in the early part of this decade made them net exporters of capital which proceeded to flow into the u s the fed chief argues that this propelled the u s current account deficit and also explains why american long term interest rates have stayed so low translation the fed didnt cause the housing bubble frugal foreigners did it the problem with this explanation is that it omits the feds role in producing this "savings glut " billions of people around the world didnt suddenly become more thrifty during this decade it was the feds low interest rate policy especially a fed funds rate from june to june that helped spur a global commodity price boom including in the dollar denominated price of oil this created a revenue boom in russia the middle east and other countries most of which have a low propensity for domestic consumption so much of that capital went elsewhere especially to the u s as an oil importer china is a little different case but as mr bernanke noted in his speech "with consumer credit not readily available and precautionary motives for saving remaining strong " chinas domestic consumption was also restrained so its capital also flowed abroad again often into u s financial instruments mr bernanke is right about these flows of capital and their contribution to low u s interest rates but hes more than a bit slippery in ignoring the feds role in this global wealth transfer meanwhile mr greenspan has emerged from the six figure speaking circuit with his memoir "the age of turbulence " the headlines are focusing on his criticism of republicans for their spending excesses and president bush for his failure to use his veto pen hell get no argument from us on those though wed note that his claim that deficits produce higher interest rates simply hasnt proved true the "maestro" is far less persuasive in his explanation for why the fed kept money so easy for so long he says it was to "shut down the possibility of corrosive deflation " but fear of deflation was long gone by the third quarter of after the second round of bush tax cuts had passed and gdp growth clocked in at on an annual basis later revised to the fed nonetheless maintained negative real interest rates for many more months to come this has proven to be the great policy blunder of mr greenspans tenure with ramifications that are making life difficult for mr bernanke today this isnt hindsight by the way these columns were critical of fed policy throughout that period not because we had any special insight but because market price signals like gold oil the dollar and later housing were flashing yellow and then red meanwhile the fed was watching its measure of "core inflation " which turns out to have been misleading in part because it didnt include an adequate account of housing prices a rethinking of its inflation measures should be one lesson the fed learns from this episode which brings us to the feds current dilemma the housing recession has caused the overall economy to slow and recession worries are rampant many on wall street want their bubble back and they are begging the fed to reflate but inflation also remains near the upper limit of the feds comfort level the dollar is weak gold is back above &# and oil briefly popped above &# a barrel last week for those of us who remember the economics of the s one abiding lesson is that trouble comes when the fed is asked to spur economic growth the job of a central bank is price stability the reagan paul volcker policy mix was tight money combined with tax cutting which reversed the s mix of easy money and tax increases washington is in danger of drifting back almost unconsciously to that s policy whether or not the fed cuts rates tomorrow wed feel better about the decision if fed chairmen present and past werent offering alibis for how we arrived at this pass
