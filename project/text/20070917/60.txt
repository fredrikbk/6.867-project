politics &amp economics mccains primary concern iraq in war weary new hampshire no surrender tour is a tough sell east rochester n h dana hussey quartermaster of the vfw post is nostalgic about the fall of when sen john mccain packed the posts bingo hall "so tight it was standing room only and with a line out the door " the arizona lawmaker hopes to re create the sizzle of the new hampshire primary when he came from behind to trounce george w bush by points but this year he is taking a different tack defending his onetime rivals controversial strategy for the war in iraq it could prove a tough sell when mr mccain returned to post last week as part of his "no surrender" tour fewer than supporters mostly veterans attended in a room that could accommodate hundreds "hes got the right message " said mr hussey the mccain campaigns chairman for stafford county "lets just hope it catches on " more than any other candidate in the presidential race mr mccain is wagering his white house hopes on success in iraq he timed this swing through iowa new hampshire and south carolina to capitalize on what he sees as gen david petraeuss successful defense of the war before congress last week but also to try to head off efforts by senate democrats starting tomorrow to legislate a swifter withdrawal from iraq "yes there are grave difficulties" in iraq mr mccain told a gathering at another vfw hall in hudson n h "but i want to point out to you that we will either stay with this strategy which is succeeding or we will choose to lose and we will surrender and we will be back and there will be chaos and there will be genocide " considered a leading contender for the republican nomination when the campaign started mr mccain has had a tough summer he fired several top advisers in july and slashed his staff as contributions plummeted leaving him with less than &# million in the bank now his campaign is starting to show signs of a turnaround his numbers have inched up in some national polls though he still is running fifth in iowa and third in new hampshire he is hiring staff in both states further signs of a comeback could come next month when candidates report third quarter fund raising numbers mr mccain got a lift from his performance in the new hampshire debate earlier this month he has also benefited from congress putting immigration reform on the back burner a rancorous fight in which he was out of step with many in his party now his campaign is trying to ride what it perceives to be a sentiment among republicans that the war in iraq is turning around his war pitch is a complex one especially in new hampshire where success is essential for his campaign but where residents are increasingly skeptical about the war antiwar sentiment here helped drive two congressional incumbents from office last fall and could imperil republican sen john sununu who is up for re election next year so in a state where he relied heavily in on the independent vote mr mccain is trying to cast his iraq stance as a mark of character he hammers on how he was among the first republicans to blast what he calls "the rumsfeld strategy" of trying to subdue iraq with limited means as far back as mr mccain argued that the u s needed far more troops in iraq a message he argues that the bush administration didnt hear until the start of this year pursuing until then a strategy he says was "doomed to failure " he also defends the need to stay the course in iraq as a matter of faithfulness to the troops there among them is his son jimmy "i read the polls i know how strong the sentiment here is in new hampshire " mr mccain said squeezed into the back of his campaign bus before flying to south carolina but "this is far too important an issue to care about my political future " nearly a dozen men who had spent years with mr mccain as prisoners of war in vietnam accompanied him and his wife cindy mr mccains rallies drew mainly from a cadre of sturdy supporters including many with sons or daughters in iraq he also attracted a smattering of the curious and the undecided many of whom were wary of his heavy iraq focus "i like the man for his integrity " said leo gerrier who had an american flag sticking from his front pocket at a franklin town rally "but does it all have to be about iraq " mr mccains backing of the presidents "surge" strategy which he discusses with no mention of mr bush is oddly narrow in its political focus for a man who touts the need for big strategic thinking much of the mission of his "no surrender" trip seems more about this weeks senate wrangling over the war than it does about becoming president while stumping for her husband ms mccain makes the pitch that among all the presidential candidates only sen mccain as both a vietnam veteran and a father of two sons in the military knows "what it means to send young men and women into combat and more importantly how we bring them home with honor " yet for all the talk of his potential abilities as a wartime president mr mccain argues that the pivotal battle is now largely between republicans and democrats in the senate when the next president takes over in january the candidate said while traveling in new hampshire "we will either be showing sizable progress in iraq or we will have failed "
