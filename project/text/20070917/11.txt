business schools the recruiters picks a special report closer to home business schools have long attracted students from the middle east now the region is attracting the business schools insead has long attracted executives from the middle east to its business school campuses in fontainebleau france and singapore but more and more in recent years students found it harder to get away and wished insead would open up shop closer to home this month they got their wish as insead transformed a residential villa into a research and executive education center in abu dhabi insead plans to offer a variety of executive education programs including one on managing employees in the middle east and it may eventually send executive m b a students in france and singapore to abu dhabi for some of their courses "we saw that this was a region with a booming economy where we didnt have a strong profile " says peter jadersten executive director of the center "we have learned that you become a truly global school only when you have your feet on the ground in many different parts of the world " while china is still the hot spot for new business education ventures the middle east is becoming an alluring draw as well particularly for european business schools schools like the welcoming attitude of the regions governmental leaders and see growing demand for management training as businesses expand some deans also say theres strong interest in their programs from prospective arab students who have been reluctant to study in the u s because of concerns since about getting visas most of the business school growth is in qatar and in abu dhabi and dubai in the united arab emirates frances lille school of management for instance has announced plans for a campus in the persian gulf region possibly in the united arab emirates bahrain or qatar focused on international project management but schools also are moving into other parts of the middle east insead opened an entrepreneurship center in israel last year and the grenoble graduate school of business in france recently trained engineers from the national petrochemical co of iran in industrial project management "governments throughout the region have made educating their future leaders a priority and are devoting more money to it " says celia de anca professor of global diversity at instituto de empresa business school in madrid which has focused on women in its middle east projects it helped establish the queen rania scholarship in jordan for women interested in studying at the spanish school and developed a three day entrepreneurship program for women with effat college in jeddah saudi arabia while most schools have dipped their toes into the market with short term executive education offerings two london business schools are simultaneously launching executive m b a programs this fall in dubai cass business school part of city university in london is offering a general management curriculum as well as two regional specializations energy and islamic finance to differentiate itself cass expects to attract both expatriates working in the middle east and locals "in many of the gulf countries there has been a dependence historically on expatriates " says hassan hakimian associate dean at cass "now theres an effort to upgrade the business skills of the local labor force " london business school will require students to take classes both in dubai and at its london campus but thats still far more convenient than studying in north america says roland duerr a student in the inaugural class mr duerr says he had considered schools in both the u s and canada but he can keep his job as food and beverage manager at the burj al arab hotel in dubai while getting his executive m b a from london business school "i realized i would definitely need an m b a to further prosper in my career and to complement my previous education which was focused on the hospitality industry " he says "even though an m b a in the u s may be the ultimate my company wanted me to stay here and i didnt want to give up the opportunities it can offer me " eventually dubai residents may be able to obtain an american style m b a degree in their own backyard more north american schools are starting to explore the middle east including the university of california at berkeley which teamed up with a local school in dubai to develop a joint program in "total quality management " the sloan school of management at the massachusetts institute of technology also is studying possible ventures in the middle east but declines to elaborate on its plans at this point and queens school of business in kingston ontario recently opened an executive education facility in dubai carnegie mellon university was one of the first american entrants into the region setting up a qatar campus in and admitting students in undergraduate business administration and computer science this year carnegie mellons tepper school of business created an executive entrepreneurship certificate a nine month part time program aimed at helping people commercialize their technology research "theyre trying to establish a new economy built around knowledge and technological innovation and they need a more entrepreneurial culture " says arthur boni director of the tepper schools entrepreneurship center some schools say they intend to move cautiously unsure of the long range outlook for business education in the middle east iese business school in barcelona spain for instance is assessing the market in dubai but still has some reservations "the question for us is whether this is just a bubble with a few years of opportunity " says eric weber associate dean "or can we set up something longer term "
