cross border deals take new direction western multinationals may have pioneered cross border mergers but the latest chapter in globalization is being written by a new breed of deal makers from places like russia china brazil and the mideast with an appetite for acquisitions in the developed world an investment fund in qatar recently bought british grocery chain j sainsbury plc while a brazilian company snapped up canadian nickel miner inco ltd and acer inc of taiwan is to acquire u s computer maker gateway inc in addition the qatar investment authority is bidding for a nearly stake in the london stock exchange says a person familiar with the matter the recent deals mark a fundamental change from only a few years ago when nearly all the investment flow went from the developed world to the developing one this year could be on pace to be the first ever in which companies and investment funds based in developing countries spend more on mergers and acquisitions in the developed world than vice versa the trend which is expected to continue could accelerate in the wake of the recent turmoil in global credit markets credit woes have put the brakes on the takeover frenzy led by western multinationals and private equity firms in the past three years of course the vast bulk of cross border deals continue to take place between companies based in the industrialized west but many companies in the developing world have ready access to large pools of capital at relatively low cost in their home country debt markets which means they can step up their buying sprees "the traditional hunters are strapped for cash right now so they have to be looking over their shoulders at these new guys who have come on the scene " says joseph quinlan chief market strategist at banc of america capital management according to dealogic firms in developing countries completed &# billion of deals in developed nations in so far this year the value of such deals has multiplied to nearly &# billion compared with the &# billion that companies in developed countries have spent on acquisitions in the other direction mr quinlan thinks that by year end the balance for the first time will tip in the other direction fueling much of the surge are so called sovereign wealth funds pools of money amassed and managed by governments flush with oil money the investment arms of kuwait saudi arabia dubai abu dhabi and qatar combined hold an estimated &# trillion these funds are now pushing to diversify by investing in more overseas assets the recent deal for britains sainsbury for instance was made by delta two ltd a subsidiary of delta commercial properties llp a fund set up by the qatar investment authority this new cadre of buyers often target energy mining and other basic industries such as steel and auto parts which are well established in the developing world and whose products are in great demand in their native countries in some cases they want to gain control of scarce natural resources held by western companies in other cases they want to tap skilled labor and gain access to western technology many of these buyers pay dearly to do so shares of acer the taiwan computer maker slumped after it announced its &# million bid for gateway last month which represented a premium to gateways share price just before the deal was announced frank yeary global head of mergers and acquisitions at citigroup says powerful forces have come together in the past four years to give companies in the developing markets more buying power for one share prices in many of those countries have risen dramatically increasing the wealth of the firms even if they dont use their stock as direct currency to complete merger deals in the west moreover in the past to months large companies in countries like russia india and brazil have had "significantly greater access to capital than at any time in their history " says mr yeary economists say this cross pollination is healthy because it injects new capital into often mature industries and helps to knit the global economy closer together roger kubarych chief economist for unicredit global research part of milan based unicredit group says companies from the developing countries help spread new technology "theres an image that the businesses that grow and thrive in the developing world are labor intensive and low tech " he says "but in fact the successful ones are using the best technology everywhere and are behaving like other global competitors " he points to mexicos cemex sab which has a cutting edge automated production process that employs high temperatures used in cement making to simultaneously burn hazardous wastes that said mr kubarych cautions that the "gravitational pull" of investing is still toward the developing countries "there simply arent that many really big companies in those countries " he says even so for this new cadre of global investors the biggest risk is political backlash especially if a potential acquisition controls key natural resources and technology or in any way involves national security last year dubai ports world a subsidiary of dubai world a holding company for that persian gulf state was forced to sell its u s port operations after a political outcry over security concerns such reaction will likely redirect investments dubai world last month announced a &# billion deal to acquire a stake in the las vegas casino mgm mirage and ownership in that companys ambitious development project known as citycenter banc of americas mr quinlan says these investors may also opt for relatively smaller deals to reduce their visibility and potential controversy "but ultimately " he says "i think the u s and europe are going to have to recognize that if we want access to their markets for m&amp a they will expect equal treatment " corrections &amp amplifications delta two ltd which is controlled by a fund established by the qatar investment authority in conjunction with london based three delta llp is in preliminary talks with the board of j sainsbury plc about mounting a bid for the british grocer yesterdays outlook column incorrectly
