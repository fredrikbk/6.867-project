too much hope may be pinned on rate cut investors are putting a lot of hope in the federal reserves ability to ride to the rescue tomorrow maybe too much hope though the stock market surged last week on optimism that a widely expected interest rate cut by the fed would boost stocks such a rate cut would offer little immediate help for the fundamental problems weighing on the nations economy and financial markets these include a worsening housing slump and high gasoline prices which are damping consumer spending and fears of further defaults on the billions of dollars of low quality loans that have been used to finance mortgages and corporate takeovers even if the fed carries out a series of rate cuts the economy and stock market are likely to be dealing with the fallout from these problems well into next year financial markets view it as almost a certainty that the fed will cut its target for short term interest rates tomorrow perhaps by as much as half a percentage point in an effort to perk up credit markets and economic growth it would be the first cut after consecutive quarter point increases that took rates from an exceptionally low in june to in june where they have remained since based partly on the markets rapid recovery after fed rate cuts during the credit crisis many money managers are betting stocks will surge if the fed cuts rates now that helps explain last weeks strong stock gains including the weeks point or rise in the dow jones industrial average to but some economists worry that expectations have gotten out of hand what ailed stocks in was the combination of asian economic woes and a russian debt default which contributed to the near collapse of a huge u s hedge fund long term capital management unlike in when the real troubles were imported from abroad todays problems are home grown the housing meltdown and the credit crunch that has followed even if the fed acts quickly and cuts rates more than once this year as many economists now expect the impact on the economy would be slow to take hold indeed the housing crunch may get worse before it gets better so instead of taking off like a rocket as it did when the fed cut rates three times in the fall of the u s stock market may have to navigate more difficult seas "the bounce back in the financial markets is probably going to be smaller than it was in " when the dow jones industrials surged from its close on oct through the end of the year says jan hatzius chief u s economist at goldman sachs group inc "we should expect further problems in the financial markets from the housing troubles " "in it was things that were happening halfway around the world the crisis today is a reflection of a problem that is at the heart of the u s economy " mr hatzius says todays trouble "is more serious than by a significant margin " a survey of economists published last week by wsj com put the risk of a u s recession at up from a month earlier while most economists dont expect recession they worry that the combined effects of the credit crunch and the housing mess will hold back consumer spending business investment and corporate profits which is bad news for stocks "the recession in housing shows no sign of ending undercutting the momentum of the economy " says ethan harris chief u s economist at lehman brothers holdings inc "we are likely to see consumer spending slow down " because consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity it is important to growth mr harris sees economic growth bottoming out at an annual rate of about or in the first half of next year down from a rate in this years second quarter and that assumes that the fed decides to pull out the stops and do everything it can to get things going again but in general investors appear to be more optimistic than economists nick raich director of research at cleveland bank national citys private client group which manages about &# billion for wealthy investors has seen home loans failing in his state the overall foreclosure rate in ohio is the highest in the nation he says and yet mr raich believes that the stock market will be fine he isnt counting on a quick u s economic recovery but he believes that the fed will restore investor confidence and that the still booming world economy will help keep the u s out of recession in may national city warned clients about troubled markets to come and urged them to cut back on stock holdings last month it told clients to step gingerly back into the market although corporate profits may come in a little weaker in future quarters than analysts currently expect mr raich says he thinks stocks are headed higher "whats important is the feds willingness to indicate that it will do whatever it takes to keep us out of recession " he says "a lot of our bullishness on stocks will not be because of the u s consumer but because of global growth " in the near term however the big problem is that it takes months for rate cuts to translate into economic growth by affecting things such as investment consumer spending and exports in credit markets some banks have become less willing to extend credit for purposes like takeover financing because of a fear of default a quarter point or half point change in base rates isnt going to change that very quickly what a fed rate cut or a series of cuts could change quickly is investor psychology "i think this is more about confidence the sense that somebody has got a hand on the tiller " says mr harris of lehman brothers if investors believe the fed will do all it can to get credit markets going again and keep the housing market from pulling the economy into recession they may be willing to bet on the future by buying stocks by the same token if the economy or corporate earnings show signs of sluggishness later investor confidence could wane tomorrow lehman brothers is slated to kick off wall streets third quarter earnings reports to be followed later in the week by morgan stanley bear stearns cos and goldman sachs investors expect the big investment firms which have been enormously profitable in recent years to be hard hit by the turmoil in financial markets sparked by mounting defaults on subprime mortgages and the unwinding of the buyout boom another cash cow for the industry while almost everyone expects a fed rate cut tomorrow prognosticators are divided about whether the fed will cut by one quarter percentage point or one half percentage point regardless many economists believe the fed will have to cut rates again perhaps more than once more before markets and the economy are back on a stable path some think the fed may have to keep cutting into in the fed cut rates three times before it was comfortable that it could stop then chairman alan greenspan signaled the first rate cut in advance in a speech and markets rose on that signal the actual rate cut however disappointed some investors because it was only one quarter point the fed cut rates twice more by one quarter point each time including one cut made in between its regular policy meetings some economists fear markets could react negatively if tomorrows cut is just a quarter point or if investors sense further cuts arent imminent one problem is that some fed policy makers still appear concerned about the risk of inflation and it is uncertain how many times they will be willing to cut rates during the first half of this year overall inflation including food and energy was running at an annualized rate of down from in national citys mr raich however thinks the fed has leeway to act and restore confidence "the key here is that core inflation has remained remarkably well contained " he says "so it should give the fed some wiggle room to sufficiently re inflate the economy "
