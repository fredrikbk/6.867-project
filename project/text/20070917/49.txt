who mr floro says is bent on cleaning up what he says is the philippines corrupt legal system mr floro says he never consulted the invisible elves over judicial decisions and the fact that he puts

by a popular revolt two years later in and was sentenced last week to life in prison for corruption in march after lengthy delays the supreme court finally dismissed mr floro from the court service largely because of his belief in the supernatural even though mr floro says the elves played no part in his judicial decisions the supreme court justices said his broad faith in mysticism and supernatural phenomena had affected his work "lest we be misconstrued we do not denigrate such a belief system " associate justice minita chico nazario wrote in the supreme courts verdict "however such beliefs especially since judge floro acted on them are at odds with the critical and impartial thinking required of a judge under our judicial system " mr floro dissents he has filed three appeals of the supreme courts decision since then and is continuing his campaign on local television and on the internet the supreme court hasnt reversed any of his decisions after suspending and later removing him from the bench
