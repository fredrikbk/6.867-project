bush set on attorney general pick expected nod to mukasey may soothe left irk right independent streak is seen president bush is expected to nominate former federal judge michael mukasey for attorney general say lawyers close to the white house a move that could avoid a fight with congress but spark friction with disaffected conservatives an announcement could come as soon as today officials said for president bush mr mukasey years old would be a nominee who stands firm on the administrations legal assertions on national security and broad presidential power moreover his reputation as a legal conservative who has spent little time in washingtons partisan maelstrom would make him an asset in working with democrats on the administrations biggest legislative priorities which include a permanent rewrite of the foreign intelligence surveillance law one sign of how palatable mr mukasey may be to democrats is that sen charles schumer of new york has endorsed him as a good choice for supreme court justice or attorney general yesterday sen schumer said "for sure wed want to ascertain his approach on such important and sensitive issues as wiretapping and the appointment of u s attorneys but hes a lot better than some of the other names mentioned and he has the potential to become a consensus nominee " mr mukasey partially ruled against the administration in the case of jose padilla who was recently convicted on terrorism charges the ruling overturned the administrations attempt to block mr padillas right to meet with his lawyers the case suggests the judge has an independent streak that might make him more acceptable to democrats who viewed attorney general alberto gonzales as marching too closely to the white houses beat in some conservative circles however there is wariness of mr mukasey because of sen schumers prior support and because of similar support from a liberal advocacy group alliance for justice indeed some compared mr mukaseys potential ascendancy with the nomination of bush confidante harriet miers to the supreme court a move that collapsed under a conservative revolt to head off potential opposition to mr mukasey in fact the white house was reaching out to conservative legal activists over the weekend to make a detailed case for its choice other possible candidates to succeed mr gonzales had included theodore olson a former solicitor general whom democrats last week vowed to block and george terwilliger a former judge who is also viewed skeptically by some democrats opposition to mr mukasey is particularly strong from well connected republicans who champion mr olson but with democrats in control of congress conservatives ability to disrupt a mukasey nomination would likely be somewhat limited legal observers familiar with mr mukasey say his philosophy of judicial restraint is in line with that of traditional conservatives mr mukasey served as chief judge in the u s district court for new yorks southern district he retired a year ago to return to private practice at patterson belknap webb &amp tyler llp mr mukasey is close to former new york mayor rudolph giuliani and is an adviser to his presidential campaign the tensions among conservatives have prompted some close to the white house to defend the former judge jay lefkowitz president bushs former domestic policy adviser said of mr mukasey "the president has a big agenda and needs to work with congress to get it here he has someone with impeccable credentials who can help him " mr lefkowitz said mr bush never pulled punches when a confirmation fight was looming but "i dont think the president looks for confirmation fights if theyre not necessary " conservatives shouldnt have a "knee jerk reaction" just because of sen schumers recommendation he said "i dont think republicans need to be looking to pick fights right now "
