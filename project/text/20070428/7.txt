broadcom says qualcomm deceptive unfair in his april editorial page commentary "the wireless wars " george gilder appears to have fallen victim to the efforts of the qualcomm propaganda machine which is intent on distracting attention from the deceptive unfair and anticompetitive practices that are at the core of the companys legal troubles despite rhetoric to the contrary qualcomm is not content to compete on the merits of its technology rather it has pursued a strategy of manipulating and misleading global industry standards bodies to induce reliance on its technology with the ultimate goal of undermining competition and furthering its effort to impose a monopoly tax on all g g cellphone users world wide through royalty bearing patent licenses the issue here is not the jingoistic red herring of a technology battle between the u s and europe major u s technology companies like broadcom and texas instruments are among those most harmed by qualcomms deceptive and exclusionary practices broadcom and others simply desire a competitive environment in which companies win business based upon their innovation and superior products which benefits consumers and company shareholders as well as the u s broadband economy additionally the ad hominem attacks on the u s international trade commission ignore a blatant hypocrisy qualcomm itself has petitioned the very same agency to bar the importation of cellular handsets by competitor nokia one of mr gilders most contradictory assertions is that broadcoms patent rights are "flimsy " while at the same time he warns that the technology underlying those rights is so significant that it "would take at least two years to replace " he also ignores that mighty qualcomm has either lost or withdrawn all of its patent claims against broadcom our company has invested heavily in wireless r&amp d over the years and is recognized as a major technology innovator in space broadcom has also amassed a significant and diverse portfolio of more than u s and foreign patents and more than additional pending patent applications the real story here is qualcomms abuse and deception in pursuit of monopoly profits and destruction of competition as well as its duplicitous strategy of exaggerating the value of its own intellectual property while refusing to pay for its use of the valuable intellectual property of others when qualcomm adopts fair reasonable and non discriminatory licensing policies respects the intellectual property of others and ceases its deceptive and anticompetitive behavior the legal proceedings that mr gilder deplores will likely fade away david a dull senior vice president business affairs &amp general counsel broadcom corp irvine california see related letter "letters to the editor broadcoms wireless r&amp d" wsj may
