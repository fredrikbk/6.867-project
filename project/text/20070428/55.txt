pursuits books five best man vs nature is at its most riveting in these first person accounts says author james m tabor  in the amazon jungle by algot lange putnam in algot lange an opera singers son thirsting for adventure plunged into unexplored upper amazonia between brazil and peru as he recounted in "in the amazon jungle " his extraordinary chronicle of the expedition for weeks he survived alligators boa constrictors poisonous ants tarantulas venomous snakes black panthers and then the real adventure began fever and snakebite killed four indian companions alone burning with fever lost and starving injecting himself with huge precautionary doses of quinine and arsenic lange finally collapsed to die he awoke but he was surrounded by mangeroma cannibals who gleefully fried and ate other captives while nursing lange back to health for the pot he feared but mangeromas in those halcyon days ate only their enemies and white meat was not yet on their menu lange eventually returned to civilization "an emaciated fever wreck placing one foot before the other only with much exertion " even more surprising than langes survival his return for another amazonian sojourn  shackletons boat journey by f a worsley sir ernest shackletons harrowing south pole expedition aboard the endurance has prompted many books on the subject but my favorite remains "shackletons boat journey " by frank worsley the ships captain first published in the u s by norton in worsley was a fine writer and even better sailor shackleton had intended to lead the first sea to sea crossing of the antarctic but polar ice crushed the endurance in november and the goal quickly became simple survival worsley saved shackletons expedition his life and his reputation by navigating a glorified rowboat the foot james caird through miles of the notorious southern ocean storms that routinely sank large ships it was an astonishing sailing feat and made the bulwark of shackletons legend sir ernest in truth was but a passenger who early on confessed "do you know that i know nothing about boat sailing " worsley just chuckled "dont worry boss i do " shackleton really was a great explorer and wrote his own fine story of the endurance try to read him but do also read worsleys graceful and self effacing account  the worst journey in the world by apsley cherry garrard doran english aristocrat apsley cherry garrard spent with robert falcon scotts ill fated south pole expedition in "the worst journey in the world " cherrys writing is elegant and laced with wry english humor but also with the grim epiphanies that come only from agony his lasted three long years its terrible climax was the winter journey of july august when scott sent cherry and two others into the black heart of antarctic winter they hauled a pound sledge for five weeks through hour darkness below zero cold and hurricane storms on a hunt for penguin eggs that scott wanted for scientific study the fools errand wrecked cherrys body and spirit "this journey had beggared our imagination no words could express its horror " cherry wrote he was wrong though his beautiful horrifying book does exactly that  k the savage mountain by charles s houston and robert h bates mcgraw hill the himalayan mountain k is feet shorter than everest but four times deadlier in seven americans led by charles houston and robert bates attempted ks first ascent at feet altitude sickness immobilized climber art gilkey who would die it was determined unless he were immediately evacuated ks vicious terrain and weather made such an attempt virtual suicide but gilkeys comrades never hesitated at feet five of them joined by ropes fell while trying to lower gilkey down a degree slope of ice in a howling storm the last man standing pete schoening jammed his ax behind a rock held on for dear life and saved everyone from certain death "schoenings belay" resides in the pantheon of mountaineering feats in a more tragic irony than any playwright could devise just hours later an avalanche swept gilkey away but spared the other six who descended alive but shattered as houston and bates relate in "k the savage mountain " climbings true summit was the brotherhood of the rope "men banded together in a common effort of will and strength not against this or that imagined foeman of the instant but against their only true enemies inertia cowardice greed ignorance and all weaknesses of the spirit " their willingness to die for a friend earned them a renown that has escaped ks eventual conquerors  minus degrees by art davidson norton in february art davidson ray genet and dave johnston completed the first winter ascent of mount mckinley in alaska but on descent a monster storm trapped them at feet for six days they survived barely in a coffin size ice cave enduring mph winds and temperatures that reached minus degrees hence the title of davidsons subsequent account this finely crafted adventure tale runs on adrenaline but also something else brutal honesty given access to all seven expedition members journals davidson revealed that every "men vs nature" tale has another dimension men vs themselves his story of extreme mountaineerings good bad and ugly spares no one especially himself at one desperate point he volunteers to descend alone to "send in help " but "i knew my reasons for a solo descent were flimsily constructed excuses to conceal my desire to save art davidson above all else " before "minus degrees " mountain tales glowed with heroism and self sacrifice davidsons was the first to show the darker aspects as well mr tabor is the author of "forever on the mountain the truth behind one of mountaineerings most mysterious and controversial tragedies " which will be published by norton in july
