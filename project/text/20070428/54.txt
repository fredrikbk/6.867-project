pursuits books dire combustion how a theatrical rivalry spurred a fatal rampage the shakespeare riots by nigel cliff random house pages &# it is always wise to begin any examination of americas unfolding with a remark by alexis de tocqueville that prescient frenchman to whom our country was as wondrous as prosperos isle nigel cliff begins his rambunctious account of one of the most bizarre events in the tangled anglo american story by quoting tocqueville about theater in a democracy "on the page aristocratic traditions will be gradually modified in so to speak a legal manner in the theater they will be overthrown by riots " this is precisely what happened in new york city in when people were killed in an astonishing explosion of violence over two styles of playing shakespeare at least shakespeare was the fuse the powder was a volatile mix of social forces and outsize personalities in "the shakespeare riots " mr cliff tells the whole strange saga with great skill and enormous gusto it is hard to believe but is nonetheless true that the words of shakespeare meant more to th and th century america than those of any other author except the bibles mr cliff is eloquent when describing the hold that shakespeare had on the psyche of a young america we made him our own around campfires in barrooms on riverboats and within tents along the farthest reaches of the west generally speaking imported english actors held the stage on the settled atlantic coast in the early th century but on the frontier of ohio kentucky and the mississippi a young giant was learning his trade edwin forrest as our country grew more self confident along came forrest american and magnificently physical speaking the bard with an immediacy and freshness that to judge by the fervor of contemporary accounts rivaled that of the elizabethans forrest was our first international homegrown star and was received rapturously from the backwoods to boston his first tour of england in was a triumph his opposite number in britain william charles macready was as complex and careful as forrest was direct and dynamic a man who always doubted the suitability of the acting profession for a gentleman macready hated the vulgarity and brutalities of the theater ironically he did more in his tormented and brilliant career to raise the level of acting to an art form than any figure save david garrick the th century titan of the london stage the theater in which forrest and macready plied their trade was robust noisy and often dangerous mr cliffs description of english and american playhouses is rich and makes me glad that i didnt have to tread the boards in hissing was the most polite way of showing disapproval and was heartily encouraged throwing projectiles from the stalls might add emphasis not to mention injury but affection too was lavished loudly in such a theatrical atmosphere forrest and macready began as mutual admirers and when their paths crossed even friends soon enough though they began feuding denigrating each others performances and accusing each other of career sabotage both were also caught up as mr cliff explains in a growing struggle between britain and america on the diplomatic stage tensions between the two countries were at their most intense since the war of the author says with disputes over the canadian border and americans continuing involvement in the slave trade another flash point was the postponement or repudiation of debts by pennsylvania illinois and other states outraging creditors in london and impoverishing british widows and pensioners who had invested in state bonds overseas in the u s there was also a growing animus between democrats and the aristos not least in new york whose residents saw themselves "on the cusp of history " history at the time was busy with lower class agitation and assaults on privilege think only of the revolutions in europe new york in mr cliffs telling was increasing divided between the kid glove world of "society " with its preference for the astor place opera house and a roiling underclass of gangs immigrants and laborers "that the showdown took place in a theatre was not as outlandish as it appears today " writes mr cliff "the theatres had always been the great democratic gathering places the only arenas where the peoples voice was louder than the elites " it blew up on lafayette street and astor place between gangs loyal to forrest a true "american" and enemy of privilege and factions loyal to macready who stood for social order and "civilization " the actors were appearing in the city in rival productions of "macbeth " irish resentment of england played a part in the bad blood as did a cast of amazing scoundrels liars and thugs on may macreadys performance was disrupted by the howls of hundreds of forrest supporters in the crowd over the next three days newspapers and handbills stoked anger on both sides one handbill began "working men shall americans or english rule in this city " the strong new york police force and troops from the new york state militia turned out in anticipation of trouble at macreadys may show when forrests supporters were turned away at the door they grabbed cobblestones from a construction site and began raining them on the theater the police and troops moved in hundreds then thousands of combatants joined the fray on both sides the militia opened fire killing nearly two dozen rioters that night macready escaped from the scene wearing a disguise before the actors rivalry turned into a lightning rod for social enmities it had spawned a remarkable period in american theater acting styles were compared and contrasted with a relish and fire never seen before or since acting mattered shakespeare mattered but then the debate became acrimonious and devolved into violence in the process the theater ceased to be the one place where all segments of society both in england and america could meet under one roof and bellow their approval or derision on an equal footing entertainment began to be tailored to its audience and the presentation of shakespeare lost vitality as it became "respectable " something of tocquevilles vision of a democracy was lost as society calcified around its own exclusive amusements opera for the rich music hall and vaudeville for the poor macready returned to england triumphant forrests star gradually faded in a flurry of scandal divorce lawsuits and dwindling houses he died alone macready retired in still unsure whether he had chosen the right profession americas concerns moved on to a larger stage as the country tore itself apart in civil war and england consolidated its empire never again would theater and acting be so important or command such passion popular history is hard to write well fluid prose is not enough its arguments must also be strong if it is to be taken seriously on the latter score mr cliff has succeeded admirably his analysis of the historical context of the riots is especially good his authors bio mentions a "double first in english" at oxford but i wish his prose was a little less dense and overheated it must be the time he has spent as a journalist that gives him the habit of loading too much description on the back of fragile syntax it gives the text a piled on quality from time to time still his obvious intelligence and enthusiasm his sensitivity to the concerns of both actors his generous fairness to both sides of the conflict english and american haves and have nots and the amazing story itself make "the shakespeare riots" a wonderful read and the book registers the most important point of all at least to me theater matters mr herrmann is an actor whose theater credits include "julius caesar" at the public theater on lafayette street near astor place his narration of audiobooks includes "einstein " by walter isaacson and the forthcoming "reclaiming history " by vincent bugliosi
