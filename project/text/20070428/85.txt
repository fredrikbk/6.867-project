the week ahead our take on coming events media time warner investors seek icahns influence in bottom line by matthew karnitschnig doing battle with dissident investor carl icahn worked wonders for time warner inc in the months since beating back the investors hostile campaign management has shown a new readiness to take bold steps toward overhauling the company this coming week investors will get a progress report as the media company releases first quarter earnings time warner stock hit a nearly five year high in january thanks both to a rally in the broader cable tv sector and investors enthusiasm for a radical new aol strategy devised by the company a &# billion share buyback a result of mr icahns campaign also didnt hurt mr icahn was able to sell a big chunk of his position at a handsome profit in recent months the stock has come off its highs in spite of the progress the media conglomerate still seems afflicted by doubts about almost all of its businesses not only do some investors worry about the future of its cable tv and aol divisions but they also fret about the prospects for its magazine publishing film and television businesses as the internet remakes the media and entertainment industries mr icahns view that the company should be broken up a key tenet in his campaign against company management still has currency in some quarters on wall street thats unlikely to happen while richard parsons remains at the helm he argues that the company is less exposed to disruptions brought on by the digital shift precisely because it has a broad portfolio of assets that includes aol but hes expected to step down next year and all expectations are that hell be succeeded by the companys president jeff bewkes some wonder whether mr bewkes may be more willing to take more aggressive action about the companys structure for now though attention is focused on time warners plans for its cable tv business its main source of both growth and profits as well as the progress of a revamp at aol time warners board plans to discuss how much of time warner cable the company should continue to own as part of a strategic review next month the company listed of time warner cable in march as part of its acquisition of adelphia communications inc the business which is the no cable operator in the nation and accounts for about of time warners operating profit has been growing at a rapid clip thats a result of the popularity of its bundled television internet and telephone service offering management sees strong growth in cable for years to come but some on wall street question the cable industrys long term potential in the face of increased competition from telephone companies and want time warner to divest the asset completely others argue that time warner management would be crazy to jettison the companys strongest business investors will also be analyzing aols results to see whether the online services recent turnaround is continuing in september aol began offering its services free shifting from a subscription model to one supported by advertising initial results of the switch were positive with online advertising at the unit growing about in the fourth quarter alone yet for all of aols potential as an advertising platform questions about its future persist oil its chavezs way or the highway by david luhnow and russell gold on may celebrated as labor day outside the u s venezuelas president hugo chavez will carry out what is fast becoming a ritual among populist leaders in latin america he will mark the occasion by thumbing his nose at western oil companies last year it was bolivias evo morales who sent army troops to seize natural gas projects owned by companies such as spains repsol ypf sa this time around mr chavez is expected to formally seize four large oil projects in venezuela that until now have been run by some of the biggest names in the business the former army officer will likely bring along a few troops as a show of strength the flamboyant leader set the workers holiday as a deadline for the companies involved to transfer the facilities to state firm petroleos de venezuela sa or pdvsa this past week five of the six companies agreed to hand over the keys exxon mobil corp chevron corp bp plc total sa and statoil asa conocophillips was the only holdout but in the end will have no choice the hard part comes next all sides still have until june to agree on the financial terms of the new ventures which will raise pdvsas stake in the deals to at least from a current minority position companies are pushing for compensation for what they call an expropriation and some are even threatening to leave the country "compensation for expropriation the terms going forward those are really important issues for us to sort out whether we continue to participate or we dont " said james mulva ceo of conocophillips in a recent interview the houston oil giant has an ownership stake in two of the heavy oil projects the companies however will probably stay the projects which involve extracting a tar like crude from the orinoco river basin and processing it into a synthetic fuel are much less profitable than a few years ago due to rising taxes and royalty rates the projects should still make money as long as oil prices remain lofty for the most part the firms also need venezuela too much to walk away the orinoco region could hold more oil than even saudi arabia companies could find themselves in a better bargaining position if pdvsa which has become politicized during mr chavezs tenure has trouble running the ventures which require complicated technology to upgrade the crude many of the top foreign executives at the projects have been pulled out by the companies and many local workers are also wary of reporting to pdvsa and mr chavez pdvsa saddled by mr chavezs social spending demands is already struggling to keep production from falling in other parts of the country if it bungles the operations at the orinoco that could be bad news for the oil market put together the projects produce about barrels a day politics candidates jump over bushes to trace path to reagan by jackie calmes even before nine republican presidential candidates agreed to meet for their first debate thursday at the reagan library in simi valley calif they were competing for who best fits the mantle of the iconic late president but expect the reaganesque preening to be laid on thick with next weeks gathering like the democrats debate thursday in south carolina the republican event will go minutes on msnbc starting at p m edt it also can be viewed on the internet at www politico com its a measure of the republican partys current straits its identity crisis really that aspirants would bypass both president bush and his father who was voted out of office after inviting a party mutiny by raising taxes while the younger bush gets republicans respect for his tax cuts his spendthrift fiscal record and interventionist foreign policy have left most republicans consistently telling pollsters that he is no ronald reagan now his would be successors claims to that brand depend "on how you define the reagan legacy " says former rep vin weber who has considered himself a reaganite since his first election to congress in the year that the former actor and california governor won the white house mr weber who supported john mccain in but now advises mitt romney says "we think the reagan legacy should be optimism about the future which gives romney the edge certainly over mccain " former new york city mayor rudy guiliani with his liberal record on social issues "is still something of a mystery " yet of the pack mr mccain arguably has the best claim not least for being a longtime close friend of nancy reagan the mccain camp says mrs reagan will remain neutral in the contest at her invitation the reagan library is also hosting the partys final debate next jan after the first nominating contests in iowa new hampshire south carolina and nevada and just before the feb crush of primaries in california and elsewhere that could decide both parties nominees his campaign brochures first point states "john mccain is a proven conservative leader in the tradition of ronald reagan who believes in a strong national defense more accountable government lower taxes free enterprise economic growth and traditional values " in his stump speech he recalls mr reagans veto of a highway bill because it had more than special projects "earmarks " and contrasts that with the current presidents signing of one that had more than spending earmarks with president mccain he told a greenville s c rally thursday "that will never happen again " the year old senator even turns to reagan to deflect questions about his age it works for some after his greenville appearance year old republican anna roman said "president reagan was an old man and when he ran i was against him because i thought he was too old but he turned out to be a good president "
