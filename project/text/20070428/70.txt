pursuits sports &amp recreation cycling ride like the wind it worked for lance now amateur cyclists and triathletes are paying up to &# an hour to train in wind tunnels san diego alan morrison an avid cyclist has spared no expense trying to improve his times in weekend races he bought a custom frame &# sleek wheels &# and a meter that tells him how much wattage hes generating as he pedals &# but recently he went a step further shelling out &# to have scientists analyze his body position while he rode a bike in mile per hour winds "i didnt realize amateurs could have access to something like that " says mr morrison a year old retired chemical engineer from san jose calif with more people entering triathalons and cycling races some weekend warriors are pulling out all the stops to finish a few spots higher in the standings the latest sign of the lance armstrong trickle down effect is the growing appeal of wind tunnels futuristic looking enclosures used mostly by aerospace companies to design new planes wind tunnels contain giant fans that blow air at an object while sensors measure the so called drag or how much force is pushing against the object airplane makers take that information and use it to design a more aerodynamic wing or fuselage the idea of sticking cyclists in wind tunnels took off among the pros around the beginning of the decade in large part because mr armstrong was training in them to get ready for the tour de france cyclists including levi leipheimer and floyd landis have dramatically altered the way they sit on their bikes based on wind tunnel training from san diego to wichita kan wind tunnel operators faced with consolidation in the aerospace industry are looking to weekend warriors to help fill the void but can an hour pedaling in front a big fan really help an amateur pick up the pace kenneth moll a lawyer in chicago who is preparing for the ironman race in wisconsin has hired cycling coaches swim coaches and personal trainers and says the wind tunnel was the most useful hour of training others though have had less success during her hour long session darby lippincott was told she could save five minutes an hour by adding handlebar extensions that stick out farther over the front wheel but when she tried the new technique in an ironman race in canada last year her back started spasming miles into her mile ride because she was so uncomfortable "i had to soft pedal" because of the spasm says ms lippincott the owner of a seattle construction company "i couldnt dig in " the interest in wind tunnels comes at a time when aerodynamics is becoming a hotter topic in cycling for years making bikes lighter in weight was the big obsession now that bikes are about as light as theyre going to get without compromising a riders safety people have moved on according to professional cycling coaches about of the effort cyclists put out during a ride goes toward fighting the wind clothing and equipment makers are also gearing up on this front italian apparel maker castelli recently released a &# cycling jersey called "the split second " whose strategically placed seams and golf ball like dimples promise to diminish wind resistance the label claims the jersey will save cyclists " seconds in km at km hr " among amateur athletes the best known wind tunnel is the san diego low speed wind tunnel in the last few years some cyclists have paid for a session at the facility and cyclists now account for about of its revenue a couple of years ago the tunnel spent &# on new sensors that are more accurate with slower moving objects mph is a typical speed for cyclists vs hundreds of miles per hour for airplanes the san diego air &amp space museum took over the facility when it was on the verge of being shuttered wind tunnels at the university of washington texas a&amp m and the massachusetts institute of technology have also tested cyclists the aerodyn wind tunnel in charlotte n c was designed for nascar teams but this summer it plans to open to cyclists a smaller tunnel nearby and says it already has a waiting list of people one caveat for cyclists who pay for wind tunnel sessions think twice before buying a new bike linnea alvord changed her riding position after switching bikes now unable to afford another trip to the wind tunnel the portland ore marketing consultant has been trying to duplicate the test at home she has moved the full length mirrors from her bedroom down to the basement and placed them around her stationary bike taking a spin in the wind the f has been tested here and so has the tomahawk cruise missile now its my turn to be strapped into a machine that blows wind at miles per hour fortunately for me its not blowing at full blast ive been a recreational cyclist for years and recently have been ramping up my training rides and taking part in more races curious whether a wind tunnel could help someone like me i signed up for an hour session at the san diego low speed wind tunnel i started by pedaling the bicycle for about minutes just to warm up once the fans foot propeller began blowing wind at a relatively innocuous mph i went through a series of tests where i had to hold my position for about a minute at a time during the first test i felt fine but then a voice came on the pa system asking me to lean farther forward in my best lance impression i reached as far forward as i could my elbows almost slipping off the pads i noticed my wind resistance numbers started to drop proving that position is more aerodynamic but the speed came with a price i was about as uncomfortable as ive ever been on a bike im used to riding six or seven hours at a time but every second in this position seemed like an hour and i couldnt move or adjust my body or id screw up the readings i tried only six positions some cyclists try up to but the point was clear the farther i leaned forward and the more i hunched over the faster i went this isnt true for everyone some cyclists inexplicably create less drag by raising their handlebars a bit after the session i sat down with the facilitys scientists who broke the news to me that compared with other cyclists im not very aerodynamic this is partly because i have a larger frame another factor too many cheeseburgers reed albergotti
