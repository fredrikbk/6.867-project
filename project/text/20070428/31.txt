embryonic stem cell research collides with an ethical barrier in their april editorial page commentary "stem cell compromise " john t gill and pete sessions rest their argument on two nonsustainable ethical legs they say "the cells could not be sold and the embryos must come from couples who are actually going through the ivf process in order to bring forth a child " they cannot seriously believe that formidable legal restrictions could be written and enforced how would you define a couple married not married significant others friends classmates what proof would be required to show intent to "bring forth a child" how quickly do you think it would take for a "stem cell industry" to start handling this new market they say they have reviewed this concept with "several prominent conservative biblical scholars " really and who would they be and what are their credentials pat oswald wayne pa dr gill and mr sessions elegantly make the point that nonviable embryos from ivf should be acceptable for stem cell research this makes little sense when viable embryos that are not implanted but simply discarded suffer the same fate the fatal flaw in their argument is that all embryos that are not implanted in a womans womb are also nonviable to simply select those that could not be implanted then discard the rest is disingenuous if that makes it more acceptable to the religious right so be it but we discard so many viable embryos that selectively calling some nonviable to justify their use in research is nothing more than hypocrisy the use of "living tissue" to save lives has a long history in organ donation and allowing these embryos to be destroyed with no benefit shows no respect for life just bone headed religiosity david j melvin chester n j dr gill and mr sessions consider the right priorities but go far astray in their proposals for a compromise in the stem cell research debate to their credit they show much needed serene thinking forgoing polemic and seeking a way to push forward in the promising area of stem cell research while still honoring the sanctity of life well done unfortunately this solution doesnt hit the mark they suggest that using nonviable embryos gathered from couples using ivf might provide an ethically acceptable middle ground "whether one asserts that life begins at the union of egg and sperm or not the belief is not violated by this proposal " sounds good so far theyve got my attention but then they hit big problems when one recalls that just two paragraphs before they explain that a nonviable embryo is one that "has essentially no chance of surviving and thus will not become a living human being " whoa the egg and the sperm have already united ok so human life and to speak of survival chances means its already alive it already is a living human being and we can never purposely kill an innocent living human being this must have occurred to them as well because they try a different tack comparing the use of these embryos to organ donation there is an obvious difference between research with embryonic stem cells and organ donation one takes organs from a person who has died or nonessential ones from someone living the other uses the human being itself killing it in the process embryonic stem cell research runs up against barriers we cannot afford to break down if our society is not to become monstrous in our search for medical cures there are so many promising leads in nonembryonic stem cell research when will our legislators begin to aggressively fund these jean lavery wakefield r i
