pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink bourbon mint and perfect ice last sunday afternoon i was out with my family when the kids spotted the surest sign that summer is in the wings the hawaiian shave ice man was out plying his trade as i stood in line with my daughters and son i had to marvel at the quality of the ice the man was making fluffy powdery and fine it was shaved with a single sharp blade from a spinning crystalline cake of ice such ice is almost wasted on blue raspberry root beer or watermelon syrups this was the stuff of which great mint juleps are made with the kentucky derby a week away we are at the official start of julep season novelist walker percy noted that juleps "are drunk so seldom that when say on derby day somebody gives a julep party people drink them like cocktails " a proper cocktail is made with a couple of ounces of liquor at most by contrast "a good julep holds at least five ounces of bourbon " percy noted after folks unthinkingly toss back a few juleps "men fall face down unconscious women wander in the woods disconsolate and amnesic full of thoughts of kahlil gibran and the limberlost " the quality of most drinks depends primarily on the quality of the spirits and flavorings that go in the glass and though this is true enough for the mint julep the drink depends equally on the quality and quantity of ice used the standard option for grinding up ice the bar blender is profoundly ill suited for julep ice the blades not only chop up the big chunks but liquefy the small shards already chipped off the cubes rather than getting powdery shaved ice you get watery slush and you cant make a good julep with slush so how do you achieve julep worthy ice perhaps the best method is the one followed by chris mcmillian a bartender at the new orleans ritz carlton who is justifiably famous for his mint juleps mr mcmillian fills a canvas bag with ice cubes and then pulverizes the contents with a large flat headed wooden mallet this is the approach walker percy favored recommending that one "powder" the ice by working with the mallet "so quickly that the ice remains dry " if you are hesitant to whack at ice cubes on your expensive kitchen counters there are other options with the hawaiian shave ice man in mind i went looking for a humble plastic hand cranked snow cone machine and found one for &# at sur la table it took about four minutes of vigorous work to shave one juleps worth of ice and then there is the margaritaville frozen concoction maker made by sunbeam for jimmy buffett it is something of a marvel combining an electric ice shaver with a bar blender designed with frozen margaritas in mind the ice shaving function is nonetheless perfect for mint juleps i had two juleps worth of fluffy ice crystals in about seconds at &# the concoction maker isnt exactly cheap but the real downside is that it measures a few inches larger than a postwar fiat if you live in a manhattan studio you may not be able to fit the gadget into your apartment without first removing the stove but if you have the sort of gigantic kitchen that comes standard with new suburban construction you will find the concoction maker to be a fine use of your vast counter space while on the subject of massive capital outlays i might also mention that its well worth investing in sterling silver julep cups an essential part of the julep experience is the thick layer of frost that coats the outside of the ice packed cup but if the condensed moisture is to freeze properly the ice inside the cup needs to be able to lower the temperature on the outside of the cup glass is a lousy conductor of heat even brass under the thin layer of silver in many plated cups is relatively inefficient but silver conducts heat like crazy leading to a reliable frost of the desired density tools and materials at the ready good put half an ounce of simple syrup in the bottom of the cup i like to use the mint infused simple syrup made by the sonoma syrup company add a couple of mint leaves and gently bruise them in the syrup rub the syrupy leaves all around the inside of the cup pack the cup with freshly shaved or pulverized ice forming a snow cone dome on top drizzle another half ounce of simple syrup on top then pour three or four ounces of bourbon over the ice stick in a nice leafy sprig of mint walker percy liked a little nutmeg grated on the top the julep is best enjoyed with a straw which will let you access the various strata of the drink from the minty sweetness at the bottom to the icy bourbon blast at the top yet many eschew this essential accessory charles elme francatelli noted the resistance back in in his "cooks guide and housekeeper &amp butlers assistant " writing that "very genteel persons will be exceedingly shocked" when told that a julep should be "sucked through a straw " but he says this "vulgar precept" is necessary because "the very act of imbibation through a straw prevents the gluttonous absorption of large and baneful quantities of drink " its your choice a straw or kahlil gibran and the limberlost email me at eric felten wsj com mint julep  to oz bourbon oz mint infused simple syrup fresh mint leaves copious amounts of shaved or pulverized ice muddle oz of syrup with mint leaves in bottom of a julep cup rub entire inside of cup with the syrupy leaves pack the cup to over the rim with ice pour the other half ounce of syrup over the ice followed by the bourbon garnish with a leafy sprig of mint drink slowly thats a lot of bourbon through a straw
