politics &amp economics merkels mission major breakthrough on u s trip may be elusive with british prime minister tony blair set to leave office this summer president bush has found a new international ally in german chancellor angela merkel but while the two leading conservatives are cooperating on security issues such as irans nuclear program they have yet to achieve big breakthroughs on tough economic and environmental issues their wary courtship continues monday as the german chancellor who also currently holds the european unions rotating presidency visits washington for a one day u s eu summit while ms merkel and other eu leaders had hoped to announce u s movement on addressing climate change at the summit the prospects for a meaningful deal have all but vanished eu officials say progress on a global trade deal through the doha round of talks also has been slow "we have pretty strong differences on climate change " the eus ambassador to the u s former irish prime minister john bruton complained to reporters last week "were not really satisfied that the u s side is facing up to the gravity of the problem " so instead of big breakthroughs ms merkel is likely to be left with a few consolation prizes the main deal is expected to be an agreement to promote closer economic integration between washington and brussels by eventually harmonizing standards in areas such as biodiesel fuel accounting and intellectual property rules that is expected to include the establishment of a trans atlantic economic council which will look at existing regulatory differences in such areas as autos and medical devices and at ways to improve coordination of future regulations on the environment the two sides are expected to announce joint research efforts to develop pollution reducing energy technologies they also are considering setting up a consultation process on energy and the environment that could lead to more substantial announcements later said gary litman of the u s chamber of commerce and mr bush and ms merkel are set to sign an open skies agreement that will allow u s and eu airlines to fly more freely between cities on both sides the u s and eu decided two months ago to loosen traditional country by country restrictions on friday meanwhile mr bush held a news conference with visiting japanese prime minister shinzo abe at which the two leaders demanded that north korea live up to its promises and fully abandon its nuclear weapons program and they threatened more sanctions against pyongyang for continued stalling north korea missed a deadline two weeks ago to shut down its nuclear reactor under an agreement reached in february at a time when new european leaders are stepping in to take over from the generation of leaders who had split bitterly with the u s over iraq ms merkel still has the potential to reshape u s relations with europe but with only months left in mr bushs term she and the u s president are running out of time to accomplish some of the big goals they have discussed the lack of progress underscores mr bushs diminished clout as the iraq war drags on as well as the complex nature of some of the issues on the table particularly energy and climate change ms merkel has quietly provided help to the bush administration on some important fronts germany has been an active u s partner in multiparty negotiations aimed at ending irans nuclear program it has been a bridge between the u s and energy rich russia and remained a steady ally in afghanistan "i listen to angela merkel a lot " mr bush said in january during the chancellors prior visit to washington "she has got a lot of wisdom " yet the two leaders remain far apart on global warming their best hope for a breakthrough perhaps is to find a framework for agreement on the doha round that would accommodate both u s and european interests the trade talks have become bogged down due to differences over how to treat farm subsidies among other issues u s and eu trade representatives will work at the summits sidelines to try to bridge some of the differences the issue has taken on new urgency as mr bushs fast track authority which allows him to negotiate trade agreements that permit only an up or down vote by congress expires in june under ms merkel germany is returning to the traditional postwar role it has played from the days of konrad adenauer to helmut kohl as the key interlocutor for u s presidents in continental europe that role was shelved when mr bush fell out with ms merkels predecessor gerhard schroeder over iraq and mr schroeder established a so called axis of peace with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin mr bush first got to know ms merkel during a private minute meeting in germany in early when she was opposition leader of the center right christian democrats after she became chancellor later that year the two began trading regular phone calls in the fall of the white house set up a secure video teleconferencing system for her like the ones mr bush uses to talk to mr blair and iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki administration officials say mr bush finds the former physicists straightforward style in sync with his own ms merkel has proved deft at cultivating mr bush hosting him for a pig roast last year in the hamlet of trinnwillershagen the german equivalent of a barbecue at the bush ranch in crawford texas for ms merkel summits with foreign leaders are a relief from having to manage her fractious government in berlin her unwieldy bipartisan coalition of center right christian democrats and their main political rivals the center left social democrats is running out of issues that it can agree and act upon just months into its four year term ms merkel hopes to parlay her friendly ties with mr bush into broader eu u s cooperation that extends beyond cold war era security alliances to economics and trade germany lobbied for the open skies agreement that is due to be signed at the summit ms merkel also has been eager to enlist the u s in tackling climate change an issue on which the bush administration has been more reluctant to act than europe she wants to use mondays summit to lay the ground for the meeting of the group of eight leading nations in june where she hopes to broker a common position on combating climate change said a german government spokesman c boyden gray u s ambassador to the eu told reporters in brussels this past week that differences remain over how to weigh the importance of binding emissions targets against developing new technologies he said the u s is less focused than europe on global targets as long as emerging economies dont sign up but he said the u s and the eu are getting closer on two principles that climate change and energy security are closely related and that china and other emerging economies should take part in whatever solutions are adopted remaining differences are "probably a timing issue more than substance " he said marc champion in brussels contributed to this article
