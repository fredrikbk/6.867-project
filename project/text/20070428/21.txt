china trade by numbers most members of congress dont spend a lot of time boning up on the economics of trade so thanks are due to the u s china business council for a report detailing state by state exports to china it makes enlightening reading for anyone on capitol hill eager to launch a trans pacific tariff war populists in america like to badmouth china for flooding the u s with what they claim are cheap job destroying imports but the export data offer a very different picture china is now americas fourth largest export market buying u s goods valued at &# billion last year according to the u s international trade commission what are americans selling in china computers and electronics top the list accounting for &# billion of exports high value added and thus good job creating products such as transportation equipment chemicals and machinery are also in the top five and those numbers keep rocketing up u s exports to china increased between and americas second fastest growing export market belgium increased "only" in the same span senators chuck schumer d new york and lindsey graham r south carolina who periodically threaten to impose a tariff on chinese imports take particular note new york ranks fifth out of the states in exports to china selling goods valued at nearly &# billion last year while new yorks foreign exports overall grew between and exports to china increased south carolina is also reaping the rewards of trans pacific trade china is now the states fifth largest export market according to u s commerce department data since exports to china have increased compared with overall export growth for the state so much for the myth that china trade is bad for the u s some workers have suffered from americas transition to an information age high value economy but these trade data show that many other americans are benefiting from the opportunities china trade is creating heres hoping the democratic congress doesnt spark a trade war that would kill the peking duck laying these golden eggs
