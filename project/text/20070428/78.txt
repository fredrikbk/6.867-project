purchases more than ever and now the nations retailers are coming under legal assault for printing too much payment card information on customer receipts so far this year plaintiffs lawyers have filed more than federal lawsuits seeking class action status against big merchants such as rite aid corp wendys international inc fedex corp tjx cos and inter ikea systems bv also in the line of fire are lesser known regional restaurant chains such as in n out burger and melting pot fondue restaurants a slew of suits brought on behalf of consumers have been filed in recent weeks in u s district courts in california pennsylvania and kansas merchants are under pressure to help ensure the security of electronic transactions still most of the nations retailers dont comply with the card industrys myriad rules that prohibit the storage of certain customer data and require the installation of sophisticated firewalls to protect their computer systems earlier this year tjx parent of discount clothing chains t j maxx and marshalls disclosed that its computers had been hacked in a security breach that left at least million of its customers vulnerable to fraud the requirement that retailers cut off card data is part of the fair and accurate credit transactions act of which sought to protect consumers from fraud and identity theft amid the growing use of electronic payments although it was enacted more than three years ago the law gave retailers some breathing room to make the change in addition to the receipt requirements the law also gives consumers the right to obtain a credit report without charge every months as of dec retailers are prohibited from printing more than the last five digits of a credit card or debit card account number on receipts that are handed to customers the receipts also cant include the accounts expiration date the law applies only to electronically printed receipts rather than those that are written by hand or imprinted on old fashioned manual machines "slips of paper containing peoples financial information should not be floating around " says j mark moore a lawyer at spiro moss barness llp in los angeles the law firm has filed more than lawsuits against retailers charging that they "knowingly and intentionally continued to use cash registers which were not programmed to or otherwise did not comply" with the law although the federal trade commission is responsible for enforcing the law the legislation also gave consumers the right to sue for violations for those who receive receipts with the full account information the best thing to do is either keep it in a safe place or rip it up experts say a consumer can also report a violator to the ftc a spokesman says the agency hasnt received consumer complaints about violators and hasnt brought any enforcement actions tied to the law the agencys regional offices are working with retailers to remind them of the law the lawsuits contend that retailers are "willfully" violating the law a practice that could result in fines of as much as &# per transaction "if you assume that many of these businesses werent able to get this fixed until recently the potential fines are enough to make even the largest of these companies feel very uncomfortable " says gregory hurley a lawyer at greenberg traurig in costa mesa calif who represents retail trade groups on the issue mr hurley also puts some of the blame on the card industry saying that card issuers and the companies that process transactions for merchants didnt do a good enough job of alerting their clients to the law a spokesman for fedex kinkos which is the subsidiary named in the lawsuit has reviewed its receipts since and "in no year was the printing of expiration dates identified as an item that could compromise cardholder security" under the federal law he declined further comment citing the pending litigation a tjx spokeswoman declined to comment the suits are also drawing criticism from retailers who say they are merely opportunistic litigation from the plaintiffs bar "we firmly believe congress did not intend to allow these class action lawyers to claim hundreds of millions of dollars in damages when no one has actually suffered any monetary harm " arnold wensinger general counsel for irvine calif based in n out burger said in a statement during the past few years thousands of retailers have overhauled their payment systems to eliminate some card information in visa usa inc for example began requiring merchants that accept its branded cards to eliminate all but the last four account digits the rule applied to new terminals only since then thousands of retailers have altered their systems so that the last few digits of a card account number are preceded by a series of xs but the full account data still periodically show up on receipts some blame software that has been improperly programmed while others say that big restaurant chains sometimes dont have the power to enforce the rule with their franchisees although businesses in other countries often print the full card account information that is also changing as of april visa started requiring global merchants who accept its cards to cut off at least four of the account numbers from customer receipts denny lynch a spokesman for wendys says the burger chains company owned stores carry just the last four digits of an account number on both the merchant and customer receipt the company makes that computer program available to its franchisees who own about of the chains u s stores but he said "we dont know if all of them are taking advantage of that " he said representatives of rite aid ikea and melting pot didnt return calls for comment daveed schwartz a lawyer who represents retailers that have been sued says that companies in violation of the law are likely unaware of it "the last thing retailers want to do is to act against their own self interest by subjecting their customers to an increased risk of identity theft " he says mr schwartzs firm pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman llp is defending about a dozen retailers who have been sued the suits have also stirred debate about potential ambiguity in the law which prohibits merchants from printing the full account information "or" the expiration date the national retail federation a trade group representing merchants says the language indicates that they would still be in compliance if they printed one or the other others interpret the law as meaning that merchants arent permitted to print either one another concern is whether the law applies to merchant receipts that customers sign and then hand back to a cashier or waiter typically these merchant copies contain the full card account information the law applies to "any receipt provided to the cardholder " people involved in the litigation also are paying close attention to a pending supreme court case that could have implications in the tussle over receipt information in that case a number of insurance companies are challenging a decision by the ninth circuit court of appeals in san francisco that said companies can be found liable for violating the federal credit law even if they arent determined to have done it "willfully "
