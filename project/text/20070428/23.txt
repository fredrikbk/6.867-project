cross country land of taxes st paul minn what do you call the largest political rally for tax relief in minnesota history a non story at least according to the twin cities media then again minnesota taxpayers probably werent too surprised the lead anchor for the cbs television affiliate here as well as the star tribune of minneapolis played up a competing "global warming day of action" rally on the mall while playing down the much larger tax protest just a few hundred feet north on the capitol steps indeed on saturday april an estimated minnesotans lined up in st paul to protest against run away government spending and a push to feed it with yet with more tax hikes on the "rich " former state senator and now congresswoman michelle bachman told me it was one of the largest rallies if not the largest she had ever seen at the capitol not bad but rather than report that tax protestors far outnumbered a much better financed moveon org was sending email reminders sierra club event by at least local news outlets merely noted the combined totals for both the local cbs affiliate also posted an internet story on the global warming get together using video footage of our anti tax rally under protest the piece was pulled the purpose in organizing the tax cut rally which delivered over petitions gathered on radio station ktlks web site was to give voice to the thousands of minnesotans opposed to the plans of the left wing majority in the state house the democrat farm labor party won an seat edge in november and widened its majority in the state senate plans that include a dizzying array of new taxes totaling &# billion this in a state of five million people with a biennial state budget of &# billion and this too in a state whose general fund is running a &# billion surplus even after an automatic built in increase of &# billion nevertheless democrats have introduced bills raising all income tax rates including one for the highest top rate in the nation at in the name of transportation i e mass transit theyve proposed increasing the gas tax to cents per gallon at the pump as well as raising the state sales tax by a half cent add to that levies on everything from beer to mortgages to paint house republican leaders say the hikes will cost minnesota families well over &# per year minnesotans are hardly under taxed according to the u s census bureau the state tax burden in the home state of walter mondale and al franken already ranks sixth highest per capita in the nation the state has decoupled its estate tax from federal relief it still taxes capital gains as ordinary income though its hard to shed tears for the subsidy seeking big business community here a corporate tax rate of is one reason for the anemic job growth of late minnesotans are a hard working lot and thats providing some cover for the tax and spend crowd household income is relatively high so the liberal intelligentsia argue with a straight face that the tax burden as a percentage of income isnt going up so fast but if the state already has a surplus why raise taxes well its simple here in the land of taxes its called "ability to pay " state rep john lesch a liberal democrat from st paul once explained it clearly in a recent email to a constituent "once the wealthy simply pay their fair share then we can have a discussion of whether government has greater or lesser needs " he wrote minnesotans wouldnt pay for their annual fishing licenses this way that is based upon income but democrats are even proposing tying property taxes to household income or here we go again "ability to pay " the american dream is all about getting ahead by driving down household expenses as a percentage of income why shouldnt taxes fall too and yet minnesotas income tax code is so "progressive" that the top pay of the total tax collected while the bottom quintile of earners actually get a check from state government the uber rich you know those in the top making a whopping &# or more shoulder a remarkable of the true income tax burden as a recent tax incidence study by the state department of revenue made clear they also pay more than of the sales business and property tax the tax cut coalition wants to resist the democratic money grab and buttress a few wobbly republicans as well gov tim pawlenty who admirably refused to raise taxes during the states budget crunch after has since buckled on a tobacco tax he calls it a health care fee and a california style renewable energy mandate his current budget proposal spends the &# billion dollar surplus and then some increasing the general fund by hes promising to veto any new tax measures but is being pressured by liberals in his own party such as state rep ron erhardt of edina tax policy in minnesota not unlike washington d c has broken down into two fundamental camps one thinks government has a proper role in raising revenue for those genuine public goods in as neutral or as the framers put it "uniform" manner as possible the other camp currently running the state legislature views the tax code as a way of redistributing wealth and even in a time of surplus is looking for new ways to soak the so called rich at some point even in minnesota raising taxes based on a fanciful notion of "ability to pay" will force a taxpayer revolt in some quarters it may not qualify as news but when thousands of minnesotans take time out of their lives to show up at the state capitol its probably a sign that something more is going on than a debate over whether humans are warming the globe mr lewis who leads minnesotas tax cut coalition is a talk show host on fm newstalk ktlk in the twin cities
