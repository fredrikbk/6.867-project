gadget geeks re engineering the device to do all sorts of things having nothing to do with playing videogames to repurpose the wii mote they download free software from one of a number of web sites and then tweak that code to assign a specific command to each movement of the device in the end the remote takes the place of a computer mouse or keyboard waving the wii mote sends a message

players to use their remotes to act out whatever game theyre playing whether its casting with a fishing rod or swinging a tennis racket tim groeneboom who lives in the netherlands uses his wii mote to spice up his deejay act he was inspired by a video on the web of a california music student bobbing in front of the computer in his room and making jabbing motions with the wii mote to splice different tracks during his second gig with the wii mote mr groeneboom says he was able to roam up to about feet from his deejay booth and still be able to control how the music blended and do some

he and his partner stuck a tennis racket in the "hand" of a &# industrial robot and then tweaked the wii mote to control the robots arm so it can hit back tennis balls on the factory floor "this is what we do to relax " he says some people are using their remotes to play laser tag where players shoot one another with infrared light beams while others are using them to strum a virtual guitar several web sites like wiihacks blogspot com and wiili org have sprouted up for hackers to trade tips on repurposing wii motes because nintendo sells the wii mote separately for &# hackers dont even
