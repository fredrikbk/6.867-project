business insight a special report why bad things happen to good technology new ideas take you only so far firms also need to innovate their business models in most companies innovation is the responsibility of the technical side of the organization the research and development staff is supposed to come up with the cool new technologies and the rest of the company takes them to market but that model doesnt assure success as the recent history of innovation shows betamax lost out to vhs macintosh to a lesser degree lost out to windows we still use color tv standards from the s despite many initiatives to improve picture quality put simply bad things can happen to good technology and much of what can happen is due to the business model the company uses to commercialize the technology this is the next wave in innovation to innovate the business model that commercializes promising new ideas and technologies doing so is for the most part a simple process of trial and error but at most companies it also requires the removal of some barriers to such innovation what are those barriers perhaps the most basic is simply this companies get trapped by their own success once a companys business model has proved effective the tendency is to seek out additional opportunities that fit that model and to play down any technologies that dont fit that model for example a company that is accustomed to a business model based on charging money for products might overlook a technology that works best with a model based on free distribution with an advertising mechanism to produce revenue international business machines corp is one example of a highly successful company that saw the need for innovation in its business model and reinvented itself to great effect by experimenting with new approaches the company evolved from a model of vertical integration of its own proprietary products and services to a much more open model that includes cooperation with other companies in developing and commercializing technologies in the s and s ibm was regarded much as microsoft corp is regarded today a very large enormously successful extremely well managed company that effectively was a near monopoly but by january of the company was in need of a new approach that month ibm announced what was then the largest loss in u s corporate history &# billion for along with the latest in a string of layoffs soon after that announcement ibm fired its chief executive officer and brought in the first outside ceo the company had ever had in its history lou gerstner ibms business model innovation was born out of this financial crisis mr gerstners arrival at ibm led to significant cost cutting and a final round of layoffs but this by itself isnt business model innovation where that began was through a fervent hunt for new revenue sources one experiment was to offer ibms semiconductor lines to act as a foundry for other companies products this brought in new revenue and increased the utilization rate of ibms equipment and facilities a related experiment was to create a research alliance to share the high costs and significant risks of pioneering leading edge semiconductor processes ibms need to generate greater profits also led it to rethink its whole approach to managing its patents and technology the company was able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars a year by licensing its intellectual property these initiatives and other experiments in open source software and information technology services have transformed ibms business model more than half of the companys &# billion revenue in came from its ibm global services arm a business that didnt exist years earlier ideally of course a company will figure out how to innovate its business model before it is compelled to act by financial stresses but innovating without that motivation can be difficult one problem is an organizational gap in most companies who is responsible for business model innovation it cant be left to the chief technology officer and his or her staff alone business model innovation clearly requires leadership from the business side of the organization yet who within the company short of the ceo is responsible for the way the business creates value in its products and services and captures that value in the form of revenue from its customers certainly the chief financial officer needs to be involved both for measuring accurately the results of the model and for communicating these results to outside investors the marketing leadership focuses on brand development and channels of distribution the chief legal officer has a role to play particularly when intellectual property is an important contributor to the ability to capture value from the model but no one of these people has the ability to drive the entire business in some businesses a general manager or division president may have complete responsibility for the financial performance of a business unit even here though there often are sharp limits to the ability of these managers to innovate their business models some companies for instance put their general managers through two year to three year rotations running specific businesses increasing the size of the businesses the managers run over time this is too short a time frame to create new business models it takes more time than that to develop business model experiments obtain clear results interpret and understand the results and then carry out a broad deployment of those results little wonder then that most general managers simply stay with the current business model and show top management their ability to grow the business within the constraints of that model in turn the ceo typically delegates responsibility for the business model to the general manager of the business unit the result is that the business model becomes taken for granted so companies that spend enormous amounts of money on developing advanced research and technology often lack processes to innovate their business models in a way that might dramatically increase the return on that r&amp d investment ideally an organization will give a senior manager the resources and authority to define and launch business model experiments this will require cooperation from many other parts of the organization once the data from these experiments are received that senior executive can decide which experiments to continue which new ones to initiate and whether and when enough information exists to justify the wider adoption of a new business model air products &amp chemicals inc has created a series of teams for managing the intellectual assets of each of its businesses a system that helps ensure that the companys new business model stays flexible the company has shifted from a purely independent business model to one where it also commercializes new technologies in partnership with other companies one example of this is the companys approach to nanotechnology air products has developed some new ways to manipulate nano scale particles for use in various materials including those used in coatings adhesives inks and semiconductors among its partners in commercializing these products are dupont co and nanogate ag air products also licenses some of its technologies to other companies to manage all this air products created teams for each of its divisions that are free to determine what technologies have the most potential value regardless of whether those would be used inside air products or licensed to others as jeff orens of the advanced materials intellectual asset management team says "what i tell our scientists is that what we are protecting is not you or even your invention what we are protecting is the business model " the result of air products new approach is that the company is getting more innovation done with its internal r&amp d resources by leveraging external r&amp d and capital expenditures are down as partners invest alongside air products in business initiatives so the company is enjoying more growth without increasing r&amp d expenses and without increasing capital spending established companies also need to pay close attention to the models used by younger rapidly growing businesses in their industry including well funded start ups these new ventures seldom replicate the business model of the established firms instead they attempt to compete with a different kind of business model consider how southwest airlines co entered and expanded in the u s domestic airline market while it flew the same kinds of planes it altered many other aspects of the standard airline business model from the customers it targeted to the routes that it flew to its pricing to the way seats were assigned on its planes it is best for industry leaders to identify these innovative business models early so that they can develop a deep understanding of how they work while they are still young that gives the established companies more time to figure out how best to adapt to this new kind of business model companies also need ways to protect their business model experiments internally so that they dont directly compete with the mainstream initiatives within the company one way to do this is by funding these experiments with a separate pool of money set aside specifically for this purpose to keep these projects from being perceived as taking money away from more mainstream projects once a new business model demonstrates real potential the company needs to deploy that model more widely this is another stage of testing can the new business model work at higher volume and greater scale of operation if it can its expansion increases the competition for resources between the new model and the established model which remember has been proved successful over many years and often the top executives of the company owe their career success to the current model while the competition between the two models can no longer be avoided at this stage it can and must be managed each model deserves a chance to demonstrate its continued viability customers will ultimately be the final arbiter of whether one is better than the other in many cases though there may be market segments in which each works well and thus they can co exist at barnes &amp noble inc booksellers for example it is now clear that many of the companys customers prefer to buy books online while other customers prefer to go to their local b&amp n bookstore peruse the shelves and purchase their books at the register b&amp n now employs both business models as valuable ways to serve its market there is no way to know today exactly what any companys future business model will look like the only way forward is to conduct some experiments gather the evidence identify the most promising direction and then run some further experiments business model innovation is risky to be sure but the rewards are well worth it just imagine what ibm would look like today if it hadnt innovated its business model mr chesbrough is the executive director of the center for open innovation at the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley he can be reached at reports wsj com
