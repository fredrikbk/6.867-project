pursuits philanthropy big players in charity a rod is tackling mental health for steve nash its the environment charitable giving has become a virtual requirement for pro athletes but does a system of individual foundations make sense how philanthropy is changing sports and which players score highest for pro basketball player gary payton having his own foundation has drawn favorable attention over the years during his tenure at the seattle supersonics for example mr paytons foundation sponsored a shopping trip to fao schwarz for children with cancer stories and photos in the local press showed how the foundation was bringing christmas cheer to the needy but by one measure the gary payton foundation falls well short of being a model philanthropy in it took in about &# just under &# went to charitable programs while &# went to administrative expenses thats a roughly to ratio well below the figure most philanthropy watchers expect to see spent on charity rather than overhead throughout pro sports the individual charity has become practically institutionalized teams leagues and agents all rally players to become philanthropists as a way to boost the athletes images while giving back but if there is plenty of encouragement to get players to conduct charitable activities there is much less guidance that would help these athletes most of whom are newcomers to the world of philanthropy indeed at a time when much of the philanthropy world is keenly focused on the question of efficiency many athletes foundations are out of step baseballs highest paid player alex rodriguez has a foundation where only one third of spending in went to charitable activities the rest was spent on administrative overhead the foundation of seattle seahawks wide receiver darrell jackson directed of its total spending in to charity the indoctrination begins almost as soon as players turn pro in baseball for instance players union chief don fehr toured spring training camps this year to encourage rookies to get involved in their communities at least players from the nba and from the nfl now have personal foundations players teams and leagues leverage these charitable efforts to market themselves players often grant interviews on television radio and in print on the condition that they be allowed to talk about their latest philanthropic work teams tout this work on their web sites and in media guides that reporters reference for their stories when his foundation opened a playground in the bronx in new york giants wide receiver amani toomer was on hand for a ribbon cutting ceremony that was also attended by caroline kennedy in mr toomers foundation which had end of year assets of about &# gave &# to charity in july of that year he was invited to ring the opening bell at the nasdaq stock market because of the foundations work teams see player philanthropy as critical in part because of a widening rift between athletes and fans players salaries have hit astronomical levels even as leagues have had to crack down on player misconduct at the same time rising ticket prices have made it harder for many fans to see games "the first thing about marketing a team is that fans have to relate to the players as people " says bernie mullin the chief executive of the atlanta hawks and atlanta thrashers "we sit down with every player to find out about their lives and families to see if theres a cause thats touched their lives its not altruistic were a business " he says the wall street journal reviewed the latest available tax filings for individual athlete foundations of those devoted more than of their spending to charitable programs the standard guideline players say the foundation approach to philanthropy has advantages for one thing it enables them to hold events and fundraisers and solicit donations from people including corporate sponsors new england patriot junior seaus foundation received a &# grant from fuji computer products of america the foundation started by houston texans wide receiver andre johnson raises most of its funds from a three day event in houston in golfer vijay singhs foundation received &# in donations none of it from the golfer himself mr singh made grants of &# in and says david lightner a trustee of the foundation "if i just wrote personal checks people wouldnt know as much about what were doing " says vince carter a co captain for the new jersey nets mr carters foundation embassy of hope sent just a third of its spending to programs in the most recent year for which records are available mr carter who created his foundation in his rookie year before he bought his first house has also made major substantial donations outside of his foundation including &# million to his high school critics note that some of these organizations provide employment for athletes relatives and friends many of whom have no experience in philanthropy whose salaries are paid out of the foundations players say they prefer to hire friends and family members because they have a better understanding of the goals and are willing to work for little or no money steve nashs foundation paid &# salaries to its two employees mr nashs sister and jenny miller the foundations executive director and a close childhood friend the point guard for the phoenix suns says it would be impossible to find anyone else to do the work for that amount of money and that the two women both share his lifelong interest in the environment despite the emergence of mega charities like the bill &amp melinda gates foundation most private foundations especially family foundations dont have huge assets this also applies to many athletes foundations and tends to result in lower efficiencies because of standard legal and accounting costs mary ford gary paytons agent says that foundations performance doesnt tell the whole story and that there were other years when more money was spent on charitable programs she also says the foundations money is donated by the player himself "its all out of garys pocket " she says darrell jacksons agent brian mooney says mr jacksons foundations sponsors a large basketball tournament in a troubled neighborhood that results in a financial loss but which benefits the community and kashyap bakhai alex rodriguezs accountant says the baseball player made charitable contributions of almost &# outside the foundation in the handful of very large foundations launched by athletes are among the most efficient tiger woodss foundation which makes grants to community based childrens programs had assets of almost &# million at the end of lance armstrongs foundation had &# million both reported spending or program support that was more than of their total expenditures charities have been in the spotlight in recent years as natural disasters have led to an outpouring of donations just as watchdog groups and legislators have been calling for greater accountability unlike public companies which make quarterly earnings reports most charities are only required to file the form to the internal revenue service and some experts say this information is incomplete or inconsistent following a series of well publicized cases of abusive practices federal and state regulators have moved to crack down on charities and boost supervision last summers landmark pension reform bill included provisions to increase the accountability of donor advised funds and other charitable giving vehicles at the same time the charity sector has rolled out programs to rate nonprofits and evaluate how leanly and efficiently they operate while much of the debate centers around tax and other abuses many donors have also been critical of charities that spend too much money on their own administrative costs rather than on delivering services to the needy some charities argue they need to spend significant sums of money on overhead and fundraising in order to grow and to attract quality staffers they also say finances arent the only measure worth watching donors should also consider how effective a charity is at its mission barry zito a pitcher with the san francisco giants decided it didnt make sense for him to go through the trouble and expense of creating a foundation when he launched a program called strikeouts for troops to raise money for soldiers injured in iraq prior to the start of the season he promised to donate &# every time he struck out a batter for last years season he doubled the amount and had strikeouts he also persuaded other players to make donations based on their pitching and hitting "it took some time about two years for me to get comfortable with the idea that i had the capacity to give away money " he says "if you start out not having any money the first inclination is gosh i have to hold onto it " hines ward a wide receiver for the pittsburgh steelers has also avoided the foundation route turning to another foundation to help mixed race korean children instead he says he found his cause after a visit to seoul with his mother last year born in south korea to a black american serviceman who was stationed there and a korean woman mr ward says he didnt know much about his background until the trip which he took shortly after he was named the most valuable player of super bowl xl seeing how poorly mixed race korean children are treated mr hines vowed to find a way to help them "its shocking what these kids have to put up with " he says "they told me they were not allowed to play on the national teams and they grew up being told you look like a monkey go back to the zoo " he made another trip to seoul one month later and has raised more than &# for his effort rather than create his own foundation he had his attorney andy ree arrange to have the pittsburgh foundation a community foundation handle the money "hines can accomplish all of his goals without going to the trouble and expense of creating his own foundation " says mr ree who estimates that it would have cost &# to set up the foundation and at least &# a year to operate female athletes havent created as many foundations as men in part because it is the big male only professional leagues the nba nfl and mlb that do the most to encourage player charity but many female athletes are charitable and some have created foundations chris everts foundation raised &# in and donated most of the money to an organization that assists at risk children in florida a foundation created by mia hamm the recently retired soccer star supports efforts to help young women who are involved in sports as well as bone marrow transplant patients dawn staley marion jones and skater kristi yamaguchi have foundations that work to assist needy children players who are considering starting a foundation generally seek advice from their agents and financial advisers "if a player wants to have events auctions or golf outings a foundation can make sense " says michael loverde a partner at wilkin &amp guttenplan which provides accounting and financial advice to about professional baseball players he says he tells them they should consider no more than of their income to be discretionary including charitable efforts inevitably some players grow tired of the hassles associated with foundations when the board of the kenny lofton youth foundation gathers next week in dallas it is expected to shutter the organization larry kent one of the three board members says the decision comes from mr lofton an outfielder with the texas rangers who will continue to do charitable work but wants "one less thing to have to deal with " camille ricketts and russell adams contributed to this article
