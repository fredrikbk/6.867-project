economy slows but may hold seeds of growth weak first quarter may signal a bottom consumers keep buying the u s economy started with its weakest growth in four years as a housing slump continued to hobble expansion but consumers spent freely and business investment picked up suggesting the worst of the slowdown might be past and giving economists reason to predict faster growth in the months ahead the commerce department reported that real gross domestic product the broadest measure of economic activity adjusted for inflation grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of in the first three months of the year that was down sharply from growth of in the fourth quarter of and was the slowest rate of growth since the first quarter of residential investment a proxy for the housing market was the biggest drag on first quarter growth falling at an annualized rate of and slashing one percentage point off gdp the first quarter growth rate was below economists expectations but deeper in the report many economists found reason to believe the economy has hit its low point one reason the stock market shrugged off the disappointing news still growth is likely to remain weak and plenty of hurdles remain among the more encouraging signs the gdp report found consumer spending which accounts for about of economic activity grew at a annual rate in the first quarter that is down from a rate in the prior quarter but higher than the rate for all of the rise in business investment up compared with a decline of last quarter was a surprise given recent reports that suggested businesses are taking a more cautious outlook and cutting back investments accordingly another positive sign businesses continued to slow the rate of inventory accumulation which could foretell an increase in production down the line that view was bolstered by news that the dollar declined again friday on foreign exchange markets a trend that should give u s exports an edge and thus help lift factory production the euro briefly surpassed its december all time high of &# hitting &# before ending the day at &# the dow jones industrial average meanwhile edged up or points to another record close at while the nasdaq composite index rose points to the first quarter gdp report was "probably the low point in the cycle " said nariman behravesh chief economist at consulting firm global insight "it suggests that in fact we may be setting the stage for a very slight rebound this quarter " mr behravesh believes the economy will be growing at a rate of close to by the end of the year still the economy faces plenty of lingering challenges housing continues to be a significant drag with residential investment falling for six consecutive quarters and falling house prices could eventually affect consumers willingness and ability to spend in a paper released last week former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and fed staffer james kennedy estimated that cash people extracted from their homes accounted for almost of all consumer spending as of the third quarter of if that effect were to fall back quickly to the level of before the housing boom started it could cut annual u s consumer spending growth in half also many economists expect some slowdown in the buoyant job market which has helped consumers by pushing up wages sharp declines in residential investment for example should ultimately translate into more job losses in housing construction there are some signs consumers are losing steam in a separate report yesterday the reuters university of michigan consumer sentiment index fell points to in april the third consecutive monthly decline and the lowest level in seven months high gasoline prices and the housing troubles weighed on consumers the survey reported even as some felt optimistic about rising wages and the stock markets recent rally and while business investment is picking up businesses remain somewhat cautious and cant be depended upon to offset the housing downturn in the first quarter investment in equipment and software was up only from a year earlier compared with a year on year drop in residential investment that leaves the u s almost entirely dependent on the consumer "with the unwind in housing not looking to bottom out and firms very cautious about investment this whole thing rests on consumers " said joseph brusuelas chief u s economist at research firm ideaglobal in new york moreover while most economists believe growth will pick up later this year they dont expect growth for all of to be much more than less than what most consider to be the economys long term potential rate one puzzling aspect of yesterdays report was exports which declined in the first three months of the year compared with a rise of in the fourth quarter of last year exports have been a driver of the u s economy in recent months thanks to a weakened dollar and growth throughout europe and asia many economists viewed yesterdays exports decline as a fluke which will either be revised upward or bounce back next quarter compared with the first quarter of last year exports were up "the important thing is to have continued growth around the world " said u s commerce secretary carlos m gutierrez "weve got a good thing going with exports and we want to keep it going " the strong global economy is one reason economists are especially upbeat about the prospect for corporate profits u s companies in recent weeks have reported stronger than expected first quarter earnings often because of growing overseas operations that made up for sluggishness at home global insight forecasts that in inflation adjusted economic growth in japan and the euro zone will be and respectively u s corporations are well placed to benefit from foreign countries better fortunes charles reinhard director of portfolio strategy at asset management firm neuberger berman estimates that companies in the s&amp p derive about of their revenue from abroad up from five years ago u s companies also get a big chunk of profits from overseas operations according to data from the commerce department foreign subsidiaries accounted for about of u s after tax corporate profits in compared with a decade ago the number doesnt include exports from the u s stronger growth in places such as europe japan and china does more than just add to u s companies foreign sales the change in relative growth rates has also pushed up the value of currencies such as the euro as investors attracted by improved prospects outside the u s put more money into foreign securities that provides u s companies with an added boost when they convert their foreign sales into dollars relative to the currencies of u s trading partners the dollar is down about from a year earlier "when the dollars going down its the gift that keeps on giving " says mr reinhard "companies get exposure to stronger foreign economies and they also benefit in the currency translation " earlier this week pepsico inc reported a increase in first quarter profit more than half of which it attributed to sales outside north america caterpillar inc and honeywell international inc have also reported stronger than expected earnings driven in part by overseas operations as of the end of exports made up about one tenth of u s gdp separately the labor department reported friday that its employment cost index increased in the first three months of the year compared with gains of in the previous three quarters this was due mostly to a tiny increase in benefits costs as rising stock prices enabled firms to make smaller contributions to defined benefit pension plans wages and salaries still rose briskly economists also have been watching how much businesses boost inventories businesses continued to slow the rate of inventory accumulation for the second straight quarter trimming percentage points from growth after knocking points off growth in the fourth quarter that could actually bode well for future gdp by keeping a tight rein on inventories firms are less likely to respond to a sales shortfall with big cuts in production and employment and if sales accelerate they are more likely to boost output greg ip contributed to this article
