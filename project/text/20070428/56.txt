pursuits books the glossies dark side of the universe by iain nicolson johns hopkins pages &# two of the most disturbing discoveries in the history of cosmology are fairly recent ones that our universe consists largely of invisible "dark matter" and that the expansion of the universe is accelerating driven by a mysterious "dark force " but lets look on the bright side the discoveries have inspired iain nicolsons "dark side of the universe " a lucid essay on the cosmos past present and future accompanied by clear diagrams computer graphics and luminous telescopic photos mr nicolson begins by showing how successive generations of stars are born and die and then he explains how evolving observational knowledge of the early universe may hold the key to understanding its eventual fate our study of the revolution of galaxies he notes reveals more than meets the eye many galaxies would have flown apart long ago if the gravity of observable matter was all that held them together hence the logic of "dark matter " doing otherwise hidden work by using supernova explosions as a yardstick astronomers have also traced the ever faster rate at which the universe is speeding outward from the big bang but the force that drives such acceleration so far has no detectable counterpart in earthly physics labs "dark side of the universe" conveys the excitement of scientists tackling the largest problem yet uncovered
