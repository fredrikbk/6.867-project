pursuits travel cruise safety tales of a sinking ship sea diamond passengers accounts emerge portraying chaos in the greek isles a mattress as escape slide melissa mitcham was standing on the top deck of the ton cruise ship sea diamond earlier this month photographing the rugged red cliffs and whitewashed villas of the fabled greek island of santorini when a friend pointed down at the crystalline water and said "look at how close those rocks look " ms mitcham felt a sudden lurch the sea diamond and its passengers and crew had foundered on the underwater volcanic reef that shelters santorini bay from the aegean sea by the next morning the harbor had swallowed the greek flagged ship the first time a large cruise vessel has sunk since the achille lauro burned off the coast of somalia in and one of only a handful of major cruise ship sinkings in several decades all but two of the sea diamonds passengers survived following a chaotic evacuation that took hours involving life boats that crew members struggled to operate and scores of local fishermen and ferries answering a mayday whistle to pluck passengers from danger louis cruise lines the operator of the ship says passengers underwent a standard safety drill on the first day of the cruise to establish muster points for an evacuation and outline other emergency basics but many survivors most of them americans on spring vacations say the drill did little to prepare them for the confusion of the actual accident their accounts of the wreck and evacuation paint an unsettling portrait of a crew and command seemingly awkward in an emergency the accident came at a time when the number of americans buying cruise ship tickets abroad is soaring not since the last heyday of trans atlantic cruise liners in the s have so many americans spent so much time on waters far from the u s coast and caribbean in addition to new vessels from global industry leaders like carnival and royal caribbean cruises smaller and largely domestic companies like cyprus based louis cruise lines are also sailing more than ever while ferries often make headlines after disasters such as recent sinkings in indonesia and egypt cruise lines by and large are considered by maritime experts as some of the safest vessels sailing the popularity of cruising means most fleets are newer than ever and because their very livelihood depends on the enjoyment and well being of passengers operators go to great lengths to test equipment and on board procedures which are regulated by international shipping laws michael marathestis a spokesman for cyprus based louis says while crews regularly prepare for such scenarios the extreme circumstances of an evacuation prevent it from ever being routine "there are complaints but an event like this is never rational the crew did their best in a far from normal disembarkation " greek authorities are blaming the sea diamonds april accident on "human error " the captain and five crew members have been charged with negligence for steering the ship off course louis cruise lines which sails throughout the mediterranean wasnt known to have had any serious mishaps in the past after the accident the company said its crew followed established regulations and procedures practiced weekly to safely evacuate the ship the sea diamond was no small boat or cheap sightseeing ferry the four day cruise cost about &# yet lifejackets were hard to find for some passengers shipboard lighting failed and worse those aboard recall officials did little to inform passengers of a problem "we didnt know how serious it was " says ms mitcham a speech pathologist from carrollton ga who was separated from her year old son mason for more than three hours during the ordeal after stepping down from her vantage point because of the unexpected lurch the deck began slanting at first she and four friends thought the ship was making a tight turn into the harbor indeed there was no official indication the ship was in trouble until at least minutes after it ran aground around p m local time because the ship was supposed to have dropped anchor by p m ms mitcham and her friends remained topside commenting on the delay and joking about "people walking at a funny angle " shortly after p m a crew member spoke into the intercom asking passengers to remain calm but offering no explanation as to why passengers should feel otherwise a similar announcement followed five minutes later by p m another announcement was made asking passengers to move away from the starboard side of the ship not until about p m did officers blare an sos through the ships horn prompting surrounding vessels to rush toward the sea diamond helicopters arrived and circled the ship overhead over the following two hours crew members struggled to guide passengers to lifeboat stations and cargo ramps beneath which the rescue vessels awaited mr marathestis the louis spokesman says the ships officers in conjunction with port authorities decided against a faster evacuation because it was apparent the ship wouldnt sink immediately "when you do a forceful evacuation it is likely you have serious injuries and accidents we tried to avoid that with a slower but more orderly process " order however wasnt what many passengers recall samantha putman a year old from winston salem n c was stepping out of the shower when the jolt threw her to the ground she heard a "giant scraping sound" and smelled burning metal a few minutes later a friend from her spring break school group banged on her cabin door yelling "were taking on water " because her cabin was just one deck up from where the reef ripped through the ships hull ms putman and her neighbors were among the first to grasp the severity of the problem "you could hear water gushing in below us " she recalls ms putman threw on jeans a sweater and flip flops and grabbed three life jackets from the cabin she then rushed out into the passageway where people were already rushing up from the lower level some of them wet and bleeding from cuts "it was crazy and tilted and hard to climb toward the stairways " she says on her way toward the stairs the passageway grew increasingly crowded and the lights on the ship began to fail as the incoming seawater began to short the vessels electrical systems according to witnesses a fellow passenger ripped a lifejacket from her arm as crew members appeared and tried to manage the flow of traffic they directed passengers away from a malfunctioning elevator where at least one woman was already trapped her arm jerking about through a crack between the doors within minutes ms putman made her way up to her muster station at one of the outdoor decks another two hours passed however before crew members with flashlights guided those at the station back down through darkened passageways to a cargo ramp there they descended a plank that rescuers had lashed to a waiting ferry for those wary of taking the wobbly step down to the rescue vessel personnel had also tied a mattress to act as a slide down onto the ferry passengers said "it was not a fast process " says zak hayes another student from the north carolina group the process was even slower for those far from the point of impact ms mitcham and her four friends from georgia for instance didnt attempt to go to their station until shortly after p m when they heard the sos once they came down from the upper deck though they realized the lower decks were already crowded with people most of whom were also uninformed and without life jackets because many passengers were ready to disembark when the ship ran aground they were far from the emergency flotation devices stored back in their cabins as crew members began to appear with armloads of life jackets they began passing them through the dense crowd relying on passengers at the front of the throng to relay them back toward the rear some passengers tried to hoard them other passengers said most were apparently still clueless that the ship was actually sinking ms mitcham finally realized around p m when she recognized a waiter looking as if he had just rushed out of his cabin from a nap wearing his waiters jacket over a bare chest he told her "we abandon ship " she immediately feared for mason who earlier had joined a group preparing for a sailboat excursion in port because of the growing crowd though she couldnt maneuver to search for him "people were rude " she recalls "there was a lot of pushing and shoving " around p m witnesses say crew members began spreading word for women and children to move toward lifeboat stations along the port side of the vessel but the crowds remained thick and crew members labored to mobilize the passengers as they waited for passengers to begin disembarking mary gwen wilson one of ms mitchams companions saw crew members struggle with ropes and pulleys to lower a lifeboat with about people in it when one crew member managed to pull a rope free the lifeboat dropped several yards nearly hurling him overboard "it looked like they hadnt done it before " she says the company says the ships tilt made equipment unwieldy "youre not talking about straight lines anymore " says mr marathestis "the ship had taken a list and made it more difficult to get the lifeboats down " eventually the lifeboats began to descend and the crowd began to thin by p m ms mitchams group all had life jackets crew members then began guiding them toward a stairwell and down into the ships dark interior she said unable to see clearly in the dark she and others held onto the straps of life jackets worn by the passengers ahead of them slowly the group snaked its way down to a cargo ramp where they walked the plank onto a ferry ms mitchams group was headed into port by p m she kept looking back at the sinking ship worrying about her son mason it turned out had already made it off instead of waiting for the logjam to clear up at lifeboat stations and the cargo doors he joined another group of passengers who climbed down rope ladders dangled across the listing hull "everybody was giving instructions " says mason "we didnt know which ones to follow " the sea diamond sank shortly before dawn on april now feet underwater there are no current plans to dredge it up crews are studying how to pump the ships fuel tanks to keep them from further staining the bay
