the debt collector vs the widow viola sue kell thought her social security benefits were safe in the bank she was wrong fyffe ala heart surgery halted viola sue kells work sewing carpets in a rug mill in it was the end of years of cleaning motel rooms restaurant jobs "just hard stuff " says mrs kell a year old widow she applied for social security disability and her monthly &# benefit now is her only income but when mrs kell tried to pay her mortgage and electric bills in her checks bounced every cent of the social security check which went straight to her bank each month had been taken by a debt collector that had garnished her bank account federal law says creditors cant take social security and veterans benefits to pay debts yet the practice is widespread there is no established process for enforcing the federal prohibition when banks receive a garnishment order their standard response is to freeze the customers account banks say its not their job to check whether accounts contain cash from exempt sources collectors also dont treat it as their job so the burden falls on social security recipients typically elderly or disabled who have suddenly lost access to their bank accounts and have no idea what to do in a debt collector decided mrs kell in alabama owed &# on a three year old hospital bill it obtained a court judgment and sent a garnishment order to her bank the bank froze her account which contained &# all from social security "i was scared to death " mrs kell says "i didnt have any way of getting any money " at a loss she looked in the yellow pages for a lawyer "im not very good with things when it comes to law my husband took care of all that " she says she found a legal aid office miles away from her rural home and drove over the mountain with her bank statements and social security papers what mrs kell didnt know was that account holders can file a claim with a debt collector to have any funds that came from social security or veterans benefits exempted but federal law doesnt say who should tell them this even social securitys web site doesnt "the social security administrations responsibility for protecting benefits from legal process ends when the beneficiary is paid " said a spokeswoman she said if benefits are taken "as part of a legal process " beneficiaries can cite the exemption "as a defense against such actions " legal services alabama helped mrs kell file an exemption claim and her bank first federal in fort payne ala released her account the bank said it had frozen it because it must comply with court orders "its not a banks place to raise an exemption claim for a customer " said a first federal lawyer "it would be overwhelming " the garnishment process can be rewarding for banks when they restrain an account they collect a range of fees for imposing the freeze for the resulting bounced checks or for short term loans to prevent bounced checks if the account contains social security banks commonly collect these fees and their loan repayment out of those exempt funds banks argue that the ban on collecting debts out of social security benefits doesnt apply to them worsening the problem paradoxically is direct deposit of benefit checks this is meant to make benefits more secure it means "you can rest assured your money is safe " says the social security web site direct deposit became mandatory in unless beneficiaries opt out and more than of recipients of regular social security use it as do a majority of disability recipients but direct deposit has had an unintended result an infrastructure that makes it cheaper and easier for collectors to pursue elderly or disabled subjects of old debts these people can be hard for collectors to find sometimes because theyve moved to retirement areas but debt collectors knowing that millions of retirees are having money sent straight to banks can electronically ask a large bank if a given individual has an account with the bank anywhere in the u s if a direct deposit social security account turns up the collector garnishes it mrs kell decided to get her social security check by mail and had to drive miles to cash the check at a wal mart and buy money orders to pay bills later after her lawyer spoke to the bank she resumed direct deposit she gets food donations from first baptist church and free garden seeds from a methodist group "im pretty well fixed for food " mrs kell says once shes done paying off her debts she says she hopes to save enough money to visit her husbands grave in georgia while collectors can take many of the steps to garnish an account electronically its up to seniors and the disabled to file physical papers to prove their benefits are exempt as a practical matter if they dont get help from a lawyer they may not know their funds are exempt and depending on the state they live in if they dont claim an exemption in time generally between and days benefits that were garnished can be lost for good dolores and robert weise moved to a mobile home in hernando fla from new windsor n y three years ago looking for a cheaper place to live robert a year old former paper salesman was fighting colon cancer and the medical bills "put us down the drain " says mrs weise she opened an account at a florida branch of wachovia corp which received their social security by direct deposit in july mrs weise tried to withdraw &# at an atm for chemotherapy co payments but her account was frozen the bank had received a garnishment order mrs weise didnt know social security was exempt and the bank didnt tell her according to an account from her that is supported by correspondence among mrs weise the bank and the debt collector the bank told her to take up the matter with the collector a new york firm called mel harris &amp associates the collector also didnt tell her her funds were exempt according to mrs weise but she says it told her that if she authorized her bank to wire it &# for an old credit card debt harris would lift the garnishment order collectors obtain such orders by suing debtors usually in small claims court these clogged courts issue the orders routinely if the named debtor doesnt show up or fight the request for any reason sometimes the reason is that a summons was sent to an old address in the weises case the garnishment order shows the summons was sent to an outdated address in new york state at her bank mrs weise says "i was on my knees it was like our last dollar i didnt even have money to buy gas to get home " distraught she authorized the bank to send mel harris the money the bank then unfroze her remaining funds minus a &# processing fee mel harris declined to comment wachovia said it couldnt comment on a customer because of privacy rules but is "committed to protecting the safety of our customers funds while complying with state and federal law " it said state codes provide instructions for customers to claim their exemptions "we are required to honor valid garnishment orders and are simply following the rules and regulations set forth in federal and state laws " said a bank spokesman however the garnishment order for the weises account stated "funds defined as exempt or otherwise excluded under applicable law must not be restrained under this notice " the wachovia spokesman said banks "are not in a position to determine the character of funds at any given point in the account " garnishment orders often originate with big debt buyers that acquire large portfolios of old debts written off by credit card firms retailers and so forth in the weises case a debt buyer had purchased a batch of old credit card debts and hired mel harris to try to collect them debt buyers and collectors obtain millions of garnishment orders each year a trade group representing debt buyers said they have "a positive role in the economy returning to creditors a portion of their investment which benefits consumers in the form of more credit and lower interest rates " barbara sinsley general counsel of the group dba international added "it isnt the intention of debt buyers to garnish exempt funds " legal aid offices say they often get calls from frantic seniors wrestling with collectors whove frozen their social security money and wont let go the offices say some collectors appear to automatically deny exemption claims and drag out

so but two days later it filed a garnishment order again the fifth time it had done so "mrs rice said this caused her more stress than having her stroke " said kathleen eveslage of southern minnesota regional legal services "they basically made her last days hell " in november she died about a year later minnesotas attorney general sued messerli &amp kramer alleging that it repeatedly garnishes accounts containing exempt funds and unlawfully denies exemption claims messerli &amp kramer said it cant comment during the suit pending in dakota county district court "these people keep garnishing

collector got a default judgment against him and garnished his credit union account which contained his social security and his veterans benefits he sent an exemption claim attaching a letter from the social security administration messerli &amp kramer rejected the claim saying he had "failed to provide sufficient proof that the funds withheld are exempt " in an attempt to protect his future checks mr bender stopped direct deposit he then had to arrange a week in advance to have a bus service for the disabled take him to a bank to cash his check and pay bills even though he no longer had the car hed bought and although all of his income was exempt from creditors under law mr bender was determined to pay off the car loan he filed a bankruptcy petition that enabled him to set up a long repayment schedule finally paying it off this month many banks say its too hard to keep track of whether money in accounts is exempt from debt collection yet some banks find it possible banco popular says when it gets a garnishment order it looks at account deposits for the past days and if all of them involved exempt funds it rejects the order if it finds a mixture of exempt and non exempt funds it advises the creditor of this says the bank which is based in puerto rico and has u s and caribbean operations consumer advocates say banks should be able to keep track because they have complex
