the buzz marketwatch weekend investor choosing accounting lets firms play even more games the latest round of quarterly earnings has included a bumper crop of companies that turned in much better than expected results "blew away estimates " was uttered over and over by commentators on cnbc about companies as diverse as apple inc cummins inc and nutrisystem inc more than half of the companies that comprise the standard &amp poors stock index have reported earnings and two thirds have posted per share results that beat expectations by an average of according to thomson financial compared with over the past eight quarters two explanations spring to mind either companies arent very good at forecasting which means they shouldnt give profit targets at all or they are purposely low balling to spur postearnings enthusiasm in investors interestingly or troubling depending on your perspective is that revenue growth of has been outpaced by per share earnings growth of the implication is that companies are squeezing more profit out of every sale many of them very well may have helped in large part by the weak dollars influence on international revenue but stock buybacks which can boost per share results by reducing the number of shares outstanding and other maneuvers also appear to have played a role as companies manipulate the legal levers to game the system so that their earnings will look more robust if companies game the only set of rules they are allowed to play by now imagine how confusing things will get for investors if companies can choose from two sets of rules that is a possible outcome of an idea floated by the securities and exchange commission companies based in the u s are required to use generally accepted accounting principles or gaap to compute their financial results foreign companies with securities traded in the u s roughly of the companies that file earnings with the sec must reconcile their results with gaap standards which they claim is time consuming and costly in the absence of a single universally accepted international standard the sec is considering rules that would allow foreign companies to choose between using gaap and what are called international financial reporting standards or ifrs with a goal to abolishing the reconciliation exercise by the two accounting systems are broadly similar and are growing closer as the bodies that create these rules look to converge them through work on joint projects the main difference is that ifrs is written more in the form of principles that companies should follow while u s gaap is composed of a huge body of detailed rules it would seem logical then that the same choice should be granted to u s companies as a result "were asking a question why shouldnt we let a u s company choose " says john white director of the secs division of corporate finance that might sound good in theory but lynn turner of research firm glass lewis and former chief accountant of the sec says it will work only if the two standards are comparable right now he says there still are "holes" for such industries as insurance which is complicated enough for even sophisticated investors to figure out without letting different companies play by different rules "i have always believed that if investors are to make fully informed decisions as to which companies they should allocate their capital the accounting standards used to inform those decisions must result in comparable consistent accounting across the universe of companies that have similar transactions " mr turner says "to do otherwise creates comparisons of apples to oranges which does not work " former sec chairman arthur levitt a longtime proponent of a single international standard is more to the point "the menu system i believe leads to earnings management and that should be avoided " that seems obvious enough game over meanwhile back at home most companies dont come right out and say they manage expectations to beat estimates nutrisystem seems to come close the diet company has a history of blowing past its profit targets and analysts forecasts its stock in recent months has performed more like a yo yo dieter in the wake of several changes to its forecasts in january the stock stumbled after the company lowered the bar relative to first quarter expectations a few weeks later with the quarter half over it raised its forecast its stock rose on the news when the results were released this past week they were stronger than even the most bullish analyst expected that caused its stock thursday to open higher though it closed up just friday the stock rose an additional does the company manage expectations "what we want to do is build credibility by making promises we deliver on " says chief executive michael hagan speaking on a conference call in january about its fourth quarter earnings chief financial officer jim brown took it a step further "we always want to be sort of more likely than not that were going to exceed our guidance " in corporate speak that almost passes for candor herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer
