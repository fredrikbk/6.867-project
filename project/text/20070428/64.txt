pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece viennas quiet standout the secession building is a chaste temple of the arts anatomy of a classic as a shocking monument against conventional taste the secession building by joseph maria olbrich in vienna has sustained its contrary reputation shockingly well nose thumbing gestures by brash architects are not always appreciated or even explicable years later as impassioned motives behind a rebellion cool and anneal into orthodoxy but this white walled temple to the arts erected in as an exhibition space for young artists and designers gustav klimt koloman moser max kurzweil josef hoffmann alfred roller egon schiele and others unhappy with the stuffiness of viennese academia continues to stand out from its peers and to do so quietly indeed the chaste exterior and modest scale were among the most outrageous elements of olbrichs scheme the white stucco distinguished the place at a glance from the looming gray institutions of stone that went up in the last half of the th century along the ringstrasse in this former capital of austria hungary the empire "on which the sun never rises " as local gadfly karl kraus once wrote there isnt anything in the vicinity of its site on the karlsplatz or perhaps anywhere then or now that quite resembles the secession this isnt necessarily a compliment the blueprints havent inspired a host of imitations "the building seems somewhat mad to me " a city councilor declared when the plans were first unveiled a reaction that shouldnt be dismissed to be blase about the radical aestheticism of the secessionists is to diminish their challenge to the established order olbrich was only when he received the commission a student of the revered otto wagner with whom he collaborated in on a steel and marble railroad station another masterpiece of jugendstil and also in the karlsplatz he had considerable input from klimt as he sketched the symbolic program for the building it is oriented so that the facade confronts both the karlskirche fischer von erlachs baroque cathedral and one of viennas architectural landmarks as well as the kunstlerhaus home to an artists society that at the time monopolized art exhibitions in the city the completed work was antagonistic toward its neighbors however only in being inner directed and contradictory with its interlocking planes and rectangles boxes within boxes the building has been called cubist but unlike the austere designs of his contemporary adolph loos which do away with vitruvian ornament and signal a sharp break with the past olbrichs melding of architectural styles egyptian and greek revival in the structure an elaborate jugenstil decorative program around the exterior seems pre modernist it is in some ways as much of a grab bag of historicist quotations as the imperial museums of gottfried semper whose style the secessionists were rebelling against they just werent beholden to the weighty hand of tradition "we havent even got one " claimed the editors in the first issue of their official journal ver sacrum published in to coincide with the opening of the building as befits a temple where one goes to worship art for arts sake the portal is the focus of attention an exhortation in gold lettering on the cornice reads "der zeit ihre kunst der kunst ihre freiheit" to each age its art to each art its freedom below these words are the three muses of painting architecture and sculpture wreathed around their heads and necks are snakes and lizards eating their own tails an iteration of the theme that the fine and applied arts should not only be free but equal and conjoined uniting these elements and the central vertical note in the largely horizontal layout is the depiction of a golden laurel tree its leaves and branches carved in shallow relief around the entrance niche burst into a three dimensional crown held between four pylons on the roof olbrichs fanciful interpretation of a cupola the secession building functions thus metaphorically as a garden for nurturing artists the sphere of laurel leaves has also been called less poetically an exposed brain and a head of cabbage standing on the roof late one afternoon beneath the metal open work and looking up at the sky i thought one could also read the gilded leaves and berries as a set of planets and constellations in truth it was mainly this white and gold flowery exterior that attracted the scorn of the viennese critics the interior was at the time generally praised as an exhibition space after ascending the steps of the shrine and passing through the embossed green copper doors a hoffmann design one is suddenly in a supremely rational if small chamber shaped like a greek cross on the other side of a partition are the very functional galleries the secession building was one of the first "white cubes " the pale blank inside walls a tabula rasa for curators the rooms also featured indirect lighting through slanted glass roof panels that olbrich cleverly disguised to be unobtrusive from the street this glazed canopy was supported by slender steel beams and trusses a balancing feat that has earned him new admiration from engineers support over the decades for the building has been a constant among influential sectors of viennas arts community even as political vagaries have threatened its existence karl wittgenstein one of austrias leading industrialists and the father of eight children including the pianist paul and the philosopher ludwig largely financed construction but in the early s it became one of the first places in vienna to fly the swastika the nazis converted it to a grain silo in three allied bombs leveled the rear gallery portions in and the wehrmacht burned everything to the ground a few days before the russian army arrived not until did exhibitions resume and not until did the plan of rooms begin to resemble the original a wall of photographs in the basement chronicles the destruction and reconstruction in the beethoven frieze by klimt originally part of a temporary secession exhibition in was bought by the austrian government and restored subject to many of the same wartime indignities as the building it had been seized from its jewish owners the lederer family and placed in "state custody " the murals profess an ardent belief in the redemptive forces of art although music lovers may have trouble seeing connections between beethovens ninth symphony and klimts feverish mythology which involves many naked women as well as a gorilla in the work was installed in a permanent room in the basement and opened to the public visitors today eager to ogle the klimt should not overlook the other galleries at the secession building returning to its original mission as a cultivator of the avant garde it has for more than years maintained one of the most ambitious exhibition programs for contemporary art in vienna indeed in europe olbrichs generation has triumphed and no longer has a reason to secede the unconventional is now the status quo mr woodward is an arts writer in new york
