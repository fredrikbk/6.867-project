pursuits sports &amp recreation golf journal getting tutored by tiger the pro gives a private lesson of sorts to a group of amateurs including our columnist oakmont pa when last we saw tiger woods on the back nine at the masters three weeks ago he was in a mood most foul on the th hole he broke his four iron against a tree while hitting a shot still in contention on the th he dumped his second shot into the water on the th he hit his approach into a bunker prompting a scary angry outburst to his caddie the worlds no golfer is known for his fierce intensity on the course and his controlled remoteness with the media last monday however an extremely open and relaxed mr woods surprised about american express cardholders by crashing their lunch at oakmont country club near pittsburgh the site of next junes u s open and inviting them to follow him around the devilish course during his afternoon practice round it seems that behind the game mask mr woods has a light hearted even comic personality "remember the four iron i snapped at the masters " he asked the gallery before teeing off on the second hole he held the club aloft with a faux innocent smile "i had it fixed " the four hour visit with mr woods was arranged by american express for cardholders mostly from the pittsburgh area who had signed up for a &# morning round of golf at oakmont followed by what they thought would be an afternoon session with usga and club officials about preparing a course for the open championship since such a stunt has little value to american express without a bit of publicity the company let a handful of media types including yours truly in on the secret in advance "thatll work " mr woods deadpanned after his opening drive of the day soared yards down the middle of the first fairway the up close sound that mr woodss shots make especially those hit with the abnormally loud square headed driver he was testing are unlike anything you ever hear at the muni so preposterous was this opening wallop and many that came after it that everyone in the gallery spontaneously laughed and then whooped and applauded if only because crying seemed out of place the organizers arranged for several oakmont members to serve as marshals they didnt lack for volunteers they walked with a foot length of rope to keep the gallery organized and a safe distance behind mr woods but in the first fairway he motioned us closer and urged us to make comments or ask questions one of the first came after he three putted the first green "tiger im one up on you " shouted someone who happened to have parred the hole that morning mr woods asked if he wanted to put some money on the rest of the match later when one of mr woodss drives ballooned a bit in the wind and carried only yards or so a fan blurted out with mock confusion "tiger what happened " mr woods responded "short and straight thats my new game plan " each hole was a mini clinic as mr woods explained his strategy from tee to green and how he intended to hit the next shot for most of his approaches he attempted left to right cuts because they tend to hold hard fast u s open greens better than right to left draws but depending on the wind he hit big cuts or subtle cuts some very high some very low the only time he advised not thinking much about shot shape was off the tee on par fives "then i just try to hit the crap out of the ball " he said in majors he said his primary strategy was to avoid bogeys and in any recovery situation to try first and foremost to avoid double bogey "eagles are rare right i like to think that double bogeys are just the same " he said when we reached oakmonts famous row of church pew bunkers between the third and fourth fairways someone asked if he would demonstrate how to hit a shot out of them he refused "why bring negativity into your thoughts " he said adding he only practiced from places he intended to play eventually he did jump into the bunker for fun "ok im here " he said and invited a willing fan to come down and take a shot for him for me the golf high point of the day was watching mr woods lace yard three wood stingers into powerful headwinds the sound and power of those shots were startling "this one i dont want to climb more than head high " he explained before one and it didnt on the th tee he explained how he hits them "its pretty simple in that its the same shot i hit with my sand wedge only with a longer club i try to get the emblem on my glove going at the target as long as i can and cut off my follow through like this " he said demonstrating a low pitch with his wedge then he did the same with a three wood drawing gasps "so what im saying is dont make it more complicated than it needs to be " right but not every shot came off exactly as he intended one fairway bunker shot caught the lip and popped into the next bunker forward "tiger going trap to trap and i witnessed it " the man next to me marveled he also seemed human in choosing lower numbered clubs than one would expect for certain shots into the wind such as a punch eight iron from yards and a six iron from yards on the yard final hole into the wind he hit his approach with a five wood "this is my senior club " he said "when you turn you get a five wood when you turn you get at seven wood when you turn you get a nine wood " but dont expect to see friendly tiger during the actual open this was his first ever trip to oakmont and he said it was the hardest tournament course hes ever played email me at golfjournal wsj com
