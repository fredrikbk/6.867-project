targeting oil infrastructure shortly after the u s led invasion of iraq in insurgents there started targeting oil pipelines and other infrastructure to trip up the u s occupation which had counted on increasing oil revenue to help rebuild the country meanwhile tight supplies globally amid soaring demand have made even small attacks or disruptions in places like iraq venezuela and africa capable of sending crude markets soaring in a sophisticated seaborne attack against iraqs oil export terminals in the persian gulf rattled markets and highlighted the sudden vulnerability of largely unprotected infrastructure around the world later that same year nigerian militants targeted oil installations carefully timing attacks and press releases about the attacks for maximum effect in global crude markets the world depends critically on saudi oil which accounts for roughly of global supply in turn the kingdoms rulers depend heavily on oil exports which account for about of state revenue and around of the countrys gross domestic product in recent years the saudis have spent large amounts of money on security for their oil installations which have either been threatened or come under actual attack as happened in february the saudis also have become important to the global economy by spending their oil revenue which has been rising strongly along with rising oil prices according to saudi arabias samba financial group the kingdoms oil exports totaled &# billion in up from &# billion in the saudi arrests stem from a new crackdown on jihadist militants following a resurgence of al qaeda in the kingdom after nearly a year of little activity according to u s intelligence officials and analysts the first sign that the group was intent on making a comeback came in february when the voice of jihad an al qaeda publication that was driven underground last year suddenly reappeared on the streets of saudi arabia nearly three weeks later an al qaeda cell led by walid al radadi a midlevel al qaeda commander that the saudi security services had previously reported killed led a drive by shooting attack against a group of french expatriates in northwestern saudi arabia according to intelligence officials three people died in the attack saudi officials initially denied the attack was terrorist related later they said it was an opportunistic al qaeda attack that was planned after mr al radadi had spotted the french group driving along an isolated desert road in the area saudi security services have since stepped up surveillance of resurgent al qaeda cells leading to the arrests friday "the saudis know how to read the writing on the wall and reacted " said evan kohlman who monitors jihadist web sites and advises various governments and police forces on terrorism a recent state department study of u s saudi relations found that saudi arabia recently had improved its capabilities to disrupt terrorist organizations and pre empt the resurgence of al qaeda and any attacks in particular it said saudi security forces had killed or captured all members of an al qaeda cell that had conducted the february attack on the abqaiq refinery in eastern saudi arabia in the latest edition of voice of jihad al qaeda claimed that wasnt the case and featured a series of interviews and articles about last years attack on the refinery the attack ended in two suicide bombers detonating themselves at the refinery last year but causing no damage to the plant saudi security services said at the time that the attack happened outside the plant but the magazine claimed the attackers managed to storm the back gate and kill several guards the articles were accompanied by a message urging muslims to step up attacks on oil installations including refineries wells and pipelines around the world "in all regions that america benefits from " last year a pamphlet was published in saudi arabia called "the laws of targeting petroleum related interests and a review of the laws pertaining to the economic jihad " written by an al qaeda ideologue named abdelaziz al anzi who is currently in saudi custody in the paper he wrote that oil not only is a vital resource for the west but "enabled america to dominate the world " "the targeting of oil facilities is a legitimate means of economic jihad " mr anzi wrote oil pipelines and refineries were recommended as good easy targets along with killing executives and workers of western oil companies the best reason of all for attacking oil facilities "is the damage to americas economic reputation that happens when her interests in oil producing countries are threatened " a collateral benefit for militants is that western countries must spend huge sums of money guarding the plants and researching alternative energy sources al qaeda leader osama bin laden has said one of his aims is to economically bleed the u s by forcing excessive security spending badr al humaydi an al qaeda operative who supposedly participated in the february saudi refinery attack said in voice of jihad that the strike was carried out "according to the wishes" of osama bin laden bhushan bahree contributed to this article
