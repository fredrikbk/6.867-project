about more of mr dillaboughs picks at wsj com businessinsight q&amp a strategies for growth for companies seeking ways to grow the best option often is easy to miss because its right in their own backyard thats according to chris zook a partner and head of global strategy practice for consultants bain &amp co in amsterdam mr zook says many companies have hidden assets resources whose full potential has remained dormant or unknown the author of several books including "unstoppable finding hidden assets to renew the core and fuel profitable growth " he recently spoke with the online journal about strategies for growth here are excerpts from that interview q why do many companies best assets become hidden or go untapped for so long a in our study of companies that redefined strategies in their core business successfully and achieved a renewed wave of growth we noticed that of them had built their new wave of growth around assets they had access to or owned in their core but had not fully utilized all of those were known to the company but what was not known was their full potential and the reason their potential was often not known is because the company had failed in some cases to have the chance to look at their entire business in a new light its more difficult to find paths using hidden assets than to believe youll leap to a new market or make a huge acquisition or trigger an innovation program at a corporate level but often thats the hard right path versus the easy wrong path q when is it time for a company to consider expanding beyond its core business a usually a company has to consider redefining its core business when one of three things happens either the pool of profits in its industry begins to collapse as it did in the airline industry or begins to move elsewhere like it did in computers moving to services or second when its attacked by a powerful new business model or technology that is superior so people who made cameras based on film had to react to digital technology or third their primary source of differentiation in the market begins to erode so you often see a company that jumps out ahead and people begin to catch up to them as you saw with lowes catching up to home depot those are the three tests if you dont satisfy one of those three tests it probably means you should go back and look deeply in your core business and not redefine yourself keith huang online today see the full interview at wsj com businessinsight go to wsj com businessinsight for a range of forums videos and podcasts that are part
