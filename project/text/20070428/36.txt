hot topic economic ups and downs investors and the statisticians sent seemingly contradictory messages this week with the dow jones industrial average hitting new highs and breaking past while gdp growth for the first quarter came in at its lowest level since before the tax cuts so whom do you believe the stock market is hardly a perfect predictor of the future and the recent upward trend could reverse itself at any time but the market is as the old adage goes a mechanism for discounting the future while statistics like fridays gdp estimate are calculations about the past so if we had to choose between the two conflicting signals wed put our money on the collective sense of the market which these days is saying that the economy is stronger than the conventional wisdom would have you think the housing slump has undeniably taken its toll on overall growth for the past three quarters and that continued in the first quarter of this year for the quarter the decline in residential investment shaved about one percentage point off gdp growth the good news is that the housing slump shows no signs of tanking the larger economy unemployment remains low at and wages are rising amid an overall very tight labor market especially for skilled workers this wage growth in turn is helping consumer spending which continues to increase despite rising gas prices hidden beneath fridays disappointing headline growth number of was growth in consumer spending on an annual basis thats none too shabby given that home equity extraction has dropped precipitously with rising interest rates and falling home prices corporate profits meanwhile continue to come in ahead of expectations even though profit growth will likely come out slower in the first quarter than the double digit rates of recent years trade also knocked first quarter gdp down by about as exports declined and imports rose rising imports are a sign of strong domestic growth and we doubt exports will keep falling given buoyant growth overseas trade figures are a part of the gdp report often subject to revision and that could make the quarter look better in future weeks if theres a real red flag in yesterdays economic data its the inflation numbers the personal consumption expenditures deflator the inflation measure used to derive real economic growth from the nominal figure rose at a rate in the first quarter the "core" number which excludes food and energy prices rose by still above the federal reserves comfort range the core number has now been above for more than a year and the inflation expectation for the coming year as measured by the bureau of labor statistics is above theres still too much underlying strength in the economy to call this stagflation it looks more like "growthflation " to borrow a phrase from economist michael darda the fed has been betting that slower growth would bring inflation down thus vindicating its decision to stop raising interest rates last year but we all learned in the s or should have that inflation can coexist with slower growth inflation is a monetary phenomenon and bringing it under control means creating fewer dollars we doubt the fed will find much inflation comfort in fridays data and it shouldnt with gold near &# an ounce and the dollar hitting record lows against the euro the danger is too much dollar liquidity not too little the fed has been hoping to see how bad the housing slump gets before it considers further tightening but in the meantime price pressures have been building and dollars are sloshing around the world as we said last year we think the fed would have done better had it not gone on "pause " the stock market closed basically flat on friday suggesting that the headline gdp weakness didnt spook anyone much the dows march into record territory this week signals that investors believe that the economy will emerge from this inflationary period intact but wall streets professional economists have been underestimating the inflationary threat since this cycle began theres no sign that this has changed which means that the further tightening that the fed will likely have to come to grips with may come as a rude awakening to some wall street pros all of which is another reason that this is exactly the wrong moment for congress to be toying with tax increases and protectionism the expiration of the and tax cuts is looming ever larger as an economic question mark we can expect to feel the effects of that event long before new years day tax rates affect decisions throughout the economy and unless those cuts are made permanent or a pro growth tax reform is put in place to replace them their expiration will influence economic activity before that day arrives economic decision makers like the markets try to look forward rather than back
