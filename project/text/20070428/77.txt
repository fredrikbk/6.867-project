remembrances jack valenti eloquent defender of hollywood urged unity as scenes changed as the longtime head of the film industrys powerful trade group the motion picture association of america jack valenti was hollywoods most notorious scene stealer with a syrupy texas drawl impressive verbal dexterity and far reaching vocabulary mr valenti who died thursday in washington d c at age was famous for his oratorical pyrotechnics as he passionately defended hollywood against all comers "one thing that was commonly known by every man woman and child in our world was dont ever get on a stage following jack valenti " says jeffrey katzenberg chief executive of dreamworks animation skg words mr katzenberg adds were mr valentis "weapon of choice " so armed mr valenti was empowered to speak for a united hollywood in a way that likely will never be possible again a decorated bomber pilot who became a special assistant and trusted adviser to president lyndon johnson mr valenti quit the white house in to become hollywoods top lobbyist in washington it was a simpler time in the movie business the studios made films and tv shows and that was about it theater owners and broadcast tv networks were the common enemies mr valenti was the powerful persuasive advocate for companies that largely shared the same concerns involving the protection of the intellectual property they created in a town already filled with eccentrics mr valenti cut a unique figure he was known to pen his baroque speeches from a poolside perch at the beverly hills hotel where he was once observed poring over "the decline and fall of the roman empire" for ideas regardless of whoever else was around it was always clear who spoke as the lead voice of hollywood in a congressional subcommittee convened in los angeles to hear testimony on how a new device called the videocassette recorder might affect the business of making movies and tv shows on paper the star witness was clint eastwood the actor and director who had been drafted to represent the view of filmmakers but when the committee chair asked whether mr eastwood would lead off the testimony mr valenti replied "no i will speak first " what followed was a nearly unbroken word tour de force on behalf of the movie industry with his trademark theatricality mr valenti began by describing the film industry as "a great national asset to this country to the u s treasury and the strength of the american dollar " the vcr with its ability to record tv programs and movies without the owners permission was like a "great tidal wave off the shore " unfairly threatening the national treasure that is hollywood rolling at full speed mr valenti let fly a doozy "i say to you that the vcr is to the american film producer and the american public as the boston strangler is to the woman home alone " he apologized for running minutes longer than expected submitted pages of support materials and finally yielded to mr eastwood the "dirty harry" star virtually surrendered on the spot "you know " he began "i got so wrapped up in jacks speech that i dont know i was just kind of dazzled " after just a few sentences he offered to simply "read jacks speech again " during that era mr valenti scored big victories against both broadcasters and cable operators occasionally overplaying his hand as in the vcr debate but the landscape was shifting dramatically the studios were bought up by bigger companies and their interests no longer neatly lined up suddenly studios were part of the same organizations as their former enemies the cable systems and broadcast networks the mpaas "presidents meetings" knights of the roundtable affairs in which the chief of each studio would gather to plot strategy became contentious "sometimes meetings would get quite heated and before you even sipped your coffee someone was blowing off steam " says bob daly the former co chief executive of warner bros "jack was smart enough to let everyone blow off the steam because thats what theyd arrive with hed let everybody go at it eventually we would wear ourselves out and then jack would tell us it was time to come to a common decision and we would even though we knew that our various business interests could be affected by these decisions jack made us concede that none of our businesses would be devastated by a particular decision " but even the hyperbolic mr valenti found it difficult to continue forging such forced unity mr valenti "realized something important " says news corp president and chief operating officer peter chernin "it was a bad idea to get all those guys into the same room " for the past decade or so before his retirement mr valenti held only two or three meetings of the company presidents preferring to shuttle from party to party to solve problems at one point mr chernin recalls "jack called a meeting and we all laughed about it because we realized it was the first meeting wed had in five years " mr valentis job has been filled by dan glickman a former u s agriculture secretary who was also a longtime congressman from kansas but it is a different job today than it was during mr valentis heyday the mpaas member companies today have little in common aside from fighting piracy around the globe a big task to be sure and maintaining its famous ratings systems one of mr valentis primary legacies on many of the big issues like the industrys struggle to control its content on video sharing services like youtube the member companies make their own decisions these days says mr katzenberg its simply "not possible" to command the kind of consensus mr valenti once presided over warren e avis made it easier for fliers to rent cars at airports warren avis was often in a hurry first in he founded the rent a car company that bears his name to bring autos directly to airline passengers a perfectly timed idea that soon replaced the old practice of catching a ride to the nearest city for a rental avis rent a car system mushroomed with franchises in cities by and cities by but by then mr avis was impatient with day to day operations so he sold his interest for an estimated &# million a great return on his original &# investment albeit well short of the payday he would have enjoyed had he held it longer "what is the purpose of getting up in the morning unless theres excitement " he told the new york times in at the time of that interview mr avis who died april in ann arbor mich at age was contemplating making an ultimately unsuccessful &# million offer to buy back the car rental company the latest proposal in five decades as a peripatetic entrepreneur whose interests ranged from a bakery car parts self help seminars global flower delivery and real estate for years until his marriage to his second wife yanna elbim a former french television actress who survives him he burnished a well publicized reputation as an international jet setter linked romantically with models and actresses he owned a giant cliff top resort home in acapulco where he could he boasted entertain at the drop of a hat "hugh hefner would come down with a planeload of bunnies but he would buttonhole somebody and talk business with them in the corner " says patricia kalmbach president of avis enterprises inc mr aviss holding company "his passion was business " after world war ii air travel took off but procuring a rental car was a hassle mr avis who had purchased an interest in a detroit ford dealership started with rental car offices at willow run airport in ypsilanti near detroit and miami international airport he found investors many of them other ford dealers for other franchises he worked directly with american airlines and other carriers so that fliers could purchase plane tickets and rent a car at the same counter car reservations would be sent to the destination via the airline teletype system he introduced a charge card for payment and was among the first to offer new cars mostly fords to start with the industry previously relied on used cars due to a postwar shortage of new models "the traveler could bundle the whole thing together " says jeffrey k leestma president of the automotive hall of fame in dearborn mich "it was quickly copied because it was such a natural idea " hertz global holdings inc founded as hertz driv ur self system in chicago in with a dozen ford model ts claims to have established the first airport rental operation at chicago municipal airport now chicago midway airport in aviss "we try harder" ad campaign as no to hertz was hatched in the early s that was long after mr avis sold his company to boston businessman richard s robie the first of a succession of owners over the next six decades it is now part of avis budget group inc meanwhile mr avis moved on with hits and misses in he founded avis industrial corp whose companies manufactured products for autos and boats it was the th best earnings per share stock performer for the first half of the s according to standard &amp poors corp he resigned in after losses mounted his next venture an encounter group sensitivity training regimen that he hoped would improve corporate management and encourage greater cooperation in society "after those frenzied years in business i had lost touch with my inner self " he told the chicago tribune in "i bought real estate manufacturing companies etcetera but still had no justification for my existence i wanted to do something altruistic " his american behavioral science training laboratories attracted socialites including friends cary grant and sammy davis jr policemen and even nuns to discuss their anxieties in workshops in acapulco and his farm near ann arbor mich he wrote a book titled "shared participation " but the venture came to little "i found out that caesar hitler alexander tried to make changes in the world and its a long difficult procedure " he told the new york times in "you almost have to totally dedicate your life to do it i dont want to dedicate my life to anything i want to taste everything i want the vacations i want the play " he returned to his maverick business style getting in early on the condominium conversion trend of the late s in detroit washington new york city and elsewhere in he won a legal battle with avis rent a car system inc for the right to use his name on an international flower delivery service that he soon abandoned eventually he moved his offices into a large barn on his farm where he practiced horse jumping and swam religiously even breaking the ice
