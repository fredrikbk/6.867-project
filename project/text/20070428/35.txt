the problem tax assessments didnt keep pace with soaring property values in recent years now assessments are catching up at the worst possible time just as property prices soften in theory municipalities are supposed to roll back tax rates to offset rising property assessments but many dont do it regularly or do so to a lesser degree than they should says kenneth wilkinson the appraiser for lee county "in todays market id be lucky to get within &# or &# of my assessed value " says jack shearer a real estate broker in fort wayne ind who a month ago began the process of appealing a recent reassessment that valued his home at &# mr shearer says he brokered the &# sale of a house in his neighborhood four months ago yet the assessed value on that house recently came in at close to

to fort wayne has seen a surge of appeals in recent years sparked by a statewide move in indiana as with other parts of the country to assess properties based on current market value instead of cost that is leading to "sticker shock " says stacey oday allen countys assessor the system "is capturing in one swoop the increase in market value that happened over five years " it is happening despite

most people "can do this on your own its time consuming when you have a hectic schedule " indeed tax experts generally say there is little reason to hire help when appealing an assessment particularly given that the fee can wipe out much of any first year savings a surprising number of homeowners dont realize they can fight the assessment "its the best kept secret " says marc vorchheimer a

home and spent a few hours taking photos and finding a topographical map of his property to prove to local officials last year that the assessment of his property failed to account for major drawbacks true he told local officials his house does sit on the water which pushes up his assessed value "but the assessment didnt account for the fact that the property is on a busy road that part of it has a severe slope and that while the neighborhood is zoned single family it is actually a multifamily area " says mr obrien a real estate broker at sothebys international realty "those are recognized minuses that have to be taken into account " the local tax review board agreed and reduced mr obriens assessed value by about he calculates his property tax savings at between &# and &# a year facts
