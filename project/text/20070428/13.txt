business insight a special report dog eat dog be warned industries that buy a lot of technology are becoming as cutthroat as those that produce technology high technology industries are tough places to do business competition is constant fierce and characterized by only temporary advantage fueled by the ease with which software makers and other high tech companies can copy and distribute new products and services instantaneous delivery through the internet to hundreds of millions of consumers means a company with a slightly better online marketplace or search engine for example can quickly dominate the market and just as easily be dethroned by a rival with a new approach if this brutal competitive cycle first described as "creative destruction" by austrian economist joseph schumpeter in makes you uncomfortable weve got some bad news weve been studying competition in all u s industries not just the high tech ones and weve observed a remarkable pattern on average the whole u s economy has become more "schumpeterian" since the mid s whats more these changes have been greatest in the industries that buy the most software and computer hardware over the past dozen years in other words information technology consumption is associated with the kinds of competitive dynamics were accustomed to seeing in the it producing industries and because every industry will become even more it intensive over the next decade we expect competition to become even more schumpeterian what we have observed in industry after industry is the emergence of widespread process innovation and replication that is analogous to the product innovation and replication that takes place in high tech just as google inc can take an improved search algorithm and make it immediately available via the web or apple inc can quickly distribute an updated version of itunes companies in other industries can invent a new way of doing business embed it in internal software and deploy it as widely as necessary across locations divisions and departments to gain an advantage cvs corp chief executive officer tom ryan in wanted to improve customer satisfaction in the companys pharmacies so he directed a cross functional team to devise a better way of filling drug prescriptions the team decided to change the order of two steps and shift the initial data entry step so that it took place at drop off when the customer was still present cvs then embedded the change in the software it uses to guide its prescription filling process and rolled it out to its then pharmacies in less than a year the technology not only ensured consistency and compliance with the new process but it also allowed for a much more rapid deployment than if the woonsocket r i company had tried to implement the change solely via memos training manuals and directives from headquarters the change led to significant improvements in customer service and satisfaction positive effects on patient safety and decreased costs says the company now known as cvs caremark corp within a year of the change customer satisfaction as measured in a monthly survey of cvs pharmacy customers increased the cvs experience is a microcosm of a pervasive trend toward using it to replicate not only digital goods and services but also business processes this trend encompasses core activities such as customer service and order management as well as support activities such as accounting and human resources once a company embeds its processes in it the processes are executed the same way not only across locations but also over time this means for example that a company can ensure that no large customer order will be accepted until a specific credit check is performed while creating an innovative business process is less visible than developing a new product or investing in factories our research shows it is actually more important to a companys success intangible process capital is changing the way companies operate and the capabilities they possess as a result it also is changing the way they compete the seeds of this process revolution were planted in the s when the computing power of u s companies rose more than tenfold and two technologies gave them the potential to rapidly deploy changes in the way they perform tasks first the widespread adoption of internet based technologies made it enabled tasks accessible from any desktop inside or outside an organization second and perhaps more important the advent of enterprise software applications sold by companies such as sap ag and oracle corp allowed companies to electronically unite diverse departments such as manufacturing and accounting very few processes within an organization are self contained most involve multiple groups with enterprise software companies could electronically copy and enforce new business procedures across hundreds of sites thousands of employees and millions of transactions all without the same level of inertia errors or delays that typically accompanied such efforts in the era of fragmented computer systems working with our colleagues feng zhu a doctoral student in harvard universitys it and management program and michael sorell a research analyst at harvard business schools baker library we developed a formal theory about what competition would look like in a world where technology allows for rapid copying and deployment of process innovations first companies with superior ways of doing business would be able to rapidly leverage that advantage over competitors leaving a smaller number of firms holding a higher proportion of both sales and market value within industries second just because the wins would be bigger doesnt mean the same companies would always win there would be more turbulence in sales and market value rankings within industries because competitors with new ideas could scale up rapidly and overtake the leaders armed with these testable predictions we set out to examine whether examples like cvss were idiosyncratic or the vanguard of an economywide transformation we divided the u s private sector into industries and determined the it intensity of each one essentially by calculating how much companies within each industry spend on computer hardware and software as a percentage of total spending on fixed assets industries that consume a lot of information technology included those in both the services and manufacturing sectors publishers and insurers as well as makers of autos and machinery for example as a group high it industries increased their technology investments sharply starting in the mid s pulling away from medium it and low it industries such as farming real estate rail transportation and utilities the data clearly showed that high it industries experienced different competitive dynamics than the low it and medium it industries after the mid s and that the differences werent small concentration or the extent to which market share was held by a few dominant companies increased after in all types of industries but the increases were greatest in industries that used it most extensively as a group high it industries from to experienced an average percentage point increase in total market share held by the largest companies averaged across industry category turbulence also increased substantially in the high it industries after the mid s and the same patterns werent observed in the industries that were less reliant on information technology these patterns applied very broadly they werent caused by the abnormal performance of one or two companies or one to two industries and they also werent driven by other types of investment such as spending on plants and equipment globalization and mergers and acquisitions werent responsible for the concentration increases of the late s according to previous research cementing our belief in the connection between it and observed changes in concentration and turbulence the link between it and competition surprises many researchers and executives for two reasons first most companies buy technology to gain control over their environments not lose it enterprise systems help companies create consistency and reduce randomness so its ironic that a high level of such investment would be associated with a more frenzied competitive environment second some observers have argued that information technology is so pervasive that it no longer offers companies any big advantage if many businesses in the same industry bought the same type of large scale commercial enterprise software there is reason to believe they would subsequently become more similar and the competitive field would level instead something close to the opposite has taken place the reason even with it both innovation and replication require a combination of leadership and insight from executives take innovation many companies use it to capture huge amounts of data from their operations but relatively few have been able to use this data creatively harrahs entertainment inc the las vegas based casino giant is an exception harrahs uses its it enabled data gathering and analysis capabilities to conduct constant experiments for example the company mails slightly different promotions to two groups of similar customers and then monitors their behavior to see which promotion is more effective over time the company has gained a detailed understanding of which customers are profitable and how to maximize their loyalty and involvement for executives the key lesson is to treat information technology efforts as opportunities to define and deploy new ways of working rather than just projects to install configure or integrate systems our work suggests three broad areas of focus for top managers first they need to look at how the company should be doing business differently that means deciding what new tasks should be enabled with technology and how widely they should be deployed second managers need to lead the deployment of new procedures to success people dont like changes to their jobs dictated from outside and embedded in software overcoming this inertia and resistance requires skillful leadership third managers need to foster innovation by encouraging experimentation collaboration dialogue and all of the other activities that generate good ideas that means building a technology infrastructure and an accompanying set of practices that reduce the cost of creating and replicating process innovations managers might not want competition in their industry to become more schumpeterian but they dont have a choice companies are using it to increase the speed of process innovation and replication these companies drive the competitive dynamics of their industries rather than reacting to them leaving their rivals with a stark choice adopt the schumpeterian ethos of creative destruction or watch from the sidelines as others
