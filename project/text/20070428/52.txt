pursuits books writers block wit pain and dystopian fantasies rant by chuck palahniuk doubleday pages &# chuck palahniuks demon imagination equal parts stephen king and jonathan swift is so outrageously entertaining that the word "palahniukian" would have entered the language by now if anyone could pronounce it his first published novel "fight club " remains his best known work thanks to the brad pitt film version its hard to imagine "rant " his eighth novel at the local multiplex anytime soon mr palahniuks punk parables mingle nuggets of science and history with urban legends and then douse the whole thing in ink black humor reminiscent of kurt vonneguts one of mr palahniuks characters in the novel "lullaby" says that ocean explorers used to leave a pair of breeding sheep or goats on every island to "seed" it with a future meat source he then asks "you ever wonder when gods coming back with a lot of barbecue sauce " mr palahniuks gleeful anarchism attracts goths skateboarders and others who fancy themselves desperadoes of the fringe but its his own life story that seems to promote him to prophet of violence a former mechanic who grew up in a trailer in washington state mr palahniuk pronounced "pawla nik" is by all accounts a polite and unassuming fellow but he wields the biceps of a professional wrestler if every other writer on the best seller list simultaneously gang rushed him bring it on updike he would leave them all whimpering in the dust he is also the son and grandson of murder his paternal grandfather shot and killed his grandmother before killing himself and his father was slain by the ex husband of a woman he was seeing to the keep it real generation mr palahniuk makes eminem look like a spoiled preppy "rant" is a mock oral biography in which a revolving series of less than reliable narrators recollect the life of buster "rant" casey a small town boy with a taste for danger pranks and possibly murder as an adult rant spreads a plague of rabies among humans while becoming the leader of a cult called the party crashers the members of this odd group appear only at night at which time they put on costumes brides soccer moms meant to underline the dreariness of american middle class aspirations and crash into one anothers cars for sport the riffs in "rant " as in other palahniuk novels are more interesting than the melody which as usual is an attack on the shallowness of convention and consumerism a radio station graphic traffic tries to minimize rubbernecking delays by telling drivers the gruesome details of roadside wrecks a woman puts thumbtacks in her fudge so that people will chew carefully and be grateful for every bite that doesnt hurt and rabies breaks out among teens whose symptoms are brooding and antisocial behavior so nobody notices rant the character who causes hyperinflation in his hometown by appointing himself tooth fairy and distributing rare gold coins to kids is a typically palahniukian figure a misunderstood messiah and oracle of dystopia one of his proverbs is "lifes greatest comfort is being able to look over your shoulder and see people worse off waiting in line behind you " mr palahniuk possesses a wit that can whip up a sinister conspiracy out of the most harmless lies one character memorably explains how santa the easter bunny and the tooth fairy are three steps in a misinformation campaign meant to corrupt youthful imagination "beginning with all the possibility of childhood and ending with an absolute trust in the national currency " but "rant" has two problems that are hard to ignore one is the reader unfriendliness of the oral bio format the stuttering rhythm produced by the change in point of view every paragraph or two creates a surprisingly putdownable book there isnt a plot per se but rather a gradual revelation of the characters powers and motives such as why they seem to want rabies and dont seem bothered by the prospect of even fatal car crashes the other problem is that mr palahniuks imagination no longer appears as boundless as it once did previous novels such as "survivor" and "choke " roared along with bizarre mysteries ingenious scams and sparkling one liners like "you could call me a gentlemans gentleman but youd be wrong on both counts" and "shes so thin she must be either dying or rich " now mr palahniuk is repeating himself and possibly others "rant" contains elements familiar from the sci fi movie "strange days " in which people downloaded each others most intense experiences using brain scanning devices the book also calls to mind two other films both called "crash" david cronenbergs adaptation of the j g ballard novel about car crashing as an erotic delight and paul haggiss oscar winner about social bonds forming from automotive mishaps the all powerful hero the gibes about the depravity of celebrity worship and the idealization of actual pain over the phoniness of mass market culture "this is how church should feel " rant says as he and a friend watch themselves bleed from a rabbit bite have all turned up repeatedly in mr palahniuks work professional subversive is not a career that promises longevity and mr palahniuks elbow may be growing sore from heaving so many molotov cocktails in addition to offering allegorical reflections on the spread of aids and the rendition of suspected terrorists the book might also be read as a coded plea to understand the authors plight rant is always thrusting his arm into gopher holes in an effort to be bitten by a viper or scorpion but he can never match the buzz of his most extreme experience his first black widow attack "reaching blind into the dark underground hoping for the worst" is something that mr palahniuk also enjoys but his readers like his hero have become inoculated to its effects mr palahniuk may justly fear the same fate as the gruesome s rocker marilyn manson who as a mock headline in the onion once put it is "now going door to door trying to shock people " mr smith is a novelist and a movie critic for the new york post
