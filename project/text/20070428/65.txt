jazz ornette colemans "sound grammar " thats a first wynton marsalis won a pulitzer in but that was for "blood on the fields " a three hour long composition for three jazz singers and a big band "sound grammar " by contrast consists of eight unrelated tunes by mr coleman recorded live by his quartet at a concert should "sound grammar" have won was it even eligible the pulitzer is supposed to go to a "distinguished musical composition by an american in any of the larger forms including chamber orchestral choral opera song dance or other forms of musical theatre " whatever its other virtues "sound grammar" is clearly not a large scale composition nor does it break any new stylistic ground for the celebrated and influential avant garde saxophonist mr coleman has been making records since any number of which were far more memorable than this one so whats going on here lets start with a little history the pulitzer board embarrassed itself in when it overruled that years jury which voted to give duke ellington a special award for lifetime achievement it would have been the first time a pulitzer went to a jazz musician ellington clearly qualified for the honor but the board thought otherwise the duke as usual had the last word "fate is being kind to me " he said "fate doesnt want me to be famous too young " what made the decision especially galling was that the pulitzer prize had and has a bad reputation among music professionals prior to pulitzer juries consisted of four composers and a critic classical composers are famously cliquish so the prizes were usually given out to members in good standing of classical musics old boy network often to pieces that soon vanished without a trace ever heard of quincy porters two piano concerto some were worthy others less so but the award itself came to be seen as increasingly irrelevant more recently the pulitzer board approved the granting of special posthumous awards to scott joplin george gershwin and yes ellington mr marsaliss award was rightly seen as a deliberate attempt to widen the scope of the main prize by giving it to a jazz composer for the first time but most jazz is improvised not notated meaning that few of the greatest jazz musicians would have qualified for a pulitzer so the board changed the rules making recorded music eligible and increasing the number of noncomposers on the five person jury from one to three the result mr coleman won this years prize and the jury also gave a special award to john coltrane thelonious monk received a similar honor in i believe devoutly in the beauty and significance of jazz and i love mr colemans bold innovative music but by giving the pulitzer prize to a good but not great album that doesnt even pretend to meet its eligibility requirements the board has debased the value of the music prize still further as for the special award why single out coltrane now great as he was why not charlie parker or louis armstrong for that matter its hard not to wonder whether the board is trying to atone for past blunders by playing an arbitrary game of catch up i also wonder how many judges likely to be tapped for future pulitzer juries will be equally competent to weigh the relative merits of jazz and pop albums and written out classical compositions in a perfect world all musicians would be as familiar with duke ellington as they were with aaron copland and some of them are in practice though its comparatively uncommon for classical musicians to have extensive knowledge of jazz or vice versa yehudi wyner the classical composer and pulitzer laureate who chaired this years jury acknowledged this fact by recommending to the pulitzer board that separate prizes be given to classical and nonclassical music which strikes me as a realistic response to an otherwise insoluble problem needless to say the fact that classical music was shut out of this years pulitzers has not gone unnoticed nor should it the pulitzer prize for music after all is the only award for musical composition that receives any kind of mass media attention in this country because it is reported in most american newspapers it gives a boost to the careers of the classical composers who receive it most of whom labor in semiobscurity on the other hand it will make no difference to mr coleman who long ago wrote himself into the history of american music and needs no prize to retrospectively certify his importance thats why i have mixed feelings about mr colemans pulitzer should the jury have stretched the rules well past the breaking point in order to give it to him i wish i could say yes he deserves it and so does jazz yet i cant help but recall the footrace in "alices adventures in wonderland" that was judged by a dodo "there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes " thats no way to win an award even one that you richly deserve mr teachout the
