business insight a special report battling boycotts when a company is targeted simply because of its nationality what can it do what should a company do when its business is boycotted through no fault of its own what can a business do to avoid a boycott that has nothing to do with its products services or actions these are questions of increasing urgency a growing class of boycotts has very little to do with the actions or policies of an individual company instead they are related to the companys country of origin in such cases a company like mcdonalds corp may see its restaurants targeted not because it did anything to anger consumers but because it is a u s company or american consumers may decide to boycott french wine not because they have any complaints against french wine producers but to punish france in general for the french governments unwillingness to support u s military action in iraq in the case of actions targeted at a company a business generally has the options of ignoring them fighting back or complying with the demands of the boycotters but when the reason for a boycott is the companys nationality it would seem that nothing could be done after all it is neither easy nor desirable to change the nationality of a company to shield it from a boycott attempt so what is a firm to do this article presents a framework we have developed that offers some suggestions to companies to help them deal with such boycotts the framework is based on two dimensions the visibility of the brand and the intensity of the boycott lets first consider brand visibility which we define as the extent to which a brand is associated with a country in the minds of its customers around the world the more visible the brand the more likely it is to be targeted by boycotters visibility is very much in the eyes of the beholder for instance there may be cases when a brand is very popular but customers in a given country dont strongly associate it with the country of its origin the opposite can also happen when a product is associated with a country in the public mind but in fact the company is from a different country these perceptions of national origin may also vary from one country to another that is a product that is viewed as very american in one country may not be associated with the u s in another country when north atlantic treaty organization warplanes bombed the chinese embassy in belgrade in the alliance insisted it had hit the wrong target but many people in china were outraged nonetheless in a couple of cities rioters attacked kfc outlets but pizza hut outlets owned by the same u s parent company escaped unscathed both brands are owned by yum brands inc then known as tricon global restaurants inc so kfc had high visibility as an american brand but pizza hut had low brand visibility in this sense similar examples abound in the u s as anti french sentiment grew in the u s around the start of the iraq war some french restaurants and businesses in the u s experienced declining sales but in many cases americans may have boycotted brands owned by companies in the u s and elsewhere because of the misperception that they were french owned for instance a poll conducted in april by fleishman hillard international communications and wirthlin worldwide now part of harris interactive inc found that the american owned brands grey poupon and yoplait seemed french to many of the respondents similarly frenchs mustard appeared to many respondents as french but is actually british the second dimension of our framework is boycott intensity intensity can be measured in terms of size duration and aggressiveness size refers to how many people are boycotting the brand or product duration refers to how long the boycott is likely to continue and aggressiveness takes into account whether in addition to boycotting products violent acts are conducted against the outlets or offices of the company being boycotted it is often difficult to determine where a company stands in regard to brand visibility and boycott intensity but it is an important judgment to make because it is the foundation of an effective strategy for avoiding or coping with a boycott when a high visibility brand faces a high intensity boycott we suggest a blend in strategy this approach essentially emphasizes the local character of the company and plays down its global identity there are a variety of means available to a company to create a local face among these are public relations and advertising campaigns sponsorship of sporting events and teams and charitable activities ideally such a strategy is adopted proactively rather than reactively trying to change perceptions after a boycott is announced is more difficult than a more long term proactive effort to bring the publics attention to a businesss good citizenship mcdonalds is a high visibility u s brand that has faced boycotts in different parts of the world a big part of mcdonalds appeal is the image the brand projects of the american way of life but the companys franchisees have consciously tried to present a local face in different parts of the world as the following examples illustrate driven by anger over u s support for israel an anti u s boycott was initiated in egypt in recent years that has spread to other arab countries mcdonalds has been a prominent target of the boycott highlighting the importance of efforts by local mcdonalds management to connect with their communities both before and after the boycott started those efforts have included tailoring menus to local tastes including the introduction by mcdonalds egypt of the mcfalafel sandwich which was launched with the help of an ad jingle by a famous egyptian singer sha aban abdul raheem best known for his nationalistic songs mcdonalds franchisees in the middle east and elsewhere also have long made contributions to local charities including promotions in saudi arabia and jordan in recent years in which a portion of sales for a given period were donated to charity in indonesia the worlds most populous muslim country mcdonalds indonesia launched tv ads in showing some of the local franchise owners and staff standing outside their restaurants wearing traditional islamic clothing in many outlets a picture of the restaurants local owner was posted in the lobby efforts by mcdonalds franchisees to present a local face havent been confined to islamic countries in argentina when antiwar demonstrators blocked the entrances of a number of mcdonalds outlets during protests in against the iraq war mcdonalds argentina launched an ad campaign showing a big mac with the words "made in argentina" stamped in bold black letters the ad also mentioned the thousands of argentineans employed by suppliers of mcdonalds argentina restaurants and in the philippines where mcdonalds also has drawn the attention of some protesters against the war in iraq mcdonalds philippines has been active for more than years in charitable programs including the funding and construction of day care centers and the creation of a literacy program for young students of course as a franchiser mcdonalds has the advantage of having local owners but any company with local employees can point to that connection with the community and any company can emulate some of the other steps mcdonalds has taken getting the word out blend in strategies also can be used by companies that need to respond quickly to the rumors that often spread during boycotts or can even trigger boycotts before the rumors become accepted as reality in the public mind procter &amp gamble co was taken by surprise by a boycott of its laundry soap ariel in the arab world in not because it is an american product but because of alleged israeli connections protesters targeted ariel because of perceptions that it was somehow related to israels prime minister at the time ariel sharon and that its logo resembled the six pointed star of the israeli flag in response p&amp g ran tv ads emphasizing the detergents long history in egypt and the companys employment of egyptian labor it also eventually changed ariels logo p&amp g was essentially saying "were one of you " a variation on that theme is a strategy of blending in by saying "were not one of them " this type of response is needed in cases where customers mistakenly perceive a brand or a company to be associated with a certain country for companies that find themselves caught in the cross fire this way the only strategy is a campaign of consumer education for example because of the anti u s sentiment in the arab region and elsewhere in recent years many foreign brands and retail stores became targets of protests and boycotts because they were thought to be american when in fact they were not many businesses with foreign names felt compelled to publish statements in local newspapers clarifying their identity and explaining that their brands have no relation to the u s similarly amid the furor over the caricatures of the prophet muhammad published in a danish newspaper in nido milk powder was one of many products targeted by boycotters so its maker switzerlands nestle sa ran a newspaper ad in saudi arabia to alert readers that the powder wasnt made in denmark in the case of a high visibility brand facing a low intensity boycott perhaps just rumblings about a companys home country or about a brand on the internet or in the press we suggest a strategy of monitoring and blending in the key here is not to be lulled into a false sense of security a low intensity boycott may not always remain that way any hint of disaffection carries the risk of becoming a full blown boycott especially because modern means of communication such as email and text messaging can accelerate the snowballing effect of even low intensity boycotts careful monitoring of the environment will enable a company to detect potential causes of a boycott assess the probabilities and take measures even before a boycott is announced when a brand has low visibility there is little that needs to be done indeed in a high intensity boycott environment a company with low visibility may be better off adopting a strategy of lowering its profile rather than actively trying to offset any potential damage by touting its local connections this essentially means desisting from doing anything that may increase visibility but some companies may be able to go a step further and attempt to actually decrease their visibility for example a saudi furniture store in khobar that sells american furniture has tried lowering its visibility by changing its name from the saudi american furniture store to the saudi furniture store the fact remains that the furniture the store sells is still american but in this particular example the strategy of lowering its visibility is viable because furniture isnt often distinctly associated with countries in the public mind at least in the middle east the success of such a strategy depends on characteristics of the market and the product a low visibility company in a low intensity boycott environment can simply maintain the status quo but even in this situation the company must remain sensitive to changes in local sentiment that might alter its visibility or increase the threat of an aggressive boycott the potential cost is too great to be ignored mr alshebil is a ph d candidate in marketing at the university of texas at arlington he will be joining king fahd university of
