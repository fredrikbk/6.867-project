pursuits books wilsons less than ideal record on freedom savage peace by ann hagedorn simon &amp schuster pages &# in december woodrow wilson boarded the uss washington in new york harbor and set out across the atlantic to represent the u s at the paris peace conference it was a bold move no american president had ever traveled outside the u s while in office the voyage would last days if an emergency arose it would take the president nearly two weeks to return from versailles to the white house the day before wilson a democrat departed a resolution was introduced by a senate republican declaring wilson "out of office " stripping him of his power while on foreign soil that resolution didnt pass but wilson might have been better off staying home as he obsessively battled during the paris conference to remake the world with his league of nations his america was falling apart "savage peace" is a portrait of america in a contentious and violent year that began with world war i victory parades but quickly devolved into labor strikes race riots domestic terrorism and government tyranny ann hagedorn seems sympathetic to president wilson and his lofty ideals of world peace but if there is a central theme to this story it is the hypocrisy of wilsons crusade while he pushed for global democracy his administration led a domestic campaign against basic freedoms wilsons record as one of the worst violators of civil liberties ever to occupy the white house was already firmly established by his administration had used the sedition and espionage acts to prosecute critics of the war even eugene debs a four time presidential candidate had been thrown into prison handed a year sentence for giving a speech criticizing the draft the threat of german subversion was the rationale for prosecuting free speech during the war after it was the red menace in march the supreme court handed down three unanimous decisions all written by chief justice oliver wendell holmes upholding the constitutionality of wartime restrictions on free speech including the jailing of debs when a mitchell palmer wilsons attorney general launched even more aggressive peacetime campaigns against suspected bolsheviks and other radicals he had little to fear from the court palmers campaign was in part personal in june a terrorist planted a bomb in front of his georgetown home the explosion killed the terrorist and narrowly missed palmer similar bombs went off on the same night in seven other cities the attacks were probably the work of a small group of italian anarchists but officials portrayed them as a bolshevist plot to overthrow the government palmer claimed to have a list of dangerous radicals whom he set out to jail or deport in a series of raids without warrants at the same time a year old lawyer named j edgar hoover was named the head of the justice departments new general intelligence division and began keeping files on possible subversives justice holmes confided in a letter to a friend that he hated writing the decisions that seemed to give the courts blessing to such ruthlessness he added "the federal judges seem to me again between ourselves to have got hysterical about the war i should think the president when he gets through with his present amusements might do some pardoning " but wilson pardoned none of the political dissidents not even debs who sat in prison for an additional years until he was released by warren harding wilson was much more concerned with the treaty of versailles he made a second trip across the atlantic during the summer of to sign it claiming that it did more than make peace with germany "it liberates great peoples who have never before been able to find the way to liberty " he declared back at home however wilson seemed to have little interest in the liberty of blacks struggling for equal rights when wilson unveiled the fourteen points to be included in the peace treaty black activists argued for inclusion of a th point an end to racial discrimination wilson did not respond when a delegation of leading black intellectuals attempted to go to france for the peace talks wilsons state department denied them passports this was a year marked by racial violence in omaha neb a mob set out to lynch william brown a black man accused of raping a white woman when the white mayor stood between the mob and its target they tried to lynch the mayor first as the mayor was being strung up on a trolley poll the police arrived cut the rope and narrowly saved his life but not the life of the black man accused of rape "the omaha mob shot the prisoner william brown hundreds of times set his body partially on fire dragged him for hours through town at the end of a rope and then dangled his charred torso from a trolley pole at a busy downtown corner " ms hagedorn writes as chilling as that description is a photograph from the event included in "savage peace " is even more so it shows several dozen whites some impeccably dressed smiling as they pose in front of browns mangled smoldering body there were more than lynchings in the u s in who was to blame one naacp leader said that wilson was "the main culprit for never taking a strong position against lynching and never urging congress for the sake of humanity to put an end to such brutality " this is a recurring theme wilson the idealistic champion of democracy around the world ignored civil rights at home most of "savage peace" concerns the epic political struggles of but ms hagedorn describes other key moments such as the black sox scandal in which the corrupt players of the chicago white sox intentionally lost the world series unfortunately she spends as much time on the debate over whether to extend daylight savings time a wartime measure as she does on the influenza pandemic which killed more people than world war i ms hagedorn resists the temptation to draw parallels between wilsons tactics against germans and bolsheviks and the tactics of the current administration against terrorists and a good thing too whatever ones judgment of the patriot act its provisions do not come close to resembling wilsons draconian crackdown on political dissidents these days we dont toss americans in jail for years at a time for exercising free speech there is a cautionary tale here though wilsons savaging of civil liberties came at a time of real public fear of terrorism and subversion the public supported his policy so did congress so did the supreme court and they were wrong mr karl is senior national
