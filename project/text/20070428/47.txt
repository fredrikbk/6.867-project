investor mania want to be next warren buffett the line forms in nebraska omaha neb last month warren buffett posted the mother of all help wanted ads a request for candidates to replace him as chief investment officer of berkshire hathaway inc now the resumes are flooding in and the process is turning out to be every bit as unconventional as the billionaire investor himself among the or so applicants so far a talmudic scholar who picks stocks from home a canadian economist with an intense yoga practice and even a four year old "were going to run this like american idol in the end " the year old mr buffett quipped in an interview in his modest office neatly decorated with baseball paraphernalia and photos of old friends on a recent sunday he went in after lunch to read annual reports and open mail some of which is destined for a small box on his desk labelled "too hard " for all mr buffetts whimsy its an important quest both for his company which has a market value of about &# billion and for his legions of fans for decades mr buffetts financial decisions have been the subject of conjecture scrutiny and imitation so even though mr buffett says he is in "excellent health" and has no plans to retire soon the naming of a cio successor signals for many the end of an era and a step into uncharted territory it wont be easy to fill mr buffetts size shoes thanks largely to his legendary stock picking the "oracle of omaha" is now the worlds second richest man topped only by microsoft corp s bill gates an investor who bought &# of berkshire hathaway class a stock in after mr buffett took control would be worth more than &# million today it takes "a peculiar temperament" to be an investor who consistently seeks opportunities away from the crowd says charlie munger berkshires year old vice chairman mr buffett says mr munger whom he has known for more than four decades would be the "ideal person" for the job if he were just years younger in his march annual letter to berkshire shareholders mr buffett laid out the virtues that he is seeking such as "independent thinking emotional stability and a keen understanding of both human and institutional behavior " since mr buffett has played the dual roles of cio and chief executive of berkshire his holding company currently mr buffett manages the bulk of berkshires roughly &# billion portfolio of stocks bonds and derivatives which includes big stakes in blue chips such as coca cola co and american express co berkshire also owns a stable of companies outright including international dairy queen inc auto insurer geico utility midamerican energy holdings co and reinsurer general re the new cio will focus on securities investments and leave the bigger picture decisions to mr buffetts successor as ceo in march of mr buffett announced that the board had identified three candidates for that higher profile job those people who werent publicly named were chosen from among the dozens of managers overseeing berkshires subsidiaries the search for successors appears to reflect a larger effort by an aging patriarch to get his house in order in june mr buffett pledged of his berkshire stake or about &# billion at the companys current stock price to the bill &amp melinda gates foundation and four smaller charities he said he would also leave the rest of his money to charity last august he remarried on his birthday his emotions are sometimes near the surface in his office mr buffett wiped away tears from behind his glasses while watching a video of investment manager william ruane speaking in about his efforts to clean up parts of new yorks harlem neighborhood mr ruane a classmate of mr buffetts at columbia university rang up impressive gains at the sequoia fund for nearly years "now wouldnt you trust this man to manage your money " he asked while gesturing to the image of his old friend who died in at age "im looking for another bill ruane " he says berkshires new candidate wont be among mr buffetts longtime associates he will have little to judge them on but their words personal and private investment records and his gut reaction to them mr buffett says he is confident that he will find one and maybe two successful candidates famous for buying companies after brief meetings with owners mr buffett prides himself on being able to read strangers quickly pointing to three crates of laminated folders scrawled notes and colored envelopes bearing the hopes of hundreds of aspirants he says "theres one in there " with mr mungers help mr buffett will whittle down the current contenders to about "real possibilities " he says adding that hell start reading the letters in earnest after berkshires annual shareholders meeting next weekend from those he will ask for personal investment records going back at least years then after determining whether "the general attitude toward purchase and sale of securities is compatible" with berkshire he will fill the job with either one or two people he plans to hand them up to &# billion to manage until it is time for them to take over the entire portfolio mr buffett explains that the purpose of the trial run is "to see if their decision making apparatus works out hopefully while im still alive " what it isnt however is a mentorship program something many applicants have misinterpreted he says he isnt looking for someone to teach but "for someone who already knows how to do it " the misunderstanding is reflected in dozens of letters from students professional investors and a surprising number of engineers and lawyers hoping to be apprenticed to the master "i assure you " wrote one year old college student "although i may be short on experience i am very long on potential " a lawyer in oregon recommended his four year old son characterizing the toddler as a "great negotiator" on issues such as "bedtime chores allowance baths etc " professional headhunters are skeptical about mr buffetts search some warn that his requirement of seeing candidates personal investment records could repel those who would rather be judged by their public track records "im sure hell come up against at least one person who says they arent comfortable doing that " says lawrence lieberman of orion group a new york firm that recruits managers for investment funds indeed notably absent from the application letters are some big name money managers who have publicly expressed their admiration for mr buffett theres no word from edward s lampert the year old chairman of sears holdings corp and head of connecticut based hedge fund esl investments inc mr lampert declined to comment nor does thomas gayner chief investment officer of markel corp a speciality insurer based in richmond va profess to be a candidate mr gayner manages markels &# billion stock portfolio with a bias toward long term concentrated holdings a style favored by mr buffett he hasnt applied but three of his supporters sent letters to mr buffett on his behalf "its very flattering and very kind but im trying to keep the job i have now " says mr gayner whose appointment this year to the board of washington post co where mr buffett has been a long time director gives him face time with the berkshire chairman mr buffett acknowledges that some people particularly some who know him personally are too shy or embarrassed to apply he says he might reach out to some of them eventually many others though did put up their hands the letters reviewed by the wall street journal show a cross section of mr buffetts devotees nearly all claim to have modest tastes and simple lives mirroring mr buffetts and like him they take pride in being unconventional even at the risk of seeming idiosyncratic take joseph weiss a year old manager of a &# million stock fund who works mainly out of a basement office in his square foot red brick home in the middle class brooklyn n y neighborhood of midwood "i give you a somewhat virgin mind although it has been quietly promiscuous " he wrote in his letter he was referring to his lack of a conventional college education something mr buffett says doesnt impress him and isnt a requirement for the cio job instead mr weiss holds two degrees in the study of the talmud ancient hebrew texts on the laws of moses sitting in his bright sparsely furnished house on a recent morning after sending his five children to school his wife works in newark n j the wiry youthful looking mr weiss explained that his talmudic education helps him "conceptualize and organize things " mr weiss recounted a few investment successes such as debeers the diamond company whose shares he bought in after figuring it was being valued in the stock market at far below the value of its diamond reserves in suburban bannockburn ill david steinberg was inspired to apply because of mr buffetts uncanny ability to make investment decisions based on his anticipation of changes in industries and the economy "i like his deep forward thinking wisdom " says mr steinberg who manages about &# million mainly for wealthy clients in his dls capital management fund "hes out in omaha figuring things out that people will figure out on wall street years later " unlike many applicants who only have experience in managing stocks the year old mr steinberg has occasionally ventured into other investments he bought "junk" bonds in and and invested in some troubled companies during their restructuring in ottawa economist klaus kostenbauer takes a more spiritual approach as manager of prosperous yogi investments he regularly practices a rigorous form of yoga called kundalini and meditates several hours a week "my yoga makes me a better investor " says mr kostenbauer "it helps with discipline mastery of your emotions and mastery of greed fear and patience " in his application letter he jokingly offered to consult with mr buffett in the afterlife through a ouija board before making any investment decisions mr buffetts call for an independent thinker spoke to mr kostenbauer he avoids buying stocks owned by berkshire unless he has done the research and understands them himself setting him apart from many so called buffetteers since when he started managing about &# of his own money as part of a local investing club he has increased his holdings to &# he says by applying the value investing principles of benjamin graham a columbia professor who became mr buffetts mentor starting out with a small portfolio generally isnt a deterrent to mr buffett when he met mr munger in "i felt he could manage the largest portfolio in the world " he says at the time mr munger was a young corporate lawyer who didnt manage any money practically none of the letters mention pay some offered to work for free "im already rich " wrote one year old applicant in new hampshire who enclosed a photo of himself "therefore a salary of &# a year would suit me just fine and &# a year would be excessive " mohnish pabrai a hedge fund manager in irvine calif who manages about &# million in assets says that working at berkshire would be a "call to duty " "for me money isnt the driver " says mr pabrai who has three times bid hundreds of thousands of dollars in an annual charity auction to have lunch with mr buffett he was outbid each time the india born mr pabrai has his own following among investors his third book "the dhandho investor " is currently on amazon coms bestseller list he applied to work for mr buffett in before he started his own fund offering to sweep floors and to forgo pay mr buffett declined the offer "if jesus asked me to do something there would be no discussion of compensation " mr pabrai says mr buffett doesnt plan on using slave labor and in fact the cio job has the potential of very high compensation he plans to pay the manager a certain percentage say of his or her outperformance of the s&amp p over a five year rolling average "theyll make a lot of money if theyre good but not as much as if they ran a &# billion hedge fund " mr buffett says
