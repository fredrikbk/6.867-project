business insight a special report the curse of success knowledge management projects often look good in the beginning but then problems arise in the effort to improve corporate performance by sharing key knowledge among employees across an organization a practice known as knowledge management glowing reports of success far outnumber tales of disappointment but this picture isnt quite as rosy as many people believe thats because there are many projects that initially are labeled a success and its only later that negative consequences appear some companies for instance have found their knowledge management projects result in an overreliance on a database for problem solving others have tried unsuccessfully to replicate the same knowledge management system across different departments others have discovered that the original team of contributors in a project ends up squeezing out any knowledge from outside the core group such troubles generally dont show up in the usual measurements of these knowledge management or km projects but they hold profound ramifications for organizations that are committed to the cause of km this article seeks to cast a spotlight on the curses of successful km projects three case studies are presented in which a km system attained a high level of success before exhibiting one or more dysfunctional outcomes a bank that designed a fully integrated database to assist agents at its customer service call center a telecommunications company that supplied engineers at its support centers with a "digital repository" of solutions for technical problems and a college that built an online forum to facilitate broad faculty participation in developing e learning programs the cases presented were drawn from a larger continuing study of km implementation dilemmas and from interviews with a wide spectrum of participants in the km projects including management and front line staff members annual reports web sites in house publications email and similar archival sources were consulted as well each organization requested anonymity as a condition for its cooperation with the research what follows is a look at how each initial success was achieved the trap each project then fell into and how others can avoid similar problems in the future the bank a consumer bank based in hong kong launched a pilot km system at its call center that markedly improved customer service the only mistake was attempting to replicate that system throughout the bank the pilot system for the bank which has more than domestic outlets and total assets of more than us&# billion was a web based database whose contents were created and maintained by the call centers roughly agents contents included such things as additional information about important customers helpful phone numbers and advice on bank procedures such as what to do if a caller reports a stolen credit card because the system was fully integrated with key applications of the bank if a caller reported a stolen credit card an agent could use just one computer screen while initiating the card cancellation and replacement procedures and consulting the km database the agent could quickly find for example directories of police stations and hospitals in the vicinity of the customer if necessary six months after its implementation a survey of call center agents found that gave the system a "very high" satisfaction rating turnaround times per phone call too were slashed to minutes from based on this success management decided to replicate the same type of km system for five other bank departments simultaneously marketing business intelligence human resource legal and procurements officials in charge of the project thought the replications would be very straightforward the system in use by the call center was a so called content management system that starts out as an empty shell the users supply the contents similar shells were envisioned for the other departments in which users would capture store index and retrieve a body of domain specific knowledge within their divisions no major obstacles were expected downfall the extension however turned out to be a disaster for starters integrating the km databases with the applications of the other departments was monstrously complex across all of the departments there were more than back end and legacy systems with which the km systems had to be integrated each integration was unique and demanded huge amount of resources and time exceeding budgets and schedules another problem tools found helpful at the call center were not nearly as useful elsewhere for example the km search engine was intended for full text and keyword searches like call center agents needed but the marketing and business intelligence departments for example wanted a different tool concept search which is the ability to make connections between patterns of words a search term such as "priority customers" might turn up results like priority services exclusive privileges and an internal directory of relationship managers adding to the chaos most of the other departments were never certain what they wanted out of their km systems and with a team from the it department driving the project there was a lack of individual responsibility for results the extended systems did not attract sustained usage in any organized fashion outside the call center the culture of sharing and exchanging ideas that existed among the call center agents and which kept the contents of the database fresh proved to be more an exception than the norm the poorly conceived replication effort not only failed to deliver the purported benefits of km it also misdirected resources and damped staff morale subsequent bankwide initiatives promoted as bringing about better organizational performance and operational efficiency were perceived with much skepticism the trap although one senior manager blamed the problems on the it team assigned to the implementation extensive research and interviews at the bank produced a more complex picture the trap here was one experienced by many organizations a tendency to rely on only one or a few proven approaches to deal with all of the challenges of the future flush with initial success some organizations unconsciously discount new experiences and become incapable of coping with the demands of new environments as they move forward the lesson managers must resist the temptation of using a cookie cutter approach after a successful pilot project the focus should be on not only how the pilot was implemented but also on what mistakes and lessons the earlier experience uncovered managers also must be able to distinguish where factors of success were unique to a pilot and where generic principles of success can be applied on a broader scale the telecom company when a european based provider of telecom equipment and mobile services devised a km system for its engineers at support centers around the world there was initial excitement and subsequent lethargy these support centers located in some countries help individual and business customers with a host of technical issues the engineers have strict deadlines for solving problems anywhere from three days for high priority clients to days for others every month the company computes the average time that each center takes to solve a problem and then posts the global average as a benchmark for all units in a bid to shorten turnaround times the company developed for its engineers a web based digital repository of technical solutions contributed by their fellow engineers inspired in part by eureka the knowledge sharing system developed for field service agents at xerox corp the stand alone system was designed to break down a problem into parts such as what the customer was trying to achieve facts about the clients technical platform and likely causes and fixes for numerous problems when a user entered a description of a problem the system searched its database for comparable problems resolved and produced a best matched solution incentives were created to encourage engineers to contribute their knowledge to the database part of an engineers annual salary increase was linked to the quantity and quality of his or her postings as benchmarked against the organization wide annual average quality for each posting was determined by parameters such as the significance of the problem and the number of times the solution had been endorsed by other users in the beginning the system attracted a stream of postings mostly from the highly experienced engineers then units began to compete as the prospect of earning more money drew regular contributions from more engineers turnaround times improved dramatically as word about the systems usefulness spread and usage rates increased after the first year the average time to solution for high priority problems was reduced to four hours from two days two years later solutions for about of problems encountered daily could be easily and quickly found among the entries in the system downfall other results were not so desirable chiefly engineers developed a dependency on the database fueled by its usefulness and by the constant pressure to maintain fast turnarounds when problems were received expediency drove most engineers to locate and apply solutions directly from the system without first giving the problem some thought moreover an analysis of the contribution pattern found that of the solutions were created by of the engineers as the system became more saturated with contributions the possibility of contributing unique solutions narrowed coupled with the fact that the pressure to turn problems around remained unabated most engineers chose the easy way out by simply relying on the system to solve problems thus what appeared to be a successful km initiative actually diminished problem solving abilities among the majority of the companys engineers management of the telecom company disputed that the engineers experienced any loss of skills citing data showing the reductions in turnaround time as evidence but in many interviews engineers said they didnt know what to do when faced with problems that had no solution in the database such problems went unsolved and were passed along to research and development for further study the trap the company offered rewards for both contributing and using solutions but it took a lot more time to devise a solution than to find one in the system thus even though the cash reward was greater for contributing solutions there was more incentive for most engineers in the form of job pressure to solve problems quickly thus they became more adept at searching for solutions at hand and less so at problem solving another pitfall of digital repositories once management enshrines a particular solution as a so called "best practice" by placing it in the database often there is little or no motivation to improve or refine the solution especially in a fast paced operational environment the lesson for km projects in which similar workers create and re use knowledge in a database and in which the contributions require a great deal more effort managers must either design the system so that the reward and effort for each are more in balance or they must change the way the organizations best practices are conceived and communicated any best practice must be subjected to regular inquiry and validation additionally when documenting a given practice the assumptions and rationale that underpin the solution should also be included this allows re users of the information to retain the sharpness of their problem solving skills as they have the opportunity to assess the extent to which the original solution is appropriate and to decide whether any further adaptation is required the college what began as a collaborative effort to develop online courses at a college in malaysia eventually stalled as the team leaders refused to consider ideas that came from outside the core group this project began by taking some faculty members from the government funded schools teachers and seven academic departments and putting them through an intensive three month instructional design training program afterward the were to play an active role in supporting colleagues throughout the school in designing effective e learning courseware a few of the initial members set up an online system for a so called community of practice or cop a forum consisting of persons with a common interest or shared field of study who exchange ideas and information debate with and learn from one another and so achieve goals and find solutions that might have eluded each of them individually seven members of the original group volunteered to help lead the cop the colleges management praised and approved the idea as a bottom up initiative to augment the e learning focus invitations to join the cop web site online were periodically emailed to all faculty those who registered could post comments in online discussions and gain access to e learning courseware developed by the core group and other e learning materials members also were invited to quarterly lunch and learn forums on such themes as virtual collaboration and online assessment within three months membership reached greatly exceeding expectations the cop successfully produced a web based reference guide to help faculty present teaching materials effectively on the colleges e learning platform the guide drew praise from management and faculty alike thus encouraged the cop began to develop a broader suite of e learning methodologies and practices such as a step by step guide on how synchronous discussion with students could be conducted for example and design templates for presenting web based learning materials gradually the cop was recognized as the colleges authoritative voice on e learning downfall the cop also developed two serious problems a tendency by its core members to promote their own ideas for practices and tools as the only acceptable form of e learning and social alienation although membership reached only an inner circle of about were actively engaged in cop activities these core members jealously guarded the groups established canons always believing that its work was best in class the core group was unwilling to make any changes to the set of e learning methodologies and practices it had developed newer cop members were kept out of the inner circle and had little opportunity to contribute fresh ideas or challenge existing ones intentionally or not it appears that the cop became alienated from the rest of the faculty whom it was intended to serve the trap in a properly functioning cop different perspectives on shared problems and issues are constantly exchanged given shape refined and eventually approved or adopted as a solution or best practice making a cop possibly the ideal structure for developing sharing and stewarding knowledge the danger as in this case is that a cop can also mutate into a structure which monopolizes the creation and transfer of knowledge the dysfunctional development of the colleges cop could be traced to the core groups unwillingness to consider ideas other than its own the lack of a leadership renewal process and a lack of criteria that outsiders could use to judge the quality of the cops work the lesson managers who intend to build a cop must nurture the sense of identity among members and ensure timely cycles of leadership renewal outside contacts must also be encouraged with sources of expertise such as professional bodies and trade associations this helps ensure that ideas which are sparked internally do not stagnate but are constantly challenged and renewed judging criteria must be set as well for outsiders to challenge the quality and appropriateness of the cops
