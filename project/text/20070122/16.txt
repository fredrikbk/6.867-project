boss talk a special report unnecessary tension profits vs growth short term vs long term the parts vs the whole does it really have to be either or the biggest challenge for business leaders is achieving many different things at the same time it isnt enough to make a company more profitable or to grow revenue the problem is finding a way to do both simultaneously and growing both profits and revenue is just one of many seemingly conflicting tasks that executives face among others the need to achieve better performance in the short term versus positioning ones company for the long term and the need to improve each individual part of a company versus strengthening the company as a whole ken favaro co chairman of management consulting firm marakon associates compares these competing tasks to the conundrum of people who lived in mud huts centuries ago and sought both light and heat they could get light if they punched a hole in the side of their hut but that also brought in the cold or they could stay warm but sit in darkness the mud hut conundrum mr favaro notes was solved with the invention of glass which made it possible to let in light and keep out the cold "glass was the common bond that made two conflicting objectives light and heat possible " he says mr favaro who is co author with marakon senior adviser dominic dodd of "the three tensions " thinks business leaders must identify and simultaneously accomplish these if they want their companies to be winners they cant afford to see saw between goals by chasing say bottom line profits one year and top line growth the next mr favaro discussed the tensions that most confound executives and how to resolve them here are excerpts the wall street journal what are the most important competing objectives challenging executives mr favaro three pairs stand out profitability versus growth short term versus long term improvement and improving the parts of a company versus the whole wsj would you rank these in a particular order mr favaro i would call profitability versus growth the mother of all tensions do i as a manager cut price in order to grow my margins or do i raise price in order to grow my top line what is important to recognize is that both top line growth and bottom line margins determine earnings over time top line growth gives you the ability to achieve scale reputation and credibility in the marketplace which in turn draws in talent all of this is necessary to generate healthy margins and of course healthy margins are necessary to generate the resources you need to keep the top line growing at any point in time top line growth and bottom line margins conflict with one another but over time they are highly dependent on one another wsj what tension do business leaders talk about most mr favaro we talked in depth with chief executives and more than half spoke of the tension between short and long term growth thats not surprising given that theyre stuck between two political forces current shareholders and the analysts who are pounding the table for earnings today and their own people who are pounding the table for more resources its a classic conflict should you cut investments today in order to boost current earnings or increase investment in order to position the company for future earnings both are necessary and dependent on one another current earnings provide the ability to invest in future earnings and you need future earnings in order to get the license to invest wsj can you elaborate on improving the parts of a company versus strengthening synergies among the parts mr favaro this is the conflict between individual performance and collective performance should you create more autonomy for the individual parts of a company in order to create more initiative more motivation more accountability and ultimately more individual performance or centralize activity into common functions to get economies of scale and scope a company to some extent is only as good as its individual parts but the individual parts can be good or bad depending on what they are gaining from being part of the whole wsj how can executives resolve these tensions mr favaro broadly speaking they have to recognize traps in common management practices take profitability versus growth for instance a key trap is to grow revenue without growing customer benefit if customers are getting a lot of benefit from choosing your product or service theyre willing to pay for that and then you dont have to cut prices and sacrifice margins wsj how can executives identify customer benefit mr favaro the challenge is that it varies enormously even for any one product take chocolate some people buy chocolate because they want a fix for their sweet tooth others buy it because they need a gift for someone in both cases they are getting a benefit but its a different benefit executives also have to ask themselves if what they are selling is a benefit to customers or just a feature this is where technology companies can get themselves into a fix innovation creates features but features dont automatically create benefits what matters is how you get from features to benefits apple computers ipod is a fantastic example of a feature that produced a benefit that then wiped out the customer benefit equation of sonys walkman now sony has a real tough challenge the company doesnt know how to grow revenues for its walkman without sacrificing margins wsj are there other ways executives can grow both their top and bottom lines mr favaro something the ceos we talked to found helpful is to change the question from "how can we grow the share of our market " to "how can we grow our market " cadbury schweppes top executives have done this with gum by recognizing that this can be a health product as much as a candy in cadbury a confectionery and beverage maker bought adams and its gum brands such as trident and dentyne executives increased advertising and reformulated packaging to raise awareness about these sugar free gums and also began launching new sugar free gums that help whiten teeth remove stains and even repair cavities they grew the sugar free gum market which had been stagnant for years and their own share of this market theyve done the same thing with chocolate they started by observing that people in the united kingdom were eating savory snacks more often at tea time and with coffee theyd always positioned chocolate as a dessert but in addition they began marketing it as a snack selling individual portions rival brands mars and nestle followed them and because they were leading the growth of the market they picked up share and never had to sacrifice margins to get that top line growth wsj how can executives resolve the tension between short term and long term growth mr favaro the trap here is tying your level of investment to whether or not youve achieved an annual earnings target that causes uneven investment especially in cyclical businesses when earnings are in the tank because its a down cycle executives often cut back on investments or they ramp them up when earnings are strong what should drive investments the most are prospects for future returns wsj how can executives improve the performance of both the company as a whole and individual business units mr favaro a common trap here is thinking that autonomy means you cant ever interfere or promote sharing of ideas and practices across units you end up institutionalizing silos on the other hand if you centralize everything you constrain business units to the point where they can no longer respond to their customers and competitors in an optimal way that can happen if you force every unit to depend on a centralized sales force or a centralized human resources department that doesnt understand their particular talent needs the solution is for a ceo or a head of a business unit to recognize that he or she is both a coach and a conductor coaches know the strengths and weaknesses of their individual players and how to improve on these conductors get performance out of a group and what enables a ceo to be both coach and conductor is the capacity to create shared values common practices and a shared sense of identity
