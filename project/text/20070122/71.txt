review &amp outlook editorial cuyahoga comeuppance the judicial hammer finally came down last week on the california law firm of brayton purcell one of the giants of the asbestos bar all the firm had done was file a false claim lie in court and obstruct discovery but hey everyone has a bad day once in a while the ruling came from ohio judge harry hanna of the cuyahoga county court of common pleas as he barred brayton purcell from practicing in his court in the process the judge exposed one of the darker corners of tort abuse asbestos trusts or funds set up by bankrupt companies to pay legal claims the judge is overseeing a suit brought by brayton purcell which claimed lorillard tobaccos cigarettes had caused the late harry kananians mesothelioma what emerged in court however is that brayton purcell and other firms had previously filed numerous claims to other asbestos trusts claiming that kananian had developed his asbestos cancer for different reasons this is called "double dipping " and because trust payouts are confidential the public rarely learns of these abuses our kimberley strassel exposed the kananian scam last year on these pages reporting on court records showing that brayton purcell and its lead attorney christopher andreas had gone to extraordinary lengths to hide these facts in his opinion judge hanna found that brayton purcell disobeyed court orders and lied to the court about it that it had filed a false claim to an asbestos trust because "this fiction of course improved chances of recovery from the trust" that mr andreas had lied to the court about what he knew about the claim forms and when and had encouraged trusts to resist discovery and that the lead counsel had shown a "shocking" lack of "respect" during his deposition "the record before this court indicates that brayton purcell institutionally and christopher andreas individually have failed to abide by our rules they have not conducted themselves with dignity they have not honestly discharged the duties of an attorney in this case therefore they have forfeited their privileges to practice before this court " the judge wrote cuyahoga county has long been a mecca for asbestos lawsuits and tens of thousands are still pending judge hanna and two of his colleagues are charged with overseeing that docket which means that brayton purcells banishment is a serious sanction that hurts its pocketbook even better would be if his ruling inspires the ohio state bar association and local or federal prosecutors to look at his findings in particular the description of how brayton purcell filed a fraudulent claim with the express aim of getting a payout judge hanna is also setting an example for the judiciary which has to take a harder line if litigation fraud is going to be reined in texas federal judge janis graham jack blew the whistle on silicosis fraud in while the michigan supreme court recently outlawed the "bundling" of asbestos suits a practice that had clogged courts and pressured companies into unfair settlements bankruptcy judges have also been exposing "prepackaged" bankruptcies which often let trial lawyers and asbestos companies bilk insurers with bogus claims judge hanna has now opened the door to more scrutiny of "double dipping" and the rampant fraud inherent in asbestos trusts the goal should be for more judges to allow for the discovery and admissibility of trust forms in ongoing litigation his opinion is required reading for other judges who can start asking whether similar dishonesty is destroying the integrity of their own courts
