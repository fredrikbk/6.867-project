duponts biotech bet ethanol boom inspires a drive to catch up after years of watching monsanto co dominate crop biotech dupont co s pioneer hi bred international unit is preparing to launch its strongest effort ever to fight back as the ethanol driven boom in grain prices shows no signs of slowing the company last month announced it will shift about &# million to its budding biotech sector laying off employees in other areas in the process in the company released its first biotech product under a joint venture it expects to release its first solo product by pioneer has been a leader in the seed business for most of the past years but it was slow to the biotech game since it has been losing ground as farmers have increasingly turned toward monsantos seeds which contain bioengineered traits that can make it easier and cheaper to grow their crops also monsanto st louis has stepped up its efforts to breed seeds with strong conventional genetics that better compete with pioneers seeds pioneer holds about of the corn seed market down from in according to kevin mccarthy a chemicals analyst at banc of america securities llc monsanto also has about of the corn seed market up from in by monsanto is expected to surpass pioneer pioneer parent dupont the wilmington del chemical company whose products range from envelopes to teflon nonstick coatings for cookware has remained profitable despite the slipping in the seed market still that has "been a consistent source of downward tension in duponts earnings over the last several years " mr mccarthy says the company which reports fourth quarter earnings tomorrow is expected to post &# billion in sales up from the previous year the agriculture and nutrition sector which accounted for about of duponts net sales last year is also expected to post stronger results in part because of robust seed and chemical sales in brazil and because of increased corn seed sales in the u s driven by a growing demand for ethanol a biofuel made from corn pioneers annual seed sales amount to &# billion about of its agriculture and nutrition sector biotech seeds make up only a fraction of that fourth quarter results in the agriculture sector are projected to show a loss of &# million an improvement over the fourth quarter in when the business showed a loss of &# million according to mr mccarthy duponts fourth quarter in the agriculture sector is seasonally weak pioneer tends to make all of its profits in the first half of the calendar year the race for companies to get their own seeds in the ground comes as the ethanol boom is creating unprecedented demand for corn corn prices in spot markets have been approaching &# per bushel an unheard of level at a time of bumper crops as farmers make plans to increase their corn production to take advantage of demand they are expected to switch out of other crops lifting prices for them as well to help meet the growing demand farmers are increasingly turning toward seeds with bioengineered traits that can make it easier and cheaper to grow their crops about million acres of biotech crops are planted in the u s up since and accounting for about of the total global biotech crops planted according to the national center for food and agricultural policy duponts top competitor monsanto has spent the past decade aggressively developing and marketing genetically modified seed varieties that can withstand herbicides and fend off pests in monsanto commercialized the first genetically modified seed roundup ready soybeans dramatically altering the landscape of farming and bringing a new dynamic to the seed industry the seeds are designed to stand up to the companys roundup herbicide and other glyphosate based herbicides making weed control a much easier chore for farmers roundup ready versions of other seeds such as corn canola and cotton soon followed dupont was a late comer to biotech partly because early investments in biotech were considered high risk monsanto was one of the only companies pouring money into the field early on also dupont underestimated the popularity and growth potential of the field says citigroup inc chemicals analyst p j juvekar while the company has long been a leader in providing seeds with strong conventional genetic traits most of its seeds now containing biotech traits use technology licensed from monsanto some in the industry calculated that the biotech business model would play out differently early on monsanto provided the technology to seed companies via licensing arrangements serving a growing demand from farmers pioneer along with other seed companies provided the seed the vehicle to take the technology to market "the initial concept was there would be technology providers and technology marketers " says john bedbrook vice president of the agriculture and nutrition division at dupont but eventually monsanto changed the game the company started acquiring seed companies of its own providing it with its own route to farmers fields in monsanto bought a national seed company called asgrow the following year it acquired dekalb genetics corp another national seed company and in the company formed american seeds inc a unit developed to acquire local independently owned seed companies through these moves monsanto secured multiple avenues to the marketplace allowing the company to spread its seed widely and rapidly today of all soy acres in the u s are planted with seeds containing a monsanto trait according to the company about of corn acres have monsanto traits now dupont is trying to catch up "it became clear to pioneer that in order to be a competitor long term they had to invest in biotech " mr bedbrook says in april the company entered a joint venture with syngenta ag called greenleaf genetics that would enable dupont to license its own biotech traits to seed companies a potentially profitable model that has served monsanto well in dupont together with dow chemical co also released a biotech trait called herculex a second generation biotech corn seed that protects against a variety of crop damaging pests similar to some of monsantos traits that have been on the market for some years by dupont expects to release its first independent proprietary biotech seed optimum gat a soybean seed designed to withstand herbicides the challenge now is to stay ahead in the rapidly advancing field the latest must have technology for farmers is called "stacking " seeds that have not just one but two or even three biotech traits folded into one seed the heat is coming not only from farmers but from wall street where the stocks of both companies have enjoyed run ups "there is a lot of pressure from shareholders to see success after spending so much money" on research says citigroups mr juvekar monsantos stock was at &# friday in the new york stock exchange p m composite trading up over past year while duponts stock closed at &# on the big board up in the period
