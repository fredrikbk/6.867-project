boss talk a special report goodbye mainstream where do you find the latest fashion trends these days everywhere says david wolfe fashion trends emanate from everywhere from the highly watched runways to the streets of st tropez to the fads that spread quickly across music and pop culture nobody knows this better than the peripatetic david wolfe creative director at doneger group a new york fashion consultancy specializing in trend and color forecasting mr wolfe years old is one of the fashion industrys most authoritative sharpshooters clients flock to see his presentations which he gives times a year to glean his take on whats likely to emerge from the sundry people and places that contribute to the fashion zeitgeist the world has turned into "tiny consumer tribes " in which the so called mainstream has virtually disappeared he says "i try to open doors to clients to show them that retailing reflects everything that is going on in the world " mr wolfe whose year career in the industry includes stints as a retail buyer advertising copywriter and fashion illustrator says he is always amused by the novel yet predictable nature of the industry "there is a rhythm to fashion " he says "ive seen the same trends keep coming around more than a few times " here are excerpts from a conversation with mr wolfe the wall street journal whats the biggest change across the greater fashion landscape nowadays mr wolfe i think there is going to be this big breakdown of the whole system i think there is going to be a clothing apparel industry that dresses the great american public in casual everyday clothes and then there are going to be the fashion specialty chains the fast fashion people the boutiques whatever you want to call them who deliver fashion with a capital "f " at every price point wsj why are fast fashion chains which offer swift replication of runway trends at low prices working in a casual era mr wolfe so many marketers seem to feel that the casualization of fashion in the s was written in stone locked in forever and people would never want anything else so they stopped paying attention to the frivolity and fripperies of fashion which is really what fast fashion retailers such as h&amp m and zara brought back across the ocean because it always was there in europe they never stopped they never went as totally casual as we did the clothes were still casual but they had a high fashion content wsj now that americans at every level can buy the newest fashion looks at every price level have their tastes become more sophisticated mr wolfe i think there is no such thing as a broad based american mainstream anymore and thats one of the major problems that fashion retailers are having at the moment instead of becoming one great homogenized society after the internet we are now much more segmented and layered the people who are interested in fashion need a faster hit all the time to stay interested and thats what these fast fashion retailers are delivering i think the smart retailers are taking advantage of their consumer group yes and no is the correct answer to everything today because it depends on whom you are trying to sell to wsj give us an example mr wolfe skinny jeans is a perfect example of why the system doesnt work the way people think it works skinny jeans are the hottest thing going for the fashion customer whether she has got a good body or a good butt or whatever the fashion customer is into skinny jeans does this mean that eventually everyone in america is going to be in skinny jeans of course not but the fashion system of old would eventually have everybody sooner or later from coast to coast in skinny jeans it doesnt work that way anymore skinny jeans will come and go within a very very restricted universe wsj when should retailers be careful about rolling out too many of these trendy designs to broad audiences mr wolfe i think they should never roll them out to a broad audience wsj why not mr wolfe because a broad audience doesnt want them it is the old thing about the consumer is really calling the shots today and if you arent paying attention to what the consumer is willing to accept or wants to embrace you are going to lose money wsj how does personal style play into the fashion industry these days mr wolfe the whole personal style phenomenon is a con it was one of those buzz concepts like power dressing i think everybody wants to be told what to wear the whole purpose is to impress people to fit into your peer group they want to be perceived as a personality who has style everybody wants the same personal style and thats the fun of it it identifies you as belonging to the personal style tribe i have the handbag i have the skinny jeans i have the right label on everything the personal style look is a compilation of items that look like they dont really belong together but they are as premeditated as the old fashioned coordinated head to toe matchy matchy outfit fashion marketers can accommodate this by having all the right items that you can put together for the personal style du jour wsj how soon will it be before the middle class basically buys all their clothes at target and wal mart mr wolfe when they get all the fashion right target is so good i really believe that they have revolutionized mass merchandising on fashion target created an image and then moved the merchandise up into that image so i think they now deliver what they are proposing to you i think they do it beautifully i think wal mart and fashion is such an oxymoron i admire them for taking a crack at it if you are going to make this kind of huge change and go after something that you are not known for at all you need a five year plan wal mart means one thing to america good value for very little money and that isnt what fashion is about they can sell apparel i dont think they can sell fashion wsj two key consumer groups baby boomers and large sized women claim that they are still being ignored by mainstream fashion lines why does the perception exist mr wolfe the boomer consumer and the plus size consumer are making such noise that fashion marketers are finally hearing because for a long time if you asked every designer who is your customer they all say the to year old even if it is really year olds they have the misconception that everybody wants to be or can relate to this mythical perfect customer and thats not true now we are much more realistic about age and size than we ever have been before wsj are companies managing their business to market fashion in the right way mr wolfe the thing i dont understand about our business is that it is called the fashion industry too many people are too caught up in the fashion part and forget the industry part and when a fashion company becomes so big that it becomes an industry then the wrong people are in charge and dont know about the fashion part companies have trouble getting the balance right fashion is a craft it is not an art nobody needs any fashion it is an emotional subjective illusionary thing that you are buying which is why abercrombie &amp fitch works if you are the abercrombie customer you go in there and you are not just buying a fleece top but you are buying the whole package you are buying the lighting you are buying the sexy salespeople whenever you put that sweatshirt on you feel that you are cool and sexy and groovy and all of this stuff and it is just a sweatshirt so thats the fashion part of it thats important that you cant lose sight of that and when you become big they always lose sight of that wsj but why do so many companies like the gap start to stumble mr wolfe it is kind of logical that when you become that big you have to start lowering the bar to appeal to more and more people you cant afford to be special and individual because you are not going to appeal to enough people which is why the best marketers get it right and kind of move a little bit toward fashion but they cant move a whole lot toward it because you are trying to satisfy a lot of people h&amp m can afford to be edgier because there arent a lot of h&amp m stores as soon as there is an h&amp m store in every mall in america it is going to get watered down they will be selling the same stuff that every other store has they will just have to wsj what do you think management in this era of fast fashion needs to do mr wolfe i think the challenge isnt any different than it has ever been it is a left brain right brain thing the management and creative people live in parallel universes and the wise people in management understand how to harness rampant creativity good creative people understand how to communicate their artistry to management whenever you get that perfect synergy i think you end up with a profitable operation a good example is juicy couture the european management seems to understand how to squeeze the right stuff out of the creative side of it balance of power is really what it is i dont think there is a formula i think somebody could come from some unrelated universe and understand how to work with creative people but it is the trickiest problem and thats what makes fashion probably a bigger gamble in terms of big business than any other sector even automotive design which is certainly a powerful force is balanced by engineering and technology and all kinds of practical elements that dont make the chasm between management and creative as deep as it is in the fashion world so it is the most exciting thing because it supplies the drama of the friction that makes this industry so exciting to observe ms agins is a senior special writer for the wall street journal in new york she can be reached at teri agins wsj
