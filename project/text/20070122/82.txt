the daily fix manning is bound for super bowl after leading historic comeback as players rest for a week or more between football games the hype machine revs up and with a week of dead space to fill and no new information to analyze the commentary predictions and cliche ridden press conferences can generate backlash and even backlash against the backlash but if you hate hype as much as the fix and followed backlash against the backlash columnist bill simmonss advice last week perhaps contrary to the corporate wishes of his employer espn com to "skip the shows columns features and sportscenter segments and join cbs at p m et on sunday" you saw a well played game between two accomplished well coached teams decided in the final seconds the indianapolis colts defeat of the new england patriots in the afc championship game wasnt flawless both teams saw offensive linemen score after their running backs fumbled the ball near the goal line the colts benefited from a pass interference no call and a questionable roughing the passer call in the fourth quarter but it was thrilling so about that hype twice in the three prior postseasons the pats ended the colts run in fact in minutes of playoff football against new england over the last four seasons indianapolis has led for just one minute but it was the final minute of last nights game after quarterback peyton manning shook off a horrible start to lead the colts to second half points or more than their total output in five prior halves of playoff football against the pats now the colts the winningest team in the league over the last two seasons will face the chicago bears with the second most wins in that span in a battle of i in the super bowl in two weeks more on the bears in a moment it marks indianapoliss first super bowl appearance and the franchises first since when they played in baltimore mr manning has suffered in comparison to patriots quarterback tom brady in playoffs past a reputation that wasnt redeemed by his starting this postseason with one touchdown and six interceptions the last of them returned last night by new england cornerback asante samuel for a touchdown and a lead mr mannings comeback from that low point aided by his usual array of offensive weapons and an occasionally formidable defense was the biggest comeback in conference championship history and is columnists favorite topic today "this was the best non super bowl game that many witnesses have ever seen " bill plaschke writes in the los angeles times "it was also the best possible ending to the most recycled story that many have ever heard " mr mannings father archie manning threw for yards in the nfl but never played on a winning team last night he couldnt bring himself to watch the clinching drive anthony cotton writes in the denver post "roaming the hallways deep in the bowels of the rca dome the elder manning only occasionally allowed himself to peek out onto the field where his son a student of the sport weaned on nfl films and game tapes as much as mothers milk was leading the indianapolis colts on an yard march into history " mr cotton writes indys late comeback stunned new england columnists who have watched the partnership of mr brady and coach bill belichick amass a playoff record and seen mr brady close out of the games in which he has held a halftime lead after mr samuels touchdown "media personnel already were busily preparing manning stories adding this performance to his list of cant win the big ones " jackie macmullan writes in the boston globe the providence journals bill reynolds may have begun his column as an ode to the pats in their quest for a fourth championship in six years but this morning it reads as an elegy to a team whose great run made history and may be history "they have given us an unbelievable ride these past six years one that seemed to come out of nowhere " mr reynolds writes "who could have dreamed of foxboro massachusetts as the most glamorous address in the whole nfl who could ever have envisioned what the patriots now mean in new england last night does nothing to change that regardless of the final score " if the bears rout of the new orleans saints in the nfc championship game was rendered in a watercolor it would be dominated by white and green white for the falling snow green for the grass stains marking the physically dominant victors the chicago tribunes rick morrissey starts with the snow a fitting backdrop for a bears home game in january "the snow good lord the snow it sat in a holding pattern above soldier field suspended and animated and beautiful taking its own sweet time falling to the ground thomas jones stumbled into the end zone rolled once rolled twice and rolled one more time before coming to rest on his back exhausted he had a split second to feel the flakes on his face before being buried by an avalanche of desmond clark and muhsin muhammad two of his teammates " mr joness running mate from chicagos backfield cedric benson was draped in green after the game in the locker room "his pants were completely covered in green as the grass had been smashed in " greg couch writes in the chicago sun times "just below the knees where the pants stopped bensons legs were colored green too his arms green the cold the messy field the sheer physicality of the game he was wearing it all " bears quarterback rex grossman shook off a for start to lead a third quarter touchdown drive and he played conservatively enough not to hurt his team detroit free press columnist michael rosenberg writes that theres too much attention on the bears quarterback "if the bears made the super bowl with one of the worst groups of linebackers in the nfl nobody would mind " mr rosenberg writes "most of us wouldnt even notice until some tv talking head screamed about how awful the bears linebackers were and then that guy would get fired for not talking enough about the quarterback " the saints kept things close until the fourth quarter with their highlight an yard touchdown reception by reggie bush capped by a celebratory somersault "if they prefer to let the season long bliss linger a bit longer if theyd rather not return to somber reality just yet at least there is the image of reggie bush launching himself into space into full curling orbit and landing with all his body parts intact " lisa olson writes in the new york daily news unfortunately his move also angered the bears and they outscored the saints from that point on that was a disappointing ending to an unexpectedly successful season that brought a measure of joy to new orleans "the saints gave optimism to people here and they gave them a break " sally jenkins writes in the washington post but recovery from katrina remains at a standstill ms jenkins writes after visiting the city the colts tony dungy and the bears lovie smith good friends who talk on the phone each monday are the first two black coaches to lead their teams to the super bowl msnbcs don pierson traces the efforts of players owners especially dan rooney of the pittsburgh steelers and coaches to bring hiring equity to the nfl culminating in yesterdays historic pair of firsts newark star ledger columnist jerry izenberg says the rooney rule has worked and adds of messrs dungy and smith "they destroyed a folk myth that is entitled to no more discussion what we need to talk about is the fact that together they weaved a tapestry built not on color but on brilliant coaching " found a good column from the world of sports
