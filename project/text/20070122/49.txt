investors credit putin as they pile up profits hot stock market makes russian leader a hero with money managers moscow in western capitals vladimir putin has an image problem politicians in the u s and europe routinely accuse him of squelching domestic dissent strong arming foreign oil companies and using russias vast energy resources to blackmail neighbors one constituency however has a strikingly different take on the russian president to many investors mr putin is a hero the reason the russian stock markets spectacular rally during his seven years of rule when mr putin took office in january the countrys publicly traded stocks were valued at &# billion their value now exceeds &# trillion russias benchmark rts index rose in the fourth year under mr putin that the market has returned more than "hes done a helluva of a job " says mark mobius an emerging market guru and managing director of templeton asset management ltd "the country has made tremendous strides in the time weve been there and youve got to give putin credit for that " many money managers are betting the rally will continue this year even with lofty valuations falling oil prices and rising political uncertainty in the run up to russian presidential elections in march when mr putin is obliged by term limits to stand down to be sure some investors agree with western criticism of russias spotty human rights record and of mr putins moves to undermine the independence of russias courts and parliament they concede that in the long run democratic institutions are crucial for healthy market economies but for the time being concern about the state of russian democracy isnt driving share prices events that shape the wests political stance toward russia like the unsolved murder in london last november of alexander litvinenko the former kgb agent who on his deathbed accused mr putin of having him poisoned barely register on most investors radar screens the kremlin has denied any responsibility for mr litvinenkos death and answers broader western criticism by saying that russia is pursuing its own path to democracy many investors argue that critics dont give mr putin enough credit for the huge strides russia has made under his presidency though he has created mammoth state run national champions that dominate the oil and gas industry they say there is plenty of competition in other sectors and in sharp contrast to the spendthrift populism of venezuelas hugo chavez mr putin has kept tight control of russias purse strings despite the oil boom "two key factors in any emerging market are economic predictability and political stability " says chris weafer chief economist at alfa bank in moscow "russia has the first thanks to oil and the second thanks to putin " oil is the cornerstone of russias rebound the worlds second biggest crude exporter after saudi arabia russia has reaped huge dividends from the commodity boom over the past five years the inflow of oil dollars has lifted the value of stocks and real estate here to unprecedented highs but bankers and investors say mr putins contribution has been crucial he inherited a country that defaulted on its debt in reducing itself to a pariah in international financial circles and repaired its tottering public finances he also bolstered the central governments waning power "he did a lot of positive things in a very short period of time " says mr mobius who oversees &# billion in emerging market assets of which is invested in russia indeed russia now boasts the biggest foreign exchange reserves outside asia huge budget surpluses and an &# billion rainy day fund created as a hedge against falling oil prices it has also paid off most of its foreign debt even among investors however mr putin has his detractors some were outraged by the kremlins politically motivated campaign against billionaire mikhail khodorkovsky and his company oao yukos the blue chip oil giant that was russias most popular stock among western investors until the kremlin partially renationalized it in mr khodorkovsky ended up in prison on fraud and tax evasion charges others shrink from his aggressive brand of state capitalism many took exception for example to the way royal dutch shell plc was forced to sell control of the huge sakhalin energy project to the government run natural gas monopoly oao gazprom last month after russian regulators suddenly discovered a raft of environmental violations shell acknowledged some lapses but said it had been working to fix them western investors also frequently cite widespread corruption and a lack of transparency as major obstacles to doing business in russia last year the country shared st place in watchdog group transparency internationals annual corruption perceptions index with third world countries like rwanda benin and honduras some businessmen complain that corruption has got worse under mr putin "in general putins been a good leader though former yukos shareholders and current shell executives may beg to differ " says samuel oubadia co manager of the ing russia fund which has &# million in assets under management and was up last year the best return among u s based emerging market funds though the yukos case cost investors around &# billion in lost value the kremlin followed up with investor friendly moves that did much to restore market confidence the removal of restrictions on foreign ownership of shares in gazprom and the sale of stock in the state oil company oao rosneft last summer as a result the rts has delivered a return since its lows at the depths of the yukos crisis in july shares in gazprom have nearly quadrupled over the same period it is now one of the worlds largest companies with a market capitalization of &# billion and is showing up in portfolios all over the world fidelity investments is a big shareholder and u s mutual fund manager t rowe price group inc says gazprom is among the top holdings of two of its retail emerging markets funds meanwhile western corporate giants such as general motors corp citigroup inc and toyota motor corp unfazed by the kremlins heavy handed treatment of companies like shell have poured into the country to get a piece of russias consumer boom foreign direct investment though still low in proportion to the size of the countrys economy doubled last year to &# billion major u s investment banks like goldman sachs group inc and morgan stanley have ramped up their moscow operations drawn there by the emergence of strong cash rich russian companies looking to list overseas and buy assets abroad against that backdrop the market is ready to indulge mr putin when bill browder one of russias biggest foreign investors and once a staunch defender of the kremlins policies was refused entry into the country in november as a "threat to national security " the initial reaction was disquiet over the ensuing months investors pulled hundreds of millions of dollars out of his fund hermitage capital management but the outflows stopped last summer and mr browders fund which has &# billion in assets under management was up last year mr browder says he is still "selectively bullish" about russia though he is less likely these days to give mr putin all the credit for the countrys turnaround "my logic is that its a liquidity driven market and the forces driving liquidity are still there " says mr browder skeptics warn that with a stock market dominated by natural resource companies russia remains highly vulnerable to swings in commodity prices so far this year a fall in the price of crude has helped push the rts down "if we get oil prices in the region of &# per barrel this year i wouldnt be surprised to see the market trading at around " or roughly a third from its record end of close says john paul smith global strategist at pictet asset management which has around &# billion invested in emerging markets assets part of the problem is that mr putin has made little headway diversifying russias economy and lessening its dependence on energy exports "in the past investors were able to give russia the benefit of the doubt because its assets were so cheap " says mr weafer the alfa bank economist "now they need to know where the long term growth is going to come from " politics is another potential danger though there is little doubt that mr putins preferred candidate he hasnt said who that is will win the elections uncertainty about the succession could still spook the market some analysts warn but betting against mr putin has been a losing proposition for investors in the past "ive said at the start of every year theres no way we can get more than out of russia " says alexander schwarzkopf of altima partners which has &# billion in assets under management a quarter of it in russia "every time im proved wrong "
