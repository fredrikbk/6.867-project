cold remedy can a re engineered kleenex cure a brands sniffles assailed by generics kimberly clark bets on a virus fighter neenah wis everywhere you look kleenex is under siege cheap generic tissue is tearing into its market share meanwhile it faces mounting pressure in a consumer products industry obsessed with infusing even humble paper products with innovation and high tech ingredients olays total effects cleansing wipes use a "vitalipid system " which delivers antiaging moisturizers with vitamins e b and lipids pledge clean &amp dust cloths contain "antistatic agents" that promise to remove dust and allergens as they clean furniture where does that leave kleenex an year old brand so mundane it has become synonymous with tissue itself top executives at kimberly clark corp are making a high stakes bet they have an answer kleenex laced with a mild pesticide to fight cold and flu viruses kleenexs predicament can be found up and down the aisles of supermarkets and drugstores where marketers are in a race to re engineer the classic products of americas cupboards procter &amp gamble co turned old mr clean into a new line of pretreated sponges dubbed "magic eraser " and a line of car care products and its cleaning solution added fragrances such as "sparkling apple " kellogg co s special k cereal recently added a line of "protein meal" bars and even "special k protein water " in strawberry kiwi lemon twist and tropical blend flavors companies need to play this game because giant retailers like wal mart stores inc are demanding fresh choices for consumers and filling their shelves with their own cheap generic lines of basics for kleenex the need for change is greater than ever with &# billion in global sales kleenex is part of kimberly clarks consumer tissue division which contributes more than a third of the companys annual sales but plagued by high prices for energy and pulp it has the smallest profit margins of the companys three divisions launched in late kleenex anti viral now looms as an important weapon kimberly clark introduced kleenex tissues in as a handy way for women to remove cold cream from their faces over the decades the company kept its edge by thinking up new ways to use a piece of tissue paper in the s it touted kleenex as a disposable handkerchief a decade later marketers boasted that the tissues could help kill spiders wipe up spills and be used in magic tricks tv commercials in heralded the convenience and table appeal of new cube shaped boxes in kleenex pioneered the first perfumed tissue with a light floral scent but lately the pressure to innovate has grown intense the facial tissue category has been shrinking steadily since with annual sales of &# billion the kleenex tissue brand accounts for about of the total revenue of kimberly clark which also makes huggies diapers and scott paper towels tissue sales suffered their sharpest decline in the past five years with unit sales down in according to information resources inc its data measures sales through supermarkets drugstores and mass merchandise outlets excluding wal mart which doesnt provide sales data kleenex tissue sales fared worse with unit sales down last year lower priced private label brands gained market share kimberly clark which declined to provide specific sales figures says its market share last year remained about flat with the year before one reason for tissues misfortunes consumers increasingly reach for alternatives including paper towels toilet paper and free napkins available at coffee shops and fast food chains "its about using whats present whats convenient " says erin fowler a consumer research analyst for mintel international group a market research firm "youre not going to go through the motion of putting facial tissues on the shopping list if something else is working " advances in cold therapies may also have taken a toll "over the counter and prescribed medicines are much better at treating the symptoms so there is arguably some tissue sales erosion " says steve erb kleenexs associate marketing director so in marketers gave kleenex a new mission kill germs that "had the potential to grow the entire category and increase household consumption " recalls mr erb "it could alter peoples perceptions of what a kleenex facial tissue could do " a germ fighting tissue forced the company into unusual terrain because it uses a pesticide for example kimberly clark needed to secure approval from the environmental protection agency kleenexs traditional soft touch marketing tone would also require some tweaking "there was discomfort over whether the power of the brand could overcome the killing idea " says mr erb the company had stumbled along a similar path in when it also tried a germ fighting tissue before the s onslaught of antibacterial soaps fabrics and hand wipes the idea of a chemical laced tissue was foreign to consumers kleenexs product cost to more than regular tissues it had an intimidating name avert virucidal consumers complained that the paper felt slimy and stung their eyes some even said it made them sneeze after just a few months in five test markets kimberly clark pulled it from shelves "we were way before our time " says cheryl perkins kimberly clarks former chief innovation officer but the idea of adding ingredients to tissues didnt go away in procter &amp gamble launched puffs plus with lotion the first tissue treated with lotion kimberly clark later responded with its own lotion treated tissue as well as a menthol scented one those proved popular demonstrating that consumers would pay more for versions of kleenex they believed had added benefits in the late s buoyed by the new success of hand sanitizers and antibacterial soaps kimberly clark decided to re examine the antiviral idea the company also sensed an advantage the only dominant antiviral products on the market were cleaning agents such as bleach and other surface disinfectants says kleenex brand manager jean maurice boyer paper products targeting germs such as hand wipes were still relatively scarce and those were specifically focused on killing bacteria not viruses kimberly clarks main target company research pointed to one yucky habit that supported the push into germ fighting of consumers stash used tissues in places such as purses pockets and drawers and on countertops often to re use them so a tissue capable of deactivating viruses could protect others from exposure at its facilities here in neenah wis kimberly clark found a way to manufacture the antiviral tissue more cheaply than it had with avert while adding extra softness this involved disassembling the three tissue layers to apply a mixture of citric acid and sodium lauryl sulfate and then putting them back together chemical additives to the outer tiers gave the tissues a silky feel when a sneeze or a cough hits the tissue the middle layer traps and kills of viruses within minutes the company claims while antiviral drugs are hard to make its considered relatively straightforward to kill a virus outside the body such as by swabbing it with bleach public health officials have worried that the widespread use of antibacterial products are contributing to drug resistant strains but wiping off a virus with commonly used ingredients generally doesnt raise that alarm kleenexs antiviral tissues target viruses that are the most prevalent causes of the flu and common cold including rhinoviruses type a and the antiviral tissues active ingredients citric acid and sodium lauryl sulfate constitute a pesticide that destroys the viruss wall deactivating the virus the company says it discovered how to make the antiviral treatment without malic acid a previous ingredient that had caused skin irritation averts old medicinal box navy blue and white squares was scrapped in favor of a more colorful patterned one some health experts remain skeptical of the tissues health benefits cold viruses as kimberly clark points out are expelled in the form of tiny droplets can travel up to miles per hour land up to three feet away and survive on surfaces for more than hours "maybe this is an added level of protection " says nicholas stamatos assistant professor at the institute of human virology at the university of maryland medical center "but what youre achieving with this youll achieve better by washing your hands " some loyal kleenex users doubt their tissues need more bells and whistles diane brabender says she always has a box of tissues on hand keeping them in both of her bathrooms her car and her office ms brabender a bank trust officer from cincinnati says shes willing to spend more for kleenex tissues because they are softer than generic brands even so shes not willing to splurge on an antiviral tissue "i just dont believe its really going to make a difference to my health or anyone elses " she says "i just need a tissue to catch my sneeze it doesnt have to do anything else " kimberly clark didnt want to position anti viral too aggressively as a preventive health product "we knew it would hold the product back if it became the sick box " says gary keider kleenexs marketing director "we knew from a sales and volume perspective that the box had to be out often otherwise consumers would use it sparingly and at limited times " hedging its bets the company decided to trumpet the tissues antiviral properties only on the boxs plastic overlay typically removed when the container is opened as a reminder that the tissues are treated a liner surrounding the boxs opening says "anti viral" in small type to further distinguish the antiviral tissue from regular ones kleenex printed tiny blue dots on the visible middle layer where the antiviral treatment is applied even this was a tough call kleenex stopped making tissues with printed designs in the late s in response to consumer concerns about the environmental impact of inks and dyes in order to make its flu fighting claims kimberly clark had to get approval for its pesticide laced product from the epa rather than the food and drug administration since tissues arent ingested after a yearlong review the epa approved the product in with certain caveats the agency for example required that kleenex state on its label that the product hadnt been tested against bacteria fungi or other viruses epa policy placed restrictions on the box design forbidding anything that appeals directly to children neither could the container portray anything edible or found in nature including flowers a ubiquitous design on kleenex boxes for its ads kleenex considered a bold approach showing a little girl blowing her nose and a message that punched up the tissues tough side after focus groups didnt seem to mind the brand started running the print ads in the tagline "ruthless killer " priced about more than standard kleenex tissues the product was launched in late kimberly clark says that anti viral now holds of the u s market and has generated more than &# million in global sales since its launch now in countries anti virals international shipments are expected to increase this year as the product passes various governmental clearances in addition to targeting households kimberly clark has worked hard to gain a presence in schools because most teachers list a box of tissue on their list of students necessary school supplies back to school season is one of the biggest selling periods for facial tissue a nationwide kimberly clark sponsored classroom handout titled "what to do when you ah choo learning about sneezes and sniffles " has included buy one get one free coupons for kleenex anti viral tissues when flu outbreaks closed schools in texas and michigan in kimberly clark shipped them dozens of free boxes of antiviral tissues the lovelady independent school district in lovelady texas put two boxes in every classroom
