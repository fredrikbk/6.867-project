goldman sachs group inc have investments in the chinese securities business but ubs ags new chinese venture stands apart because it is armed with a full set of licenses to trade underwrite securities manage assets and publish research among other things the timing is good stock markets in shanghai and shenzhen are at records and their main indexes more than doubled last year this year the capitalization of chinas markets topped &# trillion for the first time thanks to hefty new stock sales and rising prices stock and bond markets are providing a greater share of corporate funding as reliance on bank loans begins to shrink ubs was lucky in another way too it won government approval to set up a securities firm in september just as chinas securities regulator was closing the door on new foreign ventures several rival deals involving merrill lynch &amp co and j p morgan chase &amp co got caught in the doorjamb bankers involved said chinas authorities have resisted greater foreign access to the countrys securities markets in a bid to help domestic brokerage houses get back on their feet many local players are insolvent after a five year dip in the stock markets from through brokerage houses also suffered from an erosion of confidence among investors battered by the ups and downs of a market that long operated like a kind of casino "there was quite a lot of concern in the local market that the foreigners might come in too early and come in too cheap " said vincent chan head of china research at credit suisse in hong kong "there is a genuine concern among regulators about how the domestic players can compete " so far the government has focused on forcing consolidations and closures among the countrys more than securities firms the nations securities regulator is issuing new regulations aimed at making the markets more appealing to investors and companies the changes include adoption of international accounting standards and new rules for custodial services to protect client money authorities are pushing chinese companies to sell shares in domestic markets instead of internationally and foreign firms have limited access to those markets china has opened its banking sector to foreign investment as part of its commitments to the world trade organization but it has made no such promises to open up the securities sector only a handful of outsiders have direct access to the domestic markets goldmans venture set up in late is starting to underwrite domestic share sales morgan stanleys partner of more than a decade is the countrys top underwriter other firms are agitating for more access and continue to scope out opportunities a freeze against new deals remains in place and even if a thaw comes many arent convinced existing rules for joint ventures offer the right opportunity those rules allow foreign investors to take a stake in a domestic entity licensed to underwrite but not trade equities "we do not necessarily see a first mover advantage " says paul calello chief executive officer for asia for credit suisse "most important is to have the right structure and partner " some foreign securities firms have asset management joint ventures or allocations to buy domestic securities for foreign institutional investors and banking licenses that permit limited lending services ubs is hoping its deal will offer it more the swiss bank agreed to pay &# million for a stake in a new brokerage house formed out of the former beijing securities a troubled broker owned by the beijing municipal government ubs will have control of the companys member board of directors without owning the largest slice of stock the transaction got started in early when ubs was scouring china to find a domestic partner at initial meetings beijing securities offered ubs the chance to do a special deal that would have the backing of the state council according to ubs executives other available ventures offered only limited licenses "the carrot was if you help fix this broken company you can invest in a fully licensed securities company " said philip partnow a ubs banker who worked on the transaction the deal also appealed to the chinese beijing mayor wang qishan was intent on fixing up the citys financial assets and ubss investment would give the beijing government cash the two sides agreed to terms that were approved by the state council in september getting the venture up and running hasnt been easy widespread criticism that foreign investors bought stakes in chinas biggest banks too cheaply fed a broad political backlash ubs is one of six in the buying consortium the beijing government is the largest shareholder with three chinese state companies each have stakes of and international finance corp the investment arm of the world bank has a stake ubs securities doesnt have an opening date and the equity hasnt yet changed hands ubs expects it to happen in the first quarter
