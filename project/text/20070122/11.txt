boss talk a special report first fix then grow what management skills do you need to save a struggling company debra cafaro should know there are executives who are expert at restructuring floundering businesses and others adept at making companies grow debra cafaro ceo of ventas inc the real estate investment trust that owns nursing homes and other health care facilities is among the few who have succeeded at both the louisville ky company needed intensive care when ms cafaro took over eight years ago the sole tenant of its properties vencor inc was insolvent and on the verge of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws leaving ventass future uncertain ms cafaro a former real estate and corporate lawyer turned ventas around by among other things playing a key role in the financial restructuring of vencor and restructuring ventass debt then once the turnaround proved successful a feat few had expected ms cafaro turned her attention to making ventas grow and diversifying the company through an ambitious acquisition plan just last week ventas announced it would acquire toronto based sunrise senior living real estate investment trust for &# billion in cash and debt as a turnaround leader she had to be a tough negotiator and withstand conflict to achieve growth she had to convince executives at companies she sought to acquire that shed be a collegial boss she spoke with the wall street journal about the different management qualities required as a turnaround leader and a dealmaker here are excerpts the wall street journal what did you face when you first became ceo of ventas ms cafaro when i was recruited in march there were four big challenges vencor our only tenant and only source of revenue was insolvent all our debt was coming due the justice department had a &# billion medicare fraud claim against us and our distressed debt holders who are among the most sophisticated meanest and smartest guys out there also had a litigation claim against us my first day on the job rumors were circulating in the financial community that vencor was about to report a huge loss for the prior year our stock fell in trading from &# to &# a share my second day and everyone was calling me and asking "whats your plan what are you going to do " wsj what did you do ms cafaro one of the first things we did during my first week was draw down our credit lines which totaled several hundred million dollars management teams often are fearful of doing this because of the important relationships they have with their lenders but my job was to save ventas if you dont have liquidity in the situation we were in you are captive to everyone if you do have it you get some time to work through the problems so liquidity is the no priority we had a meeting with our lenders to reaffirm our commitment to pay them back cents on the dollar as a lawyer who had represented lenders i understood what they would want and we were prepared to give them a higher interest rate and fees wsj what management qualities do you need to lead a turnaround ms cafaro you have to be willing to temporarily upset a lot of people in order to save the company you have to withstand a lot of conflict histrionics screaming at meetings and toughness on all sides wsj is there any one skill you need the most ms cafaro one of the reasons i love turnarounds is theyre the most complex situations you have to call on every single skill youve got strategic tactical theatrical legal social intellectual not a lot of other situations require that wsj were there things you decided not to do ms cafaro we never sold any assets or raised dilutive equity at the time we couldnt give away a nursing home because of the turmoil in the industry but given demographics about the aging population we made a judgment that these were assets we wanted to hold even though others in our position did the opposite and sold everything we always believed long term care was a good business to be in for the long term and was just going through an enormous strain because of a mistake the government had made about medicare payments our hypothesis was this would eventually get fixed wsj what gave you this perspective ms cafaro i read as much as i could about the industry and sought out people to talk to who had been in the business for a period of time we had a chairman and founder whod been through different cycles so i relied on him for some of my learning we also assembled an incredible outside team of professional advisers and i talked and listened to all sorts of disparate sources lobbyists in washington shareholders analysts then i synthesized all this and we formed and stuck to a plan based on a couple of key hypotheses wsj what were these ms cafaro we decided the business was good for the long term and wed rather try to help our tenant vencor get back on its feet than re tenant our buildings to someone else it took two years until vencor which renamed itself kindred emerged from bankruptcy still the biggest long term health care provider but with a sustainable capital structure a balance sheet that made sense wsj how did you change your strategy as things improved ms cafaro i went through the same thinking process as when i first joined ventas i asked "if were going to be a viable growing company what are our strengths and what do we need to be successful " we had just one tenant so it wasnt a genius move to say we ought to diversify and have some assets that werent correlated to medicare payments to do that we had to improve earnings and get rid of our high priced debt we also needed to grow our management team so we would be able to handle growth during the workout phase we had a limited infrastructure a skeletal team some people had left because this wasnt what theyd signed up to do we had a general counsel in place but we had to hire a chief investment officer chief financial officer and a team of people who were expert in real estate finance health care and acquisitions wsj was the hiring process difficult ms cafaro you cant just pour water and create an immediate team we made some important hires who are still with us and others that didnt work out that was hard for me because while im very capable of taking a lot of external conflict internal conflict takes a toll on me i care about the people who are around me and know theyve taken a risk to sign on but i also know its inevitable to make some mistakes when you hire and you just have to move on wsj whats the biggest difference between leading a turnaround and growth company ms cafaro i cant think of a lot of people who are drawn to doing both because they are so different in the restructuring world theres a lot of losing going on so theres much more conflict when youre trying to grow you really want the people youre trying to partner with to like you so you can get to yes to do deals you have to be a lover not a fighter deals are about numbers and also about fit chemistry relationships our chief investment officer came to ventas with a strong history of relationships in the industries we wanted to grow in but i also had to focus on creating relationships with senior members of health care and real estate companies and private equity firms and persuade them wed be a good partner after the bruising and very public battles wed been through there was a gap in peoples perceptions they think of you and your company one way and you have to show them not just tell them that youll be a good partner we have long term leases its a year relationship so the decisions they make about who to do business with are extremely important wsj how did you convince them ms cafaro some of it was just hard work and making sure we understood what they needed wed also established a reputation of doing what we said we would do with our tenant and our lenders and that helped us and since everyone had predicted we were a lost cause when we came out the other side some people in our industry thought "if they can do that maybe they can help us " they wanted to talk to us wsj were there other changes you had to make in your management style as you sought growth at ventas ms cafaro coming out of a turnaround i didnt think we could afford any mistakes but i also had to accept that if we didnt take risks we couldnt grow all deals have risks and id just been managing a situation where every bad thing that could have happened did happen i had to put that aside and say "i see the risks in this new deal but i will take them because i can create a structure that mitigates the risks they likely wont happen anyway and i cant let them stand in the way of our ability to move forward " wsj looking back is there anything you would have done differently ms cafaro after we started with our growth plan we should have been more aggressive and faster at building bulk and diversifying away from kindred weve doubled the size of the company and now have of our business in private pay senior housing and medical offices in hospitals and the rest in nursing care but it took time we hired our cfo and chief investment officer in and closed our first deals in the first quarter of we were very disciplined and careful in progressing but i think someone who was just a growth guy would have gotten in there and accelerated faster wsj are there any similarities between how you managed initially at ventas and now ms cafaro during a workout you have to have plans a through f and run full speed on multiple plans because you dont know which ones will fall through its very precarious all the time now in a very competitive acquisitions environment you also have to be working a through f deals and going full speed ahead on all of them because its very difficult to know which ones will succeed ms hymowitz is a senior editor and in the lead columnist at the wall street journal in new york she can be reached at carol hymowitz wsj com
