interest rates and oil prices control stocks after surprises on both investors try to unlock correct way to react for months the bull market has enjoyed two strong underpinnings falling oil prices and the hope that the federal reserve will start cutting interest rates this year now there have been surprises on both fronts and stock investors are worrying how to react hopes for an interest rate cut by spring or summer have virtually evaporated in the face of stronger than expected economic and wage data that is a big disappointment because low interest rates reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers helping stocks meanwhile oil futures which had been floating around &# a barrel have suddenly dived even lower despite a sharp gain friday futures finished the week at &# crude is down this year alone below the u s record &# hit july some investors are talking about the possibility of &# oil something the market hasnt seen in more than two years for stocks outside the oil business and for most consumers that is good news because it restrains inflation and frees up money to spend the market has to figure out how to respond to unexpected good news about oil and unexpected bad news about interest rates in the short term it is dithering with stock indexes bouncing up and down near their recent highs the dow jones industrial average finished friday at less than points below the record hit earlier last week many money managers remain quite bullish "i am seeing gas below &# a gallon here it is down more than from the summer highs that translates into more money in consumers pockets more discretionary spending " says keith wirtz president of fifth third asset management which oversees &# billion for fifth third bancorp in cincinnati falling demand for oil is contributing to the price declines oil consumption in leading industrial countries fell last year for the first time in more than years the international energy agency reports theres no guarantee that oil prices will stay down of course but if they do that removes a big part of the inflation problem mr wirtz adds although some investors worry that the economy may be too strong to permit the fed to cut its target interest rates at all in mr wirtz believes that cooling inflation will lead to rate cuts later in the year the result in mr wirtzs view will be the best of all worlds falling interest rates together with mild inflation and steady economic growth of about "if you look back through history those are great conditions for stocks " he says he is forecasting a increase in the standard &amp poors stock index this year or if you include dividends that kind of optimism helps explain why stocks arent falling much but not everyone is that hopeful which is what is preventing shares from putting in much of a gain "as a driver for stocks and as a driver for consumer spending oil is exaggerated " says jeffrey kleintop chief investment strategist at pnc wealth management which manages &# billion for pittsburghs pnc bank energy costs mainly for gasoline heating and air conditioning account for only about of consumer spending he says energy is only of business spending although that varies significantly across industries wages account for about of business costs mr kleintop says back in the s it took barrels of oil to produce &# in gross domestic product today it is barrel interest rates are far more important than oil he says "i think the market would have preferred to see oil hanging in here at &# and see the fed preparing to cut rates at this point " mr kleintop says whats more there is a downside to lower oil prices oil companies account for about of the profits of companies in the s&amp p he says a &# drop in oil prices lowers profits in the s&amp p s energy sector by he calculates oil companies have been the biggest driver of the s&amp p companies stronger than expected profits in the past couple of years falling oil prices could hurt oil companies more than they help the broader economy making them a "net negative" for profits mr kleintop says whats more if oil prices fall too sharply investors might start to worry that a recession could be looming mr kleintop sees stocks rising this year but not as much as last year and he worries that they could be volatile if the fed leaves interest rates unchanged he says the s&amp p may rise only about half of what mr wirtz expects some worry that the outlook could be more clouded inflation still is running above a year not counting food and energy costs fed officials have said that is too high is the top of their comfort zone unless inflation falls further the fed actually could be forced to raise interest rates this year worries edgar peters chief investment strategist at boston money management firm panagora asset management which oversees &# billion "if the fed starts to do another set of rate hikes then that would probably go over very badly" in the stock market he adds few investors are ready for that kind of news mr peters believes that oil is important to the economy not only because lower energy costs stimulate corporate and consumer spending but also because lower prices are good for inflation but the main inflation drivers are wages and the percentage of industrial capacity that is being used he says both those latter two factors have been strong lately unless they ease off mr peters fears we will see higher rates "there is a possibility that if energy prices stay stable and nothing else goes wrong the fed could engineer a soft landing this time " he says meaning that inflation would ease without requiring enough fed rate increases to damage the economy "but the odds are typically against that because you need ideal conditions for that to happen " he adds "the fact that energy prices have fallen is a positive thing the question is whether they will stay down if they do it is more likely that we will have a soft landing "
