boss talk a special report after fen phen wyeths ceo on changing sales tactics tv ads finding new drugs and consumer resentment the chairman and chief executive of wyeth robert essner doesnt pine for the golden era of the pharmaceuticals industry hes not sure there ever was one mr essner age brings a unique view to the executive suite in he answered a mysterious newspaper ad seeking an intellectually curious person eager to work in a stimulating environment with other bright people the ad led him to abandon work toward a doctorate in ancient history and to take a market research job in lincoln neb for a subsidiary of a drug company that has since become part of novartis ag the switch launched him on a career that has taken him to the top of one of the worlds largest drug makers during the s a time that already looks to many inside big pharma like the good old days wyeth was mired in litigation over the diet drug cocktail popularly known as fen phen since then the company has reserved or paid out more than &# billion to cover legal fees judgments and settlements of the claims of heart damage but those tough times seasoned mr essner who became ceo in and have helped prepare wyeth for todays challenges in a way that he maintains its rivals are not some analysts expect wyeth could receive marketing approval this year for as many as four new drugs including treatments for kidney cancer and schizophrenia on this wave of novel drugs diminished legal expenses for diet drug claims and strong sales of current medicines mr essners wyeth is on a roll in a recent interview at the companys headquarters in madison n j mr essner reflected on the world wide pressure on drug prices resistance from doctors to industry sales tactics and the pitfalls of drug research the wall street journal how has the publics view of the pharmaceutical industry changed since you stumbled into it in the s mr essner the industry was much lower profile then than it is today partly because its research efforts had not been nearly as successful my sense is that the attitude today is a kind of schizophrenic one people love the drugs and they love the cures but they also resent the notion that anyone should make profit on the basis of people being sick even though people can intellectually say they understand why profit is essential for that activity there still is an edge to that the issues that were resented for are based almost entirely on the economics of the industry wsj nonetheless youve said that youre not nostalgic about a rosier bygone era for the pharmaceutical business why not mr essner i think a lot of other ceos are still in the mode of thinking that the really difficult times that drug companies are having right now the heightened level of competitiveness the heightened level of customer activism here the political scrutiny are a bad patch were going through and that things will get back to normal which was depending on where you sat say or some period years ago when things felt a lot more secure my reflection is that and were not my favorite years at wyeth diet drug litigation started in and by it was very intense here we had to be extremely hard nosed extremely disciplined and watch every resource that we had i think that ironically out of the mess of the diet drugs came a way of thinking and acting that has allowed us to do as well as were doing right now wsj why are drug prices such a sore point around the world mr essner the pharmaceutical industry is becoming kind of a normal industry with normal rules its now worthwhile for customers to think about our prices in the past we were such a small percentage of budgets and the costs of drugs were so low that people didnt worry about them outside the u s weve unfortunately gotten into this sort of government utility model where companies are more and more subject to government whims when it comes to pricing wsj how do you cope with that pressure mr essner the best response is your product discovery and development strategy we know certain types of drugs give us a lot more control over pricing than others we have not done a lot of the next generation drugs in a given therapeutic category the so called me toos which are the most vulnerable to price pressure we are willing sometimes with some products to say we wont launch unless we can achieve what we feel is a fair price we can afford to be patient believing that the power of our products is such that eventually the governments will want them and will negotiate more reasonable prices with us wsj would that include enbrel the rheumatoid arthritis drug you market with amgen inc or prevnar your vaccine against meningitis and related infections mr essner weve launched almost everywhere now but in many markets we didnt launch enbrel for several years the same with prevnar were just now finally seeing prevnar not just being approved but being priced everywhere in a way that again allows us to tell our customers all over the world that everybody is getting about the same fair price these days due to currency fluctuation the price outside the u s is sometimes higher than it is in the u s for those drugs wsj the tactics drug makers use to sell to doctors are getting a fresh look you cut your sales force in the u s in and other companies including pfizer inc seem headed down the same road whats your approach to sales mr essner whats important is the relationship we have with a doctor and a doctors office having four or five reps and in the case of other companies sometimes more all trying to get to see doctors is making them more and more resentful of the intrusion theyre actually building defense mechanisms to keep reps out we believed that we could let the number of contacts between one of our reps and a doctor go down and see our prescriptions go up for more than a year now weve implemented that nationally most doctors have a unique wyeth rep other wyeth reps dont see those doctors we redefined the relationship with the customer and made a big deal out of the fact that weve heard them our top line growth prescriptions and market share are all going in the right direction our costs are going down wsj another kind of selling using direct to consumer or dtc advertising has come under fire in recent years whats your view mr essner im a believer in dtc i think its important for consumers theres a real war of information thats going on today and i think were in an environment where payers and the government would frankly love to be as in the old days the only ones who knew what the options were there are some products in our product line for which advertising makes sense for a lot of drugs trying to reach one half of of the population massive television advertising is really not all that efficient so weve used it but judiciously and carefully wsj doctors say they should be the ones to talk about drugs with patients some families say they dont want to see tv ads for impotence drugs during dinner how do you respond to complaints about the intrusiveness of the ads mr essner im on board with that i was one of the strong advocates within the industry for a change in tone for a lot of these ads particularly erectile dysfunction ads i thought they were inappropriate for medicines for the seriousness of what we do and were sending the wrong image about drugs and drug companies wsj drug research and development has never cost more but the work is less fruitful than ever whats the problem mr essner weve plowed through a lot of important diseases now and found what was easy to find the industry used to brag that it cost &# million to develop a new drug it was almost a flag that you waved "do you know how much money we spend to develop a new drug " later it was &# billion then &# billion which i think is a pretty accurate number today we dont want to brag about that we want to fix that some companies in the past have said "well do great science and as night follows day good products will come " and we know thats wrong you can do great science forever and never get drugs out of it other companies have tended to be very process oriented you build a machine and that research machine like a factory will spit out new drugs and in a pretty predictable way we know thats exaggerated too wsj so whats wyeths approach mr essner weve tried to find the middle ground between great science and rigorous process we look very sharply at ways of reducing cost and improving efficiency on the development side and constantly improving the quality of science on the discovery side our tests for a new drug are is it innovative does it help enough people that you can envision a commercial market answer those two questions yes and we want to keep it going wsj how have you dealt with the litigation over diet drugs mr essner we walled it off organizationally we created a team of people who did almost nothing but diet drugs and as much as possible we let the rest of the company do business we also walled it off financially we said were going to do everything within our power to avoid borrowing a dime from r&amp d or business or capital investment or manufacturing plants to fund diet drugs well find other ways of doing that and we were able to we eventually knew we would get through the diet drug issue but we also knew that if we were a weak company that had been starved and drained that it wouldnt have been worth it it is no longer an issue that i think threatens the company it has become manageable wsj in the late s when the company was still called american home products there were at least two serious attempts to merge with other drug makers was it for the best that nothing came of that mr essner those were different times we didnt know about prevnar we didnt have enbrel a lot of whats given our business strength has occurred since then scale is not an asset in todays environment extreme scale scale that companies havent learned to deal with is something of a handicap its a skill based industry and our focus is on trying to develop our skills being no in the industry in size just doesnt really matter wsj how do you describe your management style mr essner i like to surround myself with people who are different from me in terms of background and personality i think ive done that here i like to let them mix it up when it comes to key decisions and then im perfectly willing to make a decision its not a democracy but it is a place where everyone has got their voice and uses it freely wsj what does your training as a historian and experience as an executive tell you about the state of the drug industry mr essner no company has ever been no in this industry two decades in a row or two decades ever in most industries theres some movement but not the kind of rise and fall that you see in this industry one problem is this sense of entitlement believing that youve kind of got it figured out but all it is is that the guy before you was pretty good at discovering a few brilliant drugs how do you become great and not become complacent not become comfortable not become arrogant not think that youre entitled to success wsj whats your prescription for wyeth mr essner to love good solid change but not to love novelty loving change for the sake of change is an error you can get into thats destructive mr hensley is a news editor for the wall street journal in new york he can be reached at scott hensley wsj com
