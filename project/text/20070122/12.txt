boss talk a special report flying high how the ceo of brazils leading airline plans to deal with a low cost rival and a shortage of controllers once upon a time air passengers descending into rio de janeiros cloud wreathed beauty were most likely flying varig brazils storied flagship carrier today theyre probably flying tam tam linhas aereas first seized the mantle of brazils leading domestic carrier in on the strength of its local service last year the company became brazils top international carrier as well after viacao aerea rio grandense sa or varig saddled by debt filed for bankruptcy and canceled flights because it couldnt pay for jet fuel tams flashiest push is on international routes its been adding flights to new york paris and milan and markets have taken noticed tams stock is up more than since its march ipo on the new york stock exchange and with a fleet nearing planes tam is latin americas largest buyer of airbus jets and its largest airline overall domestically tam is riding an air travel boom only a fraction of brazils million citizens fly but thanks to government economic reforms the numbers are growing passenger miles covered rose in in and last year the news is mostly good for tam but there are risks the company is outgrowing its roots in brazils heartlands to become a signature international carrier as it does so it must fend off a challenge from budget carrier gol linhas aereas inteligentes leadership is also a question tams visionary and beloved founder cmdr rolim amaro died in in a helicopter accident he left behind not only a list of folksy management mottos no "if you dont have your own ideas have the courage to copy" but also a widow and three children who still own a controlling stake in the airline the past year also brought a stark reminder to investors that brazils misfortunes and missteps are also tams following a midair crash over the amazon in september that claimed lives on a gol airliner brazils air sector quickly plunged into chaos work slowdowns by short staffed air traffic controllers and finger pointing by government officials are still causing major delays for travelers the wall street journal interviewed tams nuts and bolts oriented ceo marco antonio bologna the companys former chief finance officer in his office overlooking a busy jetway at sao paulos domestic airport here are excerpts the wall street journal do most brazilians have the money to fly mr bologna no this is the opportunity one of the important factors why the airline grew double digits during the last three years is that deflation is creating a wage increase in real terms credit availability also increased a lot brazil has to grow and it will continue to grow if you have a lot of people who can afford an airline and that can double here easily the forecast is very interesting wsj there was a boom in cellphone use in brazil are airlines next mr bologna if you look at the research the first thing brazilians want to do if they have money is to have a better meal the second thing when they have a better meal at home is to have a cellular phone and the third thing is to travel flying its interesting its magic wsj did tam set out to become latin americas biggest airline mr bologna that was the goal tam is celebrating its th anniversary the founder in wrote a lot about the mission vision and commandments of the company the mission was to be the largest and most profitable airline in the entire world we as professional management are pushing to be the largest in the region wsj your share of passengers flying internationally on brazilian carriers leapt from to last year is that because of tams growth or varigs problems mr bologna both the long haul system has been based on bilateral agreements between the countries so the international carriers generate their passengers and we generate ours it used to be with the decline of varig the percentage moved to for international airlines like american airlines and for brazilian airlines but tam is keeping the majority of that we have around of that wsj youve been adding international flights quickly is there a danger of becoming the company you are displacing mr bologna its not a threat its an opportunity for us our approach in international flights is very careful we understand that we are competing with big dogs but we have an advantage of selling to brazilians people like to fly on their flag carrier and were offering a good product wsj domestically youre in competition with gol a new budget airline whats tams strategy mr bologna we are flying on the same battlefield but our costs are to higher than gols on available seating miles we believe that we can collect this from passengers the characteristic of the brazilian market is that is business travelers and is leisure they are paying a maximum of higher to have better service better punctuality more direct flights more comfort aboard in flight entertainment and loyalty programs gols only proposition is price the companies share about of the market its for us and for gol wsj do you risk losing domestic market share in your bid for international routes mr bologna you have to have a strong domestic network to feed your international flights so the big asset that we have is our domestic south american network we are flying from brazilian cities with a lot of frequency and a lot of direct flights we have seven flights per week to buenos aires that gives us the conditions to move for the long haul its our model wsj following the gol accident on sept brazils airspace has been plunged into chaos what happened mr bologna this was a very low probability accident two aircraft colliding in the air but the accident happened in the main control center in the country in brasilia which actually controls of the traffic in south america because of the accident controllers had to be off their consoles in order to be part of the investigation and the system didnt have backup for this so they had to increase differences between flights from two to three minutes to to minutes that created big delays in the airports in some cases to hours its a big mess wsj what effects are the delays having on tam mr bologna instead of flying each plane hours a day we may fly less this is the main concern if you see the research covering our shares this in our view is a temporary problem because now the problem is clear the government released a provisory measure to hire new controllers we do need investment in equipment but i would say its not a big deal around &# million the main problem we are talking about is people its not easy to graduate controllers its going to take at least six months to graduate new ones we are going to have some hot times on the high seas until then wsj you recently called for an end to military command of air traffic control in brazil why mr bologna the decision of military or not military is a government decision there are pros and cons on both sides i think its easiest to do on the civil side but its just a question of a decision and the government has to decide not the industry but we are begging please decide as soon as possible wsj tam is owned by the family of cmdr rolim amaro how much of your job is to make the family happy mr bologna i would like to have all the investors happy and the way to have your investors happy is to deliver results this is the first thing both for the family for funds and for individual investors the family likes governance and they are committed to governance three of them are on the board along with five independent directors so the family can participate in decisions but they want to keep the company run by professionals the widow of cmdr rolim saw all the history since the beginning and the kids were fed i would say on kerosene so they understand the business they like the business and they support our management mr regalado is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in sao paulo he can be reached at antonio regalado wsj com
