the evening wrap pfizers bloodletting pfizer will become a smaller company by cutting thousands of jobs and closing some of its manufacturing and research facilities but its not clear that losing weight will make the industry bellwether a more nimble competitor the hulking pharmaceutical company told investors and analysts that it would slash jobs or a tenth of its work force draw the shutters closed at three research sites and two manufacturing facilities in the u s and consider the sale or closure of assets overseas pfizer also said it plans to tighten up its research and developments operations which some analysts have complained are short on potential new blockbusters and long on inefficiency "pfizer must transform the way weve done business in the past in order to be successful in the future " said jeffrey kindler who became chief executive last year his predecessor henry mckinnell fell into disfavor with shareholders for carting away a generous compensation package as the companys share price languished the company said in november that it would cull its sales ranks by positions but then just a few weeks down the road pfizer was forced to pull the plug on a once promising cholesterol drug amid safety worries creating the need to find another way to cushion pfizer from an onrush of generic competition pfizer is already feeling an acute impact from generic challengers as its fourth quarter earnings results made abundantly clear to be sure pfizers bottom line was fattened more than three times over during the years final period by the sale of its consumer unit which markets listerine mouthwash and other products to johnson &amp johnson but by pfizers own preferred gauge adjusted earnings profits fell sales of the blockbuster antidepressant zoloft which lost its patent shield last year dropped in the quarter but even more troubling to many on wall street was the fact that sales of cholesterol fighter lipitor the top selling drug in the world missed the companys targets lipitor isnt due to lose patent protection for another few years but generic versions of a rival drug marketed by merck called zocor which recently lost its own patent protection have quickly chipped away at lipitor demand bear stearns analysts wrote that generic zocor prices are cratering which may make it increasingly hard for health plans to justify keeping patients on lipitor when less costly alternatives are available such headwinds will only grow in the years ahead pfizer hoped that it had another blockbuster on its hands with torcetrapib a drug that would boost good cholesterol and that lipitor sales could be propped up by marketing the drugs as a powerful cholesterol conquering combination but then a review found more deaths in heart disease patients taking the new drug than in patients not taking it and the drug was abandoned pfizer clearly hopes to avoid costly detours such as that in the future and mr kindler believes that shrinking his company will make it a better more efficient producer of new medicines but some analysts are skeptical miller tabaks les funtleyder told the associated press that "you cant cost cut your way to prosperity " at least some investors seemed to agree pfizer stock fell slightly in new york stock exchange trade boeing downgrade hurts blue chips wachovia downgraded boeing on concern that the

established beyond a reasonable doubt not merely by a preponderance of the evidence " justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote for the court several justices suggested during oral argument in october that
