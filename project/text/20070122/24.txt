the persistent rise in costs employer efforts to shift more of the burden to workers and the aging of the baby boomer generation still the odds of major legislation in the current congress appear long and health care is likely to be a point of contention in the presidential race the treasury department estimates that the change would prompt a net increase of five million in the number of americans with health insurance and administration officials are hopeful the effect will be even larger in his weekly radio address mr bush said his plan is "designed to help make basic private health insurance more affordable whether you get it through your job or on your own " over years the plan would have no cost to the government according to a person close to the administration but details werent

and predicted it would help turn the focus of the health care debate further toward reform of the private insurance market and away from creating or expanding government run health care programs "this really changes the conversation " said grace marie turner president of the conservative galen institute "people understand tax deductions " but several said the administration will have to do more to help the poorest of the uninsured mr bush hinted in his saturday radio address that he will have another initiative aimed at encouraging states to create insurance pools for lower income people

of insurance and worry the white house proposal would undermine it unions and many large employers will worry about the long term effect particularly if it encourages younger healthier workers to drop out of workplace plans and buy cheaper insurance themselves if mr bushs plan isnt dead on arrival to congress "i think its going to be wounded on arrival " said ron pollack executive director of

contributes to overspending and inflation in the sector conservative economists say the change would touch off intense competition in the insurance marketplace and thereby help hold down prices while also giving consumers more incentive to buy high deductible coverage and become smarter shoppers
