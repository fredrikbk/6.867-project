mail here amid bullish stock markets and generally positive outlooks for industrial economies have global investors and policy makers become too complacent ahead of the annual world economic forum gabfest in davos switzerland a lot of serious thinkers worry that investors and executives across the spectrum of officialdom are over minimizing a broad array of risks "its worth remembering that markets were very upbeat in the early summer of " former u s treasury secretary and harvard president lawrence summers tells bloomberg while mr summers isnt suggesting another world war is on its way he and the likes of european central bank president jean claude trichet plan to tell business and political vips at davos that theyre underestimating the risks of everything from trade imbalances to terrorism the wefs report on the global risk landscape produced with the help of businesses ngos think tanks and governments argues that there is a fundamental disconnect right now between risk and mitigation while experts suggest risk levels in the past year were rising across the areas the group studies "mechanisms in place to manage and mitigate risk at the level of businesses governments and global governance are inadequate " it says it cites "tactical gains" that include increased cooperation against terrorism an upgrade of world wide epidemic preparedness in response to bird flu fears and growing recognition of the need for new ways to share the risks of emerging markets but it warns "the tactical gains may be illusory and are certainly temporary " bloomberg points out several measures of risk perception that show it to be at historic lows the yield gap between emerging market investments and u s treasury bonds narrowed to a record last week the total amount of debt used to pay for buyouts in europe climbed to times earnings in the third quarter of last year the most ever and u s hedge funds are more leveraged than they have been at any time since when long term capital management collapsed "current risks are ludicrously underpriced " willem buiter a former member of the bank of englands monetary policy committee tells the news service "at some point someone is going to get an extremely nasty surprise " reverberating investment decisions crucial to businesses ability to deal with such risk is recognition of the interdependency of various risk areas and there are plenty of real world examples that illustrate this interconnectedness take for instance the interplay between china oil markets bonds and the u s dollar which has been steadily losing value over the last couple years the dollars weakness is partly to blame for why opec and central banks from china to romania have been saying they want to reduce their reliance on dollar denominated assets now at a time when oil prices are also falling opec nations have begun to dump u s treasury bonds at what bloomberg describes as the fastest pace in more than three years oil producers now overshadow asian central banks as the biggest pool of global savings bloomberg notes and since late they had increased their stash of treasurys by to &# billion according to u s government data but in the past three months indonesia saudi arabia and venezuela sold &# billion of their u s bond holdings china too seems on the verge of redistributing some large foreign holdings china now has the largest cache of foreign reserves and premier wen jiabao said over the weekend that the country plans to diversify those holdings which include a lot of dollars and a lot of treasurys the financial times says this could mean a rise in investments in foreign securities or the purchase of more foreign technology and raw materials the pursuit of more oil has already become a key factor in chinese foreign policy the wall street journal suggests that the reserves decision "could fuel uncertainty about the dollar but is unlikely to result in any immediate selling of the u s currency by the worlds fourth biggest economy " and that fortification of chinas financial sector may be what beijing has in mind health care reform rides again however intractable health care reform may have proven in washington it dominated voter concerns for a generation of election cycles until made national security by far the biggest tug on americans heartstrings so it may be a sign of diminished or perhaps stabilized terrorism worries that health coverage now looms as perhaps the biggest non iraq issue ahead of the vote in a plurality of americans considers the cost of health care their biggest economic concern according to a new wall street journal nbc survey while the associated press says its latest poll found "americans rated health care the economy and iraq and terrorism the issues they care about most " its no surprise then that president bush with record low approval levels largely due to iraq has picked health care as one of the headline issues for his state of the union address tomorrow night mr bush said in his weekly radio address that he will propose changes to the way insurance payments are taxed and white house officials tell the journal he will seek to extend the tax deductibility currently enjoyed by workers in employer sponsored programs to people who buy their insurance outside the workplace but to pay for it workers employer provided insurance benefits would be counted as taxable income the journal notes "the odds of major legislation in the current congress appear long" during a politically contentious election cycle and at a time when the federal budget is already stretched but that doesnt mean you wont hear an awful lot about the issue sen hillary clintons first public appearance after announcing her presidential candidacy over the internet on saturday took place at a manhattan community health clinic where she too proposed new health care legislation as the washington post reports ms clinton wants to renew the childrens health insurance program "which provides money to states to cover americans under age whose families earn too much money to qualify for medicaid " as the new york times explains the tottering magazine auto industry axis the main
