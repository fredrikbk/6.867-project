politics &amp economics in china posturing stalls usual politics leaders seek support to secure positions for next five years delay risky economic moves beijing there are no television ads or campaign fund raisers but chinas political season is in full swing as the ruling communist party elite prepares for a secretive meeting late this year that will largely determine the policies governing the worlds most populous nation for at least the next five years a date for the national congress of the communist party as the gathering is called hasnt been publicly announced but is expected around november the jockeying ahead of the event already is complicating chinas political climate leading lobbyists and deal makers to shift strategies and accept that it may be harder to get some things done this year some foreign businesses are beginning to find that getting crucial government approvals for investments acquisitions or licenses is slower and more difficult as chinas officialdom becomes more cautious that is likely to be especially true for deals in areas that the government worries are contributing to economic excesses notably real estate "its not the time to rock any boat " said matthew mcconkey an attorney with law firm dla piper in beijing "people are holding their breath a little bit and dont want to do something now and find out later that it was the wrong thing to do " the increasingly circumspect approach of the people who run the government is a reminder of the consensus driven nature of decision making in chinas authoritarian system chinese officials arent directly accountable to the general public but they must nonetheless cultivate support among other officials to ensure their survival much like politicians seeking re election they are now looking to reassure their supporters and avoid unnecessary risks and damaging mistakes held once every five years the party congress is a venue for the or so most powerful people in china to articulate their priorities and decide who among them deserves advancement or demotion the last congress in november was a historic event as current top leader hu jintao succeeded jiang zemin in the countrys most powerful post general secretary of the communist party mr hu also holds the positions of state president and commander in chief of the armed forces the peaceful and orderly transfer of power to mr hu was a landmark for china after the upheaval and violence that had accompanied top level power struggles in earlier decades nothing so exciting is expected from this years congress as mr hu premier wen jiabao and the rest of chinas current collective leadership face no challenge to their stewardship of the country their positions arent likely to change until the following meeting in by then term limits mean mr hu wont be able to serve another five year term as president though there is no similar hard rule governing his leadership of the ruling party he also will be turning that year and other senior leaders have set a strong precedent by retiring around that age that means beijings tea leaf readers will be watching this years politicking for any signs of who emerges as an eventual successor to mr hu and how he is positioning his allies for continued influence there is little to guide them in this process mr hu himself was tapped early on by former paramount leader deng xiaoping but no single individual on the political scene today commands the authority that the late mr deng did "hu jintao and wen jiabao have been consolidating their power and they are certainly trying to appoint their own people to important positions " said joseph cheng a political scientist at city university of hong kong their policy agenda which has put more focus on alleviating poverty and less on supporting the wealthier coastal provinces is gaining momentum and "people are ready to jump on their bandwagon " he said reshuffling at the top also has repercussions down the ranks for the leaders of local governments and administrative agencies and of major state owned enterprises whose leaders also are chosen by the communist party for them the stakes are significant successful chief executives have been promoted to provincial governorships or other high ranking offices conversely some who have fallen from favor have been forced out the corruption investigations that last year ensnared the top party official in shanghai and several local executives were widely interpreted as a demonstration of mr hus ability to sideline a political rival and rein in a locality that hadnt respected central government dictates yet it is difficult to draw a simple conclusion on how political pressures will affect these companies and they may not become more conservative across the board for instance china national offshore oil corp parent of the hong kong listed cnooc ltd which failed to buy unocal of the u s two years ago has had disappointing production figures this year some analysts argue that may motivate the companys head to make a splashy expensive purchase of an overseas oil field to boost the numbers and his own prospects the political positioning doesnt mean the governments day to day work is grinding to a halt there is an ambitious legislative agenda for this year including proposed antitrust property rights and labor laws the administration also is pursuing overhauls in the financial sector following the restructuring of major state banks in recent years after discussing policies at another important conclave of officials over the weekend indeed the party congress gives officials a rare chance to get the ultimate high level endorsement of their pet projects and policies by having them written into its authoritative documents that is concentrating minds on domestic priorities and internal positioning for outsiders seeking to influence china this may not be a great time to be asking for favors many analysts said treasury secretary henry paulsons visit to beijing last month when he asked china to let its currency strengthen faster and open its markets further to u s goods came at a time when his chinese hosts werent in a good position to deliver policy changes "the political calendar tells people to pay more attention looking like youre giving major concessions to foreigners isnt the best way to demonstrate your bona fides " said scott kennedy a professor at indiana university and author of a book on lobbying in china to get things done businesspeople and diplomats may have to shift their style he said "what the political climate does do is intensify the notion that to lobby successfully in the chinese environment you must present a win win package to the government you must show that what you want them to do is also in the countrys best interests " mr kennedy said shai oster contributed to this article power structure key elements of the current organization of chinas communist party maneuvering has begun in anticipation of its congress later this year general secretary hu jintao chinas most powerful figure he controls the partys day to day administrative body and leads other key party groups like the central military commission but his power also depends on the cooperation of other officials politburo standing committee members the partys equivalent of a board of directors where policy decisions are set by consensus of the members political bureau or politburo of the central committee full members alternate along with the standing committee the partys most important group members meet often in secret to work out national policy lobbying for membership is intense central committee full members alternates generally meets yearly to discuss and approve policies set by the senior leadership members include top officials from central government ministries the military and provincial governments approves membership of the polituro and its standing committee national congress delegates meets every five years with delegates elected by regional party groups an important symbol of party unity it approves candidates proposed by the party leadership for the central committee source wsj
