politics &amp economics iraq tinges clinton mccain war stances may affect front runners electability washington new york sen hillary clintons official entry into the presidential race which she begins far out in front of a growing democratic pack doesnt just rattle the rivals in her own party it also is underscoring new doubts among republicans about how formidable their own front runner arizona sen john mccain might be against the woman they most love to hate the vulnerabilities of both front runners start above all with their stances on the increasingly unpopular war in iraq as mrs clintons weekend announcement of her candidacy made clear they are responding to that issue in opposite ways mrs clinton has long been suspect among liberal democratic activists for her vote approving president bushs use of force in iraq and then for declining to disavow it saturday she showed that she has changed course in her online announcement of her candidacy she trumpeted a plan she has presented to block mr bushs proposed increase in u s troop strength the announcement timed to get a jump on the presidents state of the union address tomorrow night seemed designed to address her main problem with her partys base though it could feed a sense that she is too cautious and calculating by contrast mr mccain continues to be the most prominent supporter of the war the president and a military buildup that remains a popular stand among republican voters polls show but it has been eroding his popularity with the general public which over time has admired his independence but now overwhelmingly opposes the war a new wall street journal nbc news poll conducted jan shows americans by to say mr bush shouldnt go ahead with his proposed troop "surge" if congress passes a nonbinding resolution against it further mccain slippage in the polls in turn would undercut his top selling point among republican voters long suspicious of his maverick ways and his past criticism of christian conservative leaders the belief that mr mccain is the republican who is best able to beat their nemesis mrs clinton a number of republican leaders privately have been making that case within the party among them former party chairman haley barbour now mississippis governor and mississippi sen trent lott the second ranking senate republican leader as the mood about the war worsens skepticism about mr mccains national appeal is building one pro mccain republican lobbyist says not only voters are at stake but also the donors he needs "the war is really hurting mccain with the finance types " predictably supporters for other republican aspirants among them former new york mayor rudy giuliani former govs mitt romney of massachusetts and mike huckabee of arkansas and kansas sen sam brownback who also announced his candidacy over the weekend are fanning the questions about mr mccain as a sign of the reassessments several republicans pointed to last weeks news that prominent national strategist and former minnesota rep vin weber one of mr mccains earliest supporters in against then gov george bush has become mr romneys policy chairman mr weber in an interview declined to address mr mccains war woes but anticipating that democrats will choose mrs clinton he said "republicans are increasingly beginning to see that if democrats are going to nominate the consummate insider perhaps that gives us our ultimate opening a face from outside washington maybe its romney maybe its giuliani maybe its huckabee i think its romney but nobodys made the sale yet its still early " for its part the mccain campaign argues the senator remains formidable judging both by polls and republican endorsements in states with early nominating contests advisers cite the recent "battleground poll" conducted by bipartisan pollsters for george washington university which suggested mr mccain could beat mrs clinton by points so could mr giuliani according to the poll though his liberal social stances lead many republicans to conclude he cant win their nomination echoing mr mccains recent remark that he would rather lose an election than a war his backers also suggest he will get points for principled consistency on the war where others not least mrs clinton have shifted "john mccain is doing what he believes is right for our troops and for our country " mccain spokesman danny diaz said yesterday "this is a principled individual who is committed to seeing us achieve victory in iraq and winning the war on terror " both mrs clinton and mr mccain face questions about their electability as evidenced by the expanding field of competitors in both parties mr brownback a favorite of social issue conservatives who opposes the troop increase entered the republican contest saturday with a more traditional political rally of family and supporters in topeka yesterday new mexico gov bill richardson a former congressman and in bill clintons administration both united nations ambassador and energy secretary joined the democratic fray with a web announcement mrs clintons emerging high profile as the democratic led congress moves to stop a troop increase and perhaps even seek to bring troops home is likely to help her with party voters moreover most democratic contenders originally supported the war with exceptions such as illinois sen barack obama and ohio rep dennis kucinich still her shift underscores what even some supporters say is a vulnerability a sense that her political calculations leave people uncertain where she stands this sentiment was captured hours after her announcement in the opening comedy skit on televisions "saturday night live " the clinton character says that for every one point increase in mr obamas popularity more troops would come home if he craters "the troops can stay in iraq " the clinton camp hit the electability argument head on in its opening volley on the new campaign web site pollster and chief strategist mark penn opened his "campaign memo" with the question "people are always asking can hillary clinton win the presidency of course she can " he cited her election in new york and her landslide re election in november with increased support from traditionally republican areas to arguments that she is a divisive figure mr penn cited recent polls showing an increase in the number of americans who view mrs clinton favorably while many democrats worry that she is unpopular among white men mr penn wrote that "women constitute a huge x factor in this upcoming election" since more than of voters will be women and younger voters especially "believe it is about time this country had its first woman president " hats in the ring a year before the first primary votes are cast the presidential field is growing fast
