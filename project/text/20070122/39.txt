for some manufacturers there are benefits to keeping production at home new york it has long been an axiom that u s made consumer goods such as tv sets and kitchen appliances cant compete in a world where cheaper labor can be found elsewhere like many axioms though it isnt entirely true recent data from the federal reserve contained some surprises for anyone who thought u s companies dont make things for american consumers anymore in its monthly update on factory output the fed reported that u s production of audio and video equipment surged about in december and was up for all of that is a significant change from several years ago when the numbers were negative as u s production moved overseas even output of appliances though down for popped in december the shift doesnt necessarily represent a renaissance more likely it reflects the fact that much of what can go abroad already has leaving behind what can and should be made in the u s one area of strength high end goods like top of the line &# sony grand wega tv sets and &# sub zero pro refrigerators which appeal to the affluent folks who have been driving much of the growth in u s consumer spending "its the very high end products " says daniel meckstroth chief economist at manufacturers alliance a trade group "manufacturers who have niche markets in high end products have a very good outlook " such manufacturers account for only a tiny fraction of u s output and employment still the numbers illustrate an important point about the physical and strategic limits of globalization in just about any possible future there will always be some business that is better done close to the customer the obvious examples are home building and services such as restaurants but the logic also can apply to certain types of manufacturing "if the thing being sold to the u s market is locally customized delicate or very large chances are itll continue to be produced in the u s " says bruce greenwald professor of business and economics at columbia university in new york the same he says is true "if the manufacturing process itself involves almost no labor like medical testing or like some very automated electronic component manufacturing plants chemical plants and metal fabricating plants " the dominant trend for the past couple decades of course has been the exodus of manufacturing from the u s to lower cost locales such as china just about anything that can be mass produced and shipped is made abroad and imported to the u s or soon will be imports account for about of all the audio and video equipment sold in the u s of household appliances and of computers according to mr meckstroth chief economist at manufacturers alliance a trade group as a result manufacturing has been declining as a share of the economy in manufacturing accounted for about of u s gross domestic product a broad measure of economic activity that is down from about in more recently slumps in the housing and auto sectors have sparked a drop in overall production as companies worked off unsold stockpiles of things such as furniture and auto parts in the fourth quarter of u s industrial production fell at an annualized rate of many manufacturers though have managed to keep busy aside from producers of computers and business equipment which logged double digit growth in as companies made investments aimed at boosting efficiency the fortunate ones include makers of consumer electronics and appliances that have set up shop in places typically associated with industrial decline take for example sony corp of japan which makes its grand wega high definition tv sets at a factory near pittsburgh a city better known for mothballed steel mills the tv sets employ cutting edge technology and tend to be large with screens ranging from to inches their size and the sensitivity of their electronics make proximity to the consumer a meaningful advantage as does the ability to react quickly to changes in tastes for high end equipment "it is important for us to produce these sets close to most of our customers " says stan glasgow president and chief operating officer of sony electronics inc a sony unit that also assembles customized vaio computers in san diego proximity "gives us a distinct advantage with our retail partners across the country as we have the ability to quickly fill the channel with specific products " over in madison wis sub zero freezer co makes a different kind of large and expensive product high end refrigerators and wolf brand stoves michele bedard vice president of marketing says the closely held company posted double digit growth in despite the slump in the u s housing market a fact she attributes to people choosing to invest in renovations rather than selling their homes in a soft market sub zero is in the process of expanding its production space almost to about million square feet ms bedard says sub zero prefers to manufacture locally because it can better manage the process and make changes to models on short notice "the pros of being in wisconsin outweigh the pros of moving overseas " she says "we can be very nimble and just be master of our own destiny " more u s produced tv sets and refrigerators though probably wont translate into more jobs in the u s audio and video manufacturing for example accounts for only about american jobs and the number hasnt grown along with production despite its plans to increase capacity sub zero isnt planning to add to its person work force across the manufacturing sector the picture is similar to stay competitive companies are doing everything they can to boost productivity that is make more stuff with fewer people "manufacturing in the u s is headed toward plants that have no people in them " prof greenwald says that is bad news for factory workers who must retrain or be cast aside it could be better for the u s economy as a whole the more the u s can produce for each hour worked the wealthier the average american becomes if for example output per hour rises an annual rate of the average inflation adjusted wage will more than triple over years "manufacturing is contributing to the welfare of the economy in terms of standard of living but its not generating net new jobs " says mr meckstroth "the electronics sector is one of the areas where thats most visible " see related letter "letters to the editor manufacturing shows no long term decline" wsj january
