virginias republican hams virginia was once a solidly conservative republican state but in recent years it has tilted democratic a big reason for the shift is the gops recent love affair with higher taxes in the s republican governors george allen and jim gilmore won sweeping victories running as tax cutters then in richmond republicans enacted the largest tax increase in the commonwealths history a &# billion hike in sales and tobacco taxes now they are flirting with another tax hike even though the state has a blue ridge mountain high &# million budget surplus why the hot political issue in northern virginia is traffic congestion though the state budget has doubled in years road building hasnt kept pace with population "not a penny of the tax increase went to fund the states highest need roads " fumes gop state senator ken cucinelli the republican plan would spend &# billion more for roads and cost inefficient transit programs and pay for it through borrowing raising taxes and fees on cars and trucks and giving local governments authority to raise their assessments to be fair these are nickel and dime fees compared to the &# million in new taxes that democratic governor tim kaine is seeking democrats in the legislature who pretend they want to fix the traffic problem are cynically obstructing any solution so that republicans take a fall but if the gop raises taxes yet again mr kaine is let off the hook and republicans forfeit their brand identity as the anti tax party only years ago the virginia gop was riding high after jim gilmore was elected governor on a wildly popular message "end the car tax " now the virginia republicans want to raise car taxes have they learned nothing from the partys implosion in washington see related letter "letters to the editor three card monte with virginia taxes" wsj jan
