milton friedman rest in july last year the late milton friedman nobel laureate in economics in granted an interview to the wall street journal today we publish material from a question and answer exchange he had by email shortly after their meeting with his interviewer tunku varadarajan the journals editorial features editor should china float the yuan milton friedman yes pegging the chinese currency to the u s dollar requires that chinafollow a policy which over time yields an inflation rate that is compatible with though not necessarily equal to the u s inflation rate when that is not the case maintaining the peg will require control over foreign exchange transactions both current and capital but chinas future depends on their eliminating such exchange controls on their opening the market as much as they can and as having essentially a free price system hence it is in their own interest to move to institutions which enable them to have as free a market as possible both internally and externally if they do insist on pegging the yuan they will sooner or later run into a situation in which they are either accumulating an excessive amount of u s dollars or they are in debt for an excessive amount of u s dollars and they will have a foreign exchange crisis far better to have a floating exchange rate and let the market do the adjusting that is necessary to render developments in china economically compatible with those in the rest of the world are you still a strong supporter of flexible exchange rates even for developing countries friedman yes economic forces affecting different countries are not always the same the right exchange rate for a country in general may be one thing one time and another thing another time a country that pegs the exchange rate is essentially committing itself to adopt the economic policies of the country whose currency it is pegged to if it does that by pegging the exchange rate it will always be under pressure as circumstances change to take advantage of the pegged exchange rate when they can and get into a position which is untenable the case of argentina is the most dramatic and clearest case about that either a country should explicitly become part of the economic system of another country as it could by dollarizing its currency as panama has done or else it seems to me it is best off by allowing the market to determine the value of its currency and in that way adjust to changes in the relative economic pressures on different countries but flexible exchange rates are not a panacea for all evils governments can follow bad economic policies with either flexible or fixed exchange rates do you still think it would be a good idea to have a computer run monetary policy friedman yes of course it depends very much on how the computer is programmed i am not saying that any computer program would do in speaking of that i have had in mind the idea that a computer would produce for example a constant rate of growth in the quantity of money as defined let us say by m something like to per year there are certainly occasions in which discretionary changes in policy guided by a wise and talented manager of monetary policy would do better than the fixed rate but they would be rare in any event the computer program would certainly prevent any major disasters either way any major inflation or any major depressions one of the great defects of our kind of monetary system is that its performance depends so much on the quality of the people who are put in charge we have seen that in the history of our own federal reserve system surely a computer would have produced far better results during the s and during both world wars that raises a question about the desirability of our present monetary system it is one in which a group of unelected people have enormous power power which can lead to a great depression or which can lead to a great inflation is it wise to have that power in those hands an alternative would be to eliminate the federal reserve system to reduce the monetary activities of the federal government to the provision of high powered money that is currency and bank reserves and to constitutionalize as it were what is to be done with high powered money my preference is simply to hold it constant and let financial developments produce the growth in the quantity of money in the form of bank deposits a process that has been going on for many decades but that is of course politically impossible do tax cuts pay for themselves friedman occasionally but revenue loss is almost always less than static prediction do you have any favorite candidates for president in friedman no is inflation targeting the right medicine for monetary policy if so how would you do it friedman it is a good medicine with the present institutions and recent experience suggests that it is doable targeting central banks have been able to hit their targets basic way to do it is to keep quantity of money growing at a rate equal to target plus trend rate of real growth full discussion beyond the scope of email what is the biggest risk to the world economy americas deficits energy insecurity environment terrorism none of the above friedman islamofascism with terrorism as its weapon what are your thoughts on the low u s savings rate friedman the right saving rate is whatever satisfies the tastes and preferences of the public in a free and unbiased capital market market can adjust to any rate this is a very complicated question present estimates probably understate actual savings because of treatment of capital gains in any event the present situation does not raise any problems for the economy india how do you assess its prospects friedman fifty years ago as a consultant to the indian minister of finance i wrote a memo in which i said that india had a great potential but was stagnating because of collectivist economic policies india has finally started to disband those collectivist policies and is reaping its reward if they can continue dismantling the collectivist policies their prospects are very bright any thoughts on a china versus india comparison friedman yes note the contrast china has maintained political and human collectivism while gradually freeing the economic market this has so far been very successful but is heading for a clash since economic freedom and political collectivism are not compatible india maintained political democracy while running a collectivist economy it is now unwinding the latter which will strengthen freedom of all kinds so in that respect it is in a better position than china milton friedman died on nov age there is a memorial for him today at stanford university
