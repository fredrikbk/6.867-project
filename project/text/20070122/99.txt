thinking strategically as a connoisseur of strategy student practitioner in business and teacher i have long been intrigued with the relationship between strategic principles applied to nations and strategies pursued by businesses strategy had its origin in military use but over time it migrated into the business setting the linkage is still there most contemporary business students for example will have read sun tzus "art of war" in their business strategy course but it is a different relationship that preoccupies me just as medical research tests biological processes in large populations of fruit flies or rodents before human application i am intrigued by the prospect of applying to nations the strategic practices that have been formulated and evaluated in the "laboratory" of the worlds businesses as in medical applications we must be careful in extrapolating from one to the other nevertheless i believe there are benefits to such comparative analysis the first question that needs to be examined is this if businesss task is to generate revenue and profits for its owners what is the equivalent task for a nation and its government the principal measure is the gross domestic product of the country changes in this number are commonly used yardsticks of economic health moreover when one compares two national economies say the economies of the u s and china the first measure we use in this comparison is gdp but when we talk of gdp we must consider not just the gdp of today but the long term stability of the productive capacity of our economy this is how factors like national security enter into the objectives of a government what about governance corporations are run by senior management with power concentrated in the hands of the chief executive the equivalent to this in our country is the institution of the executive branch headed by the president it is important to stress that even as individual presidents come and go we expect the institution to be durable with a view and a constancy of purpose that is appropriately long range a successful business strategist must understand cognitively and instinctively the structure of the industry in which the business operates and must know that as the structure changes so must the winning strategy by way of historical example ibm a huge vertically integrated company dominated the computer industry before the advent of the personal computer all computer companies had to be cognizant of ibms influence on the entire industry and had to construct strategies which allowed them to prosper in coexistence with this monolith the arrival of the personal computer changed all this new rules replaced old ones governing vertical integration development of standards and many other factors after the cold war a similar change took place in the world of nations monolithic and vertically integrated military powers gave way to numerous sources of power each following independent strategies sometimes in partnership sometimes embroiled in friction that changed the rules governing international relations if national strategy in the days of the cold war was dominated by the presence and size of nuclear weapons capabilities what are the critical dominant factors today when these weapons are increasingly widespread what takes their place religious beliefs historical relationships or enmities how does one set strategies when these factors are unknown as in the case of the computer industry it takes many years to figure out how the new rules work an important task of strategic analysis is to determine the sources of power that affect our business if competitors customers or suppliers have undue influence over the behavior of our business we lose control of our destiny to our long term detriment as an example if the control of a scarce ingredient that we need in our business is tightly held by other players can we afford to be indifferent oil is just such a scarce resource its availability determines the growth of a national economy this has concerned every u s president since richard nixon who emphatically devoted a major part of his state of the union message in to the necessity of regaining control over our destiny by achieving independence from foreign oil suppliers what has happened since is illustrated in the nearby chart see accompanying chart wsj jan such charts sometimes referred to as "stagger charts " are often used in business to gauge performance against plan they are an important way in which accountability is evaluated a stagger chart shows a goal set in a given year for the years to follow the actual result obtained along with the new plan is then shown in the next horizontal line looking up and down in a vertical column one can see the consistency or lack of it between the various plans looking at the asterisked numbers along the diagonal shows how our actual energy dependence deteriorated as time went on despite repeated commitments to reverse this trend the most recent addition to this thread of commitments was when president bush in his state of the union address set a new goal to replace more than of our oil imports from the middle east by even if we somehow achieved replacement of all imports by that time when we compare this goal with the one set by president nixon in we see a year slippage in the course of years even though the importance of the energy independence issue has been recognized and emphasized by every president since our vital national objective is vanishing like a mirage in the distance this kind of dependence gives great power to other nations over our destiny it is not inconceivable that our foreign policy could be determined by them using energy availability as a lever if this possibility seemed far fetched a few weeks ago the events involving belarus have brought home its plausibility in a well publicized study of a large number of corporations jim collins has found that longevity of success in the marketplace is associated with a certain leadership style i was particularly impressed by the finding that successful leaders are able to face what mr collins calls the "brutal facts" of the competitive positions of their companies as i observe our political leaders today i have a hard time finding many examples of a willingness to do this in fact i find an alarming tendency to skirt the critical issues by not even pronouncing the words that describe them rendering them "non words " examples who among our national leaders spells out that the likely consequence of the heightened global competition is to suppress domestic wage rates or addresses the need to allocate the increasingly complex and expensive medical procedures being developed today or admits that our emergency medical system is heading toward catastrophe as it becomes the last resort access to medical care for the growing millions of uninsured non words lead to non solutions in energy dependence and in other key issues our nations corporations have been under severe criticism for a variety of shortcomings even so the capitalist free market system of corporations consistently produces results when corporations do not produce they become irrelevant and often perish in other words if the brutal facts are not faced by the leaders the brutal reality sets in by contrast our national strategy setting and execution machinery often seem broken consider this could we pull off the manhattan project today with its complexities of planning and execution under extreme time pressure i doubt it fruit flies can teach us how to cure diseases in human beings why not study how businesses set strategies and execute them and adopt the best methods to address the overwhelmingly important issues facing our society mr grove is retired chairman of intel corp
