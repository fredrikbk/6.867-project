ford toyota see alliance potential executives envision limited tie up sharing of hybrid technology toyota motor corp and ford motor co are sending more signals that they may want to establish deeper ties but the cautious courtship between the two auto giants suggests a more modest and less painful approach than the megamergers of the late s or the three way alliance proposed last year among general motors corp nissan motor co and renault sa speculation that toyota and ford might be edging toward some form of alliance has heated up since a meeting in mid december between ford chief executive alan mulally and toyota chairman fujio cho both companies scrambled to play down the significance of that encounter calling it a mere "courtesy " they stressed the talks produced no specific deals people familiar with the matter say the meeting was prompted by an invitation from toyota sent from toyotas top brass to mr mulally via a visitor to dearborn mich where ford is based in mid october that messenger a friend of former toyota chairman hiroshi okuda met with mark fields president of fords americas operations and gave him mr okudas invitation to the new ford ceo part of toyotas aim in courting ford is diplomacy an effort to win what people familiar with managements thinking describe as political peace from the u s s second biggest automobile producer though protectionist rhetoric has abated significantly toyota officials remain concerned about a possible backlash as they continue to gain market share in the u s while detroits big three shut factories and ax jobs analysts expect toyota to outsell ford in the u s on an annual basis as early as this year toyota also could benefit in a practical way if ford agreed to use its gasoline electric hybrid technology that is in part because toyotas momentum in establishing its hybrid design as an industry standard has slowed gm has lured german auto makers daimlerchrysler ag and bmw ag into a powerful alliance to develop a hybrid system of their own that they say is simpler than toyotas other companies including honda motor co are trying to go it alone messrs mulally and cho after talking for more than two hours ended the meeting by agreeing to meet again soon a person familiar with the situation said a toyota spokesman said no further meeting has been scheduled between the two but stressed that toyota remains open to the idea of forming a tie up to share costs of developing new technology or joining hands in popularizing new technology toyota also has shared operations with gm including an automobile assembly plant in fremont calif that it has run jointly with the u s car maker since the late s "so long as it is a win win for both parties and there is a reason for partnering were open to the idea of forming a partnership i think anyone among major auto makers around the world could potentially be our alliance partner " toyota president katsuaki watanabe said in an october interview analysts say it is unlikely toyota would seek to buy a stake in ford even though toyotas market capitalization far exceeds fords a primary obstacle is the voting stock controlled by the descendants of ford founder henry ford also toyota has generally avoided large scale acquisitions and alliances with rival auto makers ford meanwhile has too many financial troubles to buy a significant stake in toyota even the most efficient auto makers are worried about a glut around the world of auto making capacity and surging costs to pack cars with new technologies in part to meet increasingly stringent safety and emissions regulations those concerns tend to spur interest in alliances that can help bring down component or raw material costs or those for developing new technology to give them an edge ford according to a person familiar with its thinking could be interested in a joint venture or partnership with toyota that could focus on powertrain technology such as gasoline electric hybrid engines or on smaller four cylinder engines the december meeting in tokyo was broad based and senior executives at toyota said mr mulally discussed his experience at boeing co where he led its commercial aircraft division before joining ford in september he said he studied toyotas lean manufacturing process and transplanted some of the toyota devised production and inventory control techniques like just in time parts delivery to boeings overall aircraft assembly operations being a lean manufacturing expert himself those executives say mr cho was impressed by mr mulallys knowledge one of them said messrs mulally and cho "really hit it off" and predicted that their instant rapport may provide the springboard for a technical relationship of some kind "i dont know if mr mulally realizes this " said one senior toyota executive "but if he asked for help or suggested a way to collaborate knowing mr cho he would go out of his way to be responsive " ford which has forecast substantial losses this year has struggled to keep its engines competitive with other auto makers and in had to back off a much hyped goal of building hybrid vehicles annually because it realized it didnt have the capability to do so "ford came out of that tokyo meeting feeling toyota was worried that politically there could be problems for it in the united states if ford continued to struggle so toyota might want to do something that publicly looked like they were helping ford while it also marginally helped toyota " said one of the people familiar with the matter this person said there would be more talks in the future between ford and toyota about pursuing some sort of technology sharing venture
