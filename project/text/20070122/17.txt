boss talk a special report vfs new math strong entrepreneurs + financial controls growth over the past five years mackey j mcdonald has transformed vf corp from a manufacturer of lee and wrangler jeans and underwear under the vanity fair label into the largest apparel maker in the world in doing so the year old chairman and chief executive has snapped up a diverse portfolio of brands ranging from the north face to nautica and vans to the john varvatos design house theyre all part of his strategy of assembling so called lifestyle brands that appeal to different groups of consumers while providing faster growth than the companys legacy brands the challenge for greensboro n c based vf which now has annual sales of &# billion has been striking a balance between giving the brands which also include reef and jansport autonomy and helping them grow into meaningful contributors to vfs bottom line mr mcdonald a former u s army pilot and year vf veteran who took over as ceo in says the company chooses brands with strong identities that it believes would benefit from vfs financial muscle and relationships with retailers and while the brands continue to operate independently he centralizes functions like technology and finance he likes to say that the brands provide the "art" and vf provides "the science " we spoke with mr mcdonald about the importance and challenges of diversification here are excerpts the wall street journal what are some of the top challenges the apparel industry as a whole faces mr mcdonald the no challenge is the fragmentation of the consumer the customers needs are based on lifestyle culture and activities it is a challenge and it is also an opportunity for a company what you dont find today is the major trends in apparel that you used to for example in jeans where everyone is sort of moving in the same direction or short skirts or hem lengths today it is fragmented more and more so you need to be very focused on each individual segment wsj is that one of the reasons vf corp has decided to move from being solely a big manufacturer and building a portfolio of smaller lifestyle brands mr mcdonald it was certainly driven by the changes going on with the consumer we began to see that the consumer is fragmenting and they need more areas than the current brands we had they also are moving more toward brands that really say something about who they are and what they do its more important that the brand makes a statement about the fact that you are an outdoor adventurer when you think of reef you think surfing you think of the whole attitude and lifestyle of surfing it gives you the opportunity to one emotionally connect with the consumer but also it gives you a lot more different product categories to use that brand to sell product to the consumer wsj how do you fold these brands into vf yet allow them to retain their characters mr mcdonald we have what i always refer to as a centralized decentralized organizational structure when we acquire a brand we would like to retain the entrepreneur who really developed the brand we want to leave it in the same location because thats where the culture is and the people who do that sort of just stay as part of it it doesnt always happen that way but thats our ideal situation and so we give them autonomy and empower them to make decisions about targeting the consumer the products that they are going to deliver to the consumer the pricing distribution channels the marketing all of that stays with that entrepreneur who is really passionate about the brand and close to the customer but then we provide the support that helps them take advantage of the synergies of a large organization and disciplines that many entrepreneurial companies dont have part of it is what we call the art and science of the business we have the art through these acquisitions from the people who are there and then we bring science to it which is some of the controls such as finance and forecasting we have for example an office in hong kong that has people in it they are doing a lot of the sourcing and quality control checks making sure the fabrics are labeled making sure that shipments are on time we can bring a lot of those synergies to the business there are other sciences also that relate to studying the consumer we take a lot of these research capabilities and we help the marketing groups do studies that help them understand the consumer those are all synergies that we bring wsj in the free standing stores for your brands such as john varvatos and the new nautica stores there is a strong sense of identity in everything from the architecture to the props is the idea to give brands the creative room to do what they do best mr mcdonald it is critical autonomy thats the way that we are able to put this portfolio of brands together because to be honest with you it is a lot easier to get people really passionate about the brand versus being passionate about a corporation as a large corporation we have our values which are very important things across the corporation we believe in being open we believe in being very direct we tell them the good news and the bad news we want the brands to have their own abilities we dont want people to think "well this is vf corp " so the identity is what he drives what he decides and it is how he presents his brand that makes the marketing to the consumer much more powerful the connection with the consumer is much more powerful we talk to people quite often the last thing they want to do is be part of a big corporation but our best selling tool for that is just to talk to them they help us make those decisions they help us make the best financial plans they make strategies we make sure the strategies make sense so we get the return on investment this is where it is hard sometimes because a lot of times they want control over everything and thats the trouble we dont end up making an acquisition with those kinds of people the reason acquisitions fail nine times out of is because all parties arent totally upfront as to what happens most times something is going to change we try to be upfront about these things wsj and thats going to vary from brand to brand mr mcdonald it does and it also varies on the other side there are some people who are ready to cash in and are ready to move on and in those cases if you have a powerful enough brand then we look to see if we have someone else who is in the organization that can go in and then can drive the business wsj would that apply to nautica whose founder ceo and chief creative officer david chu left a year after you acquired the brand in mr mcdonald in that case you had the founder the designer the driver of that brand who was at a point in his career when he wanted to do something else we planned out a transition period how the transition would occur we worked through that and brought in people who had the right background to be a driver of the brand and that worked extremely well thats not our purpose our purpose is to continue because we already know the track work of the individual who built it but at the same time he had a brand that was strong and that has good consumer recognition wsj did nautica require more involvement from vf corp in terms of the business but also the creative side mr mcdonald we did a lot of research with the consumer to understand exactly how nautica was positioned in their minds and also what they expected in the product lines a lot of that work was infused to help give some of the really talented merchants and other people who were part of nautica information they really didnt have and thats where we have a lot of tools for people who have the creative skills but dont have the information wsj there have been some examples in the apparel and retail world of a giant acquiring a smaller company and things dont go so well why do collaborations like this sometimes not work out mr mcdonald every situation is different but there are some really general themes you find in those that dont work i believe that the primary cause usually is not a good clear understanding on both sides of what was going to happen as a result of the acquisition because there are differences in the way a large corporation operates in most cases and the way an entrepreneur controls a business and you really have to have good clear honest discussions about what isnt going to change and what is going to change i think that there are two things that really helped us in the last five years in the acquisitions the reason was we dont change everything there are things that we want to keep in place we can make an acquisition and we want that entrepreneur to stay not only does he stay but stay engaged and feel empowered to feel like they are driving a business and they are making the decisions but also understand that there are going to be financial controls that we are going to bring and our people are going to be part of the organization and help make that happen and we have all that clear upfront versus coming later and saying "here is your new operations guy" or "here is somebody who is going to be looking over your shoulder " mr smith is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in new york he can be reached at ray smith wsj com
