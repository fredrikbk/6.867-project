boss talk a special report heres to a long life insurance chief richard harvey sees big money in helping baby boomers protect against longevity risk people in the u s and many other countries are living longer richard harvey is out to make sure thats good news mr harvey is the group chief executive of aviva plc britains largest insurer and the fifth largest world wide by gross premiums the year old executive is watching his father and other seniors flourish in their later years hes also watching his business and industry shift from one that protects people against the financial fallout from dying too young to the risks raised by living too long in particular running out of money "longevity risk" is increasing thanks to medical breakthroughs the average life expectancy in the u s today is about years and the longer you live the longer youre likely to live many still think of as retirement age but aviva and other insurers cite research showing that year old american men have a chance of living at least another years numbers like that mean that many retirement age workers will change careers or simply shift into a new activity rather than retire mr harvey knows that well given that he plans to step down in july and do charity work in africa for a year before making his next career move andrew moss avivas group finance director will take the reins and take over a growing focus on graying customers world wide with tens of millions of baby boomers just starting or nearing retirement longevity risk is one of avivas biggest business opportunities the company estimates that americans canadians and europeans currently have some &# trillion salted away in investments and insurance products for retirement aviva which gets about of its revenue from general insurance and the rest from life insurance and investment management expects that honey pot to grow some by in years at the helm mr harvey has positioned aviva which generated about of its revenue in europe last year to get a big share of this business in the u s with its acquisition last year of iowa based life insurer amerus group co while excited about the opportunity in longevity risk products like annuities and investment oriented offerings he acknowledges that backstopping millions of customers longevity risks is far from simple here are excerpts from a conversation with mr harvey the wall street journal why step down now mr harvey ten years was a pretty long time before the mast im going to have the gap year i never had in the u k thats what we call the year some students take to travel or have an adventure between university and work ive decided its time to do something more constructive i expect to spend a good chunk of that time in africa im going to do something practical for one or two charities then ill reassess wsj how is longevity a risk mr harvey its a risk for individuals because they may not have enough savings to last their lifetime its a significant risk for society because rising longevity can leave you with an aging population that needs to be supported by a shrinking working population in some sense you have a double whammy in the developed world people are living longer than generally expected yes but were also having fewer children than we used to the combination of those factors means that society is aging doubly fast i was born in the u k in when one in five people were retired the current estimate is that in that ratio will be one to one that gives you a sense of the remarkable scale and speed of sociological change we might see in the u k and other developed markets wsj what kind of societal changes do you expect mr harvey clearly well see patterns of people working longer and that will be a good thing it will help meet many potential labor shortages and help people supplement what will inevitably be inadequate savings instead of retiring at for instance you may decide you want a career change but youll likely keep working and saving one thing that has been totally debunked is the idea that its a good idea to get people to retire to make way for the next generation in fact now you need to keep experienced capable people in harness and motivated as long as you can wsj is the u s in a similar situation as developed european markets mr harvey the u s is actually an exception in the developed world it looks like the u s population could actually be among the steadiest in the developed world because of immigration and a higher number of children being born because there is a sizable generation of people behind the baby boomers in the u s there will be a pretty marked gap in median age of the population between the u s and europe by for the u s and in europe by some projections wsj for life insurers increasing longevity is also a risk because customers with monthly payment guarantees could live far longer than expected right mr harvey its not quite as worrying as many pundits imply in many ways a significant number of customers are willing to take on some of the risks themselves they see that if they shift their savings into a product that guarantees income the overall yield they earn on that savings will be relatively low they also know that if they accept a little more risk the money will grow over that longer life they may lead so what were increasingly preparing is flexible products that will allow people to draw down their money when they need it but also give them the opportunity to continue to grow their assets wsj what are these products mr harvey equity indexed annuities which amerus offers in the u s are a good example as people near retirement theyre interested in some kind of guaranteed income they remember what happened to the stock market in but they also know the stock market represents their opportunity to invest in the real commercial world and build their assets the equity indexed annuity has seen enormous growth in the u s because it has those two features it offers a guarantee that your capital is safe with a relatively low rate of growth but youll also get a guaranteed percentage of the upside of the index the u s baby boomer likes that product maybe not for their whole portfolio but just for a part of it as they near retirement that allows them to still invest for growth but have a minimum guarantee wsj how do you hedge against the chance that interest rates inflation or even life spans play out differently than planned mr harvey geographical diversification is important because mortality trends and product demand vary country by country the fact that we have a portfolio that spreads across the whole of europe helps it also helps that we have a rapidly growing portfolio of business in asia where people are focusing on asset accumulation as opposed to protection regulating the amount of business you do in any given year is also helpful weve been careful to take some business each year but not go overboard in any one year because each year you get a bit more mortality and longevity information your pricing gets more and more accurate its also worth noting that our general insurance business insuring cars homes and businesses across europe and in canada is a very different type of business from life insurance it generates a lot of capital whereas long term savings and protection require capital commitment that balances out our risks too wsj of course there will always be the risk that one or some insurers who took on ample longevity risk got their models wrong mr harvey is there a hedge against the fact that someone who is will live however long the short answer is not yet we think weve correctly balanced the size of our exposure to mortality and longevity risks with the overall size of our group of companies its possible that some people are taking on too much risk and we wont know who has until the end wsj is there a good argument that longevity risk is peaking and that life spans wont keep growing at such a fast rate mr harvey there is no one can predict precisely what a given generations mortality will be todays year olds are doing incredibly well but they are people who lived a relatively healthy lifestyle in many cases in the u k s case these are people who survived a war they went through rationing and grew their own vegetables generally they walked a fair amount because they often didnt have cars they are living well for a long time as a result of these things and my father is one example its not quite as clear that the next generation will exhibit the same kind of longevity improvement wsj because of excess mr harvey generally as we get wealthier were not great at personal discipline were all human and we tend to want to enjoy the fruits of a good life we use transport more so we get less exercise we have more food and drink than we need in western economies there are a decent number of medics who think that because of these trends we might be seeing the peak of longevity improvement were not betting on that outcome but it might be true wsj your company is well known for some innovative policies and research you offer "pay as you go" car insurance with rates set by black boxes in cars you also photographed and mapped the entire u k coast to sell flood coverage address by address is anything in the works to predict how long a given person will live mr harvey sadly the risks are much more complex in mortality and longevity if you are predicting human behavior over the next years its just too hard will someone gain pounds or not will someone quit smoking you just dont know mr mcdonald is a staff reporter in the wall street journals london bureau he can be reached at ian mcdonald wsj com
