the afternoon report bloody baghdad american troops may not be the only force surging into baghdad a bloody car bombing attack in the iraqi capital today suggests that sunni insurgents are also stepping up their activities nearly people were killed and more than a hundred were injured when a pair of near simultaneous blasts ripped through a bustling shiite commercial district in baghdad the first explosion came from a car that had been parked close to a series of stalls where shoppers grazed over dvds and secondhand clothing the second attack came mere seconds later from a car that weaved through the gory aftermath of the first explosion each had been packed with over pounds of explosives police said like many other corners of the war pocked capital the bab al sharqi market is no stranger to sectarian bloodshed only last month a suicide bomber killed over people nearby but todays attack is the bloodiest in the city since november when sunni forces set upon the shiite slum of sadr city and killed more than in a series of car bombings and mortar attacks and it was compounded later in the day by a mortar attack in a market north of baghdad that killed at least a dozen and injured dozens more the explosions with their mushrooming plumes of smoke and debris caught on a video that was eerily reminiscent of the blast footage captured by news crews in the early shock and awe days of the coalition invasion seemed a clear escalation of a campaign by sunni insurgents to terrorize shiite civilians last week twin bombings at a baghdad university killed more than students and more than iraqis were killed or found dead around the city prime minister nouri al maliki blamed a "coalition of saddamists and terrorists" for the latest round of attacks claiming in a statement that they are trying to "break the will of the iraqi people" and "incite strife " the executions of saddam hussein and his half brother who was decapitated as he fell from the gallows have caused resentment among sunnis and stirred greater sectarian enmity president bush criticized the unruly execution of mr hussein where some attendees chanted the name of muqtada al sadr saying it had the look of a "revenge killing" and made it harder to convince the u s public that iraqs government is capable of following through on the promises it has made as the administration sends in a wave of reinforcements a particularly bloody weekend for the u s military may also make the surge a tough sell a dozen troops were killed last saturday when a helicopter crashed in an area northeast of the

greater potential sentence must be found by the jury not a judge and established beyond a reasonable doubt not merely by a preponderance of the evidence " justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote for the
