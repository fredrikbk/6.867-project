mines mengniu posted sales of nearly &# billion in up from the previous year revenue rose another in the first six months of yili posted revenue of about &# billion in up from the previous year in the s poor national transportation and a lack of refrigerated trucks meant that fresh milk had to be made locally late in the decade mengniu cleared that hurdle by selling uht treated milk uht or ultra high temperature milk didnt need to be refrigerated and could be shipped from mongolia where cows are plentiful to customers in such cities as beijing or shanghai mengniu milk was cheaper and quickly dominated its local competitors even after uht became more common mengniu held its position thanks to aggressive marketing which dwarfs its spending on research and development merrill lynch estimates mengniu spent a billion yuan or about &# million for the full year in marketing far outpacing its rivals it owns no dairy farms instead contracting out to suppliers and focusing on creating buzz around trendy drinks like suan suan ru a sour milk beverage popular among chinese teenagers in the company sponsored the runaway television hit "supergirl " a chinese reality television show similar to "american idol " the shows success was especially good in building mengnius brand image with the younger viewers it even sponsored astronaut yang liwei "they really propelled the brand and its

a milk drinking culture and in many corners of asia lactose intolerance is a common problem still recent history in south korea and japan demonstrates that such countries can learn to drink milk per capita consumption in south korea is now around pounds of dairy products a year more than three times the average consumption in china that mengniu has managed to turn a profit at this is testimony to the companys marketing strength "the word we often use is marketing machine " says erwin sanft head of china research at bnp paribas securities its biggest growth comes from milk beverages such as breakfast milk and evening milk which are packaged in eye catching designs the nba is the latest foreign partner to team with mengniu in december the dairy formed a joint venture with frances danone
