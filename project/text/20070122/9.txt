at nazi camps counterfeiting ring saved mr burger today a movie and book recount a massive plot to weaken british pound prague adolf burger a sprightly year old survivor of nazi concentration camps held up one of the british gbp notes he helped forge for the germans during the war "britannia was hard" to render he said pointing to the female symbol of great britain a toga wearing woman with spear and shield drawn in the notes top left hand corner mr burger was a reluctant player in one of the biggest attempts at financial sabotage in history the nazis forced mr burger and about other jewish prisoners all marked for liquidation to forge so much british currency that by of all pound sterling bills in existence measured by face value were fake mr burger published a short memoir after the war and then didnt talk about the war for decades he says in the s a book by a german holocaust denier so incensed him that he took early retirement and began collecting photos and documents to prove what he had seen in the concentration camps after publishing another bigger memoir he began a one man campaign to tell young germans what he had witnessed since the end of the cold war he has traveled all over germany telling his story of holocaust horrors counterfeiting and survival to audiences at high schools german army bases and police departments "when he tells his story hes as lively as a year old " says jurgen peter schmidt former head of anticounterfeit police in hamburg who has heard mr burger speak an austrian filmmaker has made a new movie about the counterfeiting operation called "the forger " based partly on mr burgers memoir it is to be released in germany and austria in march mr burger advised on the script but says he couldnt keep it from giving his tale the hollywood treatment "there are two bedroom scenes " he says rolling his eyes if germany had been able to drop the fake fortune on britain as planned it could have undermined trust in the currency and crippled the british economy according to "kruegers men " by american author lawrence malkin the first comprehensive account of the saga instead the effort largely flopped corrupt german agents skimmed off millions when the war ended some of the money even ended up in the hands of the jewish underground which used it to smuggle jewish refugees to palestine mr burgers forgery career began after the nazis broke up czechoslovakia in early in addition to his day job as a book printer he joined an underground communist cell that printed false papers to save jews eventually arrested by the gestapo he and his wife gisela were put on a train to auschwitz where his wife died in the gas chamber he was picked for work squads he narrowly evaded one details mass execution and starvation rations reduced his weight to under pounds he recalls the ss injected him with typhus in a medical experiment and a guard knocked his teeth out with a rifle butt just because he shared a first name with adolf hitler he says after nearly two years of struggle to stay alive mr burger was recruited by an ss officer named bernhard kruger to the top secret operation bernhard at the sachsenhausen concentration camp north of berlin mr kruger ran a hutch within the camp two long wooden huts sealed off by fences and roofed over with barbed wire other inmates never saw his prisoners capt kruger and his team of ss guards spared their jewish prisoners the degradations they had known previously in nazi camps according to mr malkins account the inmates had decent food civilian clothes cigarettes books and board games they even received parcels from outside they were allowed to grow their hair and listen to the radio they worked eight hour days they had sundays off mr burger played ping pong with the ss the handpicked prisoners prewar professionals in fine arts printing or banking manned a forgery factory whose main product was british pounds the inmates were to be killed when the project ended and they knew it those who fell ill werent taken to see a doctor to whom they might reveal something they were shot inmates only hope was to keep counterfeiting successfully until the war was over "we were dead men on vacation " says mr burger mr burger befriended the only career criminal in the group a russian master forger named salomon smolianoff who was known to police across prewar europe in early leaders of the ss decided they had enough sterling they switched their attention to forging dollars capt kruger gave mr smolianoff mr burger and two others the job of figuring out how to copy &# bills even trickier than the bank of englands notes initial results were poor fearing the end of the operation the inmates stalled for time "as the production of english pounds had finished already all the hope of the man group was based on our work" with dollar bills mr smolianoff later told allied investigators the typed record of mr smolianoffs postwar interrogation by a u s secret service agent is reproduced on mr malkins web site mr smolianoff eventually achieved a breakthrough and the first fake dollars were printed "i was just an ordinary book printer " says mr burger "smolianoff was in another class " before mass production of dollars got under way the advance of the soviet army forced the ss to whisk away the forgers their machines and counterfeit loot by various accounts the caravan headed for ebensee in the austrian alps the last concentration camp in nazi hands the ss dumped the money in a lake and planned to blow up the forgers in a mountain tunnel but with u s troops bearing down the guards fled before they could execute the inmates mr burger and his colleagues were free in all the money makers of sachsenhausen forged nearly gbp million which would be worth around &# billion in todays money most of it never reached britain the war wracked luftwaffe lacked the planes to drop it according to mr malkins account agents of the sss intelligence arm used some of the money to pay for spies and supplies so many fake pounds circulated in europe and the middle east that sterling fell into disrepute losing of its value on the black market today mr burgers house in a prague suburb is an archive of photographs documents and memories of the events he survived he retains only a few specimens of the phony money he helped print his most valued souvenir is a charcoal portrait of himself hanging next to his bed drawn by mr smolianoff one day in sachsenhausen "whats the point of doing my portrait were all going through the chimney anyway " mr burger recalls saying to mr smolianoff that day in "you never know you never know " the russian replied "just sit " clambering about his bookshelves on a stepladder mr burger said the huge counterfeiting scam of the ss exposes an important side of the third reich "the nazis murdered millions for ideological reasons but they were also ordinary criminals " he said see related letter
