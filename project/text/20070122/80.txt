state of the speeches time waster web site tracks a history of presidential buzzwords in president bushs state of the union address tuesday night odds are he will make reference to insurgents perhaps more than once president bush though would be only the latest u s chief to give the word major airtime in his state of the union president lincoln decried "insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who are even now making great sacrifices " a line that could be borrowed for tomorrow nights address plenty more interesting observations can be made by following the evolution of major presidential speeches and you dont need to be a history buff to come up with your own chirag mehta a year old it manager from st petersburg fla created a tool that breaks down most major presidential speeches state of the union speeches inaugural addresses and war declarations among them going all the way back to the birth of the nation his web based application buried in his blog at chir ag filters most of the major orations accumulated online at sites like encyclopaedia britannica for their most frequently used terms pull a slider from left to right and presidential history marches forward yielding the top most used words in each oration these words are displayed in "tag clouds " an indexing method commonly used on blogs and other second generation web sites tag clouds weighted lists of keywords displayed in alphabetical order allow readers to visually sort information at glance for mr mehtas "u s presidential speeches tag cloud " the size of a word depends on how frequently it is used in each individual speech a larger font means heavy usage color varies to show how long a particular term has been in use brighter colors indicate newer words in presidential lexicon while well worn words are given drab color and words in constant use are beige the system counts most variants like terrorist and terrorism as a single term its no surprise when looking at recent speeches by president bush to see that "iraq" is big and bright in his most recent speech calling for additional troops the words "anbar" and "shia" make their tag cloud debut in a pure white font "one of the biggest trends ive noticed is that presidents have gone away from concrete action words and now focus on abstract feelings " mr mehta says "by the time you get to nixon and lbj theyre talking about commitment all the time " as years roll by the word "war" becomes beige and never goes away since it appears in every speech mr mehta has catalogued there are just two speeches where "war" isnt one of the top most used terms george washingtons inaugural address in and fdrs speech on social security of course a president needs to use a word more than once in a speech for it to crack his top list and be compared with past orations color coding signals major watersheds in american history slide over to and the words "war" and "british" leap out in a massive brilliant white in president eisenhower turns "ballistic" and "missiles" into vividly white buzzwords some seven years after president truman did the same to "communism " color coding also makes plain president bushs use of the word "terrorism " the word appears in shocking white within the tag cloud for mr bushs sept speech declaring war on terrorism and it remains roughly the same dominant size in every subsequent tag cloud for the next five years a casual survey of mr mehtas presidential "tagline " as he calls it generates all sorts of insights "intercourse" is one of mr mehtas favorite examples "i dont think bush is going use that word in his state of the union speech " he predicts "but that was a pretty common word in the early speech history " in december president adams while describing the relationship between the u s and europe says "during the same period our intercourse with all those nations has been pacific and friendly it so continues " "vessel" is another early fixture of presidential vocabulary that has been left to languish by modern administrations in thomas jeffersons state of the union address "vessel" is clearly the single most dominant term mr jefferson complained for example that european trade policies "tend effectually to prohibit the carrying thither our own produce in our own vessels " "constitution" emerges a presidential obsession in the early th century but vanishes almost entirely by the th century "family" goes from big to huge as the tag clouds from the reagan s to the clinton s as the creator makes clear hes no amateur historian "i dont know much about u s history " he admits "this was more of a cliff notes project for me " he first drew up the tag cloud software as a way to index his personal blog when he began blogging five years ago online tagging as we know it didnt exist so rather than re read his old posts and add keyword tags mr mehta wrote a program that sifts through his archives to filter out his frequently used words by the month "i learned that around when i moved to florida the word hurricane became important in my life " he says then he decided to apply the software to "something that would actually be interesting to people " he launched his presidential speech tag could shortly before the november elections and the page attracted more than a million hits in the first two weeks he says now mr mehta reports between and visitors access the page each day the tag cloud software is available free distributed through a creative commons license on mr mehtas site the process is easy he says just copy the text and plug it into his "tagline" generator which strips out common words like "the" or "and " combines similar words like "iraq" with "iraqi " and reveals the most used terms in cloud form the software will then compare the newest speech to all the earlier ones in his collection determining which words are new additions and which are old standbys and assigning font colors to each mr mehta is applying the software elsewhere last month seattle post intelligencer reporter todd bishop asked mr mehta for help applying the same tag cloud technique to microsofts history the result digests three decades of key speeches interviews and internal emails and he isnt planning to abandon his presidential archive mr mehta expects to have a tag cloud up for tuesday nights state of the union address minutes after the white house posts the speech online write to aaron rutkoff at aaron rutkoff wsj com
