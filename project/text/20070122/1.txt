americas making lenin proud "the way to crush the bourgeoisie is to grind them between the millstones of taxation and inflation " vladimir lenin mexican historian and author enrique krauze has written that he believes that the "last marxist in history will die at a latin american university " at a minimum mr krauze seems to have gotten the geography right most of the rest of the world has stuffed communism into the dustbin of history but as events over the past week remind latin america has not earlier this month president hugo chavez officially took control of venezuelas central bank and declared himself a communist he then traveled to ecuador to attend the swearing in ceremony of his latest and perhaps most promising protege rafael correa as that countrys new president mr correa has lost no time emulating his mentor mr correa who was ecuadors finance minister in was well known in the early stages of the presidential campaign last year as an anti american anti market extremist with a view that "dollarization was the biggest economic error ecuador has ever committed " but when he failed to win in the first round of voting in october he was forced to adopt a more measured tone and backed off his pledge to end dollarization the trouble for ecuadoreans as we are now seeing is that their new presidents stripes have not changed in his first week on the job he has already demonstrated a profound understanding of lenins dictum that power over monetary matters is a revolutionary essential to that end he has begun an effort to destroy ecuadors dollarization from there taxation and inflation will do much of his work for him at his inauguration last monday mr correa put on quite a show most extraordinary was his not so subtle admission that mr chavez is going to be the power behind the ecuadorean throne most latin governments guard their independence as a matter of national pride but mr correa appeared quite happy to let the world know that he will be outsourcing ecuadorean sovereignty to venezuela ecuador the new president declared is "leaving the night of neoliberalism behind" and the new "bolivarian" government will pursue "st century socialism " he denounced competition and called for cooperation instead he held up a sword that mr chavez had given him as a gift and cried "look out look out bolivars sword is passing through latin america " a reference to the chavez agenda which calls for south american integration under the thumb of the continents largest energy producer the venezuelan president was perched behind the new president eyes narrowed enthusiastically applauding the performance irans mahmoud ahmadinejad was also an honored guest sitting next to bolivian president evo morales ecuadors political instability is legendary and mr correa is the eighth president in years he will have to move quickly in his goal to consolidate power and if he is to avoid the fate of his predecessors he will also have to move carefully rewriting the constitution is so central to his agenda that on inauguration day he decreed a march national referendum on the issue the only problem is that mr correa hasnt the power to call a constitutional referendum changes to the constitution fall under congress since mr correas party has no members in the seat chamber and his coalition is shaky it is not entirely clear that he will be able to push through the constitutional changes he seeks his socialist revolution via a constitutional coup could be delayed still that doesnt leave the aspiring authoritarian without options he has lenins millstones to fall back on if only he can resurrect a local currency this explains the assault on dollarization now under way the adoption of the greenback as ecuadors currency seven years ago has been extremely popular among ecuadoreans of all classes a long history of repeated bouts of hyperinflation which destroyed both wages and savings has finally come to an end and been replaced by a new sense of stability mr correa knows full well that he cannot strip ecuadoreans of this one economic gain without facing the kind of rebellion that brought down previous governments yet the control he yearns for will not be his as long as the dollar reigns to reverse dollarization and introduce a fiat currency mr correa will have to undermine the dollar economy one step in that process is stifling commerce with the u s his countrys largest trading partner he has already pledged that under his guidance ecuador will move away from trade liberalization with the gringos and throw its lot in with mr chavezs bolivarian alternative for america trading block protectionism will help weaken the dollar economy but it may not be enough to provoke a crisis a forced restructuring of the countrys &# billion in external debt will provide further assistance by damaging the countrys creditworthiness and discouraging new investment particularly because it is well known that ecuadors debt service as a percentage of gross domestic product is lower than colombias or brazils creditors understand that paying what is owed is a matter of willingness nevertheless mr correas finance minister ricardo patino last week proposed a haircut of on the countrys debt and invited a team of argentine officials otherwise known as the worlds most experienced deadbeats to quito this week to act as advisers it will be claimed that the "savings" on debt service will be used to help the poor this will boost mr correas populist appeal but politicians never have enough revenue to meet their goals low growth rates and disappointing oil prices will exacerbate revenue shortfalls in a fiscal crisis it is easy to imagine a government like mr correas issuing script or a new currency in parallel to the dollar the new president seems to be prepared for just such an outcome in the past he has called for a regional currency and he has now announced that he will end central bank autonomy once foreign investment and trade dry up and the bottomless pit of corruption and social spending drains public coffers dollarization will be the scapegoat mr correa can then begin to print his own notes
