boss talk a special report are unions relevant seiu president andy stern thinks so but he also sees a need for an attitude adjustment while most american unions are losing members the service employees international union is gaining them the union has successfully organized workers in the south whats more it has had success in industries including health care and janitorial services that are both growing and dominated by low wage immigrant workers hoping for higher pay and health care and retirement benefits as president of seiu which represents about million nurses security guards janitors and others andy stern has become one of the most recognizable and powerful labor leaders in the country in mr stern pulled his union out of the afl cio in dramatic fashion at its convention and has since helped form the rival change to win federation which represents about six million workers mr stern says he wants to remake the labor movement by shedding its old adversarial image and creating more labor management partnerships last week he announced a new partnership with the business roundtable and american association of retired persons to push congress to act on health care reform at the same time seiu is feared by many employers because of its high success rate at waging aggressive organizing campaigns that usually include support from elected officials clergy and activists in addition to punishing publicity for employers in an interview mr stern talked about why unions are still relevant the impact of a democratic controlled congress on health care and pension policy and whether unions will ever organize the u s employees of wal mart stores inc here are excerpts the wall street journal with of u s private sector workers belonging to unions today down from about years ago the u s has one of the lowest percentages of private sector workers covered by collective bargaining agreements of democracies around the world are unions still relevant in the u s mr stern i think the need for unions is far greater today than almost at any time since the s and s i think american workers want a voice on their job and the question is will unions change to become better partners with employers to respond to what is now a global economy where more people went to work today in the u s in retail than in manufacturing wsj do you think employers in the u s are much more anti union today than years ago mr stern for one thing i think unions missed the growth of the new economy so huge companies and industries grew up nonunion in technology all of silicon valley in medical research biotech so theres not a history and then when unions arrive they are dealing with very substantial employers and second i think as much as we try to be partners with our employers who told us we should change and understand their competitive issues and try to add value not create problems the employers are not looking for any kind of union even a good partner wsj is the opposition you face during organizing campaigns tougher today than years ago mr stern it is much more sophisticated today there are now a whole wide range of consultants lawyers and strike breakers who have been battle tested i think the law employers appreciate has no remedial enforcement power so you can violate it somewhat without fear and having learned that it just only escalates peoples willingness to do anything wsj how do you think most americans view unions mr stern what we know is that most people believe now that their children will be worse off than they are seven out of americans are living paycheck to paycheck and do feel like an organization an association or even a union would be helpful in changing that situation at the same time unions have an image of being old not effective in some cases not looking like the new work force so we have an image problem i would say the only way to change your image is to change reality wsj how do you convince a company that working with a union is good for its business especially when so many companies are thriving by shedding union workers and offshoring jobs mr stern i would say there are two sets of issues one is the million jobs in transportation health care retail technology that are going to remain in this country and there i think unions need to appreciate there are ways in which we add value and there are ways that we make them less competitive so we need to understand markets we need to understand their competition we need to appreciate where we can be helpful like increasing financing or leveling the playing field so competition is about entrepreneurial activity about quality about efficiency and not about who can pay the least we want to find a st century new model that may look more like a european model that is less focused on individual grievances more focused on industry needs but i think the employers are rather scared and unimaginative its too much about cost and bottom lines and not enough about people and human relations wsj if you could gather the countrys top ceos in one room what would you tell them mr stern i would tell them the employer based health care system is dead its a relic of the industrial economy and it makes them unable to fairly compete when america is the only country who asks its employers to put the price of health care on the cost of its products i would say that employer based pensions have the same problems and that we need to create a new way that american workers do in fact have retirement security where employers are expected to contribute and three i would say we need in each of our sectors to find ways where we can better do training quality and give workers an opportunity to be involved in a dialogue about the services that are provided wsj what would you say to rank and file critics who say youre too quick to collaborate with management mr stern i think most critics come from outside the union because i dont hear our members say that people dont go to work to have a fight they go to work to provide a service to build a community to take care of their family i dont hear most people say i cant wait to go to work to have a fight with that boss wsj do you think unions will ever be able to organize wal mart in the u s mr stern the group seius part of wal mart watch has not been trying to organize them but change their business model and its clear we have their attention i dont think a traditional organizing drive is going to be successful because the laws as i said are so tilted on behalf of a company as big as wal mart and they probably are at the top of the line in terms of having an emergency response team that flies out of bentonville at the moment the word "union" is used in a store at the same time i think wal mart has the opportunity to create an entirely new american model of worker representation the question is do they want partners or do they want to be held accountable in a much more public fashion wsj you now face a congress expected to be much more in sync with union viewpoints what is the no issue unions want to see acted on by the new congress mr stern we think its time for a new health care system for every american i think were going to see some employer groups say this is the year to begin to create a call for action for health care i dont think the congress yet gets it but i think by march theyre going to see that this election in addition to iraq had a lot to do with economic anxiety and health care costs are no on that list wsj what have you and seiu accomplished since leaving the afl cio and are you satisfied mr stern im never satisfied because i think our union and the labor movement id say even a lot of our employers are really slow in making the change to a global economy a very fast paced economy we dont see our employers as enemies we dont want to be attached to any single political party our attitude now is we need to build successful employers as part of that you need to be involved and have a voice and that everyone needs to share in the success of an employer not just the shareholders and the executives wsj how do you measure success for yourself mr stern i came to seiu personally because i wanted to change peoples lives thats why im so passionate about health care at the moment because i think too many people are living each day with a sense of fear that something tragic could happen about their health which could also affect their economic security we are living through the third economic revolution following the agricultural and the industrial revolutions its a very profoundly new moment and america has no plan we need to come together as a country and find new ideas and new solutions to make work pay and keep an incredible dream alive mr
