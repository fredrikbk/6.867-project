edifice complex in real estate battle titans awash in cash though equity office was weak performer mr roth covets it last july steven roth called fellow real estate titan sam zell with a secret proposal a merger that would put the two longtime friends atop a company that would dwarf anything else in the real estate world mr roth chief executive of vornado realty trust knew that mr zells equity office properties trust was in play eop the nations biggest office landlord with more than buildings had been a disappointment on wall street mr zell thought he could get efficiencies from owning big buildings en masse but had ended up paying too much for some buildings and owning in too many weak markets with its stock trading at less than the value of its assets eop had become likely prey for cash rich private equity firms that could carve it up and sell it off but mr zells company looked like a boon for vornado with successful investments in real estate and beyond it was drowning in capital a combination with eop would give vornado a myriad of choice properties in one swoop at a time when competition has never been more fierce for commercial estate mr roth thought mr zell years old would leap at the chance to keep his empire intact married to vornados powerful financial machine mr roth guessed wrong in november after negotiations bogged down over price mr zell agreed to sell his company for &# billion to the giant private equity firm blackstone group mr zell declined to be interviewed now vornado is scrambling to get back into the deal last week the new york based real estate investment trust teamed with two partners to top blackstones bid by if its bid succeeds vornado will cherrypick from eops markets and take mr zells throne as the nations largest office building landlord vornado and blackstone are squaring off in a giant takeover battle fueled by a huge wave of cash washing through global markets low interest rates a strong global economy and high commodity prices have flooded coffers around the world with cash that investors have increasingly sought to put in stable assets such as office buildings after suffering a deep slump after the dotcom crash in the office market has seen steady recovery since the end of with relatively few new buildings rental rates in existing buildings have jumped and that trend is expected to continue over the next year or two even in some laggard markets the feverish interest in commercial real estate with sale prices for office buildings in particular climbing almost daily stands in stark contrast to falling or stagnant prices in much of the residential real estate market over the past year in a presentation to shareholders last june mr roth years old expressed regret at the many deals vornado had passed up as too expensive only to see their valuations soar "the simple answer is in this environment over the last years every single deal we didnt do was a mistake " he said in its higher bid &# a share compared with blackstones &# a share offer vornado and its partners are offering in vornado stock and the rest in cash blackstones all cash bid is scheduled for a shareholder vote feb and it has the right to make a counteroffer mr zell founded eop in with a college friend he soon earned the nickname "gravedancer" by buying distressed properties rehabilitating them and selling them for huge profits he stood out in a pinstripe world by wearing blue jeans and driving a motorcycle with fellow travelers he called zells angels he dispensed dollops of wisdom each year through custom made music boxes such as last years "capital is raining on my head" about a world awash in cash sung to the tune of "raindrops keep falling on my head " the gravedancers dance card broadened over time he took chicago based equity office public in with the plan to put together a string of skyscrapers that stretched from coast to coast and from ohio to texas his strategy bring economies of scale to the business of owning office buildings everything from spreading borrowing risk over many properties to buying light bulbs in bulk for tenants after going public eop acquired three real estate companies in five years and along with other acquisitions tripled its square footage to more than million square feet but mr zells plan fell short investors complained that eop overpaid for those companies a particular lightning rod its acquisition of spieker properties with a strong concentration of buildings in silicon valley for &# billion plus debt the deal closed in july just as the implications for the office sector from the dotcom bust were looming the bust along with the slowing demand for office space that came with the economys downturn hit other weaker office markets where eop was a landlord and exposed a fundamental flaw in the companys philosophy "i think the last real estate cycle demonstrated that you dont necessarily benefit from having a national footprint unless your properties are located in very strong markets " said keven lindemann director of the real estate group at snl financial a research group based in charlottesville va eops huge size wasnt necessarily a blessing to some tenants the buildings owner was a distracted landlord that couldnt keep tabs on property needs last year eop lost the three main tenants in its peachtree building one of atlantas prime downtown office addresses when the tenants leases came up for renewal leaving the building virtually empty cousins properties an atlanta reit recently bought the building for &# million a price one research firm described as a fire sale "we bought it at &# per square foot and you couldnt build it for &# a square foot " says tad leithead a senior vice president with cousins cousins executives are betting that their intimate knowledge of the atlanta market will allow them to fill the building with tenants in a way that the national chain could not as eops stock continued to lag behind its competitors mr zell became increasingly outspoken lashing out at analysts sometimes by name in public forums who he believed didnt fully appreciate the value of eops portfolio though eops stock had a strong run up in the companys total return to shareholders over the previous five years had been the lowest of the office reits followed by merrill lynch eop stock trading at about &# a share when vornado first approached the company in july closed at a week high on friday at &# on the new york stock exchange yet the company looked poised for a comeback in after giving up on the idea of bigger is better through a series of restructuring initiatives over the past couple of years eop abandoned its weakest markets pulling out of dallas and atlanta and reducing its presence in denver and chicago it sold off weaker properties and acquired some top quality buildings such as the verizon building in new york when the deal with blackstone was announced eop had outperformed the industry for the year vornado has been a darling of analysts and investors since it went public in in total shareholder returns over the past six years vornado delivered significantly besting the industry it won praise for paying top dollar to hire stars from the executive office to local facilities managers and won a reputation for keeping its buildings full of satisfied tenants the son of a clothing manufacturer in the bronx mr roth helped form shopping center company interstate properties in and took control of vornado in mr roths companies acquired control of retailer alexanders inc which filed for bankruptcy court protection in to get at its real estate in vornado entered the office market buying mendik co which owned seven midtown manhattan properties vornado now one of new york citys largest office landlords also has a significant presence in washington d c in a presentation to shareholders in june mr roth said that the two most important aspects of his company were brand name and the ability to pull off big acquisitions turning to vornados president michael fascitelli he added "we walk in in the morning mike and i and we never know what is going to walk in the door in terms of a spectacularly interesting transaction that we may do the rich get richer thank god " even if it acquires eop vornado intends to add only three more cities boston san francisco and los angeles all coastal markets that meet the companys strategy of owning in cities that benefit from international trade and where its difficult to build which limits competition according to a company statement its two private equity partners in the deal starwood capital and walton street capital would divvy up eops hundreds of other buildings and are expected to sell off at least some of them at times vornado has acted more like an investment fund than a landlord participating in the privatization of toys "r" us inc in the company has also invested heavily at times in mcdonalds corp and sears roebuck &amp co "theyre allowed to do a lot of things that if just about any other company did theyd be roundly booed by the marketplace " says jim corl a representative of cohen &amp steers a real estate investment firm and a major shareholder of both eop and vornado "theyre able to go out and raise a billion dollars of equity because steve roth says i need a billion on my balance sheet and the market says ok heres a billion in equity everyone else would have to explain why " but in the last year as vornado built up cash reserves and issued more equity analysts began to wonder how it might put its war chest to work when reckson associates realty corp a uniondale n y real estate investment trust with six valuable new york city buildings was in play last summer vornado was a bidder but vornado eventually lost out to sl green realty corp another new york reit when it refused to go higher than its initial price in hindsight its clear why vornado wouldnt budge beyond the price it thought reckson was worth while bidding for reckson vornado was simultaneously negotiating for the biggest trophy of them all equity office in an interview with the wall street journal last summer mr zell emphasized that eop had no defenses such as a poison pill that would keep a bidder from approaching him if the offer maximized shareholder value he had an obligation to consider it "i believed that the moment i took money from the public " he said over months five firms approached eop about a possible merger according to the shareholder proxy issued dec only blackstone was identified by name vornado was called "company c " vornado executives argued that the two companies could enhance the best in each other perhaps in a stock for stock merger the proxy said equity office would bring its vast portfolio vornado would bring its powerful balance sheet and cachet with wall street according to sources close to the negotiations and in an era in which dozens of real estate companies have been taken private eop or at least some of its assets could remain available to public investors through the capital markets an avenue frequently championed by mr zell after eop and vornado started their discussions vornado signed a confidentiality agreement and was allowed to perform due diligence on eops assets the proxy says yet by october discussions with vornado were deteriorating mr zell met with mr roth and indicated "he was highly skeptical that the two companies could agree on a transaction that would be beneficial" to eop shareholders according to the proxy an indication that price was the obstacle nonetheless mr roth pressed on asking that the company executives continue to meet the proxy said at least one more meeting was held nov but by that time blackstone was already feeling out eops bank merrill lynch about the price it would take to get the deal done merrill lynch suggested a price close to &# a share two weeks later blackstone clinched the deal the decision surprised vornado executives they simply didnt anticipate mr zells willingness to sell to the highest bidder and walk away according to people close to vornado as soon as the deal was announced however mr corl of investment firm cohen &amp steers announced that blackstones price was too low and predicted other bidders would come in mr zell had left an opening merrill lynch made clear to blackstone that the termination fee the amount that blackstone would receive if another unsolicited offer should be accepted by eop had to be low the proxy says the amount got whittled down during negotiations from blackstones original request of &# million to &# million setting the stage for vornados second chance ryan chittum contributed to this article
