house call doctor patient bond as a primary care internal medicine physician who has made house calls for the past years i found your report "green thumb finding doctors who will make house calls" money &amp investing jan to be factual and interesting but missing one critical point that affects both doctors and patients it isnt the physical event of a house call that is so greatly helpful for many ailing patients it is much more often the presence of a trusted doctor at the bedside who can help the patient and family make the right decisions a hired gun house call will produce a spur of the moment physician of uncertain credentials a doctor with litigation concerns a physician with no prior knowledge about medical history or a doctor businessman looking for payment for the time spent driving and talking often the final result may be a call to for the patient to be transported to an emergency room where expensive tests may clarify a diagnosis and where life sustaining procedures may be brought to an elderly person who had been ready for the end of life i have found that when a patient reaches out from his or her bed clutching my hand with a grip that is often surprisingly strong the payment for the doctor and the value for the patient isnt financial but is instead an intangible that comes from deep within the souls of both the doctor and the patient roger c dunham m d santa barbara calif there is no way an insurer can adequately compensate for a house call and i am embarrassed to charge a patient what i think the visit is really worth so i usually dont charge the patient or the insurance carrier anything i am sure that other primary care doctors also do the house call as an act of charity particularly when they visit the elderly sick the visit gives the doctor a chance to better understand the dynamics of the home situation and strengthen their relationships with their patients whether or not to charge for house calls is a very personal matter but at least for the elderly it seems that charging takes away from the physicians satisfaction in an inexplicable way i think it also lessens the physicians effectiveness edward j volpintesta m d bethel conn
