merkel energizes western links to russia after a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel russian president vladimir putin pledged to ensure smooth natural gas and oil supplies to europe just weeks after russia shut down an oil pipeline to the european union during a dispute with neighboring belarus the announcement after yesterdays meeting in sochi on russias black sea coast underscored ms merkels growing role as the linchpin in europes troubled relationship with russia its dominant energy supplier at a time when concerns about russias clout and direction are growing in an interview with the wall street journal last week ahead of her russia visit ms merkel made it clear she had no illusions about a relationship that has split the eu between countries that believe the eu should take a tougher line with moscow and those that favor a more pragmatic approach "irritations like those that have occurred should not be repeated " she said of this months oil supply interruption which hit germany poland hungary slovakia and the czech republic but she added "the fact remains that we wont be able to manage without russian gas and oil in europe and we dont want to either " with u k prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac both in the final months of their terms ms merkel a physicist by training from the former east germany is growing into a role as the go to person in europe and for other major international partners as well last week secretary of state condoleezza rice stopped in berlin to talk with ms merkel on her way back from a trip to the middle east the trip came shortly after ms merkel had visited washington and called for a revived effort by the "quartet" of america russia the eu and the united nations to secure peace in israels occupied territories also last week u s and north korean diplomats chose berlin for rare bilateral talks aimed at resolving the standoff over pyongyangs nuclear weapons program ms merkels status as europes most influential political actor is partly due to timing she holds the eus rotating presidency and this years chairmanship of the group of eight leading nations but her combination of plain speaking and bridge building has won her admirers on the international stage in addition germanys revived economy has restored the countrys status as the eus economic powerhouse ms merkel earned respect last year by solving a rancorous eu budget dispute between britain and france and by mending german american fences severely damaged when her predecessor gerhard schroeder fell out with president bush over the iraq war still ms merkel will need all her abilities to resolve differences both within the eu and between the eu and moscow over the relationship with russia in sochi mr putin said that to improve security of supply to the eu russia would seek to cut its dependence on transit routes through neighboring states such as belarus mr putin also said russia would speed up work on building a gas pipeline to germany under the baltic sea the baltic pipeline project however has caused divisions between germany and others in europe particularly poland precisely because it seeks to bypass poland belarus and other transit countries poland fears it would then become more vulnerable to political pressure from moscow because turning off the gas or oil to warsaw would no longer also mean switching off the supply to berlin and paris in the belarus case earlier this month russia shut the oil supply because belarus imposed transit fees in response to a pricing dispute with moscow a year ago a russian ukrainian pricing dispute also led to shortfalls in europes gas supply triggering a storm of concern over the eus dependence on russian energy the eu gets of its natural gas representing of its natural gas imports from russia in thursdays interview ms merkel said she wanted to "build a distribution network within the eu so that we can help each other in an emergency " an offer designed to ease polish fears over the baltic pipeline project at the same time she said the eu should aim to further diversify its sources and suppliers of energy ms merkel said she wanted to write a russian commitment to stable energy supplies into the eus year old cooperation treaty with russia which is due for renegotiation "regulating it by treaty in this way offers an opportunity to build trust " said ms merkel adding "its important to remember that apart from these irritations russia has been a stable energy supplier in europe over many decades also during the cold war " negotiations on a new so called permanent co operation agreement with russia were supposed to start late last year however poland has blocked the eu side from starting talks demanding that moscow first end a yearlong ban on meat imports from poland russia says there are continuing problems with polands meat certification system poland says the ban is political this week ms merkel heads to davos switzerland for the annual meeting of the world economic forum where she will present an ambitious agenda for the g this year items include global warming africas economic development and eu u s economic cooperation on her trip to washington ms merkel delivered a set of proposals on how to reduce nontariff barriers between europe and the u s she said in the interview that she still hopes the stalled doha round of world trade talks will succeed and that she prefers multilateral trade liberalization to a web of bilateral trade deals she stressed that she doesnt want her proposal for better functioning trans atlantic trade to be seen as a rival proposal to a world trade deal "doha is concerned with tariffs with trade barriers " she said while her proposals for trans atlantic trade are designed to reduce regulatory hurdles to trade she cited financial market regulations patent rules and auto emission standards as instances where "we inflict an unbelievable amount of costs on each other in accessing the american market and the european market " the fact that past proposals for a trans atlantic single market got nowhere doesnt deter her "business has a very great interest in this " she said "this is a big project you cant get through it in half a year but i want to establish it on the agenda at the eu u s summit and then we can take on points step by step "
