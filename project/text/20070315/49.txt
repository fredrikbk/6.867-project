laws are sketchy ms dunns health new california attorney general whats next u s justice department has a continuing investigation and could still bring charges "this is a complete surrender of the prosecution " said defense lawyer christine arguedas who represented h ps former general counsel ann baskins who wasnt charged "there was nobody involved in this who ever thought they were doing anything illegal " the resolution was driven by santa clara county calif superior court judge ray cunningham who recently told the defendants he would dismiss all charges if they agreed not to contest a single misdemeanor count of fraudulent wire communications said a person familiar with the matter in december then california attorney general bill lockyer made a similar offer to the defendants but he demanded they plead guilty an offer they declined this person said meanwhile californias newly elected attorney general jerry brown endorsed the judges formula which was finalized in court yesterday mr brown is the former governor of california and former mayor of oakland in the unusual arrangement three of the four defendants former h p ethics lawyer kevin hunsaker and private investigators ronald delia and matthew depante agreed not to contest the states single misdemeanor charge and judge cunningham told them he would dismiss the count after the three men performed hours of community service as for ms dunn the judge dismissed all charges outright in consideration of her continuing battle with cancer defense lawyers said "i have always had faith that the truth would win out and justice would be served and it has been " ms dunn said a spokesman for mr brown nathan barankin said the california attorney general believes dismissing all charges against ms dunn is "appropriate " because of her "level of involvement" in h ps spying affair and "her current health condition " mr barankin also said he sent out a misleading press release early yesterday incorrectly stating that the four defendants were expected to plead guilty to the misdemeanor charge resolution of the state charges doesnt affect the u s justice departments continuing investigation of the h p affair in january the state dismissed its criminal case against another defendant bryan wagner after he pleaded guilty to federal charges relating to his role in the case u s prosecutors said then that they were continuing to investigate others in the matter "by all indications the feds are moving forward " said a person familiar with the case their next step this person said is likely to involve florida based action research group the investigative firm that subcontracted the actual "pretexting" work for h p the h p scandal erupted in september largely as a result of earlier complaints by director thomas perkins about h ps actions in investigating the possibility that board members had leaked confidential information that month h p disclosed that external investigators retained by the company had used pretexting gaining access to private phone records through false pretences to spy on board members employees reporters and others mr perkins resigned from the board in anger at ms dunn last spring yesterday he said "the attorney general and the court have fashioned a most appropriate resolution of this case my thoughts and hopes continue to be with pattie dunn in her courageous battle against cancer " an adviser to ms dunn who has suffered three types of cancer including ovarian said he saw her last week and she appeared well the h p scandal resulted in the resignations of ms dunn as chairman and of board member george keyworth as well as several h p executives ms dunn was succeeded as chairman by h p chief executive mark hurd who acknowledged having known that private phone records were being scrutinized in h ps leak investigation but he said he thought such records were openly available on the internet in december h p agreed to pay &# million to settle civil claims brought by the then california attorney general lockyer against the company h p based in palo alto calif has largely recovered from the boardroom scandal although its reputation took a beating last year when the brouhaha erupted since september the stock has risen slightly closing yesterday at &# up cents in p m new york stock exchange composite trading in its most recent quarterly earnings report last month the company posted an increase in revenue and a jump in net income as it posted growth across its vast portfolio of businesses which include printers personal computers and software mr hurd remains widely admired in addition to their wavering new boss mr brown state prosecutors were hamstrung by a judge who didnt believe the defendants conduct was felonious said a person familiar with the case prosecutors also faced other challenges for one because ms dunn and the others received attorneys advice that pretexting was legal it would have been difficult to show they knowingly committed any crime nor would it have been easy to paint the defendants as nefarious as they didnt gain financially from the pretexting activity and they used the information to pursue a legitimate purpose ferreting out boardroom leakers the legal developments were disclosed yesterday before the start of h ps annual meeting where a closely watched shareholder proposal that would make it possible for stockholders to nominate directors a measure partly prompted by the scandal was on the agenda the measure proposed by several pension funds and opposed by h p was ultimately voted down by of shares voted some of shares voted supported the measure which centered around "proxy access " or the right to put competing board candidates on a companys proxy materials activist shareholders have pushed the idea as a way to increase director accountability companies generally oppose it saying it would lead to unnecessary and costly elections h p was regarded as a test case of the issue two other shareholder proposals that h p opposed did make it through one was to link executive compensation to performance while the other asked the h p board to bring any future "poison pill" measures to a shareholder vote the proposals are nonbinding meaning the company isnt required to adopt the measures meanwhile in response to a shareholder concern over h ps board mr hurd said the company needs to transform the board and will continue to look for the best board members possible "let me assure you no one is proud of what happened last year no one " mr hurd said "you have my commitment that we will do the hard work to deliver you a board you can be proud of " donna fuscaldo contributed to this article
