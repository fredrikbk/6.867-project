heart care weakens on weekends study shows fewer angioplasties done an issue of staffing for the hundreds of thousands of americans who will have a heart attack this year doctors have a simple piece of advice dont do it on the weekend thats the take home message of a large study that found heart attack patients admitted to a hospital on saturday and sunday are at greater risk of dying than those admitted monday through friday the report which reviewed outcomes of more than patients hospitalized over a year period found that those admitted on the weekend were also less likely to be treated with the invasive cardiac procedure known as angioplasty that is recommended by heart specialists the studys lead author william kostis a researcher and fourth year medical student at the university of medicine &amp dentistry of new jerseys robert wood johnson medical school said the findings suggest that the higher mortality on weekends is linked to the lower rate of angioplasty procedures the study says better access to cardiac care on the weekends could shrink the gap in mortality previous studies have found links between weekend hospital admission and less aggressive medical care but because of its size and scope the new study published in the new england journal of medicine today "is the strongest " says donald redelmeier a professor of medicine at the university of toronto who has conducted his own research on the topic the american heart association says that in the latest year for which data are available adults in the u s had heart attacks and more than were fatal overall coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the u s and in adults caused one out of every five deaths the new study analyzed the records of patients admitted to new jersey hospitals for a first acute myocardial infarction or heart attack from to the data were divided into four year intervals and researchers focused on the most recent data from when the newest types of cardiac interventions became more widely available in that group of more than admissions even after adjusting for various patient characteristics and types of heart attacks researchers found there was a increase in mortality associated with weekend admissions compared with weekday admissions patients admitted on the weekend also were one third less likely to receive "percutaneous coronary intervention " or pci which is angioplasty with or without placement of a stent on the day of or the day after admission this is important researchers said because early intervention is critical for heart attack victims the study found differences in mortality were statistically significant as early as the day after admission and persisted days and one year later researchers concluded the disparity accounts for nine to additional deaths per admissions annually they also say there is no reason to believe the experience among new jersey patients is any different in other parts of the country dr redelmeier who wrote an editorial accompanying the study says the problem comes down to staffing "all you have to do is take an aerial photo of a hospital parking lot on a sunday morning and a monday morning to see the difference " he says on the weekends he says the staff is often smaller spread thinner with less oversight and fewer senior doctors working but dr redelmeier adds there are several possible solutions including adding staff capable of administering primary coronary interventions on weekends and paying premium wages for weekend work but beefing up staff is expensive says thomas lee network president at partners health care system in boston "do you want to pay to have a cath lab team in the hospital " dr lee said in an interview accompanying the study "it would raise the cost of health care for everyone " doctors say they dont want the study to be misinterpreted by people experiencing heart attacks on the weekend "if they have symptoms they should not wait " dr kostis said "it would be a big mistake to wait for monday morning "
