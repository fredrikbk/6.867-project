cricket clarified out in in out out in not out mitch tedeschis march letter in response tunku varadarajans march leisure &amp arts article "it may not bowl over yanks but cricket is a manly game" complains that cricket has "seemingly incomprehensible rules " i would like to share a synopsis of the rules as printed on a tea towel i used to have as a child while the following does actually make sense bear in mind that even as an englishman who grew up playing cricket i can see why it may add to the confusion surrounding the game the basic "rules" of cricket you have two sides one out in the field and one in each man thats in the side thats in goes out and when hes out he comes in and the next man goes in until hes out when they are all out the side thats out comes in and the side thats been in goes out and tries to get those coming in out sometimes you get men still in and not out when both sides have been in and out including the not outs thats the end of the game james r p hall new york
