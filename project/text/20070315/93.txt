stupid cancer statistics prevailing wisdom among both physicians and patients favors diagnosing lung cancer before it escapes the lung just as most women and their doctors want to know about breast cancer before it spreads beyond the breast though still controversial among some researchers this early detection strategy is not only in the best interest of the patient it also saves health care dollars and relieves patient suffering no one questions the fact that ct scans of the lung aid in early detection chest x rays often miss primary lung cancers before they are at least one centimeter in size and have often spread beyond the lung ct scans routinely discover malignant lesions that are just a few millimeters in size the question that has caused controversy is whether discovering these lesions so early actually saves lives or as the new england journal of medicine study from last fall based on screens seemed to show merely extends survival from time of diagnosis survival data can be misleading since if a cancer is found earlier the amount of time to death may be longer even if the treatment makes no difference by contrast a study just published in the journal of the american medical association analyzing data from the mayo clinic and elsewhere looked at asymptomatic smokers and used mathematical models to determine that screening did not appear to decrease their short term risk of dying of lung cancer but both studies are limited by statistical analysis or mathematical modeling thus longer term double blinded randomized trials will be needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn mortality rate alone however is the wrong study endpoint and the wrong approach to practicing medicine the real question as it was for the breast during the mammogram controversy a few years ago is if the cancer can be detected before it escapes the lung this is the only chance for a surgical cure and whether or not eradicating the disease before it spreads extends life as most experts believe it does it most certainly affects quality of life by the time a lung cancer is seen on an x ray it is almost always too widespread to be operated on hence the only chance for a cure is finding it before it has spread via a screening ct scan it is true that smokers have more false positives because of difficult to interpret irregularities and so the question of how to interpret an abnormal ct scan involves the art of medicine it is important to know who is the best chest radiologist to read the scan and who can best perform a needle biopsy or bronchoscopy when either is necessary this strategy should be in place before the test is ordered having the best team available to order and interpret results is not a factor that can be weighed or studied in clinical research but a ct report that tells me to repeat it in six months or a needle biopsy for an irregular uncalcified nodule performed by a discerning expert is far better for a clinician like me to have in hand then no ct scan or biopsy at all my patients want to know if they have cancer as early in the process as possible and they want a plan to treat it they dont want to have to rely on mathematical projections or statistics about "hypothetical" death rates when my patient mr "azziz " a two pack per day smoker for more than years reached the age of i decided to order a screening ct scan the results showed a nodule at the top of his left lung a common place for lung cancer the biopsy showed squamous cell a common type of cancer that is often fatal but since the diagnosis was made early he was in a group where there is a greater than chance of a cure with surgery there was no evidence of spread to lymph nodes or beyond the lung and the surgery and follow up chemotherapy were successful it is now five years later and mr azziz has not suffered a recurrence if i had not screened him his aggressive cancer would almost certainly have spread beyond the lung then he would have been facing metastases to the liver which might have been barely operable or to the bone or brain which wouldnt have curable by surgery either way even if he continued to live with his cancer his life would almost certainly have been wracked with pain and chained to debilitating expensive treatments as opposed to his current life which is happy and independent even if studies someday show that a patient like mr azziz could live just as long without the kind of state of the art screening that i offered him the real question is what kind of life would it be dr siegel a practicing internist and an associate professor at the nyu school of medicine is the author of "false alarm the truth about the epidemic of fear" wiley see related letters "letters to the editor the debate continues on cancer treatment therapies and statistics" wsj march
