donor compensation could solve kidney transplant shortage your page one article "more kidneys for transplants may go to young" march highlights a crisis of our own making i was fortunate enough to receive a transplanted kidney from my daughter six years ago my life was saved while others died while waiting for a kidney because of an allocation process that is terribly misguided albeit well intentioned making choices between older and younger patients isnt a solution it merely trades one set of inequities for another there is however a sensible solution today it is a felony for a kidney donor to receive any form of compensation it is assumed that compensated donors would be poor and forced in desperation to sell a body part to someone rich enough to pay for an organ that would be terrible and should be unacceptable to everyone however millions of individuals are perfectly capable of making a rational well reasoned decision to have a safe laparoscopic procedure that usually requires a to hour hospital stay in return for financial assistance that could make a real difference in that individuals life everyone would benefit the recipient the donor the hospital and the taxpayer actuarially a kidney donors life expectancy is unaltered by the donation of a kidney and life insurance premiums are the same for a person with two kidneys as for a person who has donated a kidney we can all understand the ethical concern that the disadvantaged not be exploited and we would have to develop a screening process that eliminated such exploitation but the policy that forbids compensation to a kidney donor is turned on its head when one considers that people will die in the service of that policy harold gershowitz chicago gee we dont even have socialized medicine yet and we already have the government deciding that some people arent worth keeping alive e l gelhaar millbrae calif why not create a system that provides all of the kidneys that can be put to good use why are fewer than kidneys recovered from deceased donors every year when millions die with healthy kidneys why not use the marketplace to provide strong financial incentives to those who will their organs for medical use this could take the form of cash payments to donors or their heirs or by compensation in the form of health or life insurance for these donors while living there are undoubtedly those who would prefer that people die without kidney replacement rather than allow anyone in the system to make money providing them they must not be allowed to stand in the way richard e ralston executive director americans for free choice in medicine newport beach calif
