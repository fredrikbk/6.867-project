western whims sink japan stocks heavy investment from abroad makes markets vulnerable tokyo yesterdays selloff here put a fundamental weakness of the japanese stock market into focus it is one of the largest in the world but sometimes acts like just another emerging market like some of the tiniest markets in developing countries japans stock market is heavily dependent on foreign investors the result when foreigners are active buyers the japanese market surges when they lose appetite the market nose dives "foreigners really set the tone whether its a bull market or a bear market " says patrick mohr director of equity research at nikko citigroup in tokyo when western investors start selling in their home markets they are likely to also start selling stocks in markets such as japan he says after tuesdays drop in major u s indexes the nikkei stock average of companies fell yesterday amid concerns that investors from the west would further withdraw from riskier investments overseas in early trading today the nikkei was up about after gains of less than in the u s the japanese market also fell more steeply than others following the bigger global slide that began in late february as u s and european investors moved cash into safer assets close to home such as government bonds the nikkei fell from feb to march compared with the fall for the broad standard &amp poors stock index in the u s and a drop for the ftse index in london the nikkei has recouped since march to close at yesterday that is similar to the gain in the s&amp p while the ftse slipped less than in the period tokyo is the second largest stock market in the world after new york in market value of domestically listed companies but risk averse japanese investors despite their huge financial assets have sold more shares than they have bought in recent years in contrast foreign investors have been net buyers of japanese stocks every year since as they have tried to cash in on the nations economic expansion after a slump in the s and early s last year foreign investors accounted for a record of the value of shares traded on japans top three stock exchanges in tokyo osaka and nagoya analysts say foreign investors likely will continue to sell japanese shares over the next several weeks even if their recent aversion to risk starts to dissolve some investors are concerned that japanese corporate earnings which have been strong for the past five years as the economy expanded may lose momentum in the fiscal year that begins in april in part because of a slowdown in the u s economy a rebound in the yens value in the past few days also generated worries that earnings of japans big exporters would be eroded if the yens rise makes their products less competitive overseas others are growing impatient about what they perceive to be a recent slackening in japans efforts in economic reform some companies have adopted antitakeover measures resisting a world wide mergers and acquisitions trend that investors say would boost efficiency in many industries here another concern the japanese government is considering beefing up measures to help the poor amid growing criticism of a widening income gap investors are worried that the government may pressure companies to raise wages or enhance employee benefits which in turn may crimp companies earnings "there is a possibility the nikkei may hit a second bottom under in april " masatoshi kikuchi merrill lynch &amp co s equity strategist in tokyo said even before yesterdays decline foreign investors scaled back on buying japanese stocks last year with net purchases totaling trillion yen &# billion last year down from trillion yen in their purchases had picked up since late last year until the latest market downturn japans individual investors meanwhile are unlikely to pick up the slack anytime soon despite the recent economic expansion most japanese investors still are reluctant to put their money in stocks unable to shake off bitter memories of the bear market just a few years ago that wiped out three quarters of the market value of the nikkeis stocks at one point instead japanese investors have opted for more stable investments like bank deposits and bonds a big hit in recent years has been mutual funds that invest in high yielding foreign bonds which account for roughly two thirds of japans overall mutual fund assets many investors also have flocked to trading currencies using borrowed money with a majority betting on a weakening in the japanese yen against the dollar and the euro last year shares sold by individual investors on japans top three exchanges exceeded their purchases by trillion yen up slightly from trillion yen of net sales in japanese banks brokerage firms and life insurers also were large net sellers of stocks offsetting buying by japanese mutual funds and corporate shareholders to be sure japans individual investors have increased their presence in the stock market by other measures the number of japanese individual shareholders rose to million in from million in according to the tokyo exchange the total volume of transactions by individuals on the top three exchanges last year was more than double the level in but the heavy volume suggests that many of these individuals were trading for the short term analysts say many japanese change their holdings every few weeks or even more frequently chasing stocks with significant price moves unlike in the u s only a small portion of individual investors in japan buy individual stocks or stock mutual funds to fund retirement or to save for their childrens college education some of these short term investors apparently saw a buying opportunity when the market tumbled in late february in the week ended march the most recent data available net purchases by individual investors totaled billion yen though selling by foreigners and japanese financial institutions more than offset the buying analysts say individuals probably were active buyers again yesterday "every time the market falls we see individuals rush in to hunt for bargains " says yosuke shimizu general manager of the investment information department at monex inc one of japans leading online brokerage firms "when it goes up a bit they sell to lock in profits " highlights of the tse may first public trading institution in japan tokyo
