me to speak to their group if i didnt have a conflict i can honestly say weve never turned anyone down ive spoken to thousands and ive spoken to eight " gary blair coach of seed texas a&amp m was more straightforward in his approach to increasing interest in his program just before the end of the regular season mr blair said students should put the books aside and support his team writes robert cessna of the bryan college station eagle a team that has been vocal about its unhappiness with the first round site is george washington coach joe mckeown said he was disappointed with being the seed

lost to north carolina the regions top seed on a late basket by ivory latta in and lost to georgia the regions third seed in unfortunately for purdue god may be on its first round opponents side the boilermakers are matched up against no oral roberts in the first round and elisha turek of golden eagles has been on church missions in "honduras mexico dominican republic france jamaica iceland denmark and germany " writes mike carmin for indianas journal and courier north carolina and its coach sylvia hatchell will likely have something to say about this region and if they dont what to say the coach can use one of the "quote books upon quote books stashed in her office " writes rachel carter in the raleigh news &amp observer ms hatchell doesnt always use the shelved comments she often makes up her words and phrases such as "you need to rememberize this " dayton the dayton regional is arguably the toughest bracket in the womens tournament seed tennessee the defending national champion maryland terrapins big winner oklahoma and big ten titan ohio state will be battling for one spot in the final four "this region is very very stacked but am i surprised absolutely not " tennessee coach pat summitt told doug feinberg of the associated press "id have been surprised if it hadnt been theres a lot of great teams obviously in our bracket and yet theres no easy bracket in womens basketball these days " marylands team has won the tournament before and returned all five starters though the team lost both meetings against duke and north carolina this year to finish third in the atlantic coast conference the washington posts marc carig writes that the terrapins "seem confident entering what they hope is a successful defense of the national championship " "i like where were at " maryland coach brenda frese told mr carig "were hungry this season has humbled us more and defensively weve made tremendous strides " ohio state the big ten regular season champion will be looking to prove that it is better than a seed and can win games without senior guard brandie hoskins sidelined with a ruptured achilles tendon "im shocked " ms hoskins told the columbus dispatchs jim massie after the team received its seeding "when we were winning games it was ohio state now one player goes down and they disrespect the whole program " with players like foot senior center jessica davenport the buckeyes have the ability to put up a good fight in four seasons with the buckeyes ms davenport is the only player in conference history to record more than points rebounds and blocked shots writes mr massie oklahoma is coming off a win in the big conference tournament and has a roster including courtney paris one of the top rebounders in the country and veteran leah rush who traditionally shines in the postseason writes john helsley of the oklahoman "rushs career postseason scoring average is points nearly two points higher than her overall average beyond that tangible number she delivers a toughness and grit and attitude all offshoots of that competitive edge built on the blacktops of amarillo texas where she was also known to dip a shoulder into some unsuspecting guy playing roller hockey " while the top seeds have grabbed most of the headlines none of the teams in this regional should be counted out seed middle tennessee state has had straight wins while james madison university making its first appearance in the tournament since and pitt making its first appearance ever have reason to prove themselves and harvard which was at one point has caused an upset before consider the harvard team the los angeles times jim barrero writes "that group pulled off the biggest upset in tournament history when it defeated stanford in the first round the only time a no seeded team men or women has defeated a no " fresno call the fresno regional the storyline bracket even if it lacks the punch of dayton this regional is full of subplots that could inspire a screenplay and the teams involved in these storylines are pretty good too to start with theres north carolina state no and its legendary coach in a poignant piece ms carter of the aforementioned news &amp observer tells the story "today is kay yows th birthday and its the first day of another four week cycle of chemotherapy and biologic treatments thats enough for anybody but thursday yows family buries her father " ms yow who ranks fifth all time in ncaa division i with career wins missed games this season as she battled cancer which was first diagnosed two decades ago and recurred during the season but since she returned to the sidelines the wolfpack have won of and one thing is for sure the wolfpack who square off against seed robert morris in the first round are capable of making a run at the title having already knocked off duke and north carolina this season then there is louisiana state university no the lady tigers enter the tournament under an avalanche of attention focused not on the teams attempt to make its fourth consecutive final four but on the resignation of coach pokey chatman amid allegations of an inappropriate relationship with a former player of the situation the new york daily news filip bondy writes "from the look of things the tigers probably werent going to advance to their fourth straight final four this spring now however there is nothing but confusion and soul searching in baton rouge as chatman has fled the scene and everybody tries to put together the pieces of an unpleasant puzzle " yet while the media focuses on that story the players led by junior center and national player of the year candidate sylvia fowles hope their play "returns the conversation to what is happening on the court " says the new york times karen crouse fresno also has the university of maryland baltimore county which is a cinderella story even before playing its first tournament game umbc no was not supposed to make the tournament they ended the regular season with a losing record and entered the american east tournament as the seventh seed no seventh seed had ever won the conferences tournament but as so often happens in march umbc started winning and before the players knew it they had qualified for their first ncaa tournament as an opinion piece in the baltimore sun said "forget the glass slippers and prince charmings the retrievers work their own brand of magic " yet if any of these teams is to advance out of the fresno region the road will go through connecticut no or stanford no two of the great programs in womens college basketball and both teams have a front court player who should key her teams success in storrs conn freshman center tina charles "arrived on campus to plenty of hype and has done nothing but live up to those expectations " writes william s paxton of the connecticut post meanwhile at stanford the cardinals dominant inside player last year senior brooke smith has been transformed into a perimeter player due to injuries and has made the transition look easy "those pretty hooks have become increasingly scarce in smiths final season as she has become a perimeter scorer a perimeter defender and ball distributor " writes michelle smith of the san francisco chronicle greensboro perennial powerhouse dukes seed came as no surprise after a regular season yet even among a team of all stars one player stands out lindsey harding widely acclaimed as the best point guard in the nation duke is promoting the speedy ms harding who averages points rebounds assists and steals per game with a poster showing the chinese
