john adamss book collection provides insight into the man adams unbound boston public library through april boston the celtics arent much and the patriots watched the super bowl on television but the boston public library is as hot as a pistol "adams unbound " the bpls exhibition of the books owned by americas second president is packing them in at copley square john adamss library volumes in all is the star of the show but the collectors spirit infuses the paper leather and vellum on the shelves adams was indeed unbound the least inhibited of the founding fathers he said what was on his mind quite unlike the tactically silent franklin jefferson or washington and he talked back to the authors of his books too rebutting or refuting or cheering them on down the margins of their own pages anticipating the st century adams saw that the book was an interactive medium of communication digital or analog of course a book is mute and motionless not even the library of a presidential bookworm would seem to constitute a natural tourist magnet but the bpl and its design consultant c&amp g partners of new york have made something dramatic of these inert volumes which are stacked feet high against the walls or lie open to a well chosen page under glass visitors of whom there have been since the exhibit opened on sept it will remain open through april come away with a new sense of john adams man and bibliophile in that order this is a wonderful exhibit not least in the ingenuity of its design it owes its plan of organization to a adams diary entry "fame fortune power say some are the ends intended by a library " wrote the year old boston lawyer and soon to be thorn in the side of the british empire "the service of god country clients fellow men say others which of these lie nearest my heart " you can judge for yourself which of these motives if any drove adams to a lifetime of collecting "fortune" is a clear nonstarter though he was the busiest lawyer in massachusetts before the revolution adams never got rich he certainly didnt buy books to build his net worth he bought them because he loved them and because he wanted to learn something about the law and religion and later about the not very lucrative occupations of warfare statecraft and diplomacy it was abigail the brainy mrs adams who understood the power of compound interest and who had the bright idea of investing in interest bearing bonds adams himself preferred nonyielding assets the unrepaying heavily taxed farmland of his hometown of quincy mass for example or his great wall of books yet in spite of himself adams turned out to be a more than fair bibliographic investor among his accessions is one of only copies of the first french translation of the constitutions of the brand new american states published in under arrangement of benjamin franklin also on display is one of the rarest of the rare early editions of adam smiths "wealth of nations " a two volume production dated did adams talk back to adam smith beth prindle lead librarian on the adams exhibition regrets to report that he did not neither did he fence with john locke in the margins of "two treatises on government " nor with thomas hutchinson arch tory author of "the history of the colony and province of massachusetts bay " more than years ago one of the boston public librarys scholar librarians zoltan haraszti wrote a whole book on adamss marginal jottings "john adams and the prophets of progress " visitors to "adams unbound" will appreciate how much material mr haraszti had to work with in one title alone a treatment of the french revolution by the english blue stocking mary wollstonecraft adams deposited of his own words few of them flattering toward the author mr haraszti focused on adamss conflict with the french philosophes but "adams unbound" manages to present the full range of the collectors moods and interests yes adams made notes and practiced equations in the margins of the first volume of isaac newtons "the method of fluxions and infinite series " but he also owned books on beer making and slug worms and he sulked when he considered how little acclaim he had earned for his patrotic sacrifices in comparison to say thomas jefferson adams read and collected voraciously and eclectically in eight languages counting english and almost without regard to expense he picked up a four volume set of "don quixote" in spain in though the added weight of this accession could not have gladdened the heart of the mule on whose back he crossed the pyrenees there is evidence to suggest that the incorruptible adams pinched at least three of the volumes in this collection according to ms prindle then again to quote from the "adams unbound" catalog "adamss law books were in constant demand and he often loaned them out to friends and clerks " no habitual book thief knowing his own black heart would be so trusting of others as a writer adams lost his bearings in long work but excelled at short distances the marginal outburst exactly played to his strengths "if there ever existed a wise fool a learned idiot a profound dupe too it was david hume " he wrote of that eminent philosopher in the margins of wollstonecrafts "historical and moral view of the origin and progress of the french revolution " "there never was is not and never will be more than one being in the universe capable of comprehending it " he jotted in response to an author who thought too much of human reason and too little of god in at age adams willed most of his books to a contemplated adams academy in quincy the school was finally built in but the scholars seemed not to honor the gift which sat exposed on open shelves and the collection was soon moved to another quincy depository it came to rest at last at the boston public library in it was a close drawn thing that adamss beloved books survived the revolution cash was short in when john ordered abigail to go to any lengths to pay the familys tax bill if you have to he told her sell the library adams loved his books but he loved his country more mr grant is the author most recently of "john adams party of one" farrar straus
