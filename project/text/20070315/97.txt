and then left the arena in stunned silence try telling that to dirk nowitzki who seemed to have his first mvp award in lockdown only to watch steve nash steal the game and maybe the trophy too and try telling that to the giddy suns who were given a harsh reminder of what itll take to win an nba title better rebounding and defense and yet somehow left dallas with a statement victory " on true hoop henry abbott offers a slew of observations about the game including this scouting report on the potential western conference playoffs "if you replayed this game a whole bunch of times and i pray we do in the playoffs i have a feeling the mavericks end up winning the majority of the time sure the deep bench is a big factor because you just know one or more suns will be banged up before they make it to the western conference finals but even more than that when phoenix was rolling it was like they were defying gravity one miracle after another when dallas was rolling they were just being efficient

fakery still had a certain innocence "there were endless debates over who got lucky who got robbed we wondered who the masked wrestlers from mexico really were they went by names such as el medico and
