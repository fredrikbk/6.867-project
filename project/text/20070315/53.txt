its march madness meet the mens field online edition heres a look at teams and players to watch in the mens college basketball tournament with links to the webs best writing about the field midwest since hoops coach billy donovans arrival at the university of florida some gator football fans would shrug off a disappointing season at the swamp with a quick joke about being "a basketball school " this joke is now out of date the defending champions and seed basketball gators may now consider themselves a marked team and according to junior joakim noah are well aware of the "haters " his quip helps the gainesville suns pat dooley illustrate how coach donovan just wants these guys to enjoy the moment "hating" is something mr noah who by now is used to a chorus of "you suck" and "youre ugly" taunts and signs knows fairly well but try hating him after reading this article by cbs sportslines gary parrish "you see a miss sweden for a mom and you hate it you see a french open champion for a dad and you hate it you see the bouncing ponytail for a hairdo and you hate it too but if you could ever get past that stuff youd see that when the games are over and the tv cameras turned off noah transforms from the jabbering face of the reigning national champions and into perhaps the most gracious polite and approachable superstar imaginable " while the seed will be traveling more than miles to new orleans the seed wisconsin badgers will take a two hour jaunt down i to chicago to what tom mulhern of the wisconsin state journal calls their "home away from home " badger guard alando tucker who will suit up at the united center for the eighth time on friday believes being closer to home makes a big difference if only for the fan support "the uw players have little doubt their fans as usual will find a way to get their hands on enough tickets to make for an overwhelming home crowd advantage starting with fridays game against seed texas a&amp m corpus christi " writes mr mulhern chicago will also feature the return of the unlv rebels who havent won an ncaa tournament game since the tasty towel days and this time instead of having its success clouded by accusations of various ncaa violations the seed might have you appreciate a kinder gentler rebel take the family friendly story of point guard kevin kruger who took advantage of a short lived rule that allowed him to transfer from arizona state to play for his pop veteran coach lon kruger "its a feel good story in a town where not all stories end so well a son with one year of college ball left uses it to play for his father for the first time in his career and together the two help resurrect a once vaunted program " writes tim dahlberg of the associated press kevin is "an extension of his father on the court " and a "big reason unlv is this year " returning now to tournament teams actually in the geographic midwest youll find four that hail from the hoosier state and yes the hoosiers are in but theyre not in this part of the bracket the other three are purdue seed notre dame seed and butler which boasts the highest seed of the four indiana teams but even though the bulldogs carry an impressive record with nice wins over the likes of the irish gonzaga and tennessee theyre coming off a surprising loss in the horizon league final to wright state and butlers first round opponent old dominion is on a hot streak writes david woods of the indianapolis star the th seeded monarchs which deadspin says may have college basketballs worst collective long distance bill have won of their last old dominion is "paced by lithuanian sharpshooter valdas vasylius and tough ivory coaster arnaud dahi seven foot three sam harris is a work in progress who hails from the island of tasmania " pens eric angevine west kansas is the top seed out west but number two ucla gets to stay close to home and bruins coach ben howland gets a trip down memory lane coming off an overtime loss to cal in the first game in the pac ten tournament the bruins will face mr howlands alma mater seed weber st on thursday night in san jose theyre already calling the west the "ben howland regional " writes dian pucin in the los angeles times mr howland met his wife kim at weber where she was a cheerleader and he played on the basketball team the bruins are on track for a reappearance in the final four says mark blaudschun in the boston globe and on the way they may run into pittsburgh the team howland left for ucla after four years in when his protege coach jamie dixon took over mr blaudschun sees ucla getting past kansas in the elite eight what the seed jayhawks cant win "not in california and not against a ucla team that wants to get what it didnt last year a national championship " even after first round exits in each of the last two seasons an opening round loss for kansas would still be unprecedented the jayhawks will face play in winner and seed niagara on thursday and seeds are all time writes rick plumlee in the wichita eagle and the jayhawks are coming off a strong year in which they beat defending national champ florida and twice came from behind to beat big rival texas the second time last sunday netted them the conference championship last year mr howlands bruins sent gonzaga where mr howland got his coaching start and all america forward adam morrison home in the sweet this year if the seed zags turn back indiana and mr howlands team beats weber st theyll meet in a widely anticipated rematch this isnt the same gonzaga though mr morrison is gone as is center j p batista the team lost four in a row in december and a few weeks later standout center josh heytvelt was arrested for felony drug possession the team rallied back in a late season surge winning both the wcc regular season and tournament titles writes greg johns in the seattle post intelligencer asking "does this year gonzagas most losses since signal the start of a gradual decline or was this a natural step back from the recent glory run and the zags are just regrouping " duke haters love that the seed blue devils are no sure thing in the first round against seed virginia commonwealth university dont overlook vcu warns rob daniels at the greensboro news record the rams went this year "nearly as many wins as anybody in the field " the team arrive at the dance with regular season and tournament championships in their league which also produced at large entrant old dominion and vcus new coach anthony grant won an ncaa championship as a florida assistant last year duke might be overrated at its lowest seeding since dan wetzel goes further at yahoo sports "not since the mid to late s has mike krzyzewski fielded a team with such a limit of pure talent granted this is by dukes standard most teams in america would be quite pleased with and the blue devils roster but in duke historic terms this team lacks a game breaking scorer depth great athletic ability and experience " on thursday holy cross regular underdog and winner of the patriot league conference will square off against southern illinois another familiar long shot thats suddenly a seed this year and so grappling with expectations "weve got to come out and play like were the underdogs still just play hard play our game and not really worry about what seed we have " saluki point guard bryan mullins told robert crow of the southern illinoisan holy cross a seed that won of their past games made the tournament four times in the past seven seasons losing by four points both to kentucky in and marquette two years later associated press writer jim suhr expects a slugfest "southern holding its highest seed ever in the tournament and ranked no in the latest ap poll is the nations third stingiest defense allowing just points while the crusaders yield just points sixth lowest in the country " east top seed north carolina streaking georgetown and texas which has the best player in the country make this region among the toughest if not the most difficult the tar heels come into the ncaa tournament having beaten archrival duke in the last regular season game and winning three games in a row to take the acc tournament but the heels are bruised and battered especially their most productive player tyler hansbrough who had to wear a face mask after getting a broken nose courtesy of dukes gerald henderson "hansbroughs confidence is clearly shaken while playing with the mask he has donned for the past three games " notes jeff goodman on foxsports com "but while hansbrough struggled his teammates picked up the slack and made sure that the tar heels will enter the big dance with momentum and confidence " awaiting unc assuming the heels get past eastern kentucky will be the winner of the game between michigan state and marquette this matchup has gotten an unusual amount of attention for an versus seed game because of the coaches involved both named tom but that isnt the half of it "crean was izzos top assistant in east lansing and the two share the same physical approach to the game " writes newsday columnist joe gergen in examining some of the "sweet matchups" at the big dance "it wouldnt be a stretch if the officials just tossed a football onto the court and let them go at it " potentially looming for one of these teams in the regional finals is fourth seeded texas and its star player kevin durant if the longhorns can get by new mexico state and the winner of the southern cal arkansas game writing in the dallas morning news columnist tim cowlishaw asks if durant can do for texas what carmelo anthony did as a freshman in the tournament four years ago when he led syracuse to the title "durant certainly is every bit the player anthony was as a freshman " he states "anthony was a second team all american durant will make every first team and deserves player of the year consideration " vinnie iyer of the sporting news for one is going with durant and the longhorns to win it all this year arkansas almost didnt get invited to the big dance this year the razorbacks werent even considered a bubble team by many college basketball analysts making it all the more surprising when they did get in even the team was caught off guard "most of arkansas players were asleep on the flight back home from the sec tournament on sunday night when the pilot made an announcement over the intercom " recounts alex abrams in the fort smith times record "he started with the standard speech for the coaches and players to put their seats and tray tables in their upright positions but then he slipped in a line that caught everyone by surprise he goes oh by the way youll be playing usc in the ncaa tournament arkansas center steven hill said with a grin it was really exciting " enough so that the players let out a "hog call" on the plane in the bottom half of the bracket georgetown is favored as a seed the hoyas who play belmont are among the hottest teams in the country right now having beaten pittsburgh to win the big east tournament while mr iyer is taking texas "ive got georgetown " claims michael wilbon of the washington post "give me the team that has won of its past games give me the team that played eventual champion florida tougher than any team in last years tournament nobody else has the talent intelligence discipline depth size experience and balance of georgetown and nobody this season anyway has been better coached " so who is their coach you ask none other than john thomson iii son of the legendary georgetown coach who led his team to the championship in another showdown of the coaches could happen between mr thompson and bobby knight who coaches at texas tech his red raiders might face the hoyas in the second round if they get by boston college in the first round that may be easier said than done according to jeff walker of the lubbock avalanche journal subscription required "the red raiders and head coach bob knight have a small history with their destination for the first two rounds " mr walker explains "tech has played one ncaa tournament game in winston salem n c and knight has coached one tournament team in winston salem both tournament appearances ended in first round defeats though in by tech and in by knights indiana squad " playing in sacramento against oral roberts third seeded washington state will be favored likely getting a boost from its nearby fan base "unless your favorite colors are purple and gold like the washington huskies its difficult to find anything to dislike about the washington state cougars " says everett daily herald columnist john sleeper "the cougars are the polar opposite of the miami hurricanes football team just a year separated from an season losing is never out of their minds which brings about a refreshing humility rarely seen in big time college sports " if they win the cougars will play the winner of the game between george washington and vanderbilt a team that has come a long way since losing to "unheralded" furman in november writes maurice patton in the nashville tennessean "though vanderbilt did have other struggles over the course of the season and in fact heads into thursday on a two game losing streak the fact the commodores bounced back to win more games hasnt been lost on most followers " south the south may be viewed as the weakest of the four regions but its home to two of the tournaments three win teams ohio state and memphis the longest current winning streak memphis games and the likely top pick in this junes nba draft ohio state center greg oden after leading syracuse to the title as a freshman in carmelo anthony traded in his orange uniform for a powder blue denver nuggets jersey ohio state fans are hoping greg oden can cement his legacy in columbus before he leaves as expected for the nba the buckeyes no also rely on two other freshmen guards mike conley jr and daequan cook "in conley the buckeyes have a true point guard to steer the barge " writes tim may in the columbus dispatch "watch his eyes but dont think you see what hes seeing in the world of basketball his is a beautiful mind " for mr conley a high school teammate of mr odens and the son of a former olympic gold medalist winning comes naturally "from peewee trophies to an indiana record three straight high school titles to summer league touring team victories to an outright big ten regular season title and a conference tournament title as a freshman the championships have fallen in succession for conley run teams " the scoreboard operator will be busy when tennessee no and long beach state no take the court both teams play an up tempo style and this could be the highest scoring game of the first round the long beach press telegrams frank burlison recalls the last time long beach state won an ncaa tournament game "richard nixon was still the president of the united states there were no such things as the internet personal computers dvd players big screen tvs and cellular telephones a gallon of regular gasoline went for give or take a few pennies about cents " its a first round matchup pitting the cardinals louisville no vs the cardinal stanford no one of the last at large teams in the field stanford faces a few challenges "simply playing louisville is no break because the cardinals have played their best basketball recently having won seven of their last eight games and rising to no in this weeks ap rankings " writes jack curtis in the san francisco chronicle "traveling about miles across three times zones does not make stanfords job any easier nor does having the game start at a m pacific time the biggest handicap though is playing at kentuckys rupp arena which is a mere miles from the louisville campus and close enough for a lot of louisvilles loyal fans to make the trip " in addition the stanford band wont be making the cross country trip after it was suspended from postseason events the houston chronicles richard justice explains why texas a&amp m no could make a final four run "the aggies are as mentally and physically tough as any team in the country the aggies just have a lot of the things that win in march they have a smothering defense and poise and the countrys best clutch player in acie law " one tip if you are filling out your bracket make sure you dont confuse the aggies with texas a&amp m corpus christi john caliparis memphis tigers no rolled through conference usa undefeated and enter the big dance on the nations longest win streak yet some critics say a soft schedule has not fully prepared the team for a deep tourney run last season mr caliparis team advanced to the elite eight jim masilak of the memphis commercial appeal compares this years team to the squad "whereas last years tigers clamored for and received a no seed in the ncaa tournament the current group was more than happy with a and likely would have settled with a " mr masilak adds "whereas last years tigers claimed victories over the likes of gonzaga tennessee and ucla all of which were seeded third or better in the ncaas the current group went a mere against rpi top opponents and beat just three tournament bound opponents none of those teams gonzaga jackson state and kentucky are seeded higher than eighth in this years bracket "
