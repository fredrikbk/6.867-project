double happiness one of the many miracles of free trade is that you can win by losing as a recent dispute between the u s and china shows the u s filed papers in february with the world trade organization objecting to nine chinese export subsidies a month later china has now announced that it is repealing one of the disputed provisions a regulation that had given companies that met certain export requirements access to unusually cheap credit this isnt the first time beijing has changed its mind about a dispute before it faced a trade panel in geneva in it settled a u s initiated case involving the semiconductor industry last year it was kraft linerboard a paper product a third case attacking local content rules in the auto sector is grinding toward adjudication in geneva in all these instances its a good bet that many officials in beijing understand that they are in the wrong with such trade distorting policies but they lack the clout to push reform through chinas bureaucracy on their own steam the u s and the wto conveniently provide political cover for policy changes that are difficult at home wto commitments have forced china to reform and liberalize faster than it otherwise would have it may be no coincidence that chinas per capita gdp growth has averaged a year since wto membership in compared with in the years before that sometimes trade disputes end happily for both parties
