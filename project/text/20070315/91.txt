spam hits video sites misleading web viewers search for xbox brings clips of a queen concert models and a parade in germany heres a sure sign online video is growing up spam has arrived just the way consumers are deluged by junk email they never wanted they are now running into clips on video sharing sites that have nothing to do with what they searched for the simplest form of video spam occurs when users submit clips with misleading lists of keywords to describe them such as using "britney spears" or "world cup" to label videos that have nothing to do with the pop star or the soccer tournament the spammers misrepresent their videos in the hope that the clips will be picked up in consumers video searches which generally rely on keywords for example a recent search on google inc s youtube site using a string of names of popular videogame devices "playstation xbox nintendo psp" turned up a nine minute promotional clip for argentine tourism steamy shots of fashion models footage of a parade in germany and an apparently pirated clip of a concert by the band queen the videos were there because the people who uploaded them to youtube typed in hundreds of words to falsely describe them in the accompanying text unrelated words ranging from the names of the game devices to a list of countries including "brazil bulgaria canada " a youtube spokesman disputes the idea that video spam is common saying it "is not a significant problem on our site and its effects are miniscule " but other online video executives say falsely labeled video clips are becoming more noticeable and some say an anti video spam war has begun as they try to head off spammers efforts to clog their sites before consumers get annoyed and tune out "without a doubt weve noticed an increase in the past six months " says tim tuttle a vice president at time warner inc s aol video and a co founder of the truveo video search engine aol acquired "were certainly taking it quite seriously " says suranga chandratillake founder and chief technology officer of the video search start up blinkx he says that there was a surge of spam in january and february but that video sites are fighting it more effectively now video spammers are driven by hopes of getting free advertising revenue or just plain notoriety by foisting their videos on unsuspecting viewers they are following consumers to video sites just as they followed them to web search engines social networking sites and cellphones "like advertisers the spammers recognize there are a lot of people congregating and its a great way to reach them " says keith richman chief executive of the video site break com in fact the arrival of spam coincides with increased interest among legitimate companies in boosting the visibility of their video clips businesses are also using a variety of techniques including providing comprehensive text descriptions alongside their videos so that search engines will understand them better "marketers are starting to ask about it " says sapna satagopan an associate analyst at jupiterresearch and blinkx has fielded so many questions that this week it issued a guide to the topic for spammers there may soon be a clear economic incentive to post bogus videos more video sites may start sharing ad revenue with the people who upload videos for example spammers could be paid each time someone viewed a video they posted or clicked on an ad accompanying their clip youtube executives have said they might share revenue with individuals in that way eventually such an approach could encourage spammers to increase the use of false pretenses to draw users but revver inc a site that already pays people when ads accompanying their clips are clicked says video spam submitted to it has actually dropped over the past year it says its employees review each clip before putting it up on the site such systems arent foolproof though a recent search with the keywords "britney spears and paris" turned up a video on revver purporting to show "paris hilton nude on the beach in st tropez " the short clip didnt include any video of the celebrity heiress in fact it was an otherwise blank screen with a bit of text alongside the video box was a description consisting of about misleading keywords ranging from sexually explicit terms to "espn" and "microsoft " after the second clip there suddenly appeared an ad for a palm inc product "this is totally misleading " acknowledged revvers founder and chief executive steven starr but "this happens very very infrequently " he added revver removed the clip yesterday after a reporter for this newspaper pointed it out a palm spokeswoman said she "contacted revver to express our surprise and displeasure and clearly palm and revver agreed that the content was inappropriate " spam videos arent usually displayed prominently on a site like youtube because its tough for them to become highly rated by users but some industry executives suspect individuals may be boosting the rankings of their clips by setting up computers to automatically click on the videos repeatedly that could make spam more visible and more of a nuisance a clip titled "hot blonde tells you how she wants to " which directed users to a site telling "how to make buckets of cash" had garnered almost views by yesterday and ascended to the no slot on the "top " list featured on google video the videos creator attached more than misleading keywords including sexually explicit terms and "harry potter " it is possible that some users were actually interested in seeing the sites pitchwoman but it is likely that others were misled into watching it youtube says consumers help it identify spam videos so they can be removed and it also uses automated means to find them other online video sites say they are now using anti video spam measures as well such as screening for lots of unrelated words in the video descriptions break coms mr richman says users alone can be remarkably effective at alerting his site to spam videos last month someone was using multiple aliases to submit three to five videos an hour that were ads for a sexually explicit site the videos would litter the "just submitted" section of break until users alerted break to them then a user posted a video clip on break explaining to others how to mark the spam videos as "inappropriate" so they would be removed mr richman says that spamming by that sexually explicit site has basically stopped since then others in the industry contend that sites will have to do sophisticated analyses of the video and audio content of clips to be able to effectively identify video spam such efforts could include using speech recognition technology to see whether words spoken in clips match the descriptions users provide but jason zajac general manager of social media at yahoo inc says that because video clips are generally more ephemeral than web sites coming and going based on news and fads it is harder for search engines to assess any clips relevance to a search query
