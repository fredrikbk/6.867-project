mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q last week you advised readers that in order to stop people from piggybacking on a wireless network using a linksys router they should simply set up a password and keep it private but dont they need to enable an "encryption key " a yes most nontechnical folks would consider an encryption key as a kind of password and thats the word i used because i always try to write my columns in plain conversational english in this case however my use of the term may have caused confusion because there are in effect two kinds of passwords on linksys routers and most other brands of routers one just prevents strangers from changing the routers settings the other the one to which i was referring is required to actually access the wireless network thats the one thats technically called a "key " to enable the encryption key use the routers setup software to turn on security on newer models the strongest security system is called wpa and on older models its called wep once its enabled only people who know the key can get onto your network there are further steps you can take like hiding your networks name called an ssid from others or even restricting access to the network to specific computers with specific identification codes called mac addresses a term that has nothing to do with apples brand of computers for more details go to linksys com select "learning center" at the top of the page and click on "network security" from the menu that appears and then click on the link called "how to secure your network " q is there a stereo that i can buy that can wirelessly connect to my computer and play the same music i play with apples itunes on that computer a yes if you literally mean a stereo rather than an adapter for a stereo the best i know of is called sonos zoneplayer it involves a module you connect to your computer that links wirelessly to stereo units with built in amps in remote rooms of your house it has a beautiful remote control with a color screen and many other great features but its expensive about &# for the starter package without speakers and cant play copy protected music you buy from itunes only music you import from your cds or other unprotected files information is at sonos com for much less money you can also buy adapters that can play the music on a pc or an ipod through an existing stereo q i have been keeping a journal or diary it is hand written but i would like to make the journal more readable by others is there voice recognition software that you would recommend so i can dictate the entries a it has been years since i reviewed voice recognition software but dragon naturally speaking a windows program works well for more information see nuance com and microsofts new vista operating system has a decent built in voice recognition system if you are using a macintosh one widely known speech recognition program is called ilisten but i havent tested it information is at macspeech com
