the morning brief war bill fiddling advances amid discouraging iraq news online edition the wall street journal online congressional debate over iraq is again picking up though political points seem more at stake for now than actual policy for the bush administration house work on a war spending bill and the senates toil over a nonbinding resolution calling for withdrawal come at a time of discouraging news from the battlefield yesterday the pentagon made public what the washington post calls the militarys "bleakest assessment of iraq yet " reporting that the fourth quarter of saw "record levels of violence and hardening sectarian divisions" in which the sectarian cleansing of rival sunni and shiite militias "forced as many as civilians to flee the country each month " the number of attacks per week rose to with iraqi civilians suffering the worst of violence that claimed some casualties a day moreover the post notes "those figures may represent as little as half of the true casualties because they include only violence observed by or reported to the u s led military coalition " and a united nations estimate put the number of civilians killed in december alone at more recent findings also point to a widening gap between iraqi officials view of progress there and that of their u s counterparts yesterday top iraqi commanders in baghdad touted what they describe as the recent successes of a crackdown in the capital including a sharp drop in civilian casualties during the first month of the plan u s commanders were more cautious maj gen william b caldwell the top u s military spokesman in iraq said that while execution style killings were down by more than in february "high profile" car bombings reached an all time high with the potential "to start that whole cycle of violence again " the los angeles times reports already the bush administration has begun to tacitly acknowledge its goals will take a lot longer to achieve than officials predicted in january the new york times adds administration officials say the military buildup aimed at stabilizing baghdad wont be fully in place until june and that all the objectives of president bushs strategy wont be fulfilled until the end of the year in january the administration said most objectives would be met by this month against this backdrop the house appropriations committee today is scheduled to vote on a &# billion supplemental budget bill the hill notes that despite the bad news out of iraq the so called out of iraq caucus suffered a defeat this week when the latest draft of the bill dropped language that sought to block mr bush from ordering an attack on iran but as the bill comes to a vote these antiwar legislators are now "some of the most sought after votes in the house " the hill says the out of iraq caucus has started to split between members who insist on immediate withdrawal and those willing to back a less rigorous bill of democrats on the appropriations committee are in that caucus and if they all oppose the bill and republicans stick together it will fail potentially a major blow for the democratic leadership its not clear how many will support the bill the hill says the senate yesterday finally managed to move its debate over an iraq resolution to the floor after long delay with most republicans joining democrats in an vote to proceed the resolution would call on the administration to remove most combat forces from iraq by the end of march and to seek a political solution to the conflict rather than a military one like the house spending bill the senate measure drew a veto threat from the white house which said it would "embolden our enemies" and "hobble american commanders in the field " as the n y times reports still the bill doesnt seem likely to make it to the presidents desk the republican and democratic leaderships havent agreed on which amendments will get a vote and the hill says republicans are likely to insist on a vote threshold for actual passage something the democrats will have a tough time achieving but actual passage may not be necessary to the democrats agenda as the hill reports majority leader harry reid said the goal of the debate was to put republicans on record as "rubberstamping" the white houses unpopular policy an iran sanctions draft advances at u n the five permanent members of the united nations security council and germany have reached a broad agreement on a new slate of sanctions aimed at punishing iran for failure to cooperate with u n atomic energy inspectors and refusing to halt the enrichment of potentially weapons grade uranium diplomats tell the los angeles times the group plans to share with the rest of the council today a draft resolution that "bans irans arms exports and expands a list of people and organizations whose assets are to be frozen because of their ties to irans nuclear activities " the times reports it would also call upon "governments and financial institutions not to offer iran grants financial assistance or loans except for humanitarian and developmental purposes though it did not include restrictions on export credits as originally envisioned " in a bid to overcome reluctance from russia and china the draft drops travel bans on individuals identified with irans nuclear activities instead calling on governments to monitor the comings and goings of these people and report them to a u n sanctions committee it would also relax a ban on the sale of conventional arms to iran the times says a meek denouement for h p spying case california agreed to drop the charges against former hewlett packard chairman patricia dunn over the companys use of so called pretexting to obtain private phone records of journalists and others while the state let three other defendants in the case plead guilty to misdemeanor charges "these agreements could wrap up one chapter in the high profile spy scandal " the san jose mercury news says thought it notes the story isnt over since "federal authorities who had been proceeding with their own investigation can still file criminal charges against the defendants if they choose " still the wall street journal calls it "a meek denouement to one of corporate americas stranger boardroom dramas " noting that "the states failure to obtain convictions against any of them despite clear evidence they pried into peoples private phone records illustrates the sketchiness of privacy protections " wal mart banking ambitions grow wal mart stores has been quietly renegotiating the terms of leases with banks that operate in its stores giving the retail giant "explicit right to offer mortgages home equity lines of credit and consumer loans " dow jones newswires reports one of the leases "also gives wal
