u s iraq launch campaign to cut oil smuggling main goal is to stem cash flow to insurgents corruption runs deep bayji iraq u s and iraqi forces have launched an aggressive campaign to curb the oil smuggling that is helping to destabilize the fragile baghdad government and finance insurgents adding another facet to the bush administrations latest pacification plan for iraq in concert with stepped up military and reconstruction initiatives u s troops for the first time are maintaining a round the clock presence at the sprawling oil refinery here iraqs largest soldiers from the u s armys nd airborne division also are cracking down on illegal gasoline stations arresting refinery workers suspected of corruption and using sophisticated data sifting methods to identify which senior iraqi officials might have ties to black market oil rings the iraqi government meanwhile has begun what it calls operation honest hands which put the entire refinery under iraqi military control iraqi army soldiers are physically monitoring each of the facilitys pumps and entrances assuming many of the responsibilities previously held by a paramilitary security force employed by the oil ministry that was widely considered corrupt and ineffectual iraqi troops are also escorting many convoys of fuel trucks to destinations around the country no similar steps are currently planned for iraqs other two refineries the move represents a course change for the bush administration as it struggles to craft a new approach for stabilizing iraq u s and iraqi officials have long been aware of the flourishing market in stolen iraqi oil but largely turned a blind eye because washington feared that stationing american soldiers at refineries would spark a nationalist backlash and renew accusations that the u s invaded iraq for its oil the iraqi government meanwhile felt its modest security resources were better used directly fighting insurgents some government officials had another reason for resisting a crackdown a number of them have been implicated in oil smuggling and black market money is spread across the political and social spectrum but officials from both countries concluded recently that oil smuggling had become too big a problem to ignore any longer the loss of so much output to the black market is sharply reducing the iraqi governments main source of revenue about of its &# billion budget in came from oil revenue the stolen oil also gives insurgent groups a ready source of income helping to perpetuate the civil war widespread oil smuggling siphons off as much as &# billion a year according to u s military officials they estimate that as much as of the fuel processed at bayji is lost to the black market an amount valued at more than &# billion a year "disrupting the insurgent funding is our main job " said year old capt kwenton kuhlman who is leading the antismuggling operation at bayji "im under no illusions we cant stop it its too big but we can try to disrupt it " official iraqi estimates put oil output at about two million barrels a day but u s and iraqi officials believe the figure could rise as high as five million barrels with improved security and infrastructure former iraqi president saddam hussein helped create the black market in oil in response to economic sanctions imposed in the wake of the persian gulf war mr hussein used smuggling as well as kickbacks on oil sold legitimately through the united nations oil for food program to generate cash for his regime and to reward allies at home and abroad the stepped up fight against smuggling has no guarantee of success and risks triggering more political and economic turmoil senior iraqi officials regularly pressure the americans to call off specific investigations or release individuals detained for suspected involvement in the black market feeding washingtons suspicions that oil related corruption extends deep into the government tanker drivers already complain the extra security measures cost them money by forcing them to spend significantly more time at the refinery overall traffic at the refinery has declined slightly since the crackdown began american officers meanwhile acknowledge iraqi soldiers assigned to the refinery could succumb to the corruption "its great the iraqi army is playing the lead but it would be a disaster if they became the next set of thieves out here " capt kuhlman said the immensity of the task facing the soldiers from the nd airborne was evident on recent visits by a reporter permitted to observe the operation and underscores the broader challenge americans face in turning more security over to their iraqi counterparts several drivers said iraqi soldiers at the plant had already begun asking for bribes the drivers also said they dont want to be escorted by iraqi troops for fear of attracting insurgent attacks "i want coalition forces to guard this place not the iraqi army " driver suhaib adil kareem said "the iraqis dont care about the law " iraqs parliament will soon debate a landmark petroleum law that would clear the way for direct foreign investment in the battered oil sector and set rough guidelines for distributing oil revenue among iraqs provinces but u s and iraqi officials warn the new law will have little substantive impact unless the smuggling is brought under control the endemic oil sector corruption is a financial boon to insurgent operations a classified u s government report in november estimated iraqi militants earn &# million to &# million a year by stealing tankers full of fuel smuggling oil to other countries kidnapping oil sector workers for ransom and charging protection money from truckers and gas station owners "the fuel that is stolen comes back as bombs mortar shells and katyusha rockets " said hamad hamoud al shakti governor of the salahaddin province home to the bayji refinery the black market is fueled by three factors baghdad heavily subsidizes gasoline and other oil products and the resulting low prices mean they can be resold at enormous profit in neighboring countries the government also doesnt verify that gas station owners who are entitled to receive liters of fuel a week sell to retail customers instead of on the black market the biggest issue though is pervasive corruption u s and iraqi officials say refinery workers routinely allow tankers to pick up fuel without any paperwork which makes it easy to sell off the books police officers demand bribes of as much as &# to let tankers pass through checkpoints or for "protection" along routes the officials say and some government officials work directly with smugglers or secretly own gas stations and fuel trucks giving them a share of money earned through illicit sales u s officials say "youre talking about corruption at basically every level " said maj curtis buzzard the executive officer of the brigade conducting the interdiction push "and its deeply entrenched " as part of the campaign the u s in coming months will spend more than &# million to install video cameras to monitor the refinerys pumps and new digital scales to weigh trucks making it easier to see if truckers are carrying more fuel than they were meant to receive the money will also be used to build parking lots designed to protect drivers from extortion and insurgent attack over the past few months u s and iraqi forces already have begun arresting officials suspected of playing central roles in black market rings as far back as september iraqi forces arrested ibrahim muslit who ran the bayji refinerys oil distribution operation after he allegedly allowed tankers in a single day to receive fuel without any paperwork in january u s troops arrested ahmed ibrahim hamad a senior transportation official at the refinery after he allegedly tried to help smuggle out seven tankers of heavy fuel oil both men are in custody and unavailable for comment now u s commanders say they are investigating senior officials from the bayji city council the local police force and the provincial and national governments the american officers say they have made about arrests since the crackdown began in earnest in early february when the iraqis formally joined the campaign and they hope to make additional arrests in coming weeks during a surprise inspection of the refinerys gasoline and diesel pumps one afternoon sgt stephen truesdale noticed that the analog display on one of the machines showed it had pumped liters more than the facilitys handwritten records indicated "he helped steal liters of gas " sgt truesdale a former north carolina police officer said of the heavy set iraqi man who had been manning the pump "the pumps dont lie " the refinery worker insisted he was innocent but capt kuhlman the brigade leader told his men they had enough evidence to arrest him on the way back to their base the u s forces saw a large fuel truck parked on the side of the road surrounded by pickup trucks carrying overflowing oil barrels the iraqis at the site freely admitted they had purchased the fuel from a tanker driver who had left the refinery a short time earlier the men said they made such purchases several times a week and resold the oil to factory owners and other small businesses in neighboring towns the american forces ordered the iraqis to drive their pickups back to the refinery where the men were searched photographed and escorted onto a pair of open backed military vehicles for transport to holding cells at the u s installation the following day capt kuhlman told a room full of refinery officials and trucking company executives about the arrests shakir hamid a businessman who said his partner had been kidnapped from the refinery months earlier shook his head "in saddams time oil smugglers were hung " he said "and i release them after two days " capt kuhlman replied shrugging "but its a start "
