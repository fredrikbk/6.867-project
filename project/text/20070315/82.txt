politics &amp economics still vague why were prosecutors fired accounts dont clarify how dismissals became a bush team priority washington so far the political fallout from the bush administrations dismissal of eight u s attorneys has left a basic question unanswered why were they fired the administration has said its initial explanation that the prosecutors were fired for poor performance wasnt fully accurate emails and internal documents provided to congress this week show that senior white house and justice department aides carefully planned last years dismissals while seeking to contain any political damage and to minimize the senates role in selecting their replacements but neither the administrations public statements nor the documents explain why the dismissals became a priority for senior officials including former white house counsel harriet miers and attorney general alberto gonzaless former chief of staff kyle sampson who resigned over the matter this week mr gonzales said "mistakes were made" and promised to work with members of congress "to make sure they know what happened " ms miers couldnt be reached for comment president bush expressed confidence in mr gonzales yesterday defending the firings "what al did and what the justice department did was appropriate " he said but he also said the department "mishandled" the release of some but not all details of how the firings were carried out also yesterday the current white house counsel fred fielding met with members and staffers of the senate and house judiciary committees to discuss their requests for additional information today the senate judiciary committee was scheduled to vote on authorizing chairman patrick leahy d vt to subpoena up to current and former officials possibly including ms miers and karl rove the presidents deputy chief of staff if they dont agree to testify voluntarily one possible motive for the moves was the administrations desire to reassert control over the appointment of u s attorneys and to reward allies with the coveted and powerful positions last year the administration obtained new authority to replace u s attorneys indefinitely without senate confirmation in a september email mr sampson "strongly" recommended "that as a matter of administration policy we utilize the new statutory provisions " that would allow the administration to "give far less deference to home state senators and thereby get our preferred person appointed and do it faster and more efficiently at less political cost to the white house " he wrote moreover the replacement of senate confirmed u s attorneys with interim appointees serving under the attorney general also shifted management power to washington a former justice department official said interim attorneys lack authority to make permanent hires into the career prosecutorial ranks without special dispensation the former official said that means political appointees in washington would have to sign off on appointments of assistant u s attorneys last night white house and justice department spokeswomen said they were unfamiliar with the departments procedures the released documents indicate white house officials had originally conceived of dismissing all u s attorneys after president bushs re election although they provide no explanation why the administration would wish to ms miers communicated the proposal to mr sampson but the justice department concluded it wasnt feasible in a january memorandum to ms miers mr sampson said a wholesale purge could cause "significant disruption" to the departments work as well as political problems with home state senators he suggested instead focusing on "a limited number of u s attorneys " the administrations public statements and the materials disclosed so far point to no definitive explanation for the dismissals much of the information concerning the individual prosecutors was redacted from the documents but the department initially cited concerns ranging from disappointment with enforcement priorities to poor management on immigration the justice department was at pains to show tough border enforcement policies with many conservatives criticizing the presidents immigration law proposals as too lenient some of the emails indicate a concern that targeted u s attorneys were insufficiently attentive to that priority in a may email concerning the u s attorney in the san diego based southern district of california mr sampson questioned whether top justice officials have "ever called carol lam and woodshedded her on immigration enforcement " justice officials initially said "she continually failed to perform in regard to significant leadership priorities " particularly "border enforcement " in congressional testimony last week ms lam defended her approach to immigration cases saying she focused on big time smugglers she said she was never warned that her performance had placed her job in jeopardy john mckay the former u s attorney for the seattle based western district of washington said in congressional testimony last week that an aide to rep doc hastings r wash questioned him about voter fraud charges in the states gubernatorial election eventually awarded to democrat chris gregoire mr hastings has said the call was "entirely appropriate " during a separate interview for a federal judgeship which he didnt ultimately receive mr mckay said ms miers had asked him why he "mishandled" the election investigation
