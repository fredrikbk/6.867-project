unlike u s rivals freeport expands paying off pile of debt from phelps deal hinges on high copper prices freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc is doing what few other u s based miners and metal makers are doing in an era of consolidation gaining global reach with its &# billion cash and stock deal to acquire phelps dodge corp which received shareholder approval yesterday freeport will go from a one mine company to the worlds largest publicly traded copper miner based on output that is in contrast to other u s metals and mining companies which for the most part have stood on the sidelines or become takeover targets themselves during the current wave of mergers the move presents greater opportunities even as it presents significant challenges demand for copper used in construction and manufacturing has remained relatively strong in recent years thanks to a growing world economy and rapid development in places such as china but record high prices are expected to dip as world production accelerates moreover freeport will amass significant debt to finance the acquisition and will be exposed to political and worker unrest in new countries company officials yesterday werent available to comment at an industry conference in february richard adkerson president and chief executive of freeport acknowledged that copper price levels are unpredictable and can affect the companys profitability by as much as &# million in net income for every cent change in the price of copper but he was hopeful that copper prices would remain high for three years he also said the timing was right to do a deal because financial markets favor commodities at the moment and are providing affordable ways to structure debt "well be able to do this at a very reasonable cost and under covenant terms that are very flexible and attractive " he said "its the combination of the commodities markets these assets and the financial markets thats allowing us to do this transaction in the way we are doing it " freeport mcmoran a low cost copper miner with a single operation in indonesia that produces about metric tons of copper each year will have million metric tons of annual copper producing capacity once the acquisition is complete the combined operation which will keep the freeport mcmoran name will be second only to chiles state owned corporacion nacional del cobre de chile known as codelco which produced million metric tons of copper in it will surpass global mining titans bhp billiton ltd anglo american plc and rio tinto plc in copper production which each produce less than million metric tons each year those companies have been less focused on major acquisitions though some analysts speculate they could be interested in buying the combined freeport phelps at some point to increase their copper portfolio bhp which has a stake in chiles escondida mine the largest copper mine in the world is expanding its existing copper mines it also acquired wmc resources ltd in for &# billion gaining some gold nickel and copper resources rio and bhp are examining a major copper project in arizona called resolution other u s based metal companies including pittsburgh based u s steel corp and nucor corp of charlotte n c havent developed large global footprints like many of their competitors cleveland based iron ore miner cleveland cliffs inc has made small moves but remains far behind larger rivals pittsburgh based alcoa inc the largest aluminum company in the world has distinguished itself in terms of global reach but hasnt made major acquisitions and now finds itself challenged by russia based oao rusal which is rapidly expanding in the past three years copper has risen to record prices outpacing other commodities they have topped &# a pound in some instances and are about &# a pound prompting thefts of copper tubing used in air conditioners and copper sculptures from cemeteries prices have been sustained by demand from manufacturers in china steady construction in the u s and heavy short selling by hedge funds but most analysts say those prices cant be sustained "supply growth is greater than demand growth and copper prices should recede from these levels " said amir arif a mining analyst with friedman billings ramsey &amp co he predicts copper prices will remain at an average of &# a pound this year and &# a pound in "because of inventory builds that will take place" as copper companies reopen old mines and develop new mines by copper prices could decline to as low as &# or &# a pound which would give freeport phelps a narrow window to amass profits to help pay down debt freeport a company with an &# billion market capitalization is taking on &# billion in debt to fund the acquisition of the much larger phelps dodge which has a market capitalization of &# billion giving it one of the highest debt levels in the industry moreover freeport will now be charged with getting up and running a new mine in the unfamiliar congo of africa which had been a phelps dodge project investors and analysts are still generally favorable on the deal "the acquisition of phelps dodge transforms freeport into a multi mine multi country lower specific risk situation " said john tumazos a metals and mining analyst at prudential in new york some analysts suggest freeport could pay off debt as early as five quarters after the deal based on higher commodity prices assuming china remains a net importer of copper and prices remain at decent levels if the price of copper "stays up for another year which is conceivable they could pay off a great deal of the debt they could pay off a lot more than people think " said chuck bradford a new york based metals and mining analyst with bradford research soleil others say the combined firm could sell gold mining assets to pay down the debt more quickly in case copper prices take a downturn that would be difficult however because freeports main gold mine operates at the same location as its grasberg copper mine in indonesia
