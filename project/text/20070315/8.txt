beltway bruising attacks on gonzales bare weak power base loyalty to bush lack of conservative help erode his defenses washington the political storm brewing around attorney general alberto gonzales has exposed a potentially serious vulnerability he lacks a significant base of support outside the white house many conservatives have long questioned his moderate stances on abortion and affirmative action positions thought to have cost him a shot at an appointment to the supreme court liberals have faulted him for his actions as white house counsel when he composed and defended controversial bush administration tactics for detaining and interrogating terrorism suspects his supreme loyalty to president bush whom he served as counsel in texas helped him become attorney general but having a power base of one a now unpopular president could make it more difficult for mr gonzales to fend off democratic calls for him to resign over the justice departments handling of the firing of eight federal prosecutors mr gonzaless predecessor john ashcroft weathered controversy during his term with the help of broader political support a confluence of forces some of his own making some beyond his control and some the fault of his putative allies in the white house have come together to undermine the year old lawyer who was once seen as one of the rising young stars of the bush administration the uproar over the firings fueled by accusations that they were politically motivated shows no sign of abating president bush yesterday expressed unhappiness over the matter speaking to reporters on a latin american trip mr bush said the dismissals of the prosecutors appointees who serve at the pleasure of the president was appropriate but he said "mistakes" had been made he specified the shifting and inaccurate explanations given to members of congress "and frankly im not happy about them " mr bush said "the fact that both republicans and democrats feel there was not straightforward communication troubles me and it troubles the attorney general " mr bush said "so he took action and he needs to continue to take action " the president said he called the attorney general to discuss the problem yesterday "he is not an attorney general who has a political base independent from the president " says andrew card mr bushs former chief of staff "i dont think thats bad at all he is his own man but everyone who serves in the executive branch is an extension of the president " yesterday sen john sununu of new hampshire became the first prominent republican to call for mr gonzaless ouster "the president should fire the attorney general and replace him as soon as possible with someone who can provide strong aggressive leadership prosecuting the war on terrorism running the department of justice and working with the president and congress on important homeland security matters " mr sununu said in an interview yesterday afternoon mr gonzales said that despite the growing controversy hes not ready to give up "hopefully the story has not been fully written" on his term as attorney general mr gonzales said he said he believes he continues to enjoy the confidence of the president and that he will try to repair the damage "part of doing my job is identifying where there are problems such as the performance of u s attorneys address them and make the department even better " he said "im mad that inaccurate information was provided" to congress referring to testimony from top justice department officials that suggested limited white house involvement in the firings mr gonzaless management style of delegating liberally to trusted aides some whom he brought over from his previous job as white house counsel may have contributed to his problems mr gonzales has asserted that his chief of staff kyle sampson communicated by email for months with white house officials plotting the ouster of the u s attorneys without letting mr gonzales and other top justice officials in on details mr sampson who resigned on monday declined through his lawyer to comment after the release of some of those emails earlier this week mr gonzales stood before television cameras swallowed hard and with his voice cracking at times offered this explanation for being left out of the loop "when you have people working in the department obviously there are going to be decisions that im not aware of in real time " in the interview yesterday afternoon mr gonzales said "i hire good people smart people who know what i expect what i want and i rely on them to do their jobs i was certainly unaware of everything that was going on " thus far mr gonzales has not pushed back aggressively against his critics polite and reserved he has little of the charisma and political flair of his predecessor mr ashcroft a former senator and governor staff members and colleagues call him judge its a reference to his time on the texas supreme court but also an honorific that sums up his temperament mr gonzales grew up in the small town of humble texas one of eight children of mexican migrants in recent days his strongest asset his close ties to mr bush has become a liability those ties have served him well since when the then governor of texas plucked him from a law firm to be his counsel democrats recently have obtained emails sent by the white house to the justice department they indicate significant white house involvement in instigating and pushing a plan to rein in prosecutors who werent pursuing the white houses prosecution priorities including bringing cases related to immigration and voting fraud democrats have framed the controversy as a sign of mr gonzaless lack of independence from the white house charging that his loyalty to the president had politicized an important part of the justice system in the interview yesterday afternoon mr gonzales said that as attorney general he wears "two hats" as a member of the presidents staff and as the nations top law enforcement officer "i have to be unbiased people have to have confidence in my impartiality people are afraid i cant fulfill that role because of my relationship with the president but when you look at my record thats just not the case " he cited the departments prosecution of republican and democratic politicians in corruption cases the uproar is the first to hit the white house since democrats took control of congress the administrations foes now have the power to prolong the controversy by demanding documents and holding hearings congressional democrats are doing just that the furor has left mr gonzales frustrated and pained in an interview on feb as he traveled to a speaking engagement on a government gulfstream g jet mr gonzales expressed dismay that critics saw political motives in any of his initiatives including the firings of the prosecutors "what is important is for people to understand is that these changes were not made to retaliate against anyone or because they didnt pursue a particular case " he said "my judgments were not based on improper factors " asked to sum up how he would want his work as presidential counsel and attorney general to be remembered he said he believed he eventually "will be vindicated " he added "i do hope people will be fair in assessing what we have done to protect america " later that day as he sat with his staff at a restaurant in san diegos old town mr gonzales was told that david iglesias who had been fired as u s attorney in new mexico had held a news conference blasting the justice department mr iglesias accused the department of firing him because of political pressure from republican members of congress who he said were upset that he wasnt going to bring charges before the november elections in a corruption probe involving democrats mr gonzales said to no one in particular "what do i need to do what can we do to end this " mr gonzaless defenders say he is being pummeled for actions that arent extraordinary at all they note that other administrations have replaced u s attorneys in bunches sometimes on a grander scale president clinton changed all u s attorneys when he came into office moving out the republican appointees and replacing them with his own his critics say the latest firings are different select prosecutors appointed by mr bush himself were targeted for political reasons they say the shifting public explanations of the matter compounded mr gonzaless problems many of president bushs supporters have kept their distance from mr gonzales some still repeat the old joke that gonzales is spanish for souter a reference to the appointment of david souter to the supreme court by the first president bush mr souter is viewed as a disappointment to conservatives because he sometimes aligns himself with the courts more liberal wing when mr gonzales was talked about as a possibility for the court conservatives rebelled in part because they suspected he wouldnt share their views on issues ranging from abortion to affirmative action on affirmative action mr gonzales played a role in softening an administration brief filed in a supreme court case challenging the university of michigans admission programs in roger clegg president of the center for equal opportunity says his organization which is against affirmative action opposed nominating mr gonzales to the supreme court in part because of his involvement in the michigan case "that was a great disappointment to those of us who were hoping that the supreme court would close the door to racial and ethnic preferences " he says on "color blind" policies mr clegg says he gives mr gonzales and the administration "a b or c" grade mr gonzales further alienated some conservatives by supporting a federal prosecutor who brought a controversial case johnny sutton a u s attorney in western texas and a friend of messrs gonzales and bush successfully prosecuted two border patrol agents for shooting a suspected drug smuggler some conservatives including members of congress criticized the prosecutions some liberals however dont agree with conservatives description of mr gonzales as a "stealth liberal " citing his role in crafting antiterrorism policies at a hearing before the senate judiciary committee sen patrick leahy a vermont democrat who chairs the committee accused mr gonzales of being "complicit in advancing these government policies which threaten our basic liberties and overstep the bounds of our constitution " in the feb interview mr gonzales said of the criticism about his legal advice to the president on civil liberties "every time the courts issue a decision we learn more we are still feeling our way here we need people to realize that were not yet safe every day is sept " "i acknowledge that we have an issue and perception problem with our allies as a result of some of the events that have occurred " he continued "they need to understand abu ghraib is a fact but it didnt happen because of administration policy " he also pointed to other areas where he wants to make a difference including cracking down on child pornography and battling illegal drugs sen charles schumer a new york democrat who has led the senates investigation of the firings has called for mr gonzaless ouster citing fears that the dismissals of the prosecutors could do long term harm to the justice departments ability to handle politically sensitive cases "the damage is reparable but not if the suspicion remains " he says mr gonzales has defenders who maintain that his firings of the u s attorneys werent part of any attempt to push an administrations agenda david leitch former deputy white house counsel under mr gonzales and now general counsel at ford motor co says it isnt true that mr gonzales hasnt shown sufficient separation from his prior job as presidential counsel "to the extent he is trying to carry out the priorities of the white house he just has a sense since he knows the president so well of what the president wants " he says "i dont think he checks in with the white house any more than someone else in the position does " during a recent meeting at a san diego hotel mr gonzales fielded questions from a delegation of hispanic business leaders who spoke with pride of mr gonzales serving in such a high office with the mexican border close by many of their questions were related to immigration mr gonzales defended tough enforcement of immigrant smugglers but spoke sympathetically about immigrants seeking a better life he urged the business leaders "we need your voices out there call your members of congress " gary fields contributed to this article
