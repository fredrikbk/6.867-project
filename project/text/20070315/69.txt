mississippi justice these columns have tried to monitor the increasingly marauding behavior of state attorneys general see related article "review &amp outlook editorial dunn and lockyer" wsj march and few examples can match the assault of mississippis jim hood on state farm insurance weve been digging into the gory details which also reveal how one more ag has teamed up with the trial bar to squeeze law abiding companies into dubious settlements this tale is worthy of a grisham novel full of stolen documents turncoat employees attorneys who flout court orders and an upcoming contempt hearing within weeks of hurricane katrina mr hood filed a civil suit against state farm and other insurers for denying flood claims even though their policies excluded flood damage state farm was also sued by mississippi tort baron dickie scruggs when the insurers refused to roll over mr hood turned up the pressure with a criminal probe and his leverage in that probe included certain internal state farm documents how mr hood got his hands on those documents is a story all its own it revolves around e a renfroe a company with offices in alabama that was hired by state farm to send insurance adjusters to evaluate katrina claims two sisters cori rigsby moran and kerri rigsby had worked as adjusters for renfroe since the late s both had signed employment agreements and codes of conduct promising to protect the confidential information of companies for which renfroe worked yet around february of the rigsby sisters seemed to be thinking of something beyond contracts according to court documents they met with mr scruggs a friend of their mothers and gave him state farm documents theyd stolen from work mr scruggs at this point was working on his civil litigation against insurers and the rigsbys started clandestinely working with him in june of the two copied more pages of claims information and on mr scruggss advice gave a copy first to mr hood and then to mr scruggs they also went on national television to crow about their theft and to accuse state farm of misconduct well leave it to readers to decide what motivated the rigsby sisters who claim they found evidence of state farm fraud and so should be hailed as heroic whistleblowers but its worth noting that neither woman went to renfroe management with their concerns before they stole the papers instead they both took jobs with the scruggs katrina group a coalition of trial lawyers suing over the hurricane and are now each earning &# a year as "consultants" for advising on insurance litigation the real fireworks started when renfroe sued the two sisters in federal court alleging theyd broken employment agreements and a trade secrets law and demanding return of the documents guess who then interceded none other than mr hood who filed a brief admitting the documents were now at "the heart" of his criminal probe and couldnt be returned never mind that renfroe had already agreed that mr hood could keep his copies mr hood claimed to be worried that if the documents were returned to renfroe state farm would see them and know what "evidence" the prosecutor had against it in other words the ag admitted in a court document that his strategy was to deny evidence to state farm to make it easier for him to scare the company into a settlement his demand for a stay of the proceedings would also have helped mr scruggs the man whod got him the documents keep his own set of papers to his credit alabama federal judge william m acker jr showed himself wise to this racket in a blunt opinion in early december he said that it was "apparent" that the rigsby sisters and mr scruggs were "now engaged in a cooperative effort" to use the papers to sue state farm he then issued an injunction demanding that everyone except law enforcement officials return their documents to renfroe attorneys who themselves were under court order not to share them with renfroe or state farm that should have been the end of it instead within days of judge ackers injunction mr hoods office had sent a letter to mr scruggs suggesting that instead of giving his documents back to renfroe mr scruggs give them to the ag where theyd be beyond the reach of the injunction the letter also promised to give the papers back to mr scruggs later in the game mr scruggs did so and the injunction went unfulfilled all the way up until after the january day that state farm agreed to settle with both the lawyer and the prosecutor only then did mr hoods office send mr scruggss documents to renfroe attorneys as the court had ordered judge acker wasnt thrilled that an officer of the court mr scruggs and a state law enforcement official mr hood would so brazenly flout the law he has since invited mr scruggs and his law firm to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court and on march will hold a contempt hearing dont expect it to be pretty then again mr scruggs and mr hood have already got what they wanted mr scruggs helped mr hood get internal state farm documents for his criminal probe mr scruggs has used those documents in his litigation and by his own admission has given them to other trial lawyers working together the trial lawyer and ag ensured that state farm wouldnt see what had been stolen and thus never know how well it could defend itself that made it easier for both men to pressure the company into a &# million plus settlement rather than risk going to court meanwhile other disturbing aspects of this tale have leaked out according to documents in the alabama case mr scruggs also threatened to turn up the heat on state farm unless the company agreed to pressure renfroe into dropping its litigation against mr scruggss clients the rigsby sisters how convenient were also told that mr hood exerted pressure on state farm to settle not just with the state but also with mr scruggs who stands to make millions in contingency fees from the state farm settlement look for some of that cash to make it back to mr hood in the form of campaign contributions whatever else this is we wouldnt call it "justice " attorneys general are immensely powerful and are supposed to enforce the law fairly and without playing favorites instead many of them have essentially become business partners with the trial bar to shake down companies for cash and political gain in an earlier day this would have been known as absolute power corrupting absolutely see related letter "letters to the editor after the deluge state farm said sorry read the fine print" wsj march
