tiny flipstart pc gets caught in snag of too in between i am writing these words on a teeny tiny computer much smaller than even the littlest standard laptop yet its a full fledged pc running the full version of windows xp its called the flipstart and its from flipstart labs a seattle firm that is one of the companies owned by microsoft co founder paul allen the flipstart is part of a new wave of tiny windows pcs which include the second version of a machine called the oqo the ultra mobile pc from samsung and sonys ux series for a decade or more the computer industry has been trying to come up with an ultracompact computer that can use standard operating systems and software they have failed to catch on broadly for several reasons first they are an awkward in between size too large to fit in a pocket but too small to allow for minimally comfortable touch typing keyboards second their screens are often too small to handle the navigation through multiple windows that windows requires third their battery life has been poor finally theyve been very costly ive been testing the flipstart and found that while it overcomes some of these issues it cant lick all of them it runs windows ok and it even has decent battery life its screen resolution and navigation are also pretty good it weighs just pounds and is smaller in length and width than a standard paperback novel but its price &# is very expensive for a computer thats too small to be very good for typing yet isnt small enough to be extra portable part of the size problem is that its thick thicker than a page paperback and i found its keyboard to be too little and crude for laptop style typing but too wide for fast thumb typing like people do on a blackberry it also exhibited some funky behavior in my tests so like its predecessors and competitors the flipstart is likely to be a novelty or niche product it may be popular with some techies but its no match for a small standard laptop like lenovos x models which start at &# are pounds are thinner than the flipstart and include a great keyboard and a screen thats more than twice the size of flipstarts the flipstart which goes on sale march on the companys web site flipstart com is also much larger and heavier than the new second model of the oqo which weighs just one pound the new oqo on sale next week at oqo com is also less costly starting at around &# like the oqo the flipstart can also run the new windows vista as well as windows xp the flipstart is designed as a clamshell with a flip up lid like a laptop it can be used in an l shape like a laptop on a desk or table the oqos keyboard slides down from behind its screen and you type on it while holding it vertically like a smart phone the flipstart can be used that way too the flipstarts inch screen is bright and vivid and it has a resolution of by less than most laptops but much better than the new oqos theres a zoom feature that can be adjusted with a handy scroll wheel on the side which is also used for scrolling through text theres also a second tiny screen in the lid so you can see your email contacts and calendar when the flipstart is closed special navigation software on the main screen offers the same information in my tests the flipstart handled microsoft word the firefox web browser picasa photo software and apples itunes quite well in my tough battery test in which i turn off all power saving software turn on the wi fi crank up the screen brightness and play music endlessly the flipstart did surprisingly well it clocked in at about hours which means youd get three hours or more with typical usage the slimmer lighter new oqo got just hour minutes the flipstart includes both wi fi wireless networking and a built in cellphone modem that uses the fast ev do network both worked in my tests as did wired networking via a snap on port replicator that lets you connect a full size monitor keyboard mouse and speakers but i ran into some problems the unit too often failed to connect to wi fi networks also at one point the flipstart logged me out of windows every time i typed the letter "l" in any program microsoft outlook crashed on me repeatedly the keyboard despite its typing flaws has some nice aspects it includes a touch pad and a pointing stick to replace a mouse and special keys for quickly performing various functions such as getting to the desktop and switching open windows but for thumb typing i much preferred the oqo keyboard even though its smaller and even though flipstart commissioned a study showing its keyboard was better i think the solution to making better hand held computers is in ever more potent smart phones like apples forthcoming iphone rather than in shrunken laptops like the flipstart email me at mossberg wsj com see video versions of my reviews at wsj com mossbergvideo
