dunn and lockyer congratulations to california judge ray cunningham for showing both mercy and wisdom by dropping all charges against patricia dunn yesterday ms dunn is the former hewlett packard chairman who approved a probe into the leaking of company secrets a probe that devolved into a private eye search of the trash and phone records of a reporter from this newspaper this has always struck us as more blunder than crime and ms dunn paid for it by losing her post amid a battle against cancer but former california attorney general bill lockyer saw a way to grab a share of the cases publicity frenzy during an election year and threw felony raps at ms dunn and three co defendants mr lockyer betrayed the state of his own wisdom by going on national tv and saying "crimes have been committed" even before any charges were filed yesterdays result should embarrass mr lockyer if he is capable of embarrassment judge cunningham didnt immediately drop the charges against ms dunns three co defendants but he said those too will be dropped in september after the trio completes hours of community service and makes restitution this all shows so much good sense that we can scarcely believe it a statement from the office of ag jerry brown mr lockyers successor says federal charges could still be filed in the case but we hope the feds realize they have more pressing matters to pursue than criminalizing an act of corporate stupidity for which the culprits have already suffered in job loss and public humiliation see related letter "letters to the editor hewlett packard case we know the culprits" wsj march
