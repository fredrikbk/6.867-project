where was the crime in the libby case i was appalled by the responses to the lewis libby editorials and commentaries letters march and the apparent cluelessness to the nature of the case no crime was established by patrick fitzgerald in the "outing" of valerie plame the identity of the leaker was known by patrick fitzgerald at the outset of the so called investigation therefore there can be no obstruction of justice justice being the criminal outing of a cia agent and identification of the "outer " whether mr libby correctly identified the leaker or didnt had no effect on what had already been determined and did not impede the discovery of any criminal act as to perjury perjury of a non material fact lacks the necessary "scienter " or criminal intent to be a prosecutable crime michael h sebastian dallas
