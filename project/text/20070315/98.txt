the evening wrap subprime survey says online edition financial markets are in full cat amid rocking chairs mode over the subprime mortgage shakeout but if economists are worried that some damage may seep out from that corner of the lending universe a recession apparently isnt in the cards slightly more than half of the economists queried this month by wsj com say it is either somewhat or very likely that the subprime meltdown like an angry loan shark will eventually crack the broader mortgage market in the kneecaps those forecasters that see more widespread damage on the horizon are far from being of one mind when it comes to the extent of the shakeout however some think recent headlines including the trouble at home loan providers such as new century financial are the start of a broader malaise and a sneak peek of the misery that can be expected from "resets" of adjustable rate mortgages which were popular throughout the credit spectrum during the housing boom many of those are set to flip up to higher rates in a tepid home prices environment others argue that subprime mortgages are but a small portion of the overall mortgage market and the hit to the market will only be in proportion to their popularity whatever the extent of the eventual damage the economists believe declines in home prices await on average they think that home values as measured by the office of federal housing enterprise oversights prices index will drop this year last month they expected a decline the economists have some august company former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told a group in south florida which is among the most heavily lathered of frothy housing markets that he too is concerned about the subprime mess while conceding that it is presently hard to find any evidence that subprime problems will come back and bite the broader economy he said "you cant take out of mortgage originations without some impact " he also said buyers have had problems with arm resets the former fed chief had argued in february that homeowners might not be well served by fixed rate loans and perhaps it was a good time to take up an arm some now getting squeezed might have been listening mr greenspan endured some abuse after his musings about a possible recession were blamed for helping trigger last months stock selloff critics suggested that he might better serve the market by finding a nice sunny secluded place to go and polish his clarinet chops however three quarters of the economists said that the old fed boss shouldnt be muzzled the forecasters dont believe that economic growth is going to blow anybodys hair back during the first quarter they think that gross domestic product will expand at about a annual rate right around the same pace that the economy has plodded along at for most of the last year at the same they didnt throttle back in the face of the subprime fiasco economists still expect growth of around over the course of the year further despite concern in other quadrants that mortgage problems could kick crowds of loan officers and real estate agents onto the street they think the unemployment rate will rise only to by years end and that payroll growth will average about jobs a month over the next year right around the level seen last month with growth creeping along and the labor market staying tight but not too tight inflation
