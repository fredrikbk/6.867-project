grabbing more market share in commodities and derivatives today proposed paying &# billion in stock to acquire cbot holdings cbot recently agreed to combine with chicago mercantile exchange holdings and intercontinentals move tosses about a million tons of mud into the chicago river the crosstown exchanges said just yesterday that they expected to put the finishing touches on their merger by the

fees the justice department and the commodity futures trading commission which havent yet signed off on the chicago union could share those concerns on the floor in chicago traders seemed titillated by the idea of a bidding war breaking out but also worried about what the future might look like if intercontinental prevails some worried that much like those specialists at the new york stock
