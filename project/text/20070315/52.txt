it was a day to remember for americas mental athletes new york a year ago mark kroner ii read a story online about the usa memory championship thought it sounded pretty cool and this probably didnt bode too well promptly forgot all about it then a few months ago "someone said something about memory and that triggered my memory " said mr kroner a supply chain consultant from mableton ga who immediately registered for the th annual championship held here this past weekend one of so called mental athletes from eight states vying for the title mr kroner had to place at least seventh in the mornings time based qualifying round essentially a remembrance of things fast to move into the afternoon finals taped for airing april on hdnet the grand prize a berth at the three day world championship at the end of august in bahrain mr kroner barely had a chance to gulp down some of the glaceau smart water donated for the occasion before it was time to absorb eight pages of names and faces a dauntingly long string of numbers the precise order of a shuffled deck of cards and finally a justifiably unpublished line poem including punctuation italics and oddly capitalized words as part of his preparation mr kroner like virtually every other competitor conjured a few mnemonic devices to master recall of a shuffled deck for example he assigned each numbered card a letter the ace was an a the deuce a b the three a c the four a d then named most of the cards after a celebrity with the appropriate initials thus the ace of spades became arnold schwarzenegger the three of clubs was charlie chaplin and a little frat boy humor here the four of diamonds was pamela anderson "double d " was the maidenform inspired explanation from the blushing mr kroner who ended the day in th place the first timer might have underestimated the stress the tidy rows of desks the tense silence the implacably delivered reminder during each qualifying event that there was now only a minute remaining now only seconds induced all sorts of flashbacks "ive been out of college for seven or eight years " mr kroner said "and its like i was taking my final exams all over again " further mr kroner who admittedly blew off any sort of practice until the very last minute had perhaps underestimated the seriousness of purpose among his rivals chester santos a san francisco software engineer who has placed third three times in his five appearances here worked on his skills for an average of minutes a day ramping up to a few hours a day in the week leading up to the competition it was time well spent he aced the shuffled deck event in three minutes seconds the memory equivalent of running a four minute mile though the wizardly david thomas a motivational speaker who ended up winning this years championship did it in a mere minutes "people think i should remember names and remember their birthday but im capable of forgetting like anyone else if i dont pay attention the important thing is concentration " said mr santos saturdays fifth place finisher whose arsenal of mnemonic devices included the phonetic alphabet and an ancient technique known as the roman room associating images that represent particular bits of information with objects in a familiar space a variation is known as the journey which involves linking information to sights a stop sign a gas station a soccer field on a familiar route paul mellor a richmond va based instructor of mnemonic techniques who finished fifth last year was hoping for a better outcome this time around every week he worked on memorizing the names and faces of the or so real estate agents featured in ads in the sunday paper and on a daily basis pored over long sequences of numbers and many stacks of aces deuces queens and kings "if we can remember the order of a deck of cards well remember where we park our cars " said the intense mr mellor who placed a disappointing ninth this year but who at least had the comfort of knowing he could always locate his wheels the usa memory championship one of some two dozen such competitions in the world was founded by tony dottino a management consultant who began researching the brain during his tenure as an ibm executive "we were frustrated that we were losing the creativity of our work force " said mr dottino who learned at a seminar that the best way to deal with the problem "was to improve employees ability to organize and retain information so they could recall it spontaneously " he became fascinated by the link between memory and creativity and became a true believer in memory improvement techniques "i felt there was a whole lot more i could develop in my own brain and went around telling people if theres hope for me theres hope for you but they would reject the idea " said mr dottino then he heard a speaker say at a business conference "that if you have a message and want the media to cover it " he recalled "one good way is to start a competition " and so he did with competitors from four states that first year while mr dottino has not exactly struck gold hes still trying to find a corporate sponsor for the competition hes certain hes struck a nerve "people are afraid they cant keep up with the information they need to know for their jobs theyre afraid theyre going to lose their memories and want me to give them tips and suggestions " said mr dottino who would like to structure the memory championship like the scripps national spelling bee with qualifying rounds at the local and state levels certain notes were repeatedly sounded during the daylong contest that the mind is a muscle that people can absolutely sharpen their recall skills as they age and that folks born with less than stellar memories need not despair the ability to encode and spit back the preamble to the constitution the periodic table or this weeks grocery list can be mastered by dint of assorted mental exercises many expressing such views either had a book to sell or like last years champion year old joshua foer were working on one the competitors had one particular trait in common said tony buzan the british author of "use your memory" and "use your head" and the founder in of the world memory championship "they are interested in their brains and how they work " mr buzans own year old brain was working just fine he said "my memory is better now than when i was a university student " jerry zezima a columnist for the stamford connecticut advocate made no such claim the oldest competitor on saturday mr zezima had taken part in the first usa memory championship in and now wanted to defend his ranking fourth from the bottom success "like clockwork ill be back every years " he promised "ive been very consistent i bombed in all the events " ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal
