population growth and rising industrial production are increasing competition for the worlds freshwater supplies coke has some clean water projects in countries a service it hopes will eventually boost local economies and broaden its consumer base but the efforts are also part of a broader strategy under chairman and chief executive e neville isdell to build cokes image as a local benefactor and global diplomat "you have to be an integral and functioning part both in perception and reality in every community in which you operate " he said in an interview the company is also hoping to cure a public relations headache caused by its own thirst for water the largest ingredient in most of its more than beverage brands coke and its bottlers use more than billion gallons of water per year attracting fierce criticism even though their water usage is down since despite a volume increase nowhere is the criticism of coke more severe than in india where amid a drought in government officials forced the company to close a bottling plant after local communities alleged the facility was draining needed groundwater coke denies the charges and says an indian government study concluded its plant wasnt using excessive amounts of water the shutdown offered coke some humbling lessons says mr isdell who took the helm of the company only after the crisis erupted "it was very clear that we had not connected with the communities in the way we needed to " he said but he said it was only one of a number of reasons the company has since made "water stewardship" a strategic priority "water is at the very core of our ethos and responsible use of that resource is very important to us " he said in a recent k securities filing coke listed a shortage of clean water as a strategic risk without such "our system may incur increasing production costs or face capacity constraints " coke said so far coke and its bottlers have spent &# million on water related efforts another &# million is budgeted for including community water projects investments in waste water treatment and other work coke isnt the only company working on improving water supplies pepsico inc

health and water sanitation experts more than two years ago says bill egbe who ran cokes operations there at the time and now heads the companys south africa division the kenya unit had dabbled for years with ideas such as collecting rain on school rooftops but hadnt funded anything larger mr egbe says mr isdells new directive setting water and environmental issues as a priority helped him decide to commit &# for the project in schools "it gave us the courage to say if it works fine if not im not going to get killed" for taking money out of the budget he recalls working with public health experts in the millennium water alliance a group of nongovernmental organizations coke identified the schools in the nyanza province and with care launched water treatment and hygiene education efforts in the company funded the cost of a mold to make small packages of the chlorine based purifying substance the schools needed to clean the water and new clay storage pots to be designed with a small neck so the clean water wouldnt be recontaminated when it learned the government agency charged with drilling wells had equipment but no money it paid for the work while the company hopes such steps will help improve local economies enough eventually to build a new consumer base it isnt looking for that right now mr egbe says for now he says sales of coke products in such areas are "minimal to nonexistent " coke hasnt limited its largess to digging wells and buying clay pots the company also spent &# million last year to help create the global water challenge a coalition of corporations
