wonder land the walter reed fiasco since its publication on feb in the washington post the story of the bureaucratic nightmares experienced at walter reed army medical center by soldiers from the iraq and afghan wars has been washingtons biggest bonfire in a long time nearly four weeks on it still consumes official washington with firings hearings denunciations and the waving forward of commissions the problem with bonfires made in washington is that the high and wild flames of politics sometimes blind the public to the fires true cause so it is with the walter reed scandal the true cause of this bonfire is washington itself the local tribe as we know from dreadful experience the pain caused by hurricane katrina in was made worse by washingtons inadequacies in the bremer commission on terrorism said the national security bureaucracy was poorly organized to protect us from a terrorist attack the commission retrospectively confirmed the bremer commissions findings walter reed is a scandal but a familiar scandal it has also produced a particularly bitter irony one of its first casualties was the career of maj gen george weightman gen weightman the commander of walter reed is in fact precisely the kind of person the nation should wish to have in public life but in an act of supreme self destruction our politics is driving him out of public life well return to gen weightman shortly last week a spokesman for house speaker nancy pelosi came forward to announce the speakers perspective on the manifest problems at walter reed "the american people spoke clearly in the november elections that they wanted accountability and oversight under the republican congress it has been almost nonexistent and you can certainly see that with what occurred at walter reed " no you cannot see that rep john tierney a massachusetts democrat added that "we should have known all this before " but all this was known before though not by reps pelosi and tierney on feb two years ago gop rep tom davis and the government reform committee held a public hearing on the maltreatment of wounded soldiers the hearing was the culmination of an investigation begun in by the committee and the government accountability office virtually everything of substance in that washington post story was described in numbing detail at that hearing two years ago two soldiers army sgts john allen and joseph perez appeared before the davis hearing and described their tours through the same hell painted by the post last month gen peter schoomaker the army chief of staff described the problems at walter reed in words that should be inscribed on portals across every bridge leading into washington "life every day in this system is like running in hip boots in a swamp " he called it a "bureaucratic morass " the core of the problem has been the peacetime administrative systems difficulty in handling wounded or disabled soldiers from the reserves and national guard in the words of the system itself they have "fallen off orders " heres how that happens to enter treatment a wounded reservist would ask to have his "active duty orders" i e the order that called him up for iraq or afghanistan extended for days what is called an active duty medical extension or adme but some soldiers would fall off their active orders before the adme came through others often with complex injuries would use up their three month adme and again fall off orders before receiving a renewal sgt first class allen told the davis committee in laymens terms what this means "when my orders expire it creates a multitude of problems for me and my family no pay no access to the base such as walter reed no medical coverage for my family and the cancellation of all my scheduled medical appointments " someone should make a movie called "national lampoons federal government " the dialogue would include this line from the gaos gregory kutz describing the soldiers problem "overall we found the current stove piped non integrated order writing personnel pay and medical eligibility systems require extensive error prone manual data entry and re entry " thats right "and re entry " despite the public record the committees new democratic chairman henry waxman has rebooted the focus of the "mice and mold" scandal from the obviously dysfunctional government to "privatization" at walter reed maintenance at walter reed collapsed in when the brac base closing commission whatever the merits and with president bushs approval ill advisedly listed walter reed amid a major war so of course the civilian workforce went looking for permanent work elsewhere into this collapsing "morass" the army six months ago dropped maj gen george weightman m d no ordinary desk bound doc george weightman spent five years in the infantry after graduating in from west point then he went to medical school its a decision that has required him to design medical assistance techniques in theater with the troops that entered saudi arabia for the first gulf war in honduras with delta force there contracting malaria in kosovo as head of the th medical brigade for all troops in europe and in kuwait training the surgeons and medics who would treat our wounded in iraq the past four years a model system a former army surgeon who served there with him told me he saw "numerous instances of george cutting through the bureaucracy on the run up to baghdad " and this is just the official side of the ledger one son also west point is on his second army tour in iraq and the other is in the armys medical school so when defense secretary robert gates ordered army secretary francis harvey to run across the potomac river to walter reed and fire someone this is who he hit he fired the wrong person the next day mr gates fired mr harvey washington of late has been giving talented civilians reason not to come there to serve for fear of being destroyed in feckless political wars so naturally it follows we should also drive out the best people willing to forego civilian wealth to defend us in real wars the powers that be in this sorry walter reed saga congress sec gates the dole shalala commission could prove wisdom hasnt fled washington by reinstating gen weightman a government establishment so profligate that it thinks nothing of throwing its best people onto bonfires of its own making will likely over time burn down to nothing write to henninger wsj com
