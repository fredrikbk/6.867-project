why organic now comes in leather moniker spreads beyond foods to cater to the eco conscious but really read the label alexis idone is so committed to buying organic that she recently went to three different stores in search of an elusive item organic cotton balls with organic food surging in popularity retailers are now taking the concept beyond the grocery aisle a flurry of companies are pitching organic furniture linens cosmetics even so called organic leather but organic nonfood products arent as tightly regulated as food and even if something is made with organic material some industry experts say that doesnt necessarily mean its environmentally friendly consumer sales of organic fiber for things like clothes and linens totaled &# million in up from the previous year according to the organic trade association an industry group based in greenfield mass demand is being driven by retailers all over the country who are introducing or expanding lines of "green" or "eco friendly" products williams sonoma inc s pottery barn is rolling out a new line of duvets sheets and towels made with organic cotton this spring furniture and textile designer q collection will soon introduce a line of organic bedding for children retailer gaiam has even added organic cotton shower curtains to its product line the industry is catering to people like ms idone a year old creative director from new york besides the organic cotton balls ms idone also has her eye out for an organic sweater for her dog "i dont want chemicals going into my body or the environment " she says organic food and crops are those grown without the use of most conventional pesticides and synthetic fertilizers yet while buying organic textiles may support production thats better for the environment the immediate health benefit for people who use the products is unclear the american medical association hasnt taken a position on the health benefits of purchasing organic products according to a spokesman cotton inc a not for profit trade organization based in cary n c that represents u s importers and growers most of which use nonorganic farming methods says on its web site that theres no pesticide residue on conventionally grown cotton products anyway the u s department of agriculture requires that product fibers like cotton or wool that are labeled "organic" be produced without the use of most conventional pesticides or synthetic fertilizers however the department doesnt regulate how these textiles are processed this means consumers could potentially buy a chair made with organically grown cotton but the chair could be treated with a chemical dye or flame retardant the organic trade association has standards for textile handling and processing which ban things like toxic dyes but the guidelines are voluntary environmental advocates say there are similar issues with organically labeled cosmetics labels can say they are made with organically grown products like lavender or oranges but still contain synthetic ingredients such as triethanolamine or fake fragrance "you have to really read the label " says jane houlihan vice president for research at the environmental working group a watchdog group based in washington d c she says consumers can also check which brands have potentially unhealthy ingredients in the groups database of cosmetics at www ewg org skindeep another term frequently used to sell everything from furniture to flooring is "sustainable " according to jerry dewitt director of the leopold center for sustainable agriculture at iowa state university in ames the term sustainable is generally defined as a production method that provides a long term profit for the producer protects natural resources and has positive social impact but ultimately he says "sustainability is in the eyes of the beholder you dont have a litmus test " some argue that just because something is grown organically doesnt mean the method is sustainable the words "natural" and "green" can also fluster consumers textiles made from natural cotton often mean that no dyes or chemicals were added to the cotton but it doesnt guarantee the cotton was grown without the use of pesticides or other chemicals this can bother some purists jeannette kearney a year old homemaker in lexington mass made a mistake several months ago when she purchased a " green" blanket she assumed would be made from cotton grown without pesticides "i looked at the label and thats when i realized it just meant there were no additives " but not that the cotton was grown organically she says the organic trend has gone beyond textiles with some companies pitching so called organic or sustainable leather q collection offers a chair made with leather from free range cattle that is treated with vegetable dyes and isnt processed with heavy metals organic leather a new company in mill valley calif sells everything from bed headboards to leather bangle bracelets made from the hides of wild animals or those raised to produce organic meat says founder rowan gabrielle to clarify terms for consumers the organic trade association in january adopted comprehensive global standards for organic textiles that govern processing the group is also developing a logo for organic textiles such as those found in furniture and linens that meet those standards for example the standards ban processing of the textiles with heavy metals and chemicals such as formaldehyde but do allow the use of synthetic sewing thread and the furniture industry six months ago founded the sustainable furniture council which aims to eventually come up with its own labeling standards for furniture products that are currently billed as green or environmentally friendly says executive director susan inglis but the bar isnt high to join membership is open to any company that creates a public statement about its commitment to environmentally friendly practices makes those practices transparent and conducts a self inquiry into its current sourcing and manufacturing practices according to ms inglis she says consumers trying to make sense of the semantics should ask what percentage of a fabric is organic what "natural" fabric means and look for furniture treated with water based finishing they can also ask if the wood used has been approved by the forest stewardship council an international nonprofit that promotes responsible forestry nevertheless some retailers say consumers shouldnt get too hung up on organic labels or certification denise mari owner of organic avenue a new york city store that carries everything from a hemp dog carrier to flax toothbrushes points out that materials like hemp and bamboo are increasingly used for products like sheets or clothing because they are fast growing and dont require lots of pesticides anyway they dont usually bear organic labels meg siegel a senior vice president at a real estate firm began shopping there and said she was amazed at the range of organic and natural products she recently bought the flax toothbrush which has a handle made of the plant material "everything is just so stressful these days i like to surround myself with healthier things " she says reading the labels a flurry of non food products are touting themselves as healthier and better for the environment with labels such as "organic" and "green " heres a guide to the vernacular green this is a widely used term used to describe products or materials that are renewable recycled low in chemical emissions or that are in any way touted to be good for the environment and or human health some retailers say the word has become too broadly used to be meaningful natural in the context of products like furniture or linens it often means that no chemicals or harmful dyes were added to the product but it doesnt necessarily mean that the material itself is organic organic according to the department of agriculture an organic label means that food or fibers must be produced without the use of most conventional pesticides or synthetic fertilizers sustainable generally "sustainable"means that the production is profitable preserves natural resources and has a social improvement component
