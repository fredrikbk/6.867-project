journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources drug trafficking west africa becomes the conduit to europe illegal drugs from latin america are finding their way to europe through a new transit hub west africa in the past latin american drug lords would exploit their historical ties to the iberian peninsula to ship most of their drugs into europe through spains northeastern coast but as drug patrols and seizures in the area increased traffickers found they had a better chance at evading detection by using west africa as a staging ground to get their product into europe traffickers stockpile drugs especially cocaine in countries such as cape verde guinea bissau guinea togo ghana nigeria and senegal where customs and immigration controls are relatively weak transport specialists mostly from nigeria and ghana then move the drugs to small landing zones on western european coasts or send them directly by air to european cities behind the new smuggling routes is europes growing demand for cocaine while the u s remains the worlds top market its growth has stagnated traffickers growing reliance on the circuitous route through west africa has created some unusual scenes in places like impoverished guinea bissau where colombian gangsters have been seen driving expensive cars and setting up legitimate front businesses to conceal their activities although west african governments have carried out a few large drug busts they cant afford to make the drug trade a priority according to the u n s office on drugs and crime "only a very small proportion of the cocaine passing through africa is actually being seized " nevertheless ghana managed last year to seize two tons of cocaine hidden in boxes of fish and on a flight from morocco to amsterdam in december authorities discovered that west african passengers had swallowed cocaine packets or concealed them in their luggage law enforcement officials say they are especially worried about traffickers use of morocco where money from illicit drugs could be used to assist islamic extremists the suspected leaders of the madrid bombings were originally from northern morocco and allegedly traded hashish for explosives los angeles times march politics campaign finance overhaul hits small donors critic says campaign finance overhaul advocates are throwing good money out with the bad despite a vigorous effort over the past decade revision efforts have done little to limit the impact of donations in the u s political system but in trying to stem the flow of money finance overhaul has thwarted what had the potential to be one of american democracys healthiest developments the rising power of small political donations says mark schmitt writing in the left leaning journal democracy mr schmitt who fought for campaign finance revamping for a decade notes that the amount of money in u s politics has steadily increased in mr schmitt says he was appalled by the &# billion spent on all campaigns that year in the election &# billion might be spent on the presidential campaign alone but politics has also grown more substantive if more vitriolic than it was in in large part because the internet has allowed politicians to harness the power of small donations from individuals this has allowed some politicians to remain more independent from lobbyists money and party central committees while diversifying the political debate yet campaign overhaul activists see small online driven contributions as another case of money flowing into the system instead advocates should embrace this development says mr schmitt whose own views on revision have shifted over the years when money comes from individuals and political organizations as opposed to corporations seeking access it helps expand participation in politics of course even with small sums the rich are better positioned than the poor to join the political debate through donations to address this mr schmitt proposes a system similar to the one used in new york city which matches smaller contributions on a to basis democracy spring food u s halal mres win over few iraqi afghan
