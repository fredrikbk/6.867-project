usana sales plan draws fire from felon turned gumshoe usana health sciences inc a marketer of vitamins and nutritional supplements has set sales records in every one of its last quarters while watching its stock price soar more than over that time but the salt lake city based companys unusual sales system is drawing a skeptical review from barry minkow the convicted stock fraud felon turned private investigator who has bought "put" options on usanas shares in a bet the price will fall usana traded yesterday at &# down cents at p m on the nasdaq stock market and now has a market value of about &# billion mr minkow is no ordinary gumshoe after serving jail time in the s for stock fraud in the zzzz best debacle he became a christian pastor founded a san diego company that hunts for other potential frauds and has won praise from the federal bureau of investigation he recently helped expose pinnacle development partners an atlanta real estate marketer whose founder has been indicted usana health sciences like amway corp and other "multilevel marketers " uses at home distributors or "associates " to sell products according to company documents and interviews it arranges them in a hierarchy one person is at the very top two distributors sit below him four below them eight on the next level and so on the company pays a distributor a commission of about on sales made by those below him in the hierarchy up to a certain limit but to be eligible for commissions distributors must buy or refer to the company &# in orders each month usana which disagrees with mr minkows analysis of it uses the recruitment slogan "true health and true wealth" and its web site offers "high income potential " the company has said it holds recruitment meetings a week around the country about of usanas revenue comes from sales to its associates only comes from sales to customers unaffiliated with the company last year the company earned &# million on sales of &# million usana which was founded in currently trades at about times its per share earnings well ahead of the standard &amp poors stock indexs multiple of analysts expect strong earnings growth of this year mr minkow says the companys sales model is unsustainable because it requires the constant recruitment of new associates eventually he argues the company will run out of distributors who will face long odds selling products or recruiting new disciples usanas major product a multivitamin is far more expensive than rivals as of the end of only of usanas associates had ever earned a commission according to the companys latest figures among those who had been paid the figures show didnt earn enough to cover the &# they have to purchase or refer each month to qualify for commissions usana says this kind of analysis misses the point "the inherent goal isnt about coming in to quote break even " says fred cooper the companys executive vice president of operations most associates are interested in purchasing the vitamins without commissions mr cooper says and most distributors view what they can earn as a vitamin discount not as a path to profits mr minkow also says he is suspicious because of usanas offshore ownership the companys chairman myron wentz renounced his u s citizenship in the mid s and now claims citizenship in the caribbean tax haven of st kitts and nevis he controls a stake in usana held by a company in the isle of man in the irish sea which in turn is controlled by an entity registered in liechtenstein gilbert fuller usanas chief financial officer said mr wentz renounced his u s citizenship because "he sees himself as a citizen of the world" and that the matter had nothing to do with the company cole chambers of broomfield colo says he joined usana looking for a "turn key business " but after handing over &# in sign up and activation purchases he couldnt resell anything or recruit anyone and eventually gave up "i feel like the vitamins are so expensive " he said usana says people like mr chambers can take advantage of its one year refund for products returned by distributors who quit usana charges associates &# for a day supply of its top selling multivitamin usana essentials more than double the retail price of other premium vitamins a premium vitamin from competitor gnc corp the ultra mega green multivitamin sells for &# for a day supply usanas price is also more than times that of mass market brands like wyeths centrum mr minkow says usana looks like a pyramid scheme to him a fraud that works like a chain letter in which each new recruit has to find new members in order to profit until the available pool of recruits dries up usana says it is doing nothing wrong it says it doesnt force anybody to make the qualifying purchases in the past the distinction between a pyramid scheme and a legitimate multilevel marketer has come down to a formula devised by the federal trade commission that test looks at how much of sales are "retail " or sold to end users applying the formula to usana the company would escape classification as a pyramid scheme if at least of its sales were "retail " deciding what a retail sale is can be tricky peter vander nat the ftc economist who co wrote a paper on the subject says it depends on intent if people are buying because they want to use a companys products those sales can count as "retail " if they are buying to stay in the game for future commissions those sales wouldnt qualify he said usana says it doesnt keep track of distributors sales to the public but requires that at least of its products be bought by "end consumers " which includes associates mr minkow has sent a critical page report on usana to the securities and exchange commission and the fbi according to people familiar with the matter the fbi plans to question the company neither the sec nor fbi would comment
