sharply lower on worries about their exposure to u s subprime lenders these banks and others in the region have provided credit to u s subprime lenders such as new century financial corp which said this week that its bank lenders are pulling their funding apart from credit defaults problem spots for banks include decreasing revenue from a falloff in the sale of mortgage backed bonds also some banks could be left with pools of devalued mortgages that had been warehoused in order to package and sell to investors analysts say morgan stanley analyzed the mortgage operations of european banks including barclays plc and royal bank of scotland group plc in the united kingdom credit suisse group and ubs of switzerland and germanys deutsche bank and estimates that the downturn of the subprime mortgage loan market could result in a hit to earnings for those banks totaling &# billion many analysts believe that european banks direct exposure to the u s subprime market is modest but they say a broader reduction in investors appetite for risk is likely to hit share prices in this sector another worry is that exposure to the u s subprime market will pop up in fixed income products such as mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations where bonds are issued using bundles of loans other bonds mortgages and credit derivatives to back up payment obligations investors and banks could hold these instruments without realizing they have subprime mortgages in them "people lack the tools to quantify the exposure of the financial system to subprime and where there is uncertainty you sell first " said teun draaisma co head of european equity strategy at morgan stanley while european investors were drawing direct lines between their banks and the u s subprime market the picture was less clear in asia where the effects of this market are seen as being less specific some market strategists cited it as a factor as markets across the region fell the nikkei stock

that started at the end of last month are seen as a correction after a huge upswing in stock values in the downturn in subprime lending could have a knock on effect however by contributing to the drying up of credit in asia an easy money environment in the region has fueled appetite for risky assets including real estate and that may be ending says kenny tse a property analyst at morgan stanley the subprime lending worries and concerns about possible unwinding of the japanese yen carry trade which has allowed investors to borrow yen at interest rates close to zero and invest in assets around the world are contributing to this that has dimmed prospects of property developers that are relying on open avenues of financing to complete building projects "people are realizing that there is risk on the horizon " mr tse says subprime lending as a discrete category of home mortgages doesnt exist in most of asia in japan mortgage default by homeowners also isnt an issue because interest rates are at rock bottom levels but there are concerns that fast loan growth and poor credit records in the regions big emerging markets could lead to problems down the line in india for instance annual loan volume growth of has prompted some to question whether the financial sector is overheating especially in very hot areas such as property so far those concerns havent hit banking stocks in particular or led to mass defaults in china credit records generally dont exist making it difficult to assess creditworthiness still lending levels for property have remained high which has had a u s style impact of helping moderate income people move into homeownership lifting house transactions and underpinning prices the underlying risk to chinas banking system is banks tend to know
