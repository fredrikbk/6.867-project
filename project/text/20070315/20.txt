coming to order how the court really works supreme conflict by jan crawford greenburg penguin press pages &# confirmation wars by benjamin wittes rowman &amp littlefield pages &# to read certain accounts of the supreme court you would think that it is a place where politicians in robes push the laws and policies they personally prefer thwart the ones they dislike and look around for some legal reasoning to justify what they have done jan crawford greenburg does not understand things that way she sees the courts justices as above all jurists to use an old fashioned term legal thinkers moved by profound views about the nature of law some like antonin scalia and clarence thomas on the current court think that constitutional rulings should proceed only from analysis of the text others like stephen breyer and anthony kennedy feel the need to figure into their judgments the concrete effects of the courts decisions it is jurisprudential conflict not mere policy dispute that keeps the court from settling the law once and for all guided by such insight ms greenburg offers a fresh and detailed account of how the court works and relatedly how presidents decide who gets to sit there "supreme conflict" is by far the most fair minded portrait of the supreme court in a long time much more rounded and reliable than bob woodwards "the brethren" and edward lazaruss "closed chambers" rather than celebrate a few "enlightened" jurists doing battle with right wing ideologues in the manner of so many court reporters ms greenburg conveys the entire range of the courts opinions fair mindedly even treating conservative jurisprudence with respect and she overturns conventional wisdom along the way clarence thomas is often depicted as an unthinking disciple of antonin scalia ms greenburg argues that the influence often works the other way more than once justice scalia has abandoned his preliminary votes in conference following oral argument upon reading justice thomass dissenting opinions as for sandra day oconnor whose retirement in inspired so much high praise ms greenburg shows her to have often been indecisive inclined to decide cases by instinct rather than principle one example among many justice oconnor applied a "strict scrutiny" requirement to affirmative action policies requiring a "compelling government interest" but then effectively relaxed this standard when the university of michigan wanted to keep discriminating on the basis of race in grutter v bollinger according to ms greenburg justice thomass steadfast adherence to the original understanding of the constitution repelled justice oconnor his determination to revisit or overrule past decisions struck her as extreme but justice thomas did not have the political skills to temper her disquiet ms greenburgs reporting demonstrates just how important such political skills are a new justice not only adds his own vote to the courts tally but can also shift the votes of others as fellow justices are pushed to reflect anew on their judicial philosophy if they have one or on their reputation and habits of mind if they dont justice oliver wendell holmes called his own court "nine scorpions in a bottle " the current court in ms greenburgs chronicle sometimes resembles a group encounter session it makes sense for any president when he has a chance to nominate a supreme court justice to choose someone who not only embraces a particular judicial philosophy but also possesses a gift for persuasion each quality can get lost in the often chaotic nominating process however ms greenburg reports that president reagan nominated justices oconnor and kennedy despite the opposition of internal critics who correctly noted that both nominees lacked a firm originalist philosophy president george h w bush she reveals was planning to nominate kenneth starr then solicitor general but was talked out of it by attorney general richard thornburgh who threatened to resign if mr bush did so the decision to cast aside mr starr for david souter a new hampshire judge who had little sense of the national debates in which the court inevitably participates ranks as one of the great blunders in the history of supreme court nominations others were no less painful dwight eisenhower famously said of his presidency "i made two mistakes and both of them are sitting on the supreme court " he was referring to earl warren and william brennan by contrast george w bush may have reason in future years to say something famously about his two court triumphs mr bush was determined not to repeat his fathers mistake as ms greenburg shows when justice oconnor announced her retirement he vetted many nominees he settled on john roberts not only because he had a glittering resume and sound views but because he would be a "good colleague" and not alienate his fellow justices mr roberts would eventually replace chief justice william rehnquist who died in september after the debacle of the harriet miers nomination quickly withdrawn mr bush chose samuel alito for essentially the same reasons impeccable credentials and a measure of the collegiality that mr bush saw in mr roberts both men are now in a position to appeal to justice kennedy the key swing vote on the court and perhaps even to justice breyer one possible criticism of ms greenburgs tour de force is that she doesnt spend much time on the ordeal of the confirmation process and its effects on supreme court appointments benjamin wittess "confirmation wars" admirably fills the gap he eloquently laments the descent of the confirmation process into a televised star chamber proceeding marked by crude political bullying and vicious personal attacks the reason for such a descent he argues is that american courts in general and the supreme court in particular now resolve conflicts that were previously left to legislatures todays supreme court he notes is inclined to strike down republican supported laws on the grounds that they violate fundamental rights and democratic supported ones on the grounds that they violate property rights and federalism senators of both parties try to wrest from each court nominee a commitment to vote one way or another on particular cases or controversies the senators are pushing back mr wittes believes against what they perceive as judicial usurpation what to do about this mr wittes proposes getting rid of televised confirmation hearing testimony for starters given the propensity of politicians for grandstanding though it is hard to imagine such a reform ever occurring in any case such testimony has a value mr bush rethought the nomination of harriet miers ms greenburg has the full story only when he realized that hostile senators would expose ms mierss weak qualifications it could be argued that the "confirmation wars" have inadvertently helped to make the current court intellectually stronger than any other in the nations history a smart nominee has a better chance of surviving the senatorial gantlet of course the confirmation process would recover a lot of its dignity and logic if the supreme court stopped intruding unduly into the nations political life and allowed legislatures to do the peoples will justices roberts and alito say that they favor a limited role for the court if they are as effective as president bush hopes maybe they can pull some swing votes their way mr mcginnis is a professor at northwestern universitys school of law see related letter "letters to the editor seeking a humbler court that is less activist " wsj
