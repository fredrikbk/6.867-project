devastation by degrees the day the earth caved in by joan quigley random house pages &# for overall quality the best kind of coal is anthracite and in the th century three quarters of the worlds supply was found in northeastern pennsylvania because of its high heat content and clean burning properties anthracite was ideal for heating homes and businesses at the peak in the u s mined million tons of anthracite coal thus the anthracite under centralia pa was the main reason for the towns existence for much of the late th and early th centuries after world war ii however natural gas and abundant supplies of oil from texas and the persian gulf made coal less desirable as a source of heat by the early s coal was no longer central to centralia in the company that owned much of centralias coal seeing little economic value and concerned about potential future legal liabilities deeded it to the town for &# it would turn out to be a costly acquisition eight years later in a mine fire erupted itself not an unprecedented event spontaneous coal fires from ancient times shaped the landscape of the american west today uncontrolled mine fires burn fiercely in many nations more than million tons of coal are consumed by fires annually in china contributing as much to world wide carbon dioxide emissions as all the cars and light trucks in the u s in colorado one coal mine has burned for years as long as mining coal was profitable private companies made heroic efforts to put out such fires as soon as they were discovered the centralia fire however broke out after the coal company had left in a town garbage dump above an abandoned mine local officials reacted complacently and within a few months the fire began to rage in "the day the earth caved in " joan quigley tells the story of the fire and its devastating effects on centralia she also chronicles two decades of confusion and debate over what the best response to the fire might be in the first months after the fire began the pennsylvania state government made half hearted and failed attempts to extinguish it but it was not until that a federal state team committed &# million to block the progress of the fire with a new technique they sought to inject a fly ash barrier between the burning areas and those still unaffected but this failed too by the late s pilot lights and lanterns were going out in centralias basements starved for oxygen by the carbon dioxide coming from the mine fire residents feared for their health in the national media finally descended on centralia when a year old boy fell into a smoking sinkhole in his grandmothers backyard and had to be saved by a friend by this time there was more money to help the federal surface mining act of had established a nationwide tax on coal mining to build up an "abandoned mine lands" fund still federal and state officials bickered over how to spend the money in centralia some town residents wanted to leave with the governments help many others fiercely resisted the idea it seemed that a stalemate might go on indefinitely the fire spread and became even hotter in government estimates suggested that the most draconian efforts to put out the fire and thus the most reliable ones would cost more than &# million but that sum greatly exceeded the property value of the entire town thus the pressure for relocation intensified interior secretary james watt kept insisting that the state of pennsylvania contribute more money to the project thus delaying a decision but his departure in october following a series of public blunders opened the way for a resolution soon after congress appropriated &# million to move centralias residents by only about a dozen remained it is quite a story ms quigley elects to tell it in a novel like way concentrating on the towns residents and devoting major parts of the book to births loves feuds divorces and other aspects of centralia family life including long ago conversations the book is filled with passages like this "catharenes winter with her in laws living under their regime had exposed strains in her relationship with peacho" her husband it is hardly unusual these days for an author to apply fiction writing techniques to a real setting and real people the result in this case is vividness in places but also tedium too many personal details that can get in the way of the more interesting story of the mine fire itself as for the larger drama ms quigley describes centralia residents often behaving badly as they debate what to do about the fire in one case even firebombing the store of an opponent but the leading culprits in her telling are government officials they mislead residents propose ill conceived methods of putting out the mine fire and take years to make a decision it is hard not to share ms quigleys sense of disappointment and indignation if parallels are to be sought hurricane katrina may be apt in both cases a natural disaster to which human error contributed a great deal made a geographical area uninhabitable in both cases the government had an important role to play it failed badly in centralia taking decades to figure out what to do one can hope that an answer will be found more rapidly today in new orleans although the signs are not auspicious mr nelson a professor in the school of public policy of the university of maryland is the author of "the making of federal coal policy" and "private neighborhoods and the transformation of local government "
