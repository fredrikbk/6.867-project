face the music reverse crossover dreams booming hispanic market has acts hoping for success in a second musical language online edition i was watching a performance by beyonce on a morning show not long ago when she suddenly started singing in spanish as it turns out beyonce was set to come out with a deluxe version of her latest album "bday " featuring spanish language versions of songs from the original album she also recently released "beautiful liar " a duet with columbian pop rock star shakira the sultry dance the two women perform together in the video requires no translation listen to beyonce singing "ireemplazable" real windows media there have been plenty of stories about spanish language acts crossing over to english now with the hispanic market booming some english language performers are trying their best to cross over the other way bronx born entertainer jennifer lopez who has puerto rican roots recently released her first spanish language album and pop performer nelly furtado who is of portuguese heritage and has recorded in portuguese in the past is readying her debut spanish language album julio reyes a songwriter producer who worked on ms lopezs album is also working on ms furtados project anglo performers without overt latin roots are climbing on board kids performer dan zanes for example is said to be recording a spanish language cd canadian singer avril lavigne is going even further shes come out with versions of her new single "girlfriend" with choruses in spanish french italian portuguese japanese german and mandarin listen to "girlfriend" with a mandarin chorus real windows media pop vocalist christina aguilera may have kicked off the new trend several years ago when she branched out from the teen market and embraced her latin roots which some fans didnt know she had with an album in spanish but musicians have long sought to broaden their audiences by recording songs in other languages in the s and s several non english songs by performers with foreign or ethnic roots became hits in the u s market including "la bamba" spanish by ritchie valens "nel blu dipinto di blu" a k a "volare" italian by domenico modugno "sukiyaki" japanese by kyu sakamoto and "dominique" french by the singing nun a number of spanish language songs have surfaced on the pop charts over the years such as santanas "oye como va " but its hard to imagine a song sung in italian japanese or french getting chart topping radio airplay today todays reverse crossover boomlet english language performers singing in other languages isnt unprecedented either peter gabriel came out with a german language version of his hit "shock the monkey" called "shock den affen" and van halen singer david lee roth once released a spanish language version of his solo album "eat em and smile " some of whats behind the reverse crossover is marketing during the s s and s it could be difficult for english language performers to get a full hearing in europe in some cases acts would get outsold by local performers singing a foreign stars hits in the local tongue in an attempt to enter the european market some american and british stars re recorded their songs in french german spanish and italian the songs were typically translated by others and learned phonetically by the artists david bowie for example re recorded his song "space oddity" as "ragazzo solo ragazza sola " the lyrics in the italian version had little to do with the original which the record company reportedly deemed a bit too spacey for italians one of the most notable foreign language crossover attempts was made by johnny cash the country star recorded a number of his songs including "wer kennt den weg" "i walk the line" in german he also recorded some songs in spanish including "fuego damor" "ring of fire" listen to mr cash singing "wer kennt den weg" real windows media in january the beatles whod spent time in hamburg before they became famous recorded two german versions of their hits during a stay in paris "komm gib mir deine hand" "i want to hold your hand" and "sie liebt dich" "she loves you" none of the group members thought the german re recordings were a good idea the german arm of emi reportedly insisted on the sessions and they initially skipped it in favor of tea producer george martin ended up dragging them to pathe marconi studios to cut the records listen to the beatles singing "komm gib mir deine hand" real windows media but it could be argued that nat king cole did the most to lay the groundwork for todays reverse crossover artists in the s and s with latin rhythms finding their way into american pop and jazz mr cole traveled to cuba a number of times to record material in spanish and eventually released the albums "rumba a la king and "cole espanol " he worked with performers from the island such as cuban trumpeter chocolate armenteros and appeared at local nightspots such as havanas tropicana nightclub mr coles music brought the rhythms and sounds of the latin world to audiences around the planet but things can get lost in translation i speak from personal experience my first novel was translated into german when i showed a german speaking colleague the book she told me the title had been changed i wondered what else had been altered between the covers i just hoped i didnt unknowingly set off an international incident but the alterations that occur when art shifts tongues can be a good thing the poet derek walcott once said "to change your language you must change your life " many english language performers who sing in other languages change their words but little else the music remains largely the same beyonce does feature some latin flavored remixes of her songs on her re released cd and duets with mexican star alejandro fernandez there have been plenty of artists david byrne and wyclef jean among them who have dug a bit deeper and created music that not only features non english lyrics but also internationally flavored music as well frank sinatra for example once recorded an album with antonio carlos jobim with the brazilian maestro singing in portuguese and the chairman of the board crooning in english "francis albert sinatra &amp antonio carlos jobim" garnered critical acclaim lasting popular appeal and opened doors for brazilian music while some of todays artists are crossing language boundaries theres a difference between crossing a boundary and erasing it listen to mr sinatra and mr jobim singing "the girl from ipanema" real windows media write to christopher john farley
