not by tanks alone propaganda berlin a russian artist asked how officials shaped public opinion in the soviet era responded "we usually did that with tanks " more than works of art at the german history museum here remind us that more than tanks did the job between and whether in the soviet union fascist italy or nazi germany images of dictators led the way pictures of adolf hitler speaking saluting joking with eva braun are staples of the history channel but have you seen the fuhrer on horseback in a suit of armor "der bannertraeger" "the standard bearer" a painting by hubert lanzinger portrays him as a medieval knight holding a nazi flag hitler bought it for his planned museum in linz a patch on the canvas covers the bayonet hole made by an american g i in seen today that pose seems worthy of "the producers " so do many pictures in "art and propaganda the clash of nations " at the former zeughaus on unter den linden through april soviet artists portrayed stalin as a gentle leader bearing the weight of the world and bouquets from schoolgirls mussolini in power since was usually cast as a scowling roman emperor the futurist sculptor renato bertelli distilled that face into an upright abstract knob in his "il duce a continuous profile " which reached the public as thousands of affordable souvenirs handpainted hitler busts were also a consumer hit during the third reich like stalin franklin delano roosevelt whose new deal is an odd fourth leg in the propaganda survey is a fatherly leader an armchair george washington the survey goes far beyond any unintentional humor to view how four governments mandated and funded art when image building served nation building at its most extreme more revealing is how those governments deployed and mixed a range of visual media from painting sculpture and posters to architecture and the museum art exhibition in political strategies aimed at their own citizens and at the outside world at the international exposition in paris all four countries built competing pavilions to promote themselves its remarkable how much the modernist structures look alike in the basement galleries of i m peis addition to the museum the exhibition moves through thematic clusters the leader the family the landscape labor and industry and war in the s the four countries rallied their citizens with images of rebirth and regeneration infused with the th centurys sentimental naturalism a favorite subject is happy workers building a new factory or highway with all hints of class struggle excised except in new deal america gone from the russian images is abstraction although italians married futurism to fascism gone in germany are world war i amputees begging and the revelers and libertines and successful jewish businessmen portrayed in weimar art on canvas the master race is not defeated or decadent or weak or grotesque and certainly not tolerant once the war broke out propaganda in all the countries got more predictable glorifying the troops boosting domestic morale demanding sacrifice and demonizing the enemy as the nazis had done with jews for years norman rockwells earnest "four freedoms" fueled that campaign in the u s an italian cartoon parodied fdr on his knees praying for victory as black soldiers carted off antiquities none of the dictatorships is rehabilitated in this ambitious show which is revisionist only in the daunting range of its objects and in the inclusion of the u s the dhm is a national history museum not an art museum and even objects offer a comparative sampling of years rather than a systematic survey the exhaustive catalog is unfortunately mostly in german the sheer number of hitler portraits on view more than gives the show an eerie novelty here showing nazi images is illegal in germany which bans selling or displaying pictures of hitler nazi leaders the swastika and other nazi insignias unless done for "scientific" reasons hitler addresses troops children and the elderly he even poses at an art exhibition in front of prometheus a sculpture by the nazi stalwart arno breker yet hitler as an artist seems never to have been a propaganda subject at the munich museum that hitler built the haus der deutschen kunst painters submitted so many hitler portraits to the annual grosse deutsche kunstausstellung that officials limited the number on view at any time also at the dhm is "die kunstzeitschrift" "the art magazine" by udo wendel a self portrait from with the artist paintbrush in hand next to his parents who are reading about the current nazi exhibition its not just a sentimental family scene but a dutiful evocation of national socialist culture wendel submitted his painting to the grosse deutsche kunstausstellung in where hitler was one shopper among hundreds of thousands of visitors major loans of nazi images came from the u s army which still holds some paintings and drawings deemed to be propaganda in a basement in downtown washington these pictures including four watercolors by hitler are what remain of the german war art collection of the u s army art collection u s officers seized the german pictures on orders from gen george c marshall to remove all images of nazi leaders symbols military and "propaganda" from germany in more than were shipped stateside in when u s military lawyers warned that the seizures violated treaties banning art pillaging some works were returned to germany in another were sent back in over strong objections from some members of congress and from elie wiesel who sought the art for the future u s holocaust museum those pictures are now in the dhm "they are part of our difficult heritage we have to deal with them " said the exhibitions co curator hans joerg czech who also guides visitors to the museums permanent installations on the nazi period for fear of fueling the global market the dhm does not purchase any nazi memorabilia which it collects as part of its mission to document and interpret german history it is now the largest holder of such material objects from the wolfsonian collection source of most of the italian pictures were often bought at flea markets much stalinist era public sculpture was destroyed in the early s "der bannertraeger" is on loan from washington so is "soldaten" "soldiers" the seven foot high central canvas of the heroic triptych by hans schmitz wiedenbrueck celebrating three pillars of the nazi volk in the three panels reunited for the first time since an infantryman pilot and marine are flanked by a miner and cowherd the army returned the two side panels depicting nazi archetypes to germany because they lacked propaganda value the inclusion of new deal america reflects the cross cultural approach of the dhms acknowledged influence the wolfsonian museum in miami beach which tracks stylistic parallels in th century art design and popular culture theres no denying that the shows four countries shared academic styles and a modern vocabulary in graphic arts photography and film an american poster of a sledgehammer bears the slogan "work to keep free " chillingly close to "arbeit macht frei " the sign that greeted prisoners at auschwitz and the group portraits of stalin with cheery delegations could be norman rockwell reproductions yet no one but cartoonists tried to put fdr in armor on a horse in a toga or alone on an icy steppe nor did the u s ban or burn art that failed to meet the standards of wpa murals or punish artists who dissented once the war begins even the nazi rules of image making bend a grotesque expressionism creeps into paintings of the horrors of battle by wehrmacht soldier artists darkening as the war turns against germany in "kaempfenden volk" "fighting people" by hans schmitz wiedenbrueck women work in a reddish brown furnace while wehrmacht horsemen in the shadowy background ride to battle it is more "goetterdammerung" than "triumph of the will " the unenviable task of history museums is to offer lessons to the crowds who enter the galleries yet the dhm treads lightly here theres the obvious lesson in viewing propaganda art dont believe every picture you see with a frame around it superceded by video the paintings wont get the masses marching again and often have the kitschy quaintness of political polemics whose time has passed although the "museum of the soviet liberation of berlin" a few miles east is a propaganda shrine to a myth that ruled here until yet some image making techniques have survived to live another life in contemporary art you can see it all in a photograph of mussolini striking an imperious pose his face emblazoned on the wall behind him in five rows of portraits like a campbell soup can or jackie onassis you can just imagine andy warhol at that great cocktail party in the sky or somewhere farther south "benito meet marilyn " mr darcy is a correspondent for the art newspaper london see related letter "letters to the editor nazi
