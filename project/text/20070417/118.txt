the arab invasion jakarta indonesia the headquarters of the front for the defense of islam is reached by a narrow alley just off a one lane street in a residential neighborhood near downtown jakarta but step inside the carpeted reception area decorated by a mural of a desert mosque and partially open to the sky and its as if youve arrived in a bedouin kingdom your host is habib mohammad rizieq shihab he is dressed entirely in white a religious conceit far from typical of most indonesian ulama or experts in islamic theology to the question "where are you from " mr rizieq is quick to explain that he is descended from the quraishi tribe from what is now yemen just how he knows this isnt clear but its the symbolism that counts the prophet mohammad was a quraishi and the tribe is entrusted with the responsibility for protecting gods house the qeeba in mecca mr rizieq in fact is a native of jakarta for the better part of the past decade mr rizieq and his front known by its indonesian initials fpi have played a prominent role in indonesian political life although the fpi is not a political party it is an islamist vigilante group with the self appointed mission of policing and if necessary violently suppressing "un islamic" behavior squads of fpi militants have forcibly shut down hundreds of brothels small time gambling operations discos nightclubs and bars serving alcoholic beverages they have also stormed "unauthorized" christian houses of worship attacked peaceful demonstrators from indonesias renascent communist party trashed the office of the national commission on human rights and rampaged through airports looking for israelis to kill "non muslims from dar el harb countries at war with muslims if they are in indonesia then it is the duty of muslims to oppose them to the last drop of blood " he says "george bush can be killed too " as for the legitimacy of attacks on american diplomats and civilians "this is a dilemma " though after a moments reflection he concludes that they "cannot be disturbed" since they are here with the consent of a muslim government the source of mr rizieqs views and of the islamic radicalism that increasingly infects this country becomes a little clearer as he tells his life story a poor but talented student he won a full scholarship to study at king saud university in riyadh he says he was "not influenced by wahhabism " which he found excessively literal in its readings of the quran and islamic law as evidence of his moderation he observes that in his future shariah state authorities would not "cut off peoples hands for stealing right away first you have to raise people up " still saudi attitudes plainly rubbed off on mr rizieq particularly in their obsession with religious purity "i violently reject the mixing of non islamic and islamic theology " he says in reference to the syncretic practices of indonesian muslims who often incorporate such pre islamic rituals as communing with the spirits of the dead muslims who do not pray five times a day or do not fast during ramadan are "infidels deviants " the same goes for heterodox islamic sects such as the ahmadiyya as well as the great th century sufi mystic ibn arabi he is just as opposed to pancasila indonesias secular and pluralist official ideology which he contrasts invidiously with the islamic concept of dhimmitude "the status of being a dhimmi religious minority is an exalted one because you are under islam and you are protected as long as you respect its rules " mr rizieq claims to have five million followers in an apparent joke he proposes to send them to new york "to study and learn " the real figure is probably in the tens of thousands at most but there is no question mr rizieq has magnified the fpis influence with his modulated and so far non lethal use of violence which has helped stave off a full scale government crackdown while allowing him to bully businesses communities and individuals at will he has also reportedly benefited from the support of the so called green islamic generals who rose to prominence in the last years of the suharto era as the dictator in a pattern common to ostensibly secular muslim leaders sought to shore up his regime by appealing to his "islamic" constituency less clear is whether the fpi also gets financial support from abroad knowledgeable observers suggest mr rizieq gets all the money he needs by extorting the victims of his islamic purification campaigns but as imdadun rahmat a leading scholar of islamic extremism in indonesia notes "the radicals are all drinking from the same breast " by which he means the ideological inspiration and financial support provided by saudi arabia the mecca based muslim world league for example is notorious for sending its representatives to indonesia with suitcases of cash to fund its pet projects often extremist religious boarding schools the saudi religious affairs office in jakarta finances the publication of a million books a year translated from arabic into indonesian according to angel rabasa of the rand corporation then there is the institute for islamic and arabic studies or lipia a saudi funded university in jakarta which offers full scholarships to top students "lipia was designed to create cadres " says mr rahmat its graduates include jafar umar thalib the founder of laskar jihad a terrorist group responsible for the death of thousands of indonesian christians in the moluccas for his part mr rizieq tries to distance himself from that kind of violence although not by much "if i wanted to i could always bomb these places " he says "id rather have a physical confrontation " he adds that he is in contact with jemaah islamiyah responsible for the bali bombing but only in order to persuade it to change its ways why would he set his troops upon mere gamblers or prostitutes while conversing with murderers "when there is universal agreement among muslims on the immorality of adultery or fornication then we will act violently when there is no agreement on issues like terrorism then the approach is dialogue " its a curious form of tolerance conceived by a man who arrogates to himself the right to define what is and is not islamic is it a harbinger for indonesia that will depend on whether his country seeks to remain a part of asia or become a satellite of the middle east see related letter "letters to the editor the exportation of hate" wsj april
