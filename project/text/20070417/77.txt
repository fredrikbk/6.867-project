lenders ply aid officials at schools with free stuff lori crooks senior associate director of financial aid at duke university in durham n c says she and her family recently dined on two lobsters with fixings shipped from the boston restaurant legal sea foods the dinner worth at least &# was provided free by simpletuition an internet service that lenders pay for referrals of student borrowers "it was nice " says ms crooks who won the dinner at last summers national association of student financial aid administrators conference in seattle "it was tasty " such gifts from companies in the student loan business to financial aid officers have become commonplace and they range from dinners on up to much bigger handouts some lenders have provided officials stock on preferred terms hired them as consultants or paid their travel expenses handing out gifts at conferences is another way lenders curry favor with the aid officers many of whom are in a position to influence which loans students take things peak every year at the nasfaa national conference where banks and loan companies give away things from best buy gift certificates to video ipods and dvd players in recent months financial ties between student lenders and colleges have been a focus in a widening investigation by new york attorney general andrew cuomo the investigators say they are finding numerous indications that schools are steering students to lenders that pay the schools or financial aid officers directly leading mr cuomo to allege that the schools are putting their own gain ahead of getting the best loan terms for students mr cuomo is urging the industry to adopt a code of ethics in which gifts on anything more than "nominal" value would be banned including travel expenses the code isnt explicit about how much "nominal" is kevin walker chief executive and co founder of simpletuition says his company gave away the lobster dinners at the conference in seattle "because everybody does it " as for ms crooks the winner from duke mr walker said "ive never met this woman dukes not a customer we didnt get a meeting out of it " what simpletuition did get mr walker says was the financial aid officers business cards put into fish bowls to enter gift raffle drawings the company then adds the names to its contact list based in newton mass simpletuition enables students to compare loan terms from different companies and then click through to the lender of their choice the lenders then pay simpletuition for the referrals about two dozen colleges use simpletuitions "school channel" to link their students to lenders and simpletuition is looking to hook up with more colleges mr walker says two months ago dukes financial aid director james belvin jr joined simpletuitions advisory board a position that has no salary but includes expenses he was invited to join by a longtime friend who is already on the board according to simpletuition though duke has no business relationship with simpletuition a duke spokesman said mr belvin joined the board because he determined it would "a worthwhile thing to do " and the university has no problem with him serving as an adviser at the nasfaa meeting last year college administrators from across the country gathered around a bulletin board when the list of prize winners was posted "its pretty embarrassing when you see a financial aid official who won a drawing jumping up and down with glee " says charles bruce senior director of financial aid at oklahoma state university and a former nasfaa chairman who wants to see the handouts eliminated vesta smith campbell the director of financial aid at cleary university in michigan won a portable dvd player from comerica inc one of three lenders given preferred status by cleary at a meeting of the state nasfaa chapter ms smith campbell won a digital camera from another lender gifts are often handed out as "door prizes" at state meetings say aid officers who have attended them when asked what her schools policy is on taking gifts from lenders ms smith campbell said "generally we wont take those gifts from lenders " asked why it was appropriate to take lenders gifts at conferences she said "i dont know " ms smith campbell said the gift from comerica had no influence on university decisions about the lender and noted the school put the bank on its preferred list before she won the dvd player she also said she gave away the dvd player a spokesman for comerica wayne j mielke said if the company gave away anything at the conference it was "one or two items of nominal value we are thrifty in that respect " he says the bank uses gifts "to attract people to our booth to talk about business " hilda deleon student account supervisor at baylor college of medicine in houston won a leather coach briefcase at the nasfaa confab from the education resources institute or teri a nonprofit guarantor of private education loans a baylor college of medicine spokeswoman said that ms deleon "has no contact" with loan companies ms deleon said she believes teri and other lenders give away the freebies because they want college financial aid offices to display pens notebook notepads and other paraphernalia inscribed with company names on their front counters "so students will be familiar with the names " asked if baylor displays any of teris materials she said "im sure theres something out there a pen or a notepad with teris name on it " willis hulings iii chief executive of teri says it raffled off the briefcase valued at &# to &# not to cultivate a relationship with any particular college but to attract people to its booth at the conference because some people found giveaways to financial aid staff objectionable he said teri switched last october to handing out &# grants for student scholarships nasfaa says it has been discouraging lenders from handing out freebies by encouraging them to instead award scholarships to the schools of drawing winners at the seattle meeting a total of &# in scholarships were awarded the scholarship program was begun in the association says it doesnt keep track of the value of gifts handed out to college administrators at the time nasfaa created the scholarship program "we did not see a need to prohibit these giveaways because most were of little value " a spokeswoman said nasfaa says its current ethics statement does not limit gifts to college administrators but that "the board is is going to be reviewing the guidance in light of recent circumstances " among the vendors handing out gifts last year was student loan xpress a unit of cit group inc that has been at the center of mr cuomos investigation three top executives of student loan express have been on leave pending an internal inquiry cit declined comment on the giveaways
