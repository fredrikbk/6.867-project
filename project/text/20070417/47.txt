families wrestle with closing foundations wealthy families are setting up new philanthropic foundations in increasing numbers but they are also shutting them down at an accelerating pace some of the biggest names in philanthropy are backing the idea of setting a time limit on their giving the bill &amp melinda gates foundation announced in december it will spend its entire endowment more than &# billion within years of the death of the last of its three current trustees then close its doors other families too are putting an expiration date on their foundations because they believe they can do more good by spending a lot of money over a short period of time rather than doling out the funds over decades as some well known groups such as the rockefeller and ford foundations have long done some foundations are deciding to close after family members squabble over how to parcel out the cash often after the death of the founder other families worry about the corrosive effects of money on future generations even if it is held in a foundation another reason is cited by the jacobs family foundation in san diego concern that successive generations wont share the founders political beliefs philanthropists closed family foundations in the latest year for which figures are available up from according to the new york based foundation center which tracks philanthropy trends at the same time the number of foundations has soared to more than currently from about in according to the foundation center but families with foundations that are approaching the end of their lives and those who have recently shut them down say it can be an emotionally draining experience one concern is to avoid leaving in a lurch the charities that have long counted on their largesse another is to help foundation officials and staffers find new jobs in january trustees for the janirve foundation in florida reached an agreement with the state attorney general granting a three year extension to a deadline requiring the foundation to close while abandoning an effort to keep it open in perpetuity the foundations founder the late irving reuter had put his shutdown wishes in writing but trustees worried about the impact on the small charities that the foundation which focuses on causes in asheville n c has long supported the decision has stirred anxiety in asheville "its going to be very difficult to replace the funding from janirve " says lew kraus executive director of the asheville area habitat for humanity which received close to &# million from the foundation over the past years a commitment to build houses over the next few years will be affected he says "without janirve around its going to be a stretch " another concern is who will be around to turn out the lights when the late joseph jacobs and his wife violet years old who made their money in engineering set up the jacobs family foundation in they decided it would close within a generation so as not to outlive their children the foundation with current assets of about &# million funds job creation and community development projects "my father didnt want to create an institution that would lose touch with his conservative values " says daughter valerie hapke but mr jacobss wishes left his heirs in a bind his three daughters will be about years old when the foundation is expected to close sometime around and some family members worried they may be too old to engage in the arduous shutdown process "how do you go out of business when there is no one left " wonders foundation chairman norman hapke valeries husband the family resolved the dilemma by agreeing to let the jacobses grandchildren close up shop for philanthropists closing a foundation requires a dramatic change in mindset a switch from husbanding resources to suddenly giving them away to remain in business in perpetuity most foundations spend about of assets each year the minimum required by the irs to retain their tax exempt status to terminate a foundation all assets must be dispersed usually over a matter of months or years depending on the timetable the trick say foundation officials is to do it without making gifts that are too large for charities to spend wisely to cushion the blow to charities it supports the &# billion atlantic philanthropies which plans to stop making grants in years works closely with grantees and makes extra large gifts "we have known they were sunsetting for some time and there is such a long lead time that it doesnt feel jarring " says marc freedman chief executive of civic ventures a san francisco nonprofit group that has received roughly &# million in cash and pledges from atlantic since among other things civic ventures has used atlantic funds to launch programs aimed at encouraging older americans to get involved in civic activities still staff morale suffered at atlantic a campaigner for human rights and the aging founded by charles f feeney after it reorganized operations as part of the sunset plan say people at the foundation the new york based foundation has since stepped up its communication with staff including regular meetings career counseling and enhanced benefits for older employees who are likely to have a harder time finding new work when the foundation closes some foundations close only to reopen under a new mission the dibner fund in wilton conn closed in december after the sudden death of david dibner the son of founder bern dibner fueled disagreements among the younger family members including over which causes to support "there is a romantic notion of working together flawlessly with your siblings " says mark dibner a composer and musician and one of david dibners three sons "but that is not always the case " with input from outside mediators the dibner family divided the funds charitable assets among four new foundations one for each surviving member of the family and their descendants for the jacobs family the decision to shut the foundation has been both liberating and challenging drawing on their fathers entrepreneurial values and disdain for traditional philanthropy the family focused its resources on a high impact high risk experiment in urban renewal their plan to apply their roughly &# million toward acquiring and developing acres in a low income san diego neighborhood and then transfer ownership to local residents who would also receive job training the first phase of the project which launched five years ago is market creek plaza shopping center a brightly colored village of pueblo style restaurants and retail shops tucked beside a dry creek bed the center has been profitable since the foundation says next year the foundation plans to break ground on residential units also on the drawing board are a park a community center and additional commercial development the entire development is being managed and run by the foundation in partnership with residents some of whom work as volunteers and others who are paid late last year residents bought stakes in market creek plaza for a minimum of &# apiece joseph moore a year old who purchased a stake in the development says he was originally skeptical of the foundations plans but is now looking forward to the day when local residents assume responsibility for the project a father of three mr moore recently switched from doing odd jobs to become a financial planner a change he says was prompted in part by financial coaching he received in jacobs foundation workshops "theyre preparing us for the takeover and setting it up so we can sustain it " he says
