time warner to explore reducing cable stake inside time warner inc senior executives are considering what was once unthinkable whether the worlds biggest media company should substantially reduce its cable tv holdings over time cable has been a core part of the company and its precursors for decades and is now the biggest contributor to profits but the long term future of cable as the internet emerges as a viable venue for watching tv is murky some within time warner wonder whether the company wouldnt be better off if it were to get out of cable and double down on the web where it already owns aol by buying another major internet company just as news corp acquired myspace and google inc bought youtube to be sure a complete exit is the least likely course to be adopted people involved in the debate say more likely is that time warner will decide to gradually reduce its stake in time warner cable inc possibly through acquisitions while still maintaining a significant interest getting rid of a big chunk of its cable holdings would transform the nature of time warner making it more reliant on its role as a provider of filmed entertainment and print and web content for years time warner has believed in wedding its movies and television programs to powerful distribution networks primarily its cable operation as a way to ensure that their content wouldnt be blocked by rivals but with the internet increasingly serving as a home for tv and film offerings content companies may feel they no longer need to control old style distribution networks such as cable or satellite tv the issue will be put before the board at a meeting next month part of an annual strategic review say people familiar with the situation time warner management will present several alternatives for future ownership of time warner cable the no cable system operator in the u s based on subscribers the fact that time warner is even willing to think about a major reduction of its cable holdings is a sign of how much attitudes toward the cable industry are shifting despite cables recent streak on wall street and its success in attracting customers to its bundled offering of internet telephone and television service this is a business some analysts believe will become increasingly commoditized squeezing profit margins "both companies would trade better if they were separated " says richard greenfield an analyst with pali capital "i think its something theyre going to do " just this month shareholders in news corp voted to approve that media companys sale of its stake in directv group inc to liberty media corp news corp chairman rupert murdoch had spent years pursuing control of directv only to abandon it as directvs subscriber growth slowed markedly one argument in favor of getting out of cable is that it would free up resources for more investment in the web aol which has struggled to compete with other portals in recent years has shown promising signs of recovery recently after shifting from a subscriber based business model to one that relies on advertising but it remains a distant third behind market leader google in online advertising and some analysts question whether the company still heavily reliant on its old subscribers will attract young users in the long term some also believe time warner should exit cable because the dynamics of that business are fundamentally different from those of time warners content operations which include warner bros turner broadcasting and time inc most significantly cable requires substantial capital investment that the other businesses do not one of the downsides of getting out of cable though is that it would leave time warner much more dependent on slow growing content businesses of film television and print indeed exiting from cable would seem to increase the possibility that time warner would eventually dispose of its publishing operations where growth has nearly come to a halt so far time warner chief executive richard parsons has resisted calls that publishing be sold the discussion over cables future comes at an important juncture for time warner mr parsons a firm believer in both cable and what he sees as the competitive advantages it bestows on time warner is expected to step down next year its unclear however whether his likely successor time warner president jeff bewkes is as committed to maintaining the same level of ownership the debate is surfacing just weeks after time warner cable became a publicly traded company owned by outside investors in the course of its acquisition of the cable company adelphia communications inc time warner cant reduce its stake further immediately without being saddled with a big tax bill but beginning in the first quarter of next year some of the prohibitive tax penalties will expire making it easier for time warner to shrink its piece of the cable operator one way for time warner to reduce its cable holdings over time would be to use time warner cable stock for acquisitions thereby diluting time warners cable stake if it chooses to pursue that course which would entail time warner cable issuing new stock likely targets include other cable operators like cablevision systems corp a long island cable company that time warner has long coveted the dolan family that controls the company has so far refused to sell cox communications another family controlled cable operator is another company some analysts believe will be sold eventually most investors dont oppose time warner reducing its cable stake but some say management hasnt made a strong case for it "they should do whatever is most likely to build shareholder value " says henry berghoef a fund manager at harris associates one of time warners biggest shareholders "at this point i dont see any reason to advocate any course of action "
