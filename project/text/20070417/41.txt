econoblog can fixed minimum retail prices be a benefit for consumers online edition justices on the u s supreme court seemed divided when they heard arguments in late march on a case whose result could overturn a year old antitrust ruling known as "dr miles" for the manufacturer that sought to fix retail prices of its patent medicines the ruling was intended to promote competition by barring manufacturers from telling retailers the lowest prices at which they can sell products dr miles helped shape the th century marketplace giving rise to the "manufacturers suggested retail price " or msrp and circulars declaring that a retailers price was too low to advertise because manufacturers remained free to restrict retailers from advertising their products below a particular minimum the case before the court which pits leather goods maker leegin creative against a retailer has become a vehicle for free marketeers seeking to roll back the rigid rules that traditionally have marked antitrust law they argue that unless a particular activity almost always hurts competition strict rules should be discarded in favor of a case by case analysis of how the practice affects competition dr miles backers say the only certain result of letting manufacturers set minimum retail prices would be increased consumer costs and that any such changes should be made by congress not the court so would allowing manufacturers to set minimum retail prices hurt or help consumers wsj com asked f m "mike" scherer former chief economist at the federal trade commission and larry white a former director of economic policy at the u s department of justices antitrust division to discuss the economic core of the case passages have been edited for clarity what do you think share your comments on our discussion board f m scherer writes the central argument in leegin comes down to weighing the benefits to consumers against the disbenefits i should note that there have been many policy swerves since the dr miles decision many states passed laws during the s and s legalizing some forms of minimum price agreements in the midst of the great depression in congress passed the miller tydings act making minimum price restraints legal in interstate commerce when state laws allowed these laws were annulled by congress during the stagflation of the s my own view on all this is that in industries where minimum price agreements became widespread consumers suffered from higher prices and the inhibition of innovative retailing forms such as chain stores and discount houses on the other hand individual isolated applications such as leegins do little or no harm and probably contribute to the growth of innovative small businesses ideally a case by case rule of reason should apply the trouble is that rule of reason antitrust cases are very complex and costly a simple rescission of dr miles without putting anything in its place could do a lot of harm lawrence white writes yes its a benefit cost test but i see the pieces of this test differently first the political economic motives that underlie the state laws and miller tydings were cartel formation smaller retailers didnt like the competition that retailing innovations such as chain stores presented minimum price restraints were a way to inhibit that competition since they prevented the more efficient retailers from charging lower prices read more about it in this paper almost no one except maybe the "antitrust crazies" who want to repeal of all antitrust laws would defend the use of minimum price agreements to form cartels even if minimum price agreements were out and out legal the sherman act should still be used to prevent groups of retailers or manufacturers from horizontally fixing prices and from using minimum price agreements as a cover for their cartel behavior but what if manufacturers want to set minimum prices for retailers first lets consider why they would want to the manufacturer after deciding on its best wholesale price would tell retailers that they must sell at no lower than a price of "x" something thats not allowed under the current dr miles rules essentially the manufacturer would be specifying a minimum retailer margin but why would manufacturers want to do this isnt the manufacturer better off once it has figured out the best wholesale price letting its retailers compete on prices thus driving them lower at lower prices the manufacturer usually should sell more goods the answer as lester telser explained in is that a manufacturer may want retailers to provide tough to monitor but important point of sale services for example advice and demonstration of complex electronics the problem is that such services can be costly and susceptible to free riding in other words under the current rules "sam the catalog store" may tell customers to get their demonstrations down the block at "joes full service store" and then come back to sams to buy the product he can sell it for less because he doesnt provide any of the costly demonstrations but of course then joe cant stay in business the service isnt provided and the manufacturers sales suffer so if setting minimum prices isnt used to build cartels wheres the harm its the manufacturers judgment that this is the best way to sell the product shouldnt the manufacturers judgment be controlling isnt that what a market economy generally relies on to benefit consumers the danger of the broad per se prohibition on minimum price agreements such as the one currently in place is that it prevents manufacturers from developing business strategies that work best for them and for consumers do we want to prevent the leegins of the world from pursuing their best business strategies because we think that the dangers of the widespread setting of minimum prices for cartels are so great i vote for leegin and consumers f m scherer writes its not surprising that larry white and i are in agreement on many points in our brief to the supreme court william comanor and i made the same distinction between minimum retail price arrangements initiated by retailers and those initiated by a single manufacturer the former we argued seldom have redeeming merits and should continue to be treated as illegal per se but for manufacturer initiated price restraints the problem is more complex for one in manufacturing industries dominated by only a few sellers it is not uncommon for smaller sellers to follow the business policies of the leading firm if the leading firm implements a minimum retail price policy and the smaller rivals copy it most or all of the products in that category will be subjected to minimum retail prices such goods are commonly described as "fair traded " then consumers and especially consumers outside large metropolitan areas will be deprived of choices between high price high service merchandise and discounted merchandise so if dr miles is overturned without appropriate qualifications and fair trade strategies spread consumers would suffer the rule proposed by prof comanor and myself in the amicus brief would make it illegal only when the share of fair traded merchandise in a product category exceeds its a relatively easy rule to implement and it protects consumers from the worst abuses of minimum retail price policies it should be noted too that lester telsers argument which is often called the "free rider" theory is valid only in a subset of all cases notably for complex goods whose attributes are tough for consumers to judge without retailer help and which bear relatively high prices if i sashay into a hardware store and the clerk demonstrates to me the virtues of a fair traded wine bottle opener with the relatively low price of &# it is highly unlikely i will then travel to a discount store to save myself the higher margin lawrence white writes mike and i may agree at some level but we really do disagree as to presumption with which we approach the whole minimum price restraints area yes telsers argument is best expressed as i stated it as an information story but retailers services may vary in subtle ways about which neither mike nor i nor antitrust courts should be making judgments it really should be the manufacturers judgment that should trump all others unless there is evidence that a cartel effort is afoot again we should always be asking "whats in it for the manufacturer to be promising a higher margin for his retailers " as for retailer initiated minimum pricing yes if the retailers are forming a cartel throw them into jail but what if a single retailer comes to a manufacturer and says "i have a lot of expertise in retailing and consumers would really buy more of your goods if we retailers provided more point of sale service and to do that you ought to impose minimum prices " should that automatically be illegal as it is under the current application of dr miles even if theres no evidence of a cartel do we think that the likelihoods of cartels somehow lurking undetected in the background in such instances are so great also a market share test sounds simple but determining "the market" in such cases is can be problematic if a maker of circular power saws is imposing minimum pricing what is the relevant market circular power saws or anything that cuts wood unlike in antitrust analysis of mergers there are no good guidelines for market definition in cases involving minimum price restraints f m scherer writes larrys latest comment overstates the differences between us yes for individual manufacturers adopting minimum retail price policies i say the antitrust folks shouldnt intervene fair trade becomes problematic only when its widely adopted and consumers are deprived of low price choices on comparable merchandise so i wouldnt even ask for judgments until the threshold is passed if its not common for smaller manufacturers to follow their larger brethren no problem is posed it is only when there is extensive follower ship that a problem arises and that can happen even if not in the plurality of situations competition policy has always been about sorting out the serious problems from everyday strategies larry says our test would founder on the difficulty of defining markets i disagree the principles of market definition should be the same for minimum resale price fixing cases as for merger cases its not easy but its a lot easier than judging whether a particular business practice is reasonable or not that would be addressed only if a majority of the relevant market is covered by minimum resale price policies after which the price fixers would bear the burden of convincing a court that their policies are reasonable after all they know more about them than antitrust officials having tested most of the alternatives i have no problem with the circular saw example thats a relevant market the test is if the prices of circular saws were raised by say would you substitute a hand saw or an axe not i thank you on retailer initiated minimum pricing i wouldnt advocate bringing a case in which a single retailer convinced some manufacturers to adopt minimum retail prices for their vendors if the impact were small let it be but if most of the trade is affected or if several retailers join to induce "fair trading " as the drug industry did during the s and i say sue theres evidence that the drug retailers succeeded in getting states to enact fair trade laws they even drafted the statutes and that such laws in turn suppressed the growth of retail drug chains and discounting when the law was reversed by congress in the average retail pharmaceutical margin was now its nearer on the average branded drug purchase as of this means a price difference from &# to &# at recent pharmaceutical sales volumes that amounts to roughly &# billion difference per year lawrence white writes its all about the presumption mike worries about a world of "followership" where "consumers are deprived of low price choices on comparable merchandise " i see a world where manufacturers largely make their own choices and competition benefits consumers sometimes those benefits will come in the form of high price high service products that manufacturers deem to be their best strategies but even in the world that mike describes in his last post the appropriate legal standard for minimum price restraints would be a "rule of reason" approach not the "per se illegal" approach currently in place as for the problem of defining markets i agree with mike that the market definition approach usually used in merger analysis would work if a manufacturer hadnt yet put the minimum pricing in place for instance if a court was weighing an injunction to stop them from doing so but if the minimum price agreement is already in place then the usual tests for market definition wont work ive shown this in some of my research which touches on the famous "cellophane fallacy " involving a supreme court case which hinged on market definition finally yes the "fair trade" efforts of the s through the s were about retailers efforts to establish cartels they were a serious policy mistake thats not what any current efforts to change the current legal approach are legitimately about f m scherer writes on larrys first point we disagree for a reason common in economics differing perceptions of how the world works larrys is panglossian mine more hobbesian but i suspect that if we were confronted with actual cases rather than generalizations we wouldnt differ much on the correct rule i dont believe its an either or situation rather the approach comanor and i propose is multi step the first step is showing that minimum retail prices have been imposed in a majority share of some meaningful product category then and only then does the burden of proof shift to the price fixer to show that the restraints are reasonable i e good for consumers in the end this is hard and as justice holmes said a century ago "great cases like hard cases make bad law " a quantitative screen is useful in keeping the number of such hard cases down it also serves consumers well since as i have stressed its only when minimum retail price fixing in a category becomes widespread that consumers are seriously deprived of meaningful alternatives on defining markets yes an elevation of retail prices under minimum retail price fixing does bring the relevant product into tougher actual or potential competition with potential substitutes but the differences in retail margins here are unlikely to be nearly as large as the differences in price regimes for cellophane in a recent working paper on the web site of the american antitrust institute i have shown that judge leahys decision in the cellophane case was not palpably wrong newly developed plastic materials virtually obliterated cellophanes position in the market so even though higher priced at first they proved to be powerful substitutes the ravages of time do of course make market definition in antitrust cases harder thats the fate larry white and i have to endure as economists working sometimes in the messy world of antitrust lawrence white writes yes we are somewhat closer than i thought i could probably live with mikes version of a "structured rule of reason" legal analysis although i would prefer to keep the onus on the plaintiff to show that bad stuff is going on this is not where i thought that we were when i read mikes first post "a simple rescission of dr miles without putting anything in its place could do a lot of harm" which i thought meant that mike favored leaving dr miles in place as it is what do you think share your comments on our discussion board
