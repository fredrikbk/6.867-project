global economy europe competes for investment with lower corporate tax rates berlin europes major economies are competing with one another to cut corporate taxes as they fight to attract and keep investment fueling a trend that has taken europes corporate tax rates below those of other regions nominal tax rates on corporate income in the european union average compared with in the asian pacific region and nearly in the u s the latest moves by european governments suggest business taxes in the eu will fall further in coming years business groups have welcomed the overall decline in tax burdens predicting that lower tax rates will benefit companies and governments alike by promoting investment "this is a win win situation for everybody i think this is going to boost the economic upswing even further " said fred irwin head of the american chamber of commerce in germany which represents about u s companies doing business there still companies arent seeing their tax bills decline by as much as all the rate cutting might suggest despite their fears of losing investment and jobs to lower cost countries european governments have been recouping much of their tax cuts by reducing businesses tax exemptions and allowances germany for example will claw back much of a new tax cut by narrowing the scope for companies to deduct their borrowing costs from taxable profits in recent years many smaller european nations including ireland and the former soviet bloc nations of eastern europe have slashed corporate tax rates to as low as zero as part of their economic growth strategies and have succeeded in attracting investment from multinational corporations that success has put pressure on europes larger economies to cut their taxes until recently germany condemned the low tax competition from poland and others as "tax dumping " but after failing to win support within the eu germany has joined in chancellor angela merkels ruling coalition has agreed to cut the corporate tax rate to just under next year from others in western europe have reacted to the tax cut in germany europes largest economy in march britains finance chief gordon brown announced a reduction to from following complaints from british companies that britain was losing its status as one of europes low tax countries nicolas sarkozy a leading contender to become frances next president wants to cut the french corporate tax rate to less than from around albeit with some vaguely defined strings attached that is an unusual pledge at election time given that many french voters view global capital with suspicion "whoever wins the election they will be under pressure to follow what happens in germany and elsewhere " said philippe darvisenet head of economic research at french bank bnp paribas sa elsewhere in europe spain is reducing its tax rate on corporate profits to from in stages in britain at least businesses arent "popping the champagne corks " said richard lambert head of the confederation of british industry while lowering its overall rate britain also reduced tax allowances for the depreciation of industrial buildings some manufacturers could face more taxes under the new rules while other sectors including financial services companies could gain these winning sectors tend to be businesses that could move more easily to other locations because they have fewer physical assets in the united kingdom tax specialists said "brown has favored the sectors that could potentially move more activity outside the u k " said mark schofield international tax partner at pricewaterhousecoopers llp in germany the tax cut might not persuade u s companies that arent yet investing in germany to go there said mr irwin of the american chamber of commerce "but firms that are thinking about moving offshore are more likely to rethink and stay in germany " he said for most foreign investors in germany other factors carry more weight than taxes when it comes to making investment decisions businesspeople said germanys large and affluent market and its efficient infrastructure attract investors such as citigroup inc general electric co or ebay inc its high labor costs and strict labor laws keep others away still a more competitive tax rate will help the german units of multinationals to persuade their corporate headquarters to stick with the country mr irwin said adding "its no longer the highest tax country " the tax cutting trend has spawned an industry of academics who study whether the moves work "there is evidence that tax affects where firms locate their activities and where they locate their profits " said michael devereux professor of business taxation at oxford university who compiled a survey of the many studies done since the s corporate tax rates arent the primary reason for investment decisions he said but they do play a role along with other considerations such as access to important markets skilled workers and suppliers as well as labor costs and labor rules what is more prof devereux said there is little evidence that europes tax cuts are boosting the continent economically as a whole "largely this is capital floating around between european countries " he said "its a zero sum game overall " tax competition between europe and other major industrialized economies has remained muted the u s and japan have relatively high corporate tax rates at nearly even though as in much of europe companies tend to pay less than the nominal rate because of tax breaks some pro business voices in the u s wish the country would follow europe on the issue the cato institute in washington a free market think tank calls it "rather embarrassing" that france has a lower corporate tax rate than the u s but politically a european style tax cut is unlikely in the u s anytime soon the democratic majority in congress has other fiscal priorities more fundamentally the u s isnt feeling the same pressure as europes smaller countries
