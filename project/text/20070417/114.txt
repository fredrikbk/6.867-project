the art of showing pure incompetence at an unwanted task to learn something at the office can be difficult but to refrain from learning something requires years of practice and refinement its an office skill that steven crawley finds indispensable "the inability to grasp selective things can be very helpful in keeping your desk clear of unwanted clutter " says the executive in hr or what he calls "the dumping ground" of all unwanted office tasks "i have developed a very agile selective memory across a wide range of nonvalue added activities " the most memorable time he brandished his nonskill was when the president at an automotive parts manufacturer asked mr crawley to organize the company picnic with a sensibility more dry than bubbly he wasnt crazy about party planning so he began to milk his lack of picnic knowledge for all it wasnt worth he responded to any inquiries or suggestions with questions and comments such as "how do you do that " or "what did you guys do in the past " or even "help me remember why were talking about this " ultimately responsibility for the picnic was reassigned mission unaccomplished says mr crawley "youd be amazed at how much i dont know about picnics " strategic incompetence isnt about having a strategy that fails but a failure that succeeds it almost always works to deflect work one doesnt want to do without ever having to admit it for junior staffers its a way of attaining power through powerlessness for managers it can juice their status by pretending to be incapable of lowly tasks in all cases its a ritualistic charade the only thing the person claiming not to understand really doesnt understand that the victim ultimately stuck with the work sees through the false incompetence the tactic starts in early youth with chores "how do you open the dishwasher " its puppy eyed helplessness gets refined through homework with math word problems and book reports on "beowulf " in college it gets reinforced by enablers who take better notes in class and in marriage it works but not as well by raising the specter of disaster from a task mishandled "if i do the wash i might shrink your sweater" and "how do you change diapers so they dont leak " at work it can be institutionalized at customer call centers for example whose operators will transfer you to another department before the last department transfers you back to them and for shady corporations incompetence is the best legal defense strategy for any employee the soul stealing complexity of office machinery such as fax machines copiers pcs voicemail and even coffee makers gives everyone ample cover to studiously never learn how to use them but the same blank stare accompanies nonmechanical tasks too claire wexler an accountant who used to work at a law firm says lawyers "pretend to be completely flummoxed" by all of those machines as well as "everything related to accounting except for billing " their message "i have so many lofty matters on my mind i cant be bothered with mastering this small task " she says rescuing a pseudoincompetent from an office task can mean doing it for life failing to rescue risks the sting of being a nonteam player "theres nothing worse than doing too good a job on something that you dont want to keep doing " says carole kempler meagher she once worked with another manager of a different department who played up the fact that he "couldnt find his belly button with both hands a map and a flashlight " each month hed start complaining that he couldnt close his books their boss would beg her to help him "the following month we would go through the whole thing again " says ms meagher "sometimes being a team player means getting your own stuff done so that other people can get their own work done " laziness and status issues aside tom colbert president of a logistics provider observes that found incompetence sometimes comes from a genuine fear not of looking stupid but of proving it "theres no reason to demonstrate it " he says even someone for whom no task is too small such as mr colbert himself the fax machine and its labyrinthine menu of options are more trouble than theyre worth "its a jungle ill coerce someone else into performing the task by feigning ignorance or frustration " that person is mary powell she reports that mr colbert engages in a lot of shrugging sighing and throwing up of the hands "he usually can figure out most things without too much trouble " she says "this one particular thing he doesnt want to take the time to " strategic incompetence involves a lot of unnecessary posturing notes robert sutton a professor of management science at stanford university but its not all bad "one way in which lower status people feel more esteem in the presence of higher status people is to show they have a skill thats valued and needed " he says it can signify a mutual respect found in other hierarchies he adds "i think of apes grooming " email me at jared sandberg
