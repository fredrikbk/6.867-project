business technology intel to add extra functions to chips intel corp known for chips that act as calculating engines in computers plans to begin adding circuitry for other functions on the same piece of silicon the plan includes a new way to exploit specialized chips to accelerate computing performance intels announcement could take it into new markets and help counter a similar approach announced last year by rival advanced micro devices inc multifunction semiconductors sometimes called systems on a chip are already commonplace in cellphones and other small electronic gadgets but they are a new option for intel whose microprocessors have typically been too large and complex to share space with other types of circuitry on a standard sized chip that is changing because of improvements in manufacturing processes that shrink the size of transistors and other features of chips the next generation of production technology which intel expects to adopt in the second half of the year creates circuitry with dimensions of nanometers billionths of a meter or nearly a third narrower than the process intel now uses intel executives today are describing a series of benefits of the new process at a forum for technology developers in beijing among them are two multifunction chips that are scheduled to be manufactured in one chip code named tolapai is designed for use in devices such as industrial control systems and special purpose handheld computers used by businesses said bill kircos an intel spokesman it offers space savings of to over the four chips usually needed for similar applications and draws about less power the other system on a chip not yet named is designed for tv set top boxes media players and other consumer products that chip will include specialized circuitry for graphics audio and video processing mr kircos said though intel is initially aiming at new markets multifunction chips also will eventually be introduced for computers the companys primary focus mr kircos said the multifunction chips rely partly on quickassist intels name for a new technology to help its microprocessors communicate with special purpose circuitry that can either be on nearby chips or on the same piece of silicon the approach has similarities with torrenza amds effort to encourage other companies to make chips that work alongside its opteron microprocessor executives of the two companies say the special purpose circuitry can greatly speed up jobs such as encrypting information to protect it from eavesdroppers or analyzing communications traffic to guard against hacker attacks marty seyer an amd senior vice president noted that some accelerator chips offer fold performance improvements over its microprocessors for some tasks though intel is ahead of amd in shrinking the size of chip circuitry mr seyer argued that torrenza has a big head start over intels quickassist effort because of communications technology amd introduced with opteron in amd expects to begin adding specialized graphics circuitry to its own chips in through an effort called fusion the result of its purchase last year of ati technologies inc
