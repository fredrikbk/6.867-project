enterprise entrepreneurs with big dreams tap global market sourcing abroad gives tiny players an edge ms seye goes to india new delhi sonia seye spends her days braiding hair and turning multicolored hair extensions into intricate fashionable coifs but running a busy los angeles salon is just the start for this year old immigrant from senegal ms seye has dreams of a bigger more profitable future building franchises of her salon hair universal across california then supplying those salons with popular human hair extensions and to make that happen ms seye is looking abroad last november she went to india to find a supplier among the many companies that sell indian womens prized long fine locks the firms buy much of their hair from hindu temples where in a surrender of ego women shave their heads in offerings to the gods and then clean and prepare it for sale to the west "you dont have to be big to be global " says ms seye who has an indian hair piece sewn into her own hair small u s businesses are increasingly looking to other countries to boost their businesses through the import of cheaper or better products by tapping international markets directly small firms can cut the costs of a middleman and limit their dependence on the u s market for supplies an expanded product selection also could lead to bigger sales but challenges like different customs language and legal protections time zone differences and even the local weather can make that new business hard won "entrepreneurs and small businesses have a bigger opportunity and its easier for them to go global than large corporations" because they tend to be more flexible and have fewer legal and bureaucratic constraints that can hinder deal making says robert d hisrich director of the center for global entrepreneurship at the thunderbird school of global management a graduate school for international business in glendale ariz success importing products from abroad requires careful preparation it is important to research a countrys governing legal and monetary systems in addition to potential suppliers and their marketplaces political upheaval or an economic meltdown in a given country could potentially ruin a company you are doing business with cutting off your supply firms like dunn &amp bradstreet inc can provide country risk assessments and intelligence on many foreign companies the legwork should be followed with a visit to the country to get the lay of the land and meet a short list of possible suppliers along with government officials bank managers and anyone who might help dr hisrich says then have dinner with potential suppliers "its very important to break bread " he says "people are different over food " aspiring importers also can get free advice from the score association a nonprofit group that works closely with the small business administration and has centers nationwide where entrepreneurs can sit down with a counselor to talk about how to find foreign suppliers finance purchases and sell the products successfully at home among the questions score tells entrepreneurs to consider what products are you thinking of importing from whom are you going to source the products how do you know the source to ensure reliability what do you know about these products so that you can answer questions from your potential buyers and when it comes to funding companies that are having difficulty getting bank loans may be able to get help from the sba which provides banks and other lenders with certain guarantees against default on loans made to eligible small businesses before traveling to india ms seye who runs her business under the name art of braiding &amp extensions llc spent more than six months researching potential suppliers online the hour time difference made talking with them on the phone difficult so she peppered them with questions by email she also checked their credentials with the indian consulate with three potential suppliers in the running ms seye flew to chennai a busy city on the southern coast where most indian hair suppliers are based thanks to its proximity to the venkateshwara temple at tirupati one of the worlds richest shrines where more than pilgrims visit daily she met potential suppliers at their offices and inspected their products while widespread use of english in india meant language wasnt an obstacle ms seye says she was a little intimidated by the fact that she was young alone and looked different than everyone else "a black woman in the middle of south india by herself everywhere you go they are staring at you " ms seye eventually settled on one firm which impressed her with its stocks of blond red and other colors of hair and ordered an initial pound supply but monsoon downpours kept her freshly washed samples from drying she had to delay her departure two days and still only left with about pounds in hand it was all worth it however she says by buying direct from india instead of her los angeles supplier ms seye says she halved her extension costs even as she held firm on her already low retail prices which start at &# per ounce compared with &# at competing salons ms seye says revenue is up nearly to between &# and &# per month and her profits have doubled the entrepreneur got a boost in business by marketing to current clients and asking them to tell friends about the new extensions she also passed out fliers at nearby malls and even made some sales to a few local stylists ms seye says the trip to india is paid for more than twice over
