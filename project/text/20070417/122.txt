the spectrum game now that don imus has done his part for u s race relations and got people thinking about how the air waves are being utilized maybe this is a good time to weigh in on the fight over the federal communications commissions auction of spectrum licenses the auction which is expected to take place later this year involves selling off megahertz of electromagnetic spectrum thats become available as tv broadcasters transition from analog to digital signals these licenses are especially coveted by wireless carriers because the spectrum can more easily penetrate homes and office building interiors and cover loosely populated rural areas the spectrum also can support the new voice video and data offerings that require more bandwidth no wonder the industry refers to it as "beachfront property " allocating spectrum through auctions is certainly the most efficient way to get it into private hands the problem is that the fcc is being pressured to rig the process in the service of "public safety " first came a proposal from nextel founder morgan obrien who wants congress and the fcc to carve out megahertz of the available spectrum remove it from the auction block and turn it over to his company cyren call mr obrien says cyren call deserves this treatment because it will use the spectrum to help public safety agencies police and fire departments and other first responders communicate with each other during emergencies as a for profit venture however cyren call would also lease the spectrum to commercial wireless carriers in other words mr obrien is trying to get the government to subsidize his new cellphone company we dont blame him for trying but if mr obrien thinks the u s needs another wireless carrier then he should bid for the spectrum at auction with everyone else a second proposal comes from former fcc chief reed hundt whose company frontline wireless is also trying to game the proceedings in the name of public safety unlike mr obrien mr hundt wants to participate in the auction but he also wants to encumber a portion of the spectrum with obligations that will drive down its value and make it less attractive to larger would be bidders like verizon at&amp t and the cable companies mr hundt would have the winning bidder create a national broadband network for first responders operate as a wholesale only carrier and observe the rules of net neutrality that explains why consumers union the consumer federation of america and other self styled consumer advocates who frown on telecom property rights are swooning over his proposal like mr hundt they know such conditions might scare off auction competition and increase the chances of frontline grabbing the licenses for a song and mr hundt knows that backing from these liberal outfits which have pull with the new democratic congress can only help his efforts to pressure regulators its true that state and local public safety officials who often use communications systems that arent linked can have difficulty talking to one another the problem is exacerbated during large scale emergencies like hurricane katrina and but last year congress set aside megahertz of spectrum expressly for emergency services lawmakers dedicated &# billion in grants to help first responders build an interoperable communications network which is to say that the cyren call and frontline rationales notwithstanding police and fire departments already have all the spectrum they need if public safety is really the major concern of messrs obrien and hundt they should want an unfettered auction to proceed as soon as possible because congress has mandated that part of the proceeds finance those first responder grants mr obrien is trying to turn regulatory arbitrage into a marketplace success mr hundt who ran the fcc during the clinton administration wants the agency to revert to the bad old days of command and control rule making that he oversaw but neither course would be in the interest of taxpayers and consumers who would benefit most from an auction that simply put the spectrum in the hands of the highest bidder with no strings attached see related letter "letters to the editor lets follow swedens spectrum allocation plan" wsj april see related letter "letters to the editor nationwide broadband network to save lives" wsj april
