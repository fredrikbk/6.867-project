a man of principle who must feel lonely in regard to your april editorial "mccains finest hour" "if you try to please everybody somebodys not going to like it" donald rumsfeld while john mccain may have disagreed with mr rumsfelds approach to troops levels he surely would agree that calculating ones views to achieve optimum popularity at the expense of personal conviction is an abdication of a responsibility and a recipe for eventual public backlash the senator like the former secretary of defense has placed policy firmly ahead of politics and while other candidates continue trying to please everybody sen mccain may ultimately be rewarded if the changing calculus in iraq breeds results before its too late screaming for us to leave iraq may help in the polls today but eventually somebodys not going to like it william cooper san francisco ive finally found a candidate i can support with my vote and my pocketbook with just one comment "id rather lose a campaign than lose a war" he has soared beyond all other candidates of either party on principle alone he now has undeniable credibility and integrity he stands alone except maybe for joe lieberman now if the conservative republicans will just nominate mr mccain for president and convince mr lieberman to be his vice president they will have provided america with the most distinct choice of presidential candidates in many years ken feneley clare mich sen mccain understands the importance of victory over fascists and terrorists in iraq regardless of our differences on any other issue i can trust his steadfast leadership at this defining point of our nations history another national leader with whom i often disagree who recognizes that all else matters naught unless we are willing to defend civilization is joe lieberman these two men neither of which i would necessarily support under different circumstances are churchillian leaders for our times i say "draft mccain lieberman " t j ford goleta calif
