apres chirac paris french publishers will tell you theyve never sold so many books on politics unlike in past campaign seasons tomes about or by the main presidential contenders have consistently shot up the best seller lists this year the political publishing world in france has also seen the birth of what could be called the turncoat genre two of the fastest moving titles in the days before sundays first round of the presidential election are penned by disillusioned advisers who desperately want the french to vote against the candidate they once worked with eric besson a parliamentarian who was formerly spokesman for socialist candidate segolene royal grew tired of her never ending blunders and ignorance of major issues and wrote "qui connait madame royal " who knows ms royal to argue why shes not fit to be president azouz begag the only minister of north african origin in the departing government has published "un mouton dans la baignoire" a sheep in the bathtub a scathing account of his years as a colleague of nicolas sarkozy the conservative presidential hopeful who was interior minister in the same cabinet until stepping down earlier this month both books bring juicy insider gossip along with some disturbing hard evidence to support their cases that ms royal is a major league incompetent and mr sarkozy a populist demagogue prone to fits of uncontrolled temper mr besson resigned from the socialist party and wont say for whom hell vote mr begag openly campaigns for francois bayrou the man who came out of centrist nowhere to become the dark horse in the race turncoat literature is a sign of the times and the perfect offspring of a campaign of missed opportunities as both the besson and begag books show the candidates have steered clear of significant issues and devoted their energies to trying to convince voters that the other ones arent fit to rule the result may well be that they have all succeeded never before have voters been so disappointed by the field of candidates whether they will vote for bayrou royal or sarkozy most of them will do so in spite of their chosen ones obvious shortcomings certainly not for their proposals and ideas about governing which anyone would be at a loss to remember it would be hard to find one serious issue where the candidates have engaged each other on substance debated about the future of their troubled country talked about their respective and different or not ideas on frances most pressing problems the three main contenders have mostly criticized the other guys statements as soon as they have been uttered however insignificant they may have been on the dismal state of the education system persistently lagging economic growth massive youth unemployment and rocketing public debt all of which were theoretically and rightly identified as the most urgent problems nothing has been said that would help identify clear differences in approach among right left or center lets not even dream of a proposal that could be seriously taken as the beginning of a cure on the other hand none of the candidates has shied away from grandiose statements about things a president can do little about theyve criticized jean claude trichet and the european central bank which doesnt cost them much support theyve asked for "reforms" in the way the european union is governed which is nice and fine but mostly passes the hot potato on to other european governments any discussion of the economy and its growth problems have been for the most part absent maybe thats only normal since most voters would distrust candidates on the subject anyway mr sarkozy promises vague free market reforms but everyone knows by now that hes an interventionist at heart ms royal doesnt seem to have any opinion on economic matters which is a relief to those who fear what they might have been had she decided to have any mr bayrou spends his time explaining he should be president just because the others should not and has not said anything on the economy beyond self evident pronouncements uttered in a self important manner of the growth good debt not good type the paradox is that never before has a campaign attracted so much interest voter registration is at an all time high voter turnout if pollsters are to be believed could set a record too politics is the major topic at family dinner tables in bars offices and factories in big cities and in countryside villages at the same time and because of this campaign that never was the number of undecided voters is also unprecedented upward of of the electorate with five days to go according to some polls part of the interest comes from the fact that all three major candidates are relatively fresh faces in politics these fiftysomethings promise a generational change after decades when the same old faces clung on to power jacques chirac who first became prime minister when nixon sat in the white house and held the presidency for the past years may well be remembered in the same way russians remembered the never ending and gray years when leonid brezhnev ruled the u s s r the stagnation period but if mr chirac is the president that did nothing each of the candidates for his succession promises to be a president who wont do much mr briancon is paris correspondent for breakingviews com
