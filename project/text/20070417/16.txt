benefits of a canine running mate hearing the shriek of a fierce wind outside i tried sleeping late the other morning but my pound labrador came beside the bed and bumped her cold nose against my ankle in her view an april snowstorm is no excuse for canceling our predawn run so moments later we were jogging down the dark shoreline assaulted by pellets of ice watching the sky brighten over lake michigan it was exhilarating after decades of jogging with friends colleagues and loved ones ive come to see that the ideal running mate is a dog she is not competitive your fastest speed is nothing next to hers so you will never run too fast for her but neither will she whine about let alone ridicule your slowness the only time she will complain is when you dont run at all and that type of push is what personal trainers charge money for there is growing appreciation of the value of having a workout companion reflected in the popularity of web sites such as exercisefriends com which matches partners in athletics running doesnt require a partner but "the loneliness of the long distance runner" is more than just a great book over the course of hours on the running path solitude starts to feel like isolation unlike humans of course dogs cant talk but any runner who has had a long winded partner knows that silence isnt the worst quality and unlike humans dogs dont show up late cancel or argue about which course to take a canine jogging companion can confer health benefits beyond the lift to your workout regimen a body of scientific evidence shows that pet ownership can protect health a pet can decrease blood pressure reduce cholesterol and improve mood among other benefits says the web site of the federal centers for disease control and prevention yet these benefits accrue only if owner and pet manage to make it work the most popular pet in america dogs are also the most problematic in large part because a growing number of them live in houses or tightly confined yards of the nearly million american homes with dogs a large percentage represent the second or third owners for those canines pet advocates say owners often get frustrated by out of control chewing barking biting whining or accidents on the rug demand for help is so great that an entire industry replete with antidepressants canine psychologists and shock collars is developing around canine control but often the answer is as simple as exercise in fact canine expert cesar millan star of the television show "dog whisperer " ranks exercise first ahead of discipline and affection as the key to a well behaved dog there are even treadmills for dogs to get them exercise a border collie mix named flynn exhausted the patience of the first two families that adopted him from then returned him to a chicago shelter then a marathoner whose running partner had moved away visited the shelter seeking a four legged replacement the marathoner david hill found that several fast paced miles a day relieved flynns anxiety and hyperactivity "the running totally calms him down " says mr hill who now is a professional dog runner giving others pets a workout the sheer pleasure that dogs take in running can remind performance obsessed humans whats really important after an ankle injury sidelined a competitive boston runner named jill hourihan depleting her conditioning she was reluctant to start training again enter alex her run happy dog "hed stand at the door with the leash in his mouth and that would get me going " she says security is another benefit a head in the clouds runner i can count on my dog to see hear and smell every creature nearby including an array of chicago wildlife from squirrels to the occasional coyote dogs especially large breeds can run farther than humans but like humans they must build distance gradually small dogs can run farther and faster than most owners might think but dogs of any size shouldnt be run seriously especially on pavement until they are nearly full grown some veterinarians say english bulldogs may be one breed not built for running cold is rarely a problem but heat stroke can kill dogs so run at dawn dusk or night during summer when a normally energetic dog seems sluggish dont push him he may be sick or overheated email healthjournal wsj com
