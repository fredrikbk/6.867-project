beijing olympics the peoples republic of bang qiu baseball hopes china games will keep sport in olympics help it expand world wide peoria ariz fresh off a warm day spent on perfect green fields under cloudless skies several twenty something baseball players amble toward a state of the art spring training complex here they are dressed in long shorts and untied reeboks one wears a t shirt that reads "feelin single seein double " just another day in americas pastime but these players are chinese and while none stands within a country mile of the majors they mean the world to major league baseball like every other sport on the planet baseball wants to become the next big thing for chinas booming middle class thats why mlb not only paid for the chinese national team to train in arizona this spring but for its players to practice with nine major league teams low level minor leaguers for baseball executives though its the late innings and theyre trailing they view china as the key to its hopes of reviving the sports flagging olympic prospects and indirectly its ability to expand globally the international olympic committee voted in to give the game the boot just years after baseballs olympic debut citing the sports doping scandals as well as its reluctance to send its top players to the competition in the middle of its season next years olympics in beijing will be baseballs olympic swan song unless someone comes to its rescue without the olympics baseballs chances of growing internationally would be hurt cash strapped national sports ministries tend to fund only those games that reach the quadrennial sports jamboree expansion is a critical issue for baseball while popular in north america japan south korea taiwan and pockets of latin america and the caribbean baseball remains on the fringe in much of the rest of the world including china china is "enormously valuable" in the effort to save olympic baseball says tim brosnan mlbs executive vice president for business "everyone expects the beijing games to be over the top that will only enhance the chineses standing on the olympic stage " while its too late for the ioc to reinstate baseball in time for the games in london baseball hopes it has a chance for a decision wont come until baseballs strategy is to spend the next two years trying to make china fall in love with it that could make an impact on ioc delegates visiting next years games so mlb is pulling out all the stops beyond the chinese teams stint in arizona this spring baseball is helping put together a summer tour with a u s team made up of college players the league opened an office in beijing in january and the new york yankees made a well publicized trip to china in recent months to help spread baseballs gospel the league plans to open sports stores around china by the summer with another possibly following by years end its also considering opening an academy to teach the game there and executives regularly put chinese cities on their asian itineraries now commissioner bud selig has even hinted at starting the regular season in beijing whats more the league got former big league player and manager jim lefebvre to run the chinese national team bringing in former standout pitcher bruce hurst as pitching coach initially a one off project helping train the team for an olympic qualifying tournament in it turned into an ongoing gig for the pair mr lefebvre who also consults with the san diego padres talks a mile a minute about the progress he has seen he beams while discussing catcher wang wei who made history as the first player to hit a home run in last years inaugural world baseball classic baseballs take on soccers world cup mr lefebvre saw his team come far enough to send players in small groups to camps like the padres here so they could learn from minor leaguers from other countries but he knows better than to make any medal predictions though competitive in some international games chinas lack of depth buries it in others the team almost certainly wouldnt have made the olympic baseball tournament without the automatic qualification that comes with being the games host mr lefebvre says a baseball counterpart to basketball star yao ming may not surface for to years the numbers for bang qiu literally "stick ball" in china look microscopic compared with rival sports the national basketball association happily touts the million chinese who now play its game ping pong snooker and gymnastics are also vastly more popular than baseball in china paul archey major league baseballs senior vice president for international business estimates only chinese play baseball at any level an infinitesimal fraction of its population of billion by contrast million americans play more than of the population according to the sporting goods manufacturers association only between and true baseball diamonds exist in all of china according to the chinese baseball association though plenty play the game on makeshift grass fields while new fields are being built for the olympics theyll be razed after the games to make way for a mall commercially baseball lags far behind basketball the most heartily embraced u s sport in china as well the nba has corporate sponsorship partners there and airs games on television networks including a regular spot on cctv the countrys national network "we are just like infants who havent been mature yet " says shen wei general secretary with the chinese baseball association in beijing interest in baseball is so thin in china that cctv last year pre empted coverage of the six team chinese baseball leagues championship for soccers world cup even if it can spark a chinese baseball boom the sport still has to persuade the ioc to let it back into the games harvey schiller president of the international baseball federation who met with ioc president jacques rogge march thinks thats still possible the world baseball classic tested its players for drugs and he hopes to find middle ground on getting stars to play in the olympics if the ioc will allow for a shorter baseball tournament but mlb insiders question how flexible the game will be about allowing its all stars to play these games late in the season as pennant races are heating up an ioc spokeswoman declined to speculate on baseballs future in the meantime the national team players in arizona continue to suffer american chinese food and otherwise take in the culture they have already been treated to luxury box seats at two arizona diamondbacks games courtesy of their benefactors in new york "that was great " says li lei a year old outfielder "we got soda pop and hot dogs " tang hanting contributed to this article
