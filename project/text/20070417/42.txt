economists react economists debate inflation problem online edition the consumer price index rose in march on higher energy prices the labor department said up from februarys rise but the core cpi which excludes volatile food and energy prices advanced just half the previous months increase amid a sharp drop in apparel prices and soft gains in housing and medical costs unrounded the cpi rose last month the core cpi advanced unrounded economists weigh in on what the numbers mean for interest rates and whether the drop in the core is sustainable there is no genuine inflation problem as we have argued on numerous occasions we have been witnessing a reasonably sharp cycle in shelter costs particularly owners equivalent rents an estimate of how much homeowners would charge to rent their residence which account for a huge of core cpi when oer inflation was low in as residential house prices boomed core cpi was flattened when oer accelerated through even as residential house prices flattened out all of a sudden a core inflation problem emerged if this economy has an inflation problem it is only coming from one source rents i e the imputed cost of housing and with falls in residential house prices accelerating across much of the country the alleged inflation problem looks more and more a statistical artifact rather than a genuine phenomenon richard iley bnp paribas excluding the gain in oer the core cpi was flat suggesting a flat reading or possibly a gain for the feds preferred inflation reading the core pce deflator gains in oer appear to have peaked in november of last year and todays data suggests a deceleration from housing related effects is underway the core cpi itself appears to be decelerating bucking a seasonal bias upwards in march and is up over the past year todays core inflation news is comforting however gains of just are unlikely to repeat every month particularly when excluding the oer measure which could moderate quickly steven wieting citigroup global markets the bulk of the surprise came in categories which tend to exhibit a lot of seasonal volatility which means that the odds favor a snapback in the core in april it seems that the month to month volatility in the core figures has ticked up a bit which means that it does not necessarily make sense to get overly happy about low individual readings the surprise in the core index relative to our forecast was driven mainly by a stunning drop in hotel rates march is the month when hotel rates seasonally jump from off season to peak season prices stephen stanley rbs greenwich capital the core was held down by a drop in apparel prices reversing the increases of the past three months a surprise drop in lodging costs and a rise in medical costs after unexpectedly big gains totaling in the previous two months none of these are sustainable and the trend rate of increase is the core cpi is still around per month but the data will nonetheless be comforting to those disturbed by the slightly bigger jan feb gains overall good news ian shepherdson high frequency economics there were three key drivers of the much lower than anticipated core cpi first hotel rates posted a sharp decline this is totally inconsistent with the survey data that we look at and is likely reflective of a seasonal distortion that will be reversed next month second the apparel category fell this appeared to reflect an unwind of some unusual elevation in prior months third prescription drug prices fell this represented the fifth outright decline in the past six months so we expect some but not all of the downside surprise seen in the march core cpi to be reversed next month morgan stanley research encouragingly the "core" index rose just actually as foretold by the ppi medical cost index rose just a reversion toward mean that seems likely to continue after the unusually larger increases of the two prior months other probably transitory factors also held down the core rate the cost of "lodging away from home " which is among the most volatile components fell in march that may be a reflection of the price discounting by western ski resorts hampered by sub normal seasonal snow cover near the end of the season nomura economics research after two elevated monthly readings the subdued march core cpi number reveals a short term inflation path that is consistent with the decline so eagerly anticipated by the fed similar improvement during the second quarter will be required before the fed can take the rate hike option of the table however kenneth beauchemin global insight the moderation in core cpi in march is the first good piece of inflation news we have seen recently although with such rapid increases in headline cpi we doubt that the fed will take much comfort from this one reading nonetheless it seems likely that year over year core pce inflation will also tick down in march bear stearns economics todays report helps to cement what we see as trend core inflation of per month at the moment which is still on the high side as far as the fed is concerned + cumulatively in the latest three months is a annualized running rate which is still above the top end of the feds comfort zone even allowing for the fact that the core cpi is a bit higher than the preferred core consumption price index therefore barring an economic meltdown or financial market contagion we do not think that the fed funds target will be lowered this year joshua shapiro mfr inc core consumer inflation has been retreating irregularly for the past six months this corresponds to the sharply slower growth over the final three quarters of last year however the current pace of core consumer inflation is still running above the fomc comfort zone of to despite worries about the upside risks associated with inflation and sluggish economic activity we think the fomc will be sidelined for most if not all of this year steven a wood insight economics compiled by
