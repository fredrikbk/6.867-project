lobbyist for help arranging meetings with top republicans mr boyko currently ukraines minister of energy was the architect of gas deals between russia and ukraine now being investigated by the u s justice department for possible ties to the alleged mafia client of mr sessions mr boyko said the &# in fees was paid by a small political party he heads annex holdings the caribbean firm that paid mr boykos lobbyist also had a stake in the gas deals corporate records show at times even clients names are camouflaged by lobbyists despite federal laws making clear that they arent allowed to disguise identities by taking fees from intermediaries without such rules says prominent washington ethics lawyer jan baran "you would just have a bunch of shell organizations identified as clients of lobbyists and lobbying firms " in for instance a united kingdom shell company called foruper ltd which had no assets or employees paid barbour griffith &# foruper was established by an attorney who
