sparked a hot streak that included capturing business from bmws mini sun microsystems and priceline com butler developed a converse tv campaign that used short films from people the agency contacted through film schools web sites and design shops but when the agency and client couldnt come to terms over compensation and creative direction the agency decided that meeting converses terms wasnt worth it mr stern adds even though it wanted to keep the account he says converse had "changing needs" and was interested in using agencies for project work rather than tapping a single agency of record "to the extent that they were moving to a project basis it would not cover the cost of time of our staff " says mr stern nike rarely farms out its work anyway it has a long and deep history with independent wieden + kennedy which is based in portland ore converse executives werent available for comment given a tough new business climate walking away from a client might seem counterintuitive but some agencies are choosing to do just that rather than sink more resources into accounts where it isnt clear that either financial success or creative harmony is guaranteed agency executives complain that their clients facing heightened pressure to deliver concrete financial results are more prone than ever to change the direction of a campaign press for a better financial relationship with an agency or even cast about for ideas from rival firms these days agencies also have to focus on their own bottom lines and consider whether an account is worth winning in a volatile business climate when deciding whether to take on a client agencies now must gauge "the amount of risk that is involved with taking on a piece of business that ultimately may get shifted or put into review if the chief marketing officer doesnt reach their objectives in a short amount of time " says john houston partner and director of business development at mdc partners kirshenbaum bond

direction of its campaign for miller lite moving to an effort focused more on the product crispin had developed a concept called "man laws " in which a group of men including actor burt reynolds came up with interesting rules for men who drink beer "we said that we were taking a hard right turn back to focusing on our product and when that happens sometimes back seat drivers fall out " says peter marino a miller brewing spokesman but crispin had to contend with multiple shifts in direction from miller and could see that the partnership wasnt going to work over time "you have a limited amount of resources and you want to direct them where you are going to be successful " says alex bogusky chief creative officer of crispin one factor that weighs on ad agencies is whether or not it is worthwhile to repitch for an account that has gone up for grabs account reviews can cost anywhere from &# to &# million ad executives say and many wonder why they ought to sink that kind of money into a relationship that has already begun to show signs of wear wal mart stores held a second review late last year for its business after opting not to use interpublic groups draftfcb following an imbroglio involving two wal mart marketing executives who had been involved in the review process omnicom groups gsd&amp m had long served as wal marts agency and had taken part in the first review for the business but the cost of mounting another pitch wasnt worth the agencys time says roy spence gsd&amp ms president "we needed to move on and them too " says mr spence when careerbuilder com decided to put its ad account up for review earlier this year after chicagos cramer krasselt developed its popular super bowl ads the agencys chief executive was stunned and opted to walk away peter krivkovich the ceo says he felt it wasnt in his firms interest to pitch when the client wasnt acting in a "businesslike" manner careerbuilder com says this years work from cramer krasselt "did not carry the same breakthrough impact as previous years after evaluating many different metrics internally and externally we recognized the need to bring new ideas and opportunities to our brand " all this back and forth is just another sign that the chummy advertising partnerships of yore are giving way to a more impersonal market driven environment there is "relentless pressure on agencies and chief marketing officers to drive revenue its killing our business it destabilizes the relationship between agencies and clients " says matt weiss an executive vice president and chief growth officer at interpublics mccann worldgroup ad notes kraft foods tapped interpublic groups draftfcb to handle ad duties for its lunchables brand taking over an account previously handled by wpp groups jwt kraft
