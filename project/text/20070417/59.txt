global economy overtures to brazil show differing ethanol interests japan rushes to secure supply deals but u s moves little beyond talk sao paulo brazil last month president bush flew to this sprawling city to sign a largely symbolic agreement with brazil to promote the production and use of ethanol the same night a group of japanese executives flew home from here with the framework for a major ethanol deal in hand the events that day highlight the different approaches industrialized countries like the u s and japan are taking to the renewable fuel at a time of increasing concern about the future of oil supplies because the u s produces its own corn based ethanol it keeps a stiff tariff in place on imports of less expensive brazilian ethanol which is made from sugar cane that is a major reason that u s talk of a partnership with brazil on ethanol has yet to produce concrete results but japan has no domestic ethanol market to protect and is looking to brazil as its major source of the alternative fuel the upshot japan could lock up a sizable chunk of future ethanol supplies from brazil the worlds cheapest producer of the fuel to pull that off japanese companies are forging an alliance with an unusual partner brazilian state oil company petroleo brasileiro sa the company known as petrobras and japanese trader mitsui &amp co are in advanced negotiations about how to supply japan with as many as million gallons of ethanol annually within four years according to petrobras kyoto treatythat is nearly as much as all the ethanol brazil exported in japan sees the fuel as an option to help it meet its obligations under the kyoto global warming treaty and as a hedge against oil supplies from the politically volatile middle east mitsui chief executive shoei utsuda says a deal with japan would likely turn petrobras into brazils top ethanol exporter and make it the first oil giant to make a major move into biofuels in recent weeks petrobras executives have announced they hope to begin building the worlds first ethanol only pipeline for &# million and have firmed up plans to buy into scores of sugar cane mills but japan and brazil face a chicken and egg problem petrobras says spending huge amounts on ethanol infrastructure and production is worthwhile only if japan will end up buying the fuel while japan seeks guarantees before committing to a deal that would leave it vulnerable to supply disruptions a long term supply contract depends on the japanese government which is debating how much ethanol to mix in auto fuel mr utsuda says japan has an optional mix but could eventually mandate a higher percentage japan also is considering using ethanol instead of natural gas to fuel power plants fragmented industryjapans big worry has been supply brazil and the u s produce and consume most of the worlds ethanol meaning it isnt yet an easily traded commodity japan worries whether brazils fragmented sugar cane industry could guarantee supplies brazil has more than sugar cane mills most of which produce both sugar and ethanol in the past when sugar prices were high ethanol production slumped provoking fuel shortages addressing japanese concerns is the reason for petrobrass aggressive entry into ethanol production says paulo roberto costa the petrobras executive who oversees all refining and distribution "the japanese have made very clear that once we start supplying ethanol there needs to be a continuous supply " he says the plans are an about face for an oil producer that until recently said it had no interest in ethanol production although petrobras already distributes ethanol at fueling stations the company produced no ethanol last year and exported only about million gallons indeed some question its ability to be a reliable supplier in a new sector such as agriculture if the company ends up supplying japan the deal would account for as much as of brazils projected export capacity by last year the u s was brazils biggest export market for ethanol but with production of corn based ethanol in the u s ramping up some experts think u s imports could fall steeply in brazil still hopes the u s will drop an ethanol tariff of more than cents a gallon while mr bushs offer to brazil of a "strategic partnership" in ethanol wasnt followed by concrete proposals mr costa says petrobras has had contact with officials in california and with former florida gov jeb bush during a visit to brazil yesterday mr bush the presidents brother and co chairman of the interamerican ethanol commission again called for the u s to eliminate the tariff telling a group of sugar cane ethanol producers in sao paulo that the tax made "no sense" and was impeding the biofuels market the idea that half of brazils exported ethanol could end up in japan isnt surprising says marcos jank president of the brazilian institute for international trade negotiations a think tank here japan is "the only country introducing a consumption program without having any domestic production " mr jank says brazil doesnt lack suitors for its fuel mr costa said petrobras is also in discussions with buyers in china and south korea and other japanese trading companies have been trying to lock up ethanol contracts in march mitsubishi corp signed a year contract with sao martinho sa one of brazils two publicly traded ethanol makers for industrial alcohol used in beverages perfumes and other products brazil is rapidly expanding sugar cane cultivation to meet demand at home and overseas and expects to double ethanol production by but new plantations take three years to reach productive levels and brazil uses of its ethanol that means fuel supplies could be tight if plans for new mills and production stall and that could happen if countries like japan and the u s dont give clear signals demand will rise experts said "we cant build the ethanol pipeline and sign contracts with the mills if we wont be able to sell the product " mr costa says "wed be burying money " mari iwata in tokyo contributed to this article
