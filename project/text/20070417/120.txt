the morning brief shocked u s asks how it could happen again online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here nearly eight years to the day after the shootings at columbine high school the u s is struggling to comprehend yet another act of incomprehensible campus violence even as other parts of the world try to fathom what makes the u s among industrial democracies so uniquely vulnerable to such atrocities authorities still havent publicly identified the young man who shot dead people at virginia tech yesterday before ending his own life or even confirmed if he was acting alone while speculation about a possible motive has been even cloudier university police chief wendell flinchum told an evening news conference his officers had interviewed a "person of interest" in the first of the two shooting sprees at a dorm but he declined to give details as the associated press reports "im not saying there is someone out there and im not saying there is someone who is not " he said as quoted by the bbc ballistics tests he added will help explain what happened federal law enforcement officials tell the washington post the dead shooter carried a mm semiautomatic and caliber handgun the serial number obliterated on each police said they hadnt determined whether there was a link between the shootings and recent bomb threats on campus erin sheehan one of four people to walk away from her a m german class recounts her experience to the campus newspaper the collegiate times "it seemed so strange " ms sheehan said "because he peeked in twice earlier in the lesson like he was looking for someone somebody before he started shooting but then we all heard something like drilling in the walls and someone thought they sounded like bullets thats when we blockaded the door to stop anyone from coming in " the shooter she said "was just a normal looking kid asian but he had on a boy scout type outfit he wore a tan button up vest and this black vest maybe it was for ammo or something " the scale of the massacre the shock and sadness president bush described on behalf of americans and the sense of violation and vulnerability brought by any school shooting were enough to blot out all other issues of public discourse including a war in iraq that brings such civilian death tolls on a daily basis "schools should be places of safety and sanctuary and learning " mr bush said "when that sanctuary is violated the impact is felt in every american classroom and every american community " new york times television critic alessandra stanley notes that "the amazing thing is how familiar campus shootings have become for viewers initial disbelief is quickly folded into a methodical ritual of breaking bad news news trucks race to the scene witnesses upload images recorded on cell phones and video cameras students on the scene calmly and patiently recount their impressions in front of news cameras one student was taped soberly expressing shock and cognizance this is like a college columbine he said on msnbc really sad " adding to the flood of questions are doubts about how the university and local law enforcement reacted during the two hour gap between the first shootings at the dorm and the second round which claimed at least lives at a science and engineering center a half mile across the virginia tech campus "some students and faculty struggled to understand the university administrations rationale for failing to lock down the campus while the armed killer was at large and possibly still on campus " the richmond times dispatch reports "other students said it was too early to start assigning blame " the first shots were fired at about a m and the second round began at about "as a parent i am totally outraged " fran bernhards whose daughter kirsten attends virginia tech tells the new york times kirsten bernhards said that when she left her dorm room shortly before a m she and other students had no idea a shooting had occurred the first university warning had been sent to students by email just a few minutes earlier warning students to be "cautious " it wasnt until that a third email announced cancellation of classes and advised everyone to lock their doors and stay put chief flinchum said officials had "no reason to suspect any other incident" would happen columbine reflects a question heard repeatedly yesterday was how could this happen again and beyond the blacksburg va region of virginia tech the place american media were seeking answers was columbine colo the principal of columbine high frank deangelis told newsweek "someone asked me would metal detectors have stopped it its a deeper issue than that if you have a metal detector and someone comes on campus they just shoot the guy whos manning the metal detector what causes so much hate in a persons heart that theyre willing to go out and kill another were living in a society of violence theres so much attention on school shootings but there are young kids dying on a daily basis to violence whether it be gang warfare or other forms of violence its occurring " colorado universities and colleges were assuring students that security procedures aimed at preventing such massacres were being closely followed the denver post reports but "safety experts and university officials concede that even the most secure campuses are no match for someone absolutely bent on doing violence to themselves and others " the post says the policy issue bound to gain traction following the virginia tech shootings is gun control especially in light of virginias scant restrictions on handgun purchases and gun licenses but new federal gun control laws are unlikely to be enacted considering the bush administrations steadfast opposition to such measures and the ambiguous positions held by some democrats virginias own democratic sen jim webb saw one of his aides face illegal weapons charges last month when the aide allegedly entered a senate office building armed with a loaded pistol and two ammunition clips a piece in the independent a british newspaper was typical of reaction abroad when it declared the virginia tech shooting "a shocking reminder of the violence that lies so relatively close to the surface of american society " school shootings in the u s take place with what seems to europeans an appalling regularity the paper says "it is hard not to believe that the reasons for the sharp difference in the incidence of gun crime between the u s and europe have much to do with the availability of firearms and attitudes towards their use " a &# pound the british pound was fetching at least &# in european currency trading this

warner are looking at the possibility of reducing the media giants cable holdings a core part of its operations and currently its biggest source of profits because of the mediums murky outlook as
