lets dump the debates in regard to the april letters "lets have real debates not empty pre packaged political shows" real debates by politicians are a virtual impossibility these shows would be just the same as the current debates political candidates never answer the question asked but just slide into their next pre packaged sound bite that aside my major concern about tv debates is that they may well be a disservice to the political process we are looking for a leader of the western world and need to know the whole program of each candidate not just what conveniently fits into an hour of prime time i do not want an american idol process where the slickest tv presentation wins the vote a candidate should not lose the race because he or she lacks a tv personality if that is all it takes then the parties will be looking for regis or katie type candidates in the future bill clinton could win every time if that was how the nation made its choice so dump the debates david harper bainbridge island wash
