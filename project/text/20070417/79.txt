men boys lack options to treat eating disorders as number of male patients rises research and diagnosis remain focused on females for years brad huffaker obsessively exercised up to five hours a day then he stopped eating for up to hours a day eventually he began gorging each evening on any food he could find in the house and making himself vomit it all back up a cycle he repeated up to eight times throughout the night finally last summer mr huffaker realized he had an eating disorder and needed help but after scouring the internet and researching in patient facilities he found only one that specialized in treating men mr huffaker a year old in knoxville tenn says finding a male focused center was important because he felt ashamed dealing openly with his problem in front of women "its much easier for me to eat in front of guys " he says even amid a growing understanding of the incidence of eating disorders in men and boys experts say there is a dearth of treatment options for male patients only a handful of residential treatment centers have programs that focus on men and boys many centers are reluctant to treat men at all and there has been virtually no research done on males with anorexia or bulimia because these conditions are still considered female problems even the criteria for identifying eating disorders are female oriented the diagnostic guidelines many professionals use include questions about menstruation and female body image there are efforts to change these guidelines to be more inclusive of mens issues but eating disorder experts and male patients say the current lack of treatment programs has a profound impact on the chances of recovery for many years conventional wisdom held that one tenth of patients with eating disorders were male but in february in the first national survey of eating disorders harvard researchers reported that males represent as many as one quarter of anorexia and bulimia patients and close to of binge eaters that would mean men in the u s over get anorexia at some point in their lives and two million become binge eaters the researchers say no one knows if the numbers of male eating disorder patients are actually growing or if more men and boys are simply coming forward to seek treatment but the few programs that specialize in men say they are seeing increased enrollment both males and females with eating disorders experience similar biological and psychological problems say experts but men and boys often manifest their symptoms differently while females obsess over calories and weight males typically focus on muscle and body fat mr huffaker who is feet inches tall and got down to pounds liked that he had defined muscles taut skin and just body fat unlike females males have a variety of body images they may be trying to obtain "some want to be wiry like mick jagger some want to be lean like david beckham and some want to be really buff and bulked like arnold schwarzenegger " says psychiatrist arnold andersen director of the eating disorders program at the university of iowa in iowa city the stigma of having an eating disorder can be even greater for males than for females which typically makes them even more reluctant to seek treatment "society sees this as a girls disease " says lynn grefe chief executive of the national eating disorders association a seattle based nonprofit "if a guy suffers hes embarrassed " researchers at the university of north carolina at chapel hill reviewed clinical trials for eating disorders conducted between and and the findings recently published by the international journal of eating disorders are striking the clinical trials for anorexia included females and males studies of bulimia looked at females and males studies of binge eating disorder included females and males the eight medication studies on anorexia included females and only one male "we have abandoned men " says cynthia bulik one of the authors of the review and director of the eating disorder program at the university of north carolina at chapel hill in the primary handbook for diagnosing mental disorders the fourth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders known as the dsm iv the criteria to assess for anorexia involve female specific traits such as amenorrhea or menstrual irregularity experts say that the screening tests developed by researchers for the disorders are gender biased too "most questions are designed with female concerns in mind " says dr andersen "do you worry about hips do your thighs jiggle instead of do you worry about muscle " in response several experts including dr andersen are developing gender neutral screening tests and there is a committee being formed by the american psychiatric association to examine the eating disorder criteria in the dsm iv and determine what should be revised in the next edition dsm v to be published in that committee is likely to look at gender differences says william e narrow dsm v task force research director because of the lack of gender specific research eating disorder experts say they have no proof that the treatment for males should differ from that for females a successful regimen of care is often individualized and involves psychotherapy family therapy and antidepressants "the bigger problem arises if the male patient needs to be treated in a group setting " says b timothy walsh a psychiatrist and director of the eating disorders research unit at the new york state psychiatric institute at columbia university medical center in new york city "it can be difficult for a young man if he is the only one going through the process with a group of young women " mark grennell experienced this first hand as a teenager he began restricting his food in an effort to look lean and "cut" with well defined muscles this behavior led to fasts that lasted days at a time and ultimately an inability to keep food down three years ago when the foot young man weighed pounds he decided to seek treatment he chose an eating disorder center in southern california that accepts males but treats mostly females at times he was the only male in a therapy group often he says he had trouble relating to how the women felt fat he wasnt focused on his weight as much as on controlling his body and he was troubled by what he calls the "feminist slant" of the therapists blaming men and media images for pressuring women "they said that society teaches women to be thin to be ashamed of their bodies " says mr grennell years old "that really made me uncomfortable because thats not my experience " such issues are often cited by experts who say single sex group therapy is preferable at remuda ranch in wickenburg ariz which treats only women david wall director of psychological services says that women for instance often find it difficult to talk about issues such as sexual abuse and body image in front of male patients indeed some experts say that single sex groups can be powerful tools to healing for men "they provide a safe place a way for men to come in and talk about issues relevant to men " says brad kennington a therapist in austin texas who formed a therapy group for men with eating disorders last year that met for several months "women will talk about how they are no longer ovulating which is not a symptom in men " says mr kennington "men will talk about the role of men in a relationship and how that role gets questioned when they have an eating disorder " although men are often reluctant to seek treatment some eating disorder centers are seeing an increase in male patients at rogers memorial hospital in oconomowoc wis which has one of the best known all male eating disorder programs the number of male eating disorder patients has grown in the past three years males now represent of the or so eating disorder patients a year in the residential program rogers which is where mr huffaker sought help treats about seven males at a time they live separately from the female patients ted weltzin a psychiatrist and director of the eating disorder programs says males have different body image issues than females need more help overcoming their compulsive exercise habits and often have a harder time understanding the emotions behind the disorder male only therapy lets them "see other males cry in group therapy and then go to dinner and talk about sports " he says only a handful of other clinics around the country have specific programs for males at river oaks hospital in new orleans males have their own group and body image sessions but they share other group activities with females including anger management sessions and post meal therapy "i believe the mix of males and females is helpful " says susan willard clinical director of the hospitals eating disorders treatment center "it broadens the perspective for both populations " the university of iowas eating disorders program where of the patients are male has a separate psychotherapy group and strength training for males and men can have testosterone replaced if they need it men who are malnourished may have low testosterone says dr andersen which makes it difficult to build and maintain muscle at the center for eating disorders at sheppard pratt in baltimore which has four to six male patients in residence at a time double the number from five years ago doctors hold male only group sessions when they have enough patients "we focus on what its like for males to live in a society that focuses on these disorders as womens issues " says harry brandt director of the center how they differ some distinctive ways men may manifest eating disorders shape oriented rather than weight oriented focusing on a certain body type unhappy with body from the waist up not waist down dieting for specific reasons such as athletic performance source arnold andersen university of iowa iowa city
