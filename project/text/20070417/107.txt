talks to buy delphi hit snag with union detroit an investor groups effort to acquire delphi corp for as much as &# billion has hit a potential roadblock with the united auto workers refusing demands by group leader cerberus capital management to cut future wages and benefits for new hires said several people familiar with the negotiations a cerberus uaw standstill could hurt cerberuss effort to acquire daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group added these people if the uaw sours on cerberus it will adversely affect the private equity groups chances industry observers said the burden of keeping delphi talks going has fallen on general motors corp the former parent of parts maker delphi and could force gm to further subsidize wages and benefits for new and future uaw delphi employees said the people familiar with the matter cerberus appaloosa management and harbinger capital partners have agreed to take control of delphi which is under chapter bankruptcy protection but cerberus has recently expressed concerns to the uaw gm and delphi about delphis profitability a few years from now when new hires wages and benefits escalate "the talks are not dead but certainly on the ropes " said a person familiar with the negotiations adding that cerberus has concerns that its past financial assumptions may have been too aggressive and that sales of big pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles may be slowing this person said gm and the uaw want to complete delphi talks before uaw national contract talks start in earnest sometime in june delphi spokeswoman claudia piccinin declined to comment on the status of the talks cerberus spokeswoman j j rissi also declined to comment a spokesman for the uaw and a spokeswoman for gm didnt return phone calls cerberus has been confident in its chrysler bid partly because it has hired wolfgang bernhard former chrysler chief operating officer as an adviser but its effort faces union concerns that private equity just wants to make a quick profit off chrysler "private equity is already seen unfavorably by the unions " said auto analyst erich merkle of irn inc adding that a delphi standstill "will just hurt cerberus even more " one of the main issues in a possible chrysler sale is how to address the more than &# billion in unfunded health care and pension liabilities at the same time chrysler is seeking health care concessions from the uaw that is why all of the bidders for chrysler are courting the uaw the canadian auto workers union and the ig metall union in germany in hopes of having labor on their side all of the bids also include a proposal to give the uaw equity in chrysler people familiar with the matter said this week daimlerchrysler executive rudiger grube is continuing his meeting with potential chrysler buyers in new york last week he met with cerberus and a tandem of the blackstone group and centerbridge capital partners lp while this week he is scheduled to meet canadian auto parts supplier magna international inc billionaire investor kirk kerkorians tracinda corp has offered &# billion in cash for chrysler but so far it hasnt been invited into the sales process talks at delphi the uaw has agreed to a two tier wage system new uaw delphi hires start with a wage around &# an hour with an all in cost of about &# an hour once benefits are included that all in cost would grow to about &# an hour by far less than the all in cost of about &# an hour for previous uaw delphi workers cerberus has asked the uaw to "slow down that escalator clause " said a uaw official familiar with the talks because they are worried about delphis profitability about that time which could coincide with when they would be looking to sell delphi the uaw said it has made all the concessions it can shifting the burden to gm which wants to avoid a strike or further litigation said this union official this person estimated it would cost gm "several hundreds of millions of dollars" to fill in the gap between cerberus and the uaw delphi which filed for bankruptcy law protection in october is gms largest supplier providing the auto maker with parts such as steering systems and electronic components the uaw has threatened a strike at delphi and any shutdown at the auto supplier could quickly cripple gm which is in the midst of a fledgling turnaround effort about of delphis hourly workers accepted early retirements or buyouts last year under a special attrition program delphi plans to sell or close of its u s unionized plants as part of its reorganization it has reached preliminary agreements to sell its steering systems and interiors businesses last year delphi and the uaw reached an agreement to give permanent status to thousands of temporary workers hired to fill positions because of the attrition program despite the agreements delphi and the uaw have been able to reach on attrition and temporary workers progress on a final comprehensive agreement has been minimal uaw vice president cal rapson last month said the most recent offer from cerberus in late march "fell far short of where we want to be " gm chief financial officer frederick "fritz" henderson recently said the auto maker needs a resolution on delphi in order to realize an additional &# billion in cost savings he said gm doesnt want the talks to extend through collective bargaining which is slated to start this summer between the auto makers and the uaw the private equity funds or delphi can pull out of the agreement at any time because of the lack of a deal with the unions and gm
