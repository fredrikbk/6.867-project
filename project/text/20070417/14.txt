babes in thailand its not easy being a u s internet company in asia google microsoft and yahoo have all faced criticism for agreeing to censorship in china the latest episode features google inc s youtube video service now blocked in thailand after refusing to censor disrespectful images of revered king bhumibol adulyadej "i will order youtube to be opened up again when these offensive items are removed " sitthichai pookaiyaudom government minister for information and communication technology told us by phone from thailand last week youtubes claims that it refuses to assist in implementing censorship fall flat in bangkok "this talk about freedom of disseminating information to me is very hypocritical because for a big powerful country like china google has agreed to self censor " mr sitthichai said the storm began when an unknown user posted a video with imagery of the king with a picture of feet over his head a major insult in thailand google refused to censor the offensive material so the military government blocked youtube the offense wasnt "political" per se the king is almost a spiritual figure in thailand "the clips are regarded as an insult and offense to the belief of the thai people and the king is someone we all worship very much " mr sitthichai said "the people demanded that i show a reaction " but when the authorities reacted youtube took what it seems to believe is the high road "while we will not take down videos that do not violate our policies and will not assist in implementing censorship we have offered to educate the thai ministry about youtube and how it works " said head of communications julie supan google has faced censorship demands before but has made very different choices when it launched google cn in china last year it agreed to block access to terms and sites not pleasing to the communist party this put the company which famously pledges "dont be evil " in a seriously awkward position in the end it agreed to self censor plausibly if also conveniently arguing that it would not help spread freedom of information in china if google were to be booted from the mainland nor of course would it help googles bottom line at the same time once you agree to play by communist party rules where do you draw the line the behavior of other internet companies in china has demonstrated how slippery the slope can be microsoft has come under fire for filtering keywords like "democracy" on its china based portal then theres yahoo which provided information to chinese authorities that helped land journalist shi tao in jail in a lesser known episode as described by wired magazine in march yahoo provided evidence that helped secure a year sentence for another chinese man wang xiaoning who wrote and emailed about politics "yahoo betrayed my husband and deprived him of freedom " mr wangs wife told wired in thailand deposed prime minister thaksin shinawatra was widely criticized for eroding media freedoms but this time even defenders of free expression have criticized youtube "we are amazed by the whole episode " wrote the nation newspaper in an editorial "first they let somebody insult our king then they lecture thailand on how to embrace the internet without any reservations " the perception of a double standard only fuels indignation google will cooperate with beijing but it is much more willing to defend its principles in a smaller market like thailand its unclear how long this row will last perhaps youtube will be up and running again once the thai authorities feel they have made their point but there is an important warning for u s internet companies that strike a bargain with the chinese censors maybe those companies can justify compromising their principles once in a while but dont expect other countries wont demand the same treatment
