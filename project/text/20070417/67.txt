in afghanistan mercy missions are a part of war medevac helicopters offer villagers services taliban and al qaeda cant match kandahar afghanistan capt josh shonkwiler flew fast between jagged peaks ignoring the automated voice in his headphones that emphatically chanted "low altitude " and trying not to picture the little girl lying gravely wounded in the back of his helicopter or her older brother who was on the next stretcher his intestines held in place by a plastic bag taped to his abdomen capt shonkwiler tried not to think of the dozens of other people he and his air force medical evacuation crew had picked up over the weeks they had been at war "ive got kids of my own i dont want to see that " the year old albuquerque n m native said after landing the helicopter outside the trauma ward at the coalition hospital at kandahar airfield capt shonkwiler and the rest of the rd expeditionary rescue squadron are the elite of the militarys helicopter crews trained to carry commandos behind enemy lines and retrieve pilots shot down in combat but in afghanistan those are missions they are rarely called on to perform so instead u s commanders have drafted them into the effort to win the support of the afghan people specialists in flying over dangerous terrain on moonless nights and in foul weather the air force crews offer ordinary afghans in isolated villages an extraordinary service that the taliban and al qaeda insurgents cannot a fast ride to a good hospital in just over a year the rd and its fellow squadrons have notched more than saves recording each one with a desert brown foot painted on their pave hawk helicopters of those have been afghan soldiers or police and another afghan civilians almost all of the rest have been coalition soldiers or contractors its an expensive ambulance service the pave hawks cost more than &# million apiece with special infrared equipment that turns the blackest night into lime green day and allows them to fly when regular army medevac helicopters are grounded training each pilot costs another &# million but the military sees the rescue missions as a powerful weapon in a war thats as much over villagers as it is over villages saving the life of someones child or spouse is "one of the biggest rounds we can fire " says lt gen gary north the top air force commander for the middle east and southwest asia "thats a story theyll tell forever " capt shonkwiler and his men prefer to forget day after day they take off empty and return full doing their best to block out the images of the people they picked up along the way the crews carry walkie talkies wherever they go and are required to be airborne no more than minutes after they get an alert since they often fly at night capt shonkwiler and his co pilot capt joe epperson were asleep in their modular barracks at the kandahar base when the call came at noon on a saturday last month while the rest of the crew fired up the helicopter capt shonkwiler and a reporter raced down the taxiway to the command post where army capt gema robles was trying to make sense of the sketchy radio reports from a canadian convoy the first word was that a roadside bomb had injured two adults and a child the child she told capt shonkwiler had suffered abdominal wounds leaving organs exposed "theyre pretty badly hurt " capt robles warned him the injuries sounded serious enough that lance nussbaum the squadrons year old flight surgeon from great falls mont jumped aboard to help the crews medic tech sgt roy gomez a san antonio texas emergency medical technician all three patients were on stretchers only two could fit in the back of the pave hawk "doc you go out and figure out who the worst two are " capt shonkwiler instructed dr nussbaum the other litter would have to go in the escort helicopter routinely sent along to protect the medevac crew from ground attacks the flight lasted less than minutes the canadian troops had taken the wounded from the scene of the blast to a nearby patrol base where they popped a purple smoke grenade to mark the dirt landing zone the pilots view of the landing zone was blocked by the helicopters steep upward angle so airman st class ryan ballinger the year old gunner leaned out the left side window he and staff sgt brian stamey the year old flight engineer on the right side counted down from to zero to let the pilots know when the wheels were going to touch the ground dr nussbaum and sgt gomez ducked their heads under the whirling blades and trotted toward a waiting canadian medic it was worse than they had been told a suicide bomber had detonated his explosives packed car next to a canadian convoy on highway a mile north of a village called didar the explosion had left a canadian soldier with burns on his wrists and an afghan man with shrapnel in his chest but dr nussbaum quickly determined that the most critical cases were a year old boy eviscerated by metal fragments and a girl perhaps who it turned out was the boys sister the shrapnel had torn into her throat and punched a hole in her chest the canadian medic her fingers visible through her torn surgical gloves stroked the girls hand and cheek as if to gently wake her from a nightmare attached to a strap that secured the girl to the oversized stretcher was a white tag written on it "girl is breathing erratically" and "patient is cold " marked in purple ink on the girls forehead were the child size doses of morphine she had received two burly canadian soldiers slid her litter into the rear compartment next to her brothers the boy wore a muslim skullcap decorated in red blue yellow and green imitation gems dried blood caked his face and arm every few minutes during the flight he turned his head and stared as dr nussbaum and sgt gomez pressed air into his sisters lungs with a plastic bulb the girl drifted in and out of consciousness a look of alarm on her face when she briefly opened her eyes dr nussbaum raised the tinted eye shield on his helmet so she could see his face hoping to soothe her panic the ambulance was waiting when the helicopter touched down outside the canadian run field hospital at kandahar airfield and dr nussbaum and sgt gomez escorted their patients inside to brief the emergency room doctors the flight crew went to the chow hall and discussed the mission over salisbury steaks and green beans capt epperson a rangy year old from chattanooga tenn said he avoids seeing or thinking about the patients he risks his life to save "i dont look back " he said later he explained "i just want to focus on my job and remain emotionally detached i hate saying it like that because it makes it seem like i dont care but the best thing i can do is fly fast " that afternoon capt shonkwiler broke his own rule and visited the hospital to check on the children "im just not good with blood and guts " he says "its not my job to go out and kill people its my job to go out and save people " surgeons were stitching up the boys abdomen within days he was sitting in a wheelchair under the bed next to him were a helmet and blast blanket in case the hospital came under rocket attack his sister died on the way to the operating table the car bombs shock wave had damaged one of the major blood vessels off her aorta "there wasnt much we could do " said cdr dennis filips the canadian surgeon days later the childrens parents hadnt shown up perhaps they didnt know where their children were perhaps they couldnt find a way to get there perhaps they too were dead airman ballenger couldnt stop thinking about the boy and his sister that evening he called his parents in south bend ind they asked him how his day had been "it wasnt that great " he told them see related letter
