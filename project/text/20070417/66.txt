how shiites rift over basra risks broader instability for iraq discord in key oil region is threatening to shatter fragile ruling coalition basra iraq the escalating battle for control of this oil rich southern province is exposing widening fissures within iraqs ruling shiite muslim coalition and could bring more violence to the crucial region the biggest source of revenue for the central government while protesters marched through the city of basra the provincial capital radical shiite cleric moqtada al sadr pulled his ministers out of iraqs national government in baghdad in protest over the shiite led administrations refusal to set a timetable for the withdrawal of u s troops the shiite divisions in basra and baghdad are playing out as the fragile unity of shiite political parties is crumbling with important consequences for washington since the u s led invasion in the shiites have managed to preserve an overall unity despite recurring tensions among key groups that has helped the shiites who constitute some of iraqs population dominate the government but the shiite political parties are increasingly diverging on key issues both within the central government and in their heartland provinces of the south for the u s the stakes are high because a further splintering of the fragile shiite alliance would add to the difficulty of implementing the recently launched security plan that aims to calm baghdad to give the political process some breathing room it could also lead to increased unrest in the southern provinces where british forces are gradually disengaging mr sadrs pullout threatens to weaken the government of prime minister nouri al maliki just as it needs all the strength it can muster to help washington with the security initiative mr sadrs powerful militia the mahdi army so far has chosen to lie low and avoid open conflict with u s and iraqi forces conducting the sweep but as attacks on shiite targets by sunni muslim insurgents continue it is unclear how long the mahdi army will refrain from meting out vigilante justice upon sunnis which would revive the spiral of sectarian bloodletting that the new u s led effort is trying to stop factions loyal to mr sadrs amorphous organization are also active in the struggle for control of basra iraqs only port city from where most of the countrys oil is shipped to international markets more than protesters marched to basras provincial council building yesterday demanding the resignation of the provincial governor whom they accused of corruption and failure to deliver basic services underlying the demand observers say is a growing tussle among several powerful shiite factions over control of the regions lucrative oil industry and other sources of political patronage the protests are set to continue over the next few days with organizers pledging to live in tents in front of government headquarters until the embattled governor is removed from office the struggle for basra provides a vivid example of how the quest for power and profits has pitted several shiite factions against one another leaving the city wanting for basic services such as health care water and electricity "for a hundred years before the invasion the shia didnt have any power in iraq they are men of revolutions and uprisings " humam hamoudi an influential shiite member of parliament says in reference to his sects long history of struggle against rule by the sunni minority "basra is a test case of whether the shia can be effective administrators " competition over who should run this province started soon after british forces rolled into southern iraq in it escalated during provincial elections in when major shiite parties while presenting a unified front in baghdad went head to head at the ballot box here a coalition led by the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq or sciri a powerful and well armed shiite party based in iran during saddam husseins rule of iraq won the largest share of seats on the council the sadr movement boycotted the ballot held under foreign occupation and thus ended up with no seats despite having a sizable following in the province another shiite party called fadhila won the second largest share of seats and by maneuvering with smaller factions outflanked sciri and managed to appoint its own man mohammed al waeli as basras governor the uneasy balance of power between the governor and council kept growing and seeped into basras security forces which became infiltrated by militants doing the bidding of rival shiite factions assassinations and torture became so widespread that mr maliki placed basra under a state of emergency last year through a complicated arrangement from baghdad the government has sought to limit mr waelis authority through a special security committee much of the violence and power struggles here center on the business of oil smuggling observers say skimming and diversion of petroleum products have become the most sought after activities in basras mafia like underworld mr waeli who hails from a powerful trading family has cemented control of the oil industry through the oil protection force loyal to him and through links to his brother who is active in the oil trade that has earned him enemies among other shiite factions including local offshoots of mr sadrs mahdi army that have tried to install loyalists in the oil industry bassem sharif a fadhila member of parliament in baghdad says mr waeli has improved oil security and is being unfairly maligned by bigger shiite parties seeking to weaken fadhila both in basra and within the central government last year fadhila lost control of the federal oil ministry in baghdad and last month the party pulled out of the shiite coalition in parliament to protest what it considers lack of representation "they dont treat us as equals " mr sharif says of the other shiite parties "they cannot give fadhila the oil ministry " the withdrawal left fadhila even more exposed to pressure in basra last month local mahdi army cells these have grown increasingly splintered and diverged from a direct chain of command to mr sadr laid siege to fadhila headquarters in basra and attempted to storm the governors house engaging in running battles with fadhilas militia the most likely cause of the clash is fadhilas attempt to appoint its own loyalist to the local electricity department though mr sadrs party has no seats on the provincial council it has significant representation within the local police and government offices the sadr movement is pushing for new local elections so its street strength can be reflected on the council if voting were held and that could happen as early as this fall fadhila would likely lose some of its seats to the sadr movement and to the already dominant sciri losing control of basra would diminish fadhilas overall power on the national stage in the absence of elections protesters yesterday took their frustration with the governor to the streets where men marched with white turbaned shiite clerics the anger at fadhila ran high fadhila officials say the governor has been hampered by the hostile council and police who have sought to discredit the party and make basra fail mr waeli has said he has no intention of stepping down and the council lacks the required majority to depose him aqeel al bahadli a local member of the sadr movement said the protesters will attempt "peaceful escalation" until their demands are met so far basras oil infrastructure has avoided serious attempts at sabotage which are common in iraqs northern oil fields while they are locked in fierce competition over the oil business and other sources of patronage all shiite factions here have a stake in keeping the oil flowing smoothly so they can take a cut a senior british military official here says "this is a struggle for a share of the cake " he says "theres a rationality to it all factions want a bigger share " an iraqi employee of the wall street journal contributed to this article
