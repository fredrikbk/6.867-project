three tests may foil artery disease deaths three simple tests that can potentially save thousands of lives from strokes aneurysms or other arterial problems are getting a big endorsement today but sometimes getting accurate tests at a reasonable price can be a complex endeavor as of today the society for vascular surgery representing the nations vascular surgeons is for the first time recommending these three tests to screen for artery disease in many people years old and over one screening exam is a carotid ultrasound to detect fatty plaque in neck arteries that could lead to a stroke the second is an "ankle brachial" test to detect fatty plaque buildup in arteries in the legs and throughout the body the third is an abdominal ultrasound to see if the bodys main artery the aorta has a potentially dangerous bulge called an aneurysm different forms of these screening tests are available from medical societies hospitals and commercial enterprises at prices ranging from free to more than &# doctors say so how can people be sure they are getting accurate tests at a fair price "thats the &# million question " says dartmouth medical school vascular surgeon robert m zwolak a leader in the effort to get these screening tests widely embraced he suggests that patients start their search by looking into screening programs made available free by vascular medical groups and listed at www vascularweb org the society for vascular surgery is recommending these tests for anyone age or older with "cardiovascular risk factors " these include high blood pressure diabetes smoking high cholesterol known cardiovascular disease or a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm often such people can be at risk without knowing it william r flinn chief of vascular surgery at the university of maryland says he was startled by the results of a carotid artery screening program he directed at sites about of the seemingly healthy people over who were screened by carotid ultrasound turned out to have significant blockage in the carotid arteries in the neck many such people can be treated with statin drugs and blood thinners and wont need surgery some will have enough blockage that invasive treatment like surgery is needed dr flinn says many people in his research didnt know they had a problem he estimates one third to one half of the nations annual strokes are caused by such obstruction in the carotid arteries and many of these peoples conditions are very treatable a series of studies have shown that people with serious blockage of the carotid arteries can benefit from surgery to clear them out among the most recent large studies on this point was one published in lancet the english medical journal in may this european study looked at patients age or older with or greater blockage in a carotid artery twelve percent had strokes during the next five years if they were treated only with drugs a carotid operation to clear out plaque cut that stroke risk in half to so where should people get such a test dr zwolak recommends that if patients cant find a screening site at www vascularweb org and there are few such screenings currently scheduled they should check a local hospital some offer free screenings but the list price at many hospitals for the three exams can top &# other options are to check "vascular screening" on a web search site another is a nationwide commercial company life line screening that offers all three tests plus one for osteoporosis for a total of &# or &# each but some studies have shown variations in results among medical labs especially on the carotid test life line screening said its tests have been independently verified by two outside studies one in by the university of south florida and one in by the cleveland clinic the test for aneurysms in the abdominal aorta now is paid for by medicare but only in an initial exam when people turn the "ankle brachial" exam is available at many doctors offices
