in the fray hip hop artists are no better than imus in case you missed it on friday afternoon the hip hop summit action network hsan an advocacy group for the rap and hip hop industry issued a press release "differentiating between don imus and hip hop " that such a press release is required suggests there may be reasons to confuse these two reliable sources of offensive speech but no say russell simmons and benjamin chavis hsan chairman and president respectively after pointing out that mr imus "is not a hip hop artist or a poet " the release states "hip hop artists rap about what they see hear and feel around them their experience of the world like the artists throughout history their messages are a mirror of what is right and wrong with society sometimes their observations or the way in which they choose to express their art may be uncomfortable for some to hear but our job is not to silence or censor that expression " one might quibble and say the quest for commercial success and not artistic integrity is the driver for many major label rappers but lets accept the statement as fact so that all those in favor of freedom of expression may line up behind mr simmons and dr chavis mr imus might join the queue arguing that his comedy sketches provide him with some claim to free speech in the service of satire but mr imus abused that right on the public airwaves for quite a while and its about time he was sent to his room mr imuss skits with producer bernard mcguirk were among the most vile sexist racist and homophobic on mainstream public radio his attack on the young women of the rutgers basketball team in which smirk firmly in place he called them "nappy headed hos" was far from out of character for the program good riddance and the satellite radio network that will inevitably revive the imus program can deal with its equally inevitable return to the bilge and bile of hate speech that may be protected by law but is not immune to public outrage that compels laudable action perhaps the reason hsan feels it must differentiate itself from the radio bigots is that in attacking the rutgers basketball team mr imus and mr mcguirk co opted the language of hip hop in fact one might argue that they were empowered by the language of hip hop which is now mainstream and in play both in schoolyards and penthouses in the u s and many parts of the planet in the world of hip hop a woman who displeases the narrator is often referred to as a "ho " a shortened version of "whore " to use a phrase popular among hip hop purveyors and their fans to "disrespect" women is an everyday thing a sign of authority and virility because its a common enough expression in some circles messrs imus and mcguirk thought their listeners would let their remarks slide not familiar with the latest hip hop lyrics sample these "i got a lot but baby you can be my best ho " "the hos love it when they see a coupe roofless " "a lot of hos give me they numbers but i never call " call it cherry picking to make a point but these lyrics arent on obscure recordings they and others far more coarse and offensive appear on three of the top five cds on billboards top rap albums chart and are marketed by units of emi and the universal music group hsan argues that young buck mims and rich boy perpetrators of the aforementioned lyrics are playing characters that represent urban archetypes but hip hop has enormous cultural influence that blurs such distinctions and mr simmons and dr chavis know it when rappers imply that all women who dont acquiesce to their demands are hos the young impressionable part of their audience may think thats a valid point of view and take that attitude with them into adulthood the undeniable link between the imus flap and hip hop is how people in some segments of society now feel free to bring such an opinion of women into public discourse with confidence that others believe its true mr imus mr mcguirk and their sportscaster sid rosenberg who chimed in with equal venom saw assertive black women and believed they could denigrate them with impunity some rappers think the same way and thus it must follow that so do executives in companies that profit from selling their product the hsan press release went on to say the following "our job is to be an inclusive voice for the hip hop community and to help create an environment that encourages the positive growth of hip hop language can be a powerful tool that is why ones intention when using the power of language should be made clear " as mr simmons and dr chavez strive to "help create" such an environment an admission that one does not yet exist they might keep in mind their own words language is indeed a powerful tool ask any young woman whos been called a "ho" by some dimwit who heard it on shock radio or a rap record and thought it a fact of modern life whether the speaker was trying to emulate don imus young buck or an executive profiting from hate speech the intention was the same to degrade our daughters and sisters mr fusilli writes about rock and pop music for the journal
