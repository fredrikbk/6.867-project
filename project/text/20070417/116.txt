the daily fix sharks lightning sabres grab advantages over nhl foes online edition the san jose sharks and the nashville predators had played a rather quarrelsome playoff series through the first two games with minutes in penalties as evidence but back in san jose with the series knotted the nastiness was on hold and the sharks prevailed behind goals by milan michalek ryan clowe and patrick marleau "what a shock " reports ann killion in the san jose mercury news "went to see the sharks and predators play and surprise surprise a normal hockey game broke out oh there was still nastiness and yapping and penalty minutes given but there was none of the full general hospital soap opera that we saw in the first two games of this get together also known as hockeys most antagonistic series thus far " "game was for lack of a better term an actual game and actual games work to san joses benefit " ray ratto writes in the san francisco chronicle "the teams were not all that closely matched monday night and though each game in a series takes on its own character all the differences between the two teams clearly favored the sharks " in st petersburg fla the tampa bay lightning grabbed a lead in their series with the new jersey devils as vinny prospal beat martin brodeur with left in the third period for a win "prospals regular season was all corners and rough edges " martin fennelly writes in the tampa tribune adding that he "finished the regular season with his teams worst plus minus rating at minus for a while he had the worst plus minus in hockey only a late rush saved him from the cellar now the slate is clean it says vinny prospal has two assists to go with mondays big goal hes a plus three he can breathe again " "hey look its a supporting cast " marvels john romano in the st petersburg times "in the end it wasnt so important who scored the winning goal for the lightning in game against new jersey no it was more important who did not on this night vinny lecavalier was important but he was not the star in this game brad richards was critical but he was not the hero in this situation marty st louis was vital but he did not hit the winner " the third game on mondays nhl slate went to the buffalo sabres who beat the new york islanders in enemy territory behind a three goal second period to claim a series lead in the buffalo news bucky gleason wonders about the uninspired play of the isles alexei yashin whose play hasnt done much to ease grumbling over the nhl record year &# million contract he signed in "yashin is a gracious enough guy but to say hes less passionate than a drone would be insulting the entire bee family " mr gleason writes "yashin had a chance to give the islanders the key first goal monday night but failed to bear down and lift the puck over ryan miller he had a giveaway in the third period while attempting a lazy pass with his team trailing by a goal his awshucks response was hardly inspiring later he fanned on a shot that would have tied the game darn heres what the islanders have received so far from their so called captain in three games no points and three shots " the new york yankees have three starting pitchers on the disabled list the peerless closer mariano rivera was beaten sunday on a home run by the oakland as less than immortal marco scutaro shortstop derek jeter has made six errors a rash of miscues that earned him his picture on the back page of todays new york daily news above a giant "e " for all that jeter is hitting the yanks are and its april but the knives are coming out regardless "an entire generation of yankees fans never had to survive an era of misery and woe " ian oconnor writes in the bergen record adding that "in their largely charmed universe a division series berth is a birthright a mortal lock along the lines of death taxes and a carl pavano mri their yankees are guaranteed a game season including the opening three nights of the first postseason round but the most recent images and bulletins out of oakland should represent a cold revelation to the new school fan and a cruel reminder to the old school fan even with the wild card acting as a reliable deodorant the yankees will miss the playoffs one of these seasons and is as viable a candidate as any " the chicago cubs beat the san diego padres last night but lost &# million free agent alfonso soriano whod just rejected manager lou piniellas suggestion that he move from center field to left for at least a few days with a strained hamstring speaking of strain mr piniellas talk with reporters after fridays loss to the cincinnati reds is worth a look on youtube never has a smile seemed more worrisome "for now based on his sweet track record and the fact he might yell at me ill give lou piniella the benefit of doubt " jay mariotti writes in the chicago sun times "yet forgive me for asking if all his inherited pressure a &# million payroll splurge years of futility club for sale the spookery of cubdom is an unmanageable load for even an elite manager " so is mr mariotti surprised that mr sorianos been injured um no "only two weeks into his wrigley career the most expensive player in franchise history is injured playing a position he shouldnt be playing " he writes adding that "fans are excused for thinking the curse has bitten again kerry wood and mark prior are long gone perhaps never to return with arm injuries so the damned goat needed another target why wouldnt it be soriano " espn the magazines eric adelson frames his article "the chase" as a mystery what makes the young

feet of the flames and his teammates follow him out of the car every winter workers with big canisters and metal wicks set all of muck citys acres ablaze burning off the leaves from the stalks before they harvest the cane the boys walk around the edge of a canal toward the flames heat licks their skin as the fire crackles and snaps more kids show up on bikes and atvs and on foot carrying cane
