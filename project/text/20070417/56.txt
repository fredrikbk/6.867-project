fast and furious atv pitch improve safety by making vehicles faster industry wants to lure teens off adult models safety groups oppose despite warning labels size restrictions and state laws more than children are seriously injured each year riding all terrain vehicles in more than of those cases the injured werent on machines designed for young kids but large powerful atvs made for adults which can weigh up to pounds and zoom up to miles per hour now in a bid to reshape the rules governing their industry major atv manufacturers are pushing a novel solution bigger faster models for kids specifically the industry wants to build a new category of "transitional" atvs aimed at image conscious and year olds who disdain small bikes just as they do restaurant kiddie meals the proposal is the latest attempt by a controversial industry to stay one step ahead of its federal regulator ever since atv injuries became headline news manufacturers have pushed hard to shape industry rules before they were imposed from above this time theyre adopting a counterintuitive position make atvs safer by making some of them more dangerous industry officials say transitional atvs would reduce fatalities because they would encourage kids to ride models more appropriate to their age "almost every time you read about young teenagers getting hurt on atvs theyre riding larger faster models intended for adults " says roy watson general manager of the legal department for yamaha motor corp usa a leading atv manufacturer and proponent of transitional atvs many consumer advocates say beefing up youth options would undercut safety messages and put younger riders on more powerful machines "kids are being injured and the only solution they come up with is bigger faster machines for teenagers " asks carolyn anderson whose year old son james died after crashing on a pound atv ms anderson is the co founder of concerned families for atv safety a group for families with children killed or injured in atv wrecks "thats no solution at all " she says "they want to sell machines " rachel weintraub an attorney with the consumer federation of america who has emerged as the industrys chief critic says atvs should be treated like cars "just because a year old can see over the dashboard doesnt mean you want to give them the keys to your car " she says manufacturers are pressing ahead revising industry standards and lobbying the consumer product safety commission the federal agency that regulates atvs to sign off on their plan past industry agreements with the cpsc have limited youth models to certain sizes and speeds the debate raises a tough question what should governments and industries do to protect kids if parents let them engage in hazardous play "theres a lot about parental responsibility in here " says susan halbert who started an industry funded atv safety program for the h a youth organization after witnessing children competing to see who could slide sideways the furthest on atvs "if we cant deal with that issue theres no simple answer " introduced by the u s arm of honda motor co in as a vehicle with three bulbous tires they were called "all terrain cycles" at the time atvs were virtually unregulated atvs have replaced horses and small tractors on many farms and ranches and are also ridden for fun on public dirt trails or private property in the s concerns started mounting about their propensity to tip over the cpsc charged with protecting the public "against unreasonable risks of injuries associated with consumer products " began to consider rules in to curtail atv related injuries two years later the commission filed suit against the five leading manufacturers seeking to declare atvs an "imminently hazardous consumer product " the agencys harshest possible language short of an outright ban if approved the move could have led to severe restrictions on atv sales the lawsuit was settled a year later honda yamaha and the other companies agreed to stop producing three wheelers instead they started manufacturing four wheelers which were considered less accident prone to placate the cpsc manufacturers devised a set of restrictions on speed and engine size for atvs aimed at young riders today dealerships sell "y " models for children and older that have a top speed of mph and "y " models for riders and up that have a top speed of mph adult models are designed for riders and older the companies also agreed to monitor dealerships to try to stop them from selling adult atvs if kids under were the intended users the cpsc satisfied with the manufacturers actions halted its own attempt to craft regulations in in effect it adopted the industrys plan as its own most atvs are sold through dealerships which adhere to industry standards because of their close ties to manufacturers which in turn can be sued by the cpsc for a while the measures appeared to work atv related injuries for children fell from in to a low of in even as the number of atvs in use more than quadrupled but in the late s atvs exploded in popularity as the industry rolled out a broader range of machines for work and play children gravitated toward adult models despite the rules designed to avoid that problem and injuries began to climb the industry sold an estimated atvs last year up from a decade earlier in the most recent year for which complete data are available children went to hospitals with atv related injuries in at least children were killed in atv accidents the most recently available number a nearly threefold increase from a decade earlier the industry notes that the rate of deaths hasnt changed much because the number of machines in use has also soared one main cause of death and injury teenagers shying away from smaller bikes some teens physically outgrow youth atvs before they are leading parents to give them keys to adult models "i am guilty of that " said cary hernandez vice president of atvmiaxtreme a rider group in miami who allows her son giovanni to ride an adult atv because hes too big for the youth models the cpsc says he should ride "i cant put him on them because his knees drop to the floors " says ms hernandez who works as an accounts manager at the port of miami "i would say of kids ride what theyre not supposed to be riding " atv makers have long wanted to break free from what roger hagie a spokesman for kawasaki motors corp usa calls "the tyranny of age and size restrictions " david murray an attorney who represents yamaha says the industry suggested transitional atvs to the cpsc in the late s but the agency then under democratic leadership rebuffed the idea in recent years industry officials sensed the cpsc becoming more sympathetic given the data illustrating injuries sustained by kids riding adult vehicles the cpsc had also expressed concern over a surge in imports from china of adult size atvs marketed to teenagers makers of these vehicles didnt sign on to the industrys agreement with the cpsc imports from china baja is one of the most popular brands typically sell for less than the average atv price of &# and have grabbed as much as of the market in recent years according to industry estimates in the cpsc citing a "dramatic increase" in atv related deaths and injuries said it was considering new safety rules around the same time the industry started reworking its own standards the proposed "transitional" category or "y " for ages and up would have no limitations on size and a maximum speed of mph manufacturers through their trade association the specialty vehicle institute of america also want to turn "y " into "y " which would allow dealers to sell atvs with top speeds of mph to children as young as these changes if theyre approved would bring atv rules more in line with those governing off road motorcycles even though off road motorcycles are statistically more dangerous for kids than atvs they dont face stringent size rules atv makers who usually also make dirt bikes have long called the discrepancy unfair last month industry officials traveled to cpsc headquarters in bethesda md to press their case at an open meeting attended by much of the cpscs atv review team paul frantz a consultant who conducts research for the industry argued that current restrictions on youth atvs make them unattractive to young teenagers a class of more potent atvs for teens mr frantz said would have a better chance of dissuading them from using adult models that met with a little skepticism from the cpsc staff "youre weighting attractiveness a little heavily dont you think " asked bob ochsman director of one of the agencys safety divisions the atv industry is in a strong position because its regulator doesnt have the kind of statutory authority that many others in washington do in fact the cpsc is legally bound to accept voluntary industry standards if they "eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury " and manufacturers show "substantial compliance" with them cpsc in general relies more on coaxing industries than crafting its own mandates last year a cpsc staff report recommended lifting size restrictions on youth atvs as the industry proposes to steer kids away from adult atvs but the staff didnt support the idea of higher speed limits which remains a major sticking point or adopting a new y transitional category manufacturers now want the cpsc to take the industrys approach and make it mandatory that would give the cpsc the ability to move against sellers of chinese made adult atvs who dont comply with the rules something it currently cannot do elizabeth leland an economist who heads the cpscs atv review team says the agency is leaning toward allowing bigger sizes in line with the earlier staff report the agency is thinking about requiring manufacturers to offer all atv buyers a free training course "an awful lot of people buy atvs and they get on them and go " says ms leland "unfortunately that does lead to injuries and deaths " these efforts all face a broader problem not enough parents recognize that atvs can be dangerous one reason may be the vehicles design unlike big dirt bikes large atvs are easy for children to mount unlike cars atvs accelerate with a flick of the right thumb some argue that children and atvs simply dont mix massachusetts forbids kids younger than from riding atvs for example ms anderson of concerned families is pushing to raise that to "parents typically say that if they had known better about the atv riding risks they would have never put their children on an atv " says dr jeffrey upperman director of trauma childrens hospital of los angeles who has done studies on atv injuries he thinks all atvs are too dangerous for children including transitional ones the specialty vehicle institute of america the industry trade group offers new atv buyers as much as &# to complete a four hour instructional course but only do so industry officials also speak of the "second dealer phenomenon " after discovering that one dealer wont sell a full size bike intended for a teenager adult buyers go to a second store and instead say the atv is meant for them sometimes adults simply tell a fib bev stubbs vice president of salem sand club an oregon group that organizes family atv outings recently purchased an adult size model for her year old niece she convinced the dealer it was for a grown up "if they knew we were buying it for her they wouldnt have sold it to us " she says ms stubbs says kids are going to ride larger atvs anyway so its better to emphasize the importance of safety training and adult supervision as for government officials "i dont think they have a right to tell us what we can or cant do with our kids " one crisp recent morning yamahas mr watson took his year old son to hungry valley a popular vehicular recreation area north of los angeles to teach him how to ride a small "y " model atv young children from other groups zoomed by on a variety of adult atvs a man riding without a helmet swerved around the dusty parking lot with a baby in his arms one kid jerking back and forth rear ended the atv in front of him "where are the parents on this one " moaned mr watson pointing at a small child bouncing about on a y model the industrys new standards will be published later this year the cpsc has to decide whether they pass muster the commission is handicapped at the moment because a vacancy denies it the quorum required to enact rules to fill the spot president bush recently nominated michael baroody chief lobbyist for the national association of manufacturers to the post of chairman the pick has drawn fire from consumer groups which fear the nominee is too close to companies the agency regulates he will likely face opposition from the democratic congress which has to confirm the nomination dean treftz contributed to this article
