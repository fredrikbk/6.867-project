sailing toward ill winds scientist uses biophysics to chart catastrophes contemplate the loss for money manager fermat capital management llc profit doesnt depend much on stock price movements currency swings or corporate bond defaults fermats returns depend instead on which way the wind blows the westport conn firm founded by a biophysics scholar and his brother puts about of its invested assets in bonds linked to natural catastrophes such as hurricanes and earthquakes its rising fortunes are a window into the unusual ways that wall street is finding to manage risk many investors are focused more than ever on diversifying their risks fermat which has more than &# billion in assets concentrates risk in something highly unpredictable and with the start of hurricane season june it is about to enter its hot period catastrophe bonds are an increasingly common way for insurers to spread the danger of losses and share the risk posed by events such as hurricane katrina investors in these bonds get their money back and a preset return if storms dont hit when bad storms do hit the value of the bonds can fall because that opens the possibility of issuers drawing on the capital behind them for example some bondholders suffered losses in a big storm season but they can earn double digit returns when coastlines are clear the amount of so called cat bonds issued has grown significantly last year about &# billion of such bonds were issued more than in the prior two years combined according to goldman sachs group inc which with swiss reinsurance co are main underwriters of these bonds many investors saw after the stock market meltdown of and that it paid to invest in assets whose movements had only a remote connection to stocks or conventional bonds "theres a tremendous demand out there for investments that are uncorrelated " says paul von steenburg a vice president at wilshire associates who acts as an investment consultant for pension fund managers john seo a co founder of fermat is getting a chunk of that money institutional investors typically put a small portion of their money with fermat which he founded with his brother in expecting that its results will be largely divorced from the performance of the traditional bond and stock markets "our investors are the ones who diversify when they go into this asset class " says mr seo who in earned his ph d from harvard university in biophysics which uses the tools of physicists to study life forms mr seo says he turned to finance when he was looking for a job that would provide his family with health insurance when he was planning to do a postdoctoral fellowship biophysics taught him to use quantitative tools to try to understand the sometimes complex phenomena of biology an approach he says has proved useful when studying disasters in he and his younger brother nelson seo founded fermat a four person firm that is named after pierre de fermat the th century french mathematician whose observations about dice games helped form the basis of probability theory mr seo says he isnt particularly nervous as storm season approaches "the very first thing you do when you get into this business is contemplate the loss " he says catastrophe bonds come in various forms and often offer above average returns when covered disasters dont occur investors typically earn from a few percentage points to percentage points above the benchmark london interbank offered rate or libor but if a natural disaster is severe enough if the wind blows at a certain speed for example or if insured losses top a certain threshold investors could lose much or all of their invested principal "these bonds can go to zero on a single event " john seo said at a finance industry conference this spring he declines to discuss fermats returns specifically but he says they tend to broadly reflect the overall returns of the catastrophe bond market though they differ to a certain degree absent disasters the overall market could have annual returns in the range of to currently he says fermat gives investors a chance to manage their catastrophe risk investments judiciously it holds bonds whose payouts could be triggered by a wide variety of disasters from an earthquake on the new madrid fault in the southeast u s to flooding in great britain to windstorms in japan at the same time an important part of the firms strategy is to let price dictate whether to diversify into different types of disaster or to concentrate assets in one type of catastrophe fermat is willing to do the latter if the bond returns are enough nothing would damage fermats portfolio like a massive california earthquake or a devastating hurricane hitting the wrong place what mr seo refers to as an "infinite intensity event " a serious direct hit on miami or new york for instance could wipe out up to half of fermats assets he says still there is an upside to bad storms even if bonds get hit hard insurers could be looking for additional protection which could lead to more bond issues in the future after katrina for example his funds assets roughly doubled mr seo says if this years hurricane season is severe "the market will grow more than ever "
