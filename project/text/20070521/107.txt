real time the perils of online song lyrics yahoos new lyrics service is promising but why cant i copy and paste the words online edition ah rock lyrics theyre for scribbling on notebooks and pondering in math class pairing with your yearbook photo to cringe about years later and of course deciphering over headphones with a careful ear and a furrowed brow but theyre not for copying and pasting at least not when you get them from yahoo music last month yahoo and gracenote announced a deal that let yahoo offer lyrics for hundreds of thousands of songs from the five major music publishers gracenote in turn acquired the rights to provide such lyrics from the publishers last year if you go to yahoo music you can search for a lyric or click the "lyrics" tab on many artists pages the results are a bit hit and miss bruce springsteen and r e m results for example are limited to cover versions gracenote says licensing is still being worked out with the jersey rocker wanting to check on a lyric id consistently misheard i looked for soul asylums "easy street " it wasnt there though other sites let me reluctantly reconfirm that the line id always heard as "there are no easy answers to the questions we make tough" is in fact "there are no easy answers the questions remain tough " i like mine better to be fair hit and miss results arent unexpected for a new service gracenote ceo craig palmer says his company and yahoo worked together to prioritize what to offer first working around the most popular songs and will build from there and i did find some impressive results lots of lyrics from the famously hard to decipher replacements and van halens "unchained " which i could never get straight as a kid turns out its "fat city address" and "blue eyed murder in a size dress " not well i never even had a hypothesis theres a minor mystery solved after a quarter century song lyrics are one of those things the internet might have been made for any niche artist can have a home fans obsessiveness is rewarded and users can correct each others mistakes and the power of search makes song identification feel like magic once you were sunk if a radio station played a song you liked but didnt tell you what it was now all you have to do is scribble down a snatch of the lyric run it through a search engine and then buy it and of course theres the curiosity factor what are the words to "louie louie " anyway and are they dirty you wont find out on yahoo music because the publisher wants to preserve the mystery should you absolutely have to know no theyre not but lyric sites are also an example of how disappointing the internet can be the unlicensed lyric sites that dominate search engine results often perpetuate mistakes worse too many of them are put up by people who couldnt care less about music and only want to grab search engine traffic veteran surfers hunt for lyrics warily the worst malware infection ive ever had came not from some shameful foray into the nets red light district but from an innocent search for the words to some pop song so a better way would be welcome gracenotes mr palmer says it took his company about two years to go from discussions with publishers to "getting critical mass" on its lyrics service the difference between printing lyrics in cd booklets and making them available digitally he says is that "the rights shifted from the labels to the publishers not a few major labels but literally dozens to hundreds of publishers that represent literally tens of thousands of entities that own rights" to lyrics licensing was just the beginning gracenote says few lyrics were available in digital form at all most music publishers are just taking their first steps into the online world and had only focused on a few niche usages for digital lyrics such as karaoke feeds gracenote says it recruited its own employees to transcribe foreign versions of avril lavignes "girlfriend " and consulted everything from liner notes and fan sites to figure out the words to the beastie boys "pauls boutique " crammed with references to movies cartoons hip hop and new york city eventually mr palmer says gracenote wrote a page stylebook covering everything from capitalization to the difference between choruses and verses and whether or not to transcribe background vocals and then of course gracenote had to figure out how to get rights holders paid the yahoo model is revenue sharing from advertising mr palmer says other business models are under discussion as gracenote negotiates to bring lyrics to music subscription services digital download stores and consumer electronics makers the most obvious customer would be apples itunes which already has a lyrics tab for each song asked about potential deals mr palmer says that "we have a full pipeline " though he did say he suspects a business deal with a download store would be based around the store paying "cents" out of its profit margins for the right to embed lyrics with a download perhaps before too long youll buy a song from itunes or another service and automatically get the lyrics the same way you get the album art thats great thats the way it should work but until that happens theres something fundamentally annoying about yahoo musics lyrics and thats the inability to copy them monday addendum yes you can take a screen grab of lyrics from yahoo music but thats beyond less tech savvy folks abilities and why should anybody have to jump through all those hoops its not like copyable lyrics arent already out there even when you dont count the spyware traps plenty of artists offer lyrics on their own official sites i had no trouble finding them for the likes of mr springsteen the rolling stones metallica or gwen stefani and i could copy lyrics from their sites with no problem so if i want to add the lyrics to "if you cant rock me" to that songs metadata in itunes i can copy and paste from the stones own site but not from yahoo music "if we had our druthers we wouldnt necessarily add this feature " ian rogers yahoo musics general manager says of the restrictions on copying "but its being asked for by the copyright holders " the music publishers see what yahoo music is doing as providing lyrics for reference and think that should be different from lyrics that are "permanent " in much the same way streaming audio is temporary and digital downloads are permanent in their view you shouldnt expect to copy a reference lyric any more than youd expect to save a stream publishers arent opposed to lyrics that can be copied nicholas firth chairman and ceo of bmg music publishing says his company "would like to see as many options available for lyric sites as you can conceive of " provided such sites compensate publishers and artists but they see copyable lyrics as a different product such distinctions make perfect sense to people contemplating business models in boardrooms but theyre baffling to consumers and feel like another music offering fettered with seemingly arbitrary controls not everybody visiting yahoo music will be looking to subscribe to streams consumers may be attracted to the site because its an excellent reference guide to music or they might have found the lyric theyre hunting for through a search engine though yahoo is thwarting copying by displaying lyrics as images which ironically makes it harder for search engines to find those lyrics mr rogers says the lyrics have been fed into yahoos own search engine and yahoo music has plans to address the problem with other search engines mr palmer views any annoyance users like me may experience as a temporary thing lyrics should soon be available in other ways eliminating the need to copy and paste "consumers shouldnt have to go copy and paste these things to get the same experience " he says agreed but until then why expect music fans to parse out sites business models music fans may come to yahoo music to find accurate spyware free lyrics that they want to paste into the metadata of songs theyve acquired legally only to find they cant do that when that happens theyll rail about the music industry and find one of the many alternatives that do allow copying mr firth warns that now that a legal lyrics alternative is in place "we will certainly contemplate taking action against sites that are not paying us or the creators " but i doubt music publishers will ever be able to stamp out every site looking to make a buck off their property those who hold the rights to song lyrics may of course do whatever they wish with their intellectual property but as with so many internet content dust ups you wind up asking "wheres the harm " to mr firth its an easy question a lyric copied is a lost sale he mentioned sheet music as an example of a product whose sales could be impacted though he warned "dont ask me to measure it " which is fair enough but the words to a song arent a replacement for sheet music it takes a skilled ear to transcribe chords while anybody can write down what words they hear they certainly arent a replacement for the song itself as anyone whos seen a beloved song lyric fall flat when read aloud can attest and its risible to suggest that a fan of an artist would be happy with a sheaf of printed out lyrics instead of a songbook i used to be a pretty hardcore springsteen fan and in researching this story i came across this book i suppose i could have copied the lyrics in the book from the bosss own site and printed them out but i didnt i bought the book via amazon anyone moved to copy a lyric is probably a fan of that song or that artist a relationship that can be nurtured profitably gracenotes mr palmer raised the issue of bots grabbing up good quality lyrics but there are plenty of sources for such harvesting copying lyrics to paste them into my mp metadata demands a certain engagement with that music printing out lyrics to study while listening to music is a sign of interest if not devotion after all lyrics werent added to record sleeves and cd booklets out of altruism but to further the engagement between artist and listener and so it is here this is a small thing and it may indeed be a temporary problem mr rogers counsels patience saying of the music publishers that "i think right now theyre just dipping their toe in the water and getting started " but to too many people stealing a cent pop song feels like a small thing too when an interesting new service arrives hamstrung positions get hardened in the undeclared war between the music industry and its customers publishers are worrying about lost sales theyd be better off worrying about lost opportunities have you ever searched for song lyrics online what did you find would you pay extra for accurate lyrics
