little cold war paul wolfowitzs forced resignation from the world bank marks the open recognition equivalent to churchills "iron curtain" speech of a new kind of cold war this time between america and europes ruling elites the charges that mr wolfowitz improperly advanced his girlfriends career were always risible mr wolfowitz acted with the full knowledge and approval of world bank officialdom but the facts never mattered the goal was to rid the bank of a president making too many waves with his anticorruption agenda and who had brought with him too many american staffers and attitudes an honest bank board would have ended thursdays statement which cleared mr wolfowitz of ethical wrongdoing and announced his resignation with a triumphant "yankee go home" except of course that the bank is actually based in the u s which also provides the lions share of its budget european officials who detest mr wolfowitz as one of the "neocons" who supposedly launched the iraq war are naturally gleeful witness german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeuls early call for his resignation and her statement that he would not be welcome at todays world bank meeting on african aid in berlin upon hearing of mr wolfowitzs resignation "red heidi " as the development minister is known in germany for the color of her hair that matches her political views said the continents unified action against mr wolfowitz "has strengthened europes position in the world bank " or take the european parliament which called for mr wolfowitzs dismissal before he even had a chance to present his defense during an internal world bank probe the ad hoc committee of the banks board which investigated mr wolfowitzs behavior and ultimately became the leading force for his ouster featured four european officials out of seven members what is remarkable about all of this is not that europes elites detest paul wolfowitz george w bush and their policies that much has been clear for many years rather what is striking is that acting upon this animus the europeans chose to move boldly and aggressively against an american nominee running a multilateral institution on the flimsiest of pretexts the fact that the bush administration was caught by surprise believing until the last minute that the process would be fair and therefore exonerate mr wolfowitz underscores how unprecedented was europes conduct there are however a few developments that europes rulers might like to consider while nursing their celebratory hangovers as british prime minister tony blair keeps trying to explain there is in the u s a strong urge toward global disengagement commentators incorrectly call this "isolationism " a term more properly limited to george washingtons dislike for permanent alliances with european powers todays isolationism is better characterized as a brand of jacksonianism after u s president andrew jackson involving disdain for any kind of foreign involvement this notion fueled by the belief that the rest of the world is incurably wicked and not worth american blood and treasure is shared by a growing part of the u s electorate on the left and the right it is manifested in the blindly anti war sentiments of congressional democrats and even some republicans this trend should worry europeans for most of the last century american foreign policy was focused on europe the u s defended the continent because of shared common interests and values the modern european model of social democracy was possible only because u s security guarantees allowed europes great powers to effectively disarm american interests however are changing europe is no longer as important and america is no longer as european as when the u s rescued their allies in two world wars mr wolfowitzs ouster may prove to be a worse blow to trans atlantic relations than the franco german efforts to preserve saddam husseins regime in at least back then paris and berlin pursued real if illegitimate commercial interests and could point to not entirely unfounded fears of post saddam violence in iraq in contrast europes coup like behavior at the world bank cannot possibly be explained by any concrete however misguided raison detat let alone concern for the banks ability to fight poverty mr wolfowitzs drive to link foreign aid to anti corruption policies is africas best hope no ousting mr wolfowitz was simply about removing an influential and irritating american from an international institution for europeans diminishing u s power has become an end in itself and is seen as advancing their own interests europe will continue to use international institutions as a means of challenging and defeating american interests and influence americans must stay engaged in those institutions and it is imperative that president bush choose an american we note that donald rumsfeld is between jobs to replace mr wolfowitz but it must do so with the understanding that its interests now have to be defended not merely against more traditional opponents but against its european "allies" too messrs rivkin and casey served in the justice department under presidents ronald reagan and george h w
