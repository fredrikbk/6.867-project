the afternoon report lebanon again online edition the ethnic and political fault lines that crisscross lebanon continue to grind this time as its fragile government battles islamic militants inside one of the countrys palestinian refugee camps hundreds of lebanese troops backed by tanks tightened a siege of the nahr el bared refugee camp near the northern city of tripoli as new signs emerged that their target an armed group that follows al qaeda ideology had been training fighters inside the camp for attacks on europe and perhaps the u s the fighting was triggered sunday when police raided suspected hideouts of the group fatah islam while searching for suspects in a recent bank robbery lebanese security officials said they didnt know how many civilians had been killed inside the camp because it is off limits to their authority but they said that at least soldiers and militants have been killed fatah islam not to be confused with the fatah movement loyal to palestinian president mahmoud abbas was established in the camp last fall after its leader a palestinian named shaker al absi was released from a syrian jail lebanese authorities blamed it for the feb bombings of commuter buses that killed three people though fatah islam has denied involvement among those killed in fighting sunday according to lebanese officials was a suspect in a failed german train bombing suggesting that the camp is growing into a base for attacks well beyond lebanon in the past others affiliated with the group in the camp have said they were aiming to send trained fighters into iraq and mr absi has also been linked to al qaeda in iraq the conflict along with the hezbollah israel clash of last summer is one of the worst eruptions of violence since the end of the countrys civil war as such it is a significant blow to a country already mired in a political crisis between the western backed government and hezbollah led opposition although the armys siege appears to have support from the local population the prospect of civilian deaths inside the refugee camp is likely to further inflame this nation of nearly four million people the clashes also heighten strains with lebanons neighbor syria which has been accused of meddling in lebanese affairs including a possible role in the killing of former prime minister rafik hariri lebanons national police commander maj gen ashraf rifi said sunday that damascus was using the fatah islam group as a covert way to wreak havoc in the country just as a u n sponsored probe of the hariri assassination reaches a critical juncture the fighting also exposes some of the strains within palestinian society itself as palestinian officials in the west bank rushed to distance themselves from fatah islam and urged palestinian refugees in the camp to isolate the group meanwhile a spokesman for fatah islam abu salim warned that if the army bombardment didnt stop the militants would step up attacks by rockets and artillery "and would take the battle outside tripoli " stocks advance on alltel deal stocks gained after another weekend of deal making including the &# billion acquisition of mobile phone provider alltel corp the s&amp p
