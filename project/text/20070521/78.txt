facebook opens its pages as a way to fuel growth facebook inc has bucked the silicon valley acquisition trend remaining independent of larger technology companies now the social networking start up is seeking ways to reach the big leagues on its own on thursday the palo alto calif company will announce a new strategy to let other companies provide their services on special pages within its popular web site these companies will be able to link into facebook users networks of online friends according to people familiar with the matter for instance an online retailer could build a service in facebook to let people recommend music or books to their friends based on the relationships theyve already established on the site or a media company could let groups of users share news articles with each other on a page inside facebook previously some companies have had pages within facebook but they didnt interact with the web sites user networks this move is significant because it could turn facebook into a central hub for web users akin to an internet portal like yahoo inc rather than using facebook only to keep in touch with friends and going elsewhere for other content users could now gain access to that content inside facebook that could keep people on facebook for longer periods of time which would also appeal to advertisers its unclear how exactly facebook plans to make money from the platform strategy but one person familiar with the matter says the firm currently has no plans to share revenue with the companies that develop services to run on facebooks platform in that case the main draw for companies that put their services on the site would be visibility and access to users of the facebook site a facebook spokeswoman declined to comment for this article in a march interview facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg said "we realize that were not going to be able to build everything ourselves here and its not the most efficient thing for us to do that " he added that letting others build services to interact with facebook is "definitely going to be a bigger part of our strategy " the new platform is the latest step in facebooks go it alone strategy while other hot internet start ups in the current web boom such as youtube and myspace have been scooped up by purchasers like google inc and news corp facebook has remained independent yahoo was interested last year in buying facebook for close to &# billion but people familiar with the matter say the talks cooled months ago partly because mr zuckerberg and facebooks investors thought the company was worth more and partly because mr zuckerberg wanted to keep management control the year old mr zuckerberg who founded facebook in and facebooks venture capital investors which include accel partners and greylock partners now believe it is unlikely they will sell the company says one person familiar with the matter instead they hope to keep facebook private for as long as possible eventually going public in about two years this person says facebook is taking its business beyond social networking the hot web phenomenon where people build online web profiles with personal details and connect to each other through those profiles last fall facebook opened its site to anyone with an email address rather than its original audience of only those people with university email addresses that has helped it expand its number of users facebook is lately finding new ways to make money from those users most of the companys revenue comes from a deal in which microsoft corp brokers display ads on the site the deal runs through but facebook also controls other areas such as a "news feed" section that shows up when a user logs in it displays text ads alongside updates on the activities of that users friends in february the company started selling virtual "gifts" like roses that users can send to each other for a fee earlier this month it added classified advertising while now free that could eventually become a new revenue stream all of this has taken facebook a long way from its early days when harvard university dropout mr zuckerberg started the company facebook which has raised more than &# million in funding is profitable and expects to generate close to &# million in revenue this year says one person familiar with the matter facebook says its user base has more than doubled to million in the past six months and it is adding new users a day mr zuckerberg in the past has acknowledged he has greater ambitions for facebook he has bristled at facebooks "social networking" tag instead calling the site a "social utility" that helps people share information with their personal connections with each other as a backdrop if others build services to take advantage of those connections facebook can become more useful for its users he said in the march interview but facebook faces challenges in trying to stay independent mr zuckerberg has little management experience for instance and is now managing some lieutenants who are silicon valley veterans twice his age his main focus is on building interesting technology say people familiar with the matter a facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on those characterizations theres also stiff competition news corp s myspace is still the leader in social networking with million u s visitors in april compared with facebooks million even though facebook has grown three times as fast as myspace in the past year according to nielsen netratings and a handful of other companies are also riffing off the idea of using social networking technology to build a broader platform such as ning inc co founded by netscape communications corp founder marc andreessen ning lets groups build their own social networks some silicon valley cognoscenti have compared facebook to google google faced similar challenges in the late s when its young scrappy founders dealt with skepticism over their lack of experience lateness to the search arena and focus on technology over revenue so mr zuckerbergs moves are being closely watched as a barometer of whether a new generation of web companies can remain independent yet grow very large mr zuckerberg himself has compared facebook to google asked in march whether facebook has an analog to googles motto of "dont be evil " mr zuckerberg said "i dont know that we have a motto yet maybe its make the world more open " kevin j delaney contributed to this article corrections &amp amplifications a chart with yesterdays marketplace article about social networking start up facebook inc showed millions of unique visitors to facebook and myspace sites the text incorrectly said the figures were in thousands wsj may
