china puts cash to work in deal with blackstone willingness to invest more reserves may ease trade strains with u s early this year the chinese government announced it was looking for a place to invest a portion of its &# trillion of foreign exchange reserves not long after private equity firm blackstone group launched plans to raise money in an initial public offering the sides found each other in dramatic fashion yesterday when china said it would invest &# billion in blackstone the landmark deal signals chinas determination to earn higher returns on its reserves and gives blackstone a potential advantage in doing deals in china continued investment in u s entities could help restore some equilibrium to chinas accounts with the u s and thus alleviate one of the biggest sore points between washington and beijing the deal came just before this weeks u s china economic talks in washington led by u s treasury secretary henry paulson and chinese vice premier wu yi the run up has been dominated by u s complaints that chinas currency is kept artificially low to give chinese exports an edge in a sign the two sides realize the deal could stir political opposition the chinese ownership stake will be below the level requiring u s government approval in addition the chinese government at its own request will have no voting rights or any influence on blackstones decision making "this is a huge sign that the country is prepared to recycle its reserves and liberalize capital flows from china " says steve schwarzman co founder of blackstone "it is an exceptionally important paradigm shift and hopefully it presages further opening of the market in china as well " as china seeks to more actively manage its burgeoning reserves the u s is still likely to be the destination for most of its investment but instead of steering the vast majority to the u s treasurys market beijing is likely to seek higher returning vehicles that promise profit rather than safety blackstone which announced its ipo plans in april is expected to expand its stock market offer scheduled for june to &# billion from around &# billion to accommodate the chinese the agreement came together in just three weeks so quickly the chinese had to establish a special unit to deal with the blackstone stake since the state investment company being formed to manage the reserves doesnt formally exist and there was no entity to make the investment the first conversations came in april when antony leung chairman of blackstones asian office in hong kong called on lou jiwei head of the state investment companys working group and two of his senior deputies in beijing including jesse wang just weeks after the chinese government had announced plans to manage part of its &# trillion of reserves in a more proactive fashion blackstone announced its decision to become the first major private equity firm to go public as part of that general discussion mr leung a former hong kong finance secretary and banker at citigroup inc and j p morgan asked if the chinese were interested in investing in any of blackstones funds three weeks ago mr leung received the news the chinese were indeed interested but in taking a stake in blackstone itself yesterday the two sides agreed that chinas soon to be established state foreign exchange investment company would take a &# billion stake in blackstone under the terms of the deal it was agreed the state investment company would refrain from selling the shares for four years and forgo investing in a competing private equity firm for one year at the end of the four year lock up period the chinese company may begin selling one third of its shares a year for these nonvoting shares the chinese investment company will pay of the public offering price the state investment companys stake will be kept below other central banks and government investment authorities have long invested in private equity funds the government of singapore has been an active investor in both private equity and venture capital in the u s more recently with the rise of oil prices persian gulf states have emulated singapore for example the abu dhabi investment authority bought up nearly half of apollo managements listed investment vehicle last year and the qatar investment authority the youngest of such gulf entities is becoming a major investor as well but this is the first time a government is investing in the heart of a private equity firm with a cut of all the fees and profits that accrue to the management company itself fund investors by contrast pay those fees it is likely other official entities will seek to replicate what china is doing with blackstone analysts say the deal caps a frenzied few months for blackstone the firm won a bidding war to acquire real estate firm equity office properties one of the biggest owners of office buildings in the u s blackstone with &# billion under management then announced an ipo that would value the new york firm at between &# billion and &# billion by inviting china into its fold blackstone derives direct and indirect benefits from the relationship it will have close access to top decision makers in beijing its dealings with the government will also confer a stamp of approval that translates into legitimacy among chinese making it more likely to attract other local partners whats more beijing has a clear interest in seeing the firm and its own investment succeed so this deal will give blackstone a potential leg up on rivals such as tpg and the carlyle group which have been in the region far longer but even as blackstone and other private equity firms have done dozens of deals they have faced a backlash from labor groups that are fearful of job losses and shareholders of acquisition targets who are angry that buyout firms are snatching their future investment gains by buying companies at modest premiums just last week congress held hearings on the impact of private equity deals now chinas blackstone stake opens up another front for critics in the summer of political opposition helped scuttle chinese state oil firm cnooc ltd s attempt to buy california oil company unocal corp a deal by dubai ports world to buy a company that controlled many u s ports withered amid political fallout by investing in private equity firms foreign investors are hoping to deflect some of the criticism by going in with a local partner by taking a stake in blackstone itself for example the chinese government wont actually own of any of the companies the firm buys through its investment funds that could preempt criticism about foreign ownership and should there be layoffs at any acquisitions negate claims that a foreign country is causing u s job losses in a recent talk henry kravis co founder of kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co noted "we are approached all the time by chinese and middle eastern investors to team up to do u s private equity to avoid nationalism here " myron brilliant head of the u s chamber of commerces asia division and a close china watcher said he doesnt expect the blackstone deal to spark the same kind of political opposition that doomed the cnooc and dubai deals "the heart of the matter is that we have to decide if our security is at risk in these kinds of deals " he said "and i dont think our security is at risk with a chinese company taking an equity stake in an american financial firm " chinas venture into private equity would be a bold first step as the country seeks alternative investments for its &# trillion of foreign exchange reserves the worlds largest most of the countrys reserves which support chinas currency and the domestic banking system have long been held in safe but low return u s treasury bonds and other government debt but early this year chinese officials said they would begin investing some of the reserves more aggressively in hopes of earning higher returns how exactly to adjust the investment strategy for the reserves is still being debated in chinese official and academic circles some have advocated a freewheeling approach that would pursue political as well as financial ends for instance by buying stockpiles of minerals that china needs to import others have pushed for a conservative style more akin to a pension fund which could involve buying blue chip stocks to supplement the current heavy reliance on bonds "i think theyre doing what any responsible investor does and that is to diversify ones portfolio " u s deputy treasury secretary robert kimmitt told reporters in potsdam germany at a group of eight meeting during the weekend mr kimmitt said the treasury hadnt seen any drop in chinas interest in buying u s debt since it announced plans for the investment agency "i dont see it as a zero sum game " he said yochi j dreazen in washington contributed to this article
