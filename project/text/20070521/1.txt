a tort riot the depredations of the trial bar are legion but sometimes a case is so exquisite in revealing the character of the modern tort industry that its details deserve national distribution such is the case of the lawyers fighting like a hyena pack over the spoils of a &# million shell oil settlement in new orleans back in shell sold misformulated gasoline to tens of thousands of customers fouling their fuel gauges and creating a class action bonanza for four score plaintiffs lawyers our readers wont be surprised to learn that most of the &# million that shell coughed up went to the lawyers the plaintiffs got "a new fuel gauge and a bucks " says dane ciolino a law professor at loyola university in new orleans whos now involved in the case the lawyers on the other hand got well no one really knows exactly what they got except for the judge and the handful of lawyers who divvied up the pot the total amount that shell agreed to pay the lawyers was about &# million but the rest of the details are under seal the lawyers who shared in that windfall are barred from discussing their take with anyone according to a january gag order that order was issued at the urging of the five lawyers who decided how much everyone else would get "letting each persons award sic stand on its own merits and be examined on its own merits would lead to a peaceful situation " attorney don barrett told the judge in requesting that the amounts paid be put under seal allowing the lawyers or the clients for that matter to compare jackpots could only lead to jealously the five argued on the other hand mr barrett noted "we think that when people look at what they got compared with what they did they are going to be quietly pleased " after all he added "we have money to go around " mr barrett got his gag order and that might have been the end of it but some of the other lawyers were neither pleased nor quiet about the secrecy and result at least four attorneys and one of the original plaintiffs remember them have appealed to have the seal lifted prof ciolino is representing them in the case which the new orleans times picayune has joined on freedom of speech grounds the sealed order arose out of a january hearing before u s district judge ivan l r lemelle the hearing was apparently public but according to the five lawyers present none of the other lawyers in the case was informed beforehand this gave the five who had been appointed by the court to decide on the allocation of the &# million a free hand to argue for their allocation as well as for sealing their justification of the amounts judge lemelle did pause long enough to ask whether the proposed sums were different from what each of the had requested mr barrett said they were "yes sir some people turned in hours that were clearly grossly excessive " lest the point be overlooked mr barrett added "there were two firms that we generously gave a substantial award that really didnt do anything for the common benefit " our emphasis since this could be said about all mr barrett nonetheless said the five were "proud" of their work though not proud enough to let it see the light of day they needed judge lemelles help to cover their tracks however and he obliged he even agreed according to the transcript to seal the record of the hearing although copies are now circulating the fifth circuit court of appeals has been asked to examine the order sealing the records but no hearing date has been scheduled if the fifth circuit agrees that the class member and the other attorneys have an interest in knowing how the pot was divvied up it will be a victory for common sense but even without that data the lawyers conduct is revealing by mr barretts own admission the committee raised most of the lawyers fees "raised them generously" to make sure most of the money extracted from shell was doled out to the lawyers mr barrett admitted in open court that some of the lawyers had "grossly" overbilled or done little or nothing to merit a share of the pie but the committee paid these lawyers well anyway were grateful to the lawyers who blew the whistle on mr barretts cover up but its hard to feel sympathy for anyone in a group that walked away with almost two thirds of the money won in the case unsealing the records would be a good first step but mr barretts statements suggest that the juiciest story is not how the money was divided among the lawyers but how lawyers extracted nearly twice as much from the defendant for themselves than they won for their clients just another day at the office for the tort bar
