the politics of happiness at the outset of his presidential run of democrat hubert h humphrey called his ill fated campaign "the politics of happiness the politics of purpose and the politics of joy " what exactly does the "politics of happiness" mean you might be tempted to dismiss it as nothing more than utopian flapdoodle from a doomed democratic candidate or maybe a contrast inspired by the unlovable richard nixon but might there be something more to the idea a better higher approach to politics and one to which we can aspire regardless of our ideology perhaps if our politics were "happier " we could enjoy a climate of mutual respect and understanding maybe even genial compromise between the parties heading into a presidential election year in our current climate of ideological acrimony the "politics of happiness" might sound attractive to you when it comes to politics the standard intuition is that anger and happiness are incompatible for example todays foam flecked furious liberals appear to advertise their own misery with their catchphrase "if youre not outraged youre not paying attention " this by the way is now official democratic policy the democratic national committees web site asserts that "outrage must be taken to the ballot box " if we had a politics of happiness we could have a constructive dialogue about our differences in short a thousand political flowers would bloom right wrong the strange fact of the matter is that the hard core liberals and conservatives in america are actually some of our happiest citizens according to the national opinion research center in in spite of all their bile of people who said they are "extremely liberal" also reported being "very happy" with their lives versus of people who were just "liberal" and of moderates at the same time a whopping of people who were "extremely conservative" were very happy compared with of non extreme conservatives as much as you might prefer not to believe it the "politics of happiness" is actually the politics of intolerance nasty sloganeering and the screaming pundits on cable television think this is hyperbole consider data from the university of michigans national election studies which asks respondents to rate other people on a scale where is best and zero is worst these so called "feeling thermometers" are useful for revealing intolerance and bigotry because they measure feelings about other groups of people not just about ideas or institutions in "extremely liberal" folks gave lumpen "conservatives" a freezing average temperature of "extremely conservative" people in turn gave liberals an average score of the temperature for these groups from the non extreme populations was and respectively to put this into perspective note that north korea and iran avowed enemies of the u s receive similar temperatures to those which extremists give their fellow citizens who just happen to disagree with them politically not surprisingly there is also evidence that people with extreme views are less empathetic and compassionate than others they are less loving toward family members and less charitable with their money they are even less honest in everyday transactions so how on earth could these people be happier than the rest of us perhaps the intensity of their political views animates them in some positive way giving them a sense of purpose or maybe there is something else about the life of the average extremist that brings lots of joy in either case what we see is that the anger we associate with the far left and far right is apparently compatible with their happiness the trouble is that while radicals may be happy they undoubtedly lower the happiness of the rest of us through their intolerance and antisocial ways spewing out what economists call "externalities" with every insulting bumper sticker and obnoxious street demonstration political nastiness is something akin to pollution as approaches we can expect to endure plenty of this pollution if as generally happens politicians tailor their primary rhetoric to the extremes im unhappy to predict that we appear to be in for a year of the "politics of happiness " mr brooks a professor at syracuse universitys maxwell school of public affairs and a visiting scholar at the american enterprise institute is the author of "who really cares" basic books see related letters "letters to the editor get your worldviews all decided chase all your cares away" wsj may see related letter "letters to the editor moderates bravely face lifes messy complications" wsj may
