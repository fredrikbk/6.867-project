more pop for corporate museums cokes exhibit leads trend of bigger flashier costlier atlanta its not "pirates of the caribbean " but a new movie about coke debuting here this week is expected to fill seats in the city where the product was first sold for eight minutes chairs in the theater shake squirt water and puff wind while scientists in the d film "in search of the secret formula " try to track down a list of important ingredients the ones that go into making a coke from the theater to a foot high contour bottle encased in a glass tower to more than pieces of memorabilia elaborately orchestrated schmaltz pervades the new world of coca cola a &# million museum opening to the public thursday coca cola co estimates that about a million people a year will visit the companys shrine to itself which is roughly the size of football fields and located about a mile from cokes headquarters corporate museums arent a new idea and hundreds have popped up throughout the world as marketing tools thinly disguised as tourist attractions but the coke museum replacing a smaller facility that closed last month is perhaps the most ambitious combination yet of size cost and self promotion in one section a miniature bottling line churns out samples of the companys namesake cola and every visitor gets an ounce bottle of coke to take home a tasting area offers samples of about drink brands produced by coke including a japanese soda with vegetable juice called vegitabeta "beverage connoisseurs" wearing white jackets will hand out sips of newly developed juices and other noncarbonated drinks corporate museums once werent much flashier than a dusty set of exhibits packed into a few rooms at headquarters and visited by just a handful of bored employees or clients plant tours were also once a popular family pastime but have been largely phased out due to government health and safety regulations the new world of coca cola shows how companies are becoming increasingly aggressive at using museums and interactive technology to promote their corporate namesakes companies are looking for new ways to "take brand attributes and let people experience them one on one " says bruce weindruch chief executive of the history factory in chantilly va which helps manage archives and develop corporate museums but did not work on the new coke facility many such museums were once managed by companies public relations staffs but the newer ones are generally overseen by marketing executives "these museums have a lot more to do with brand reputation management " says mr weindruch hershey co s chocolate world started in last year updated its great american chocolate tour ride with special effects and a trio of singing cows the pennsylvania attraction gets as many as three million visitors a year next year harley davidson inc will open a &# million museum in milwaukee filled with classic motorcycles and is expected to attract visitors a year stacey schiesl director of the harley davidson museum said the company decided to open a museum because it sees its vast collection of more than motorcycles dating to its earliest years as a way to attract both regular customers and newcomers not all corporate museums survive in january the foundation that ran kelloggs cereal city usa in battle creek mich closed the nine year old museum because of debts and disappointing attendance kellogg co plans to convert it into offices the new coca cola museum reflects a push by e neville isdell cokes chairman and ceo to reassert the marketing dominance and globetrotting swagger that made coke the worlds most recognized product the exhibits are designed to help the companys recovery from years of management turmoil and lackluster ads mr isdell calls the museum a "manifestation" of cokes "mission vision and values " the company will use the museum to showcase product rollouts including a relaunch of vanilla coke planned for friday the entrance fee coke plans to charge &# for adults &# by advance purchase online &# or &# online for senior citizens and &# or &# online for children ages to is steep compared with other corporate museums but fees at other museums can add up admission to hersheys chocolate world is free but visitors must pay to see the "really big d show" &# for adults ages or participate in the hersheys chocolate tasting experience &# for all ages coke says its fee is justified given the entertainment it includes such as two movies and that it doesnt plan to use its museum to make a profit it hopes ticket revenue will cover operating costs though the amount spent to build the new world of coca cola is equivalent to about days of coke revenue the square foot new world of coca cola is a free standing building on the downtown spot where coke operated an amusement park during the olympics next door is the georgia aquarium bankrolled by home depot inc co founder bernie marcus and coke has donated adjacent land for a proposed civil rights museum outside is a foot inch pound statue of john s "doc" pemberton the atlanta pharmacist who invented coke in highlights of attractions inside the sleek airy building include a soda fountain and a prototype of the original contour bottle next to an andy warhol themed exhibit people can create their own pop art at a "milestones of refreshment" tour showing cokes impact on the development of marketing and cultural history visitors are invited to try their hand at tracing the coca cola script on a computer screen the flashier and more interactive exhibits reflect a general trend says allyson lazar principal with orinda group a museum planning firm "you see that more and more in the museum world " but its most visible in corporate museums because they have more money for the latest technology the old museum was hugely popular drawing more than million visitors over its more than years of operation long lines often snaked out the door but by coke decided that it wanted a bigger museum that would include fresher and more interactive exhibits the new museum was also part of an effort to help atlanta revitalize an area downtown unlike at its old world of coca cola the company plans to update its collection of artifacts from its vast archives regularly to lure repeat visitors coke has preserved artifacts that poke fun at the company for its disastrous launch of new coke in displaying them more prominently than it did previously video footage shows protesters brandishing "i want my old coke" signs in front of cokes headquarters and pouring the drink into sidewalk drains but the new museum has no reference to touchy subjects like the small amounts of cocaine originally left in the soda by the coca leaves used to make the cola phil mooney coke archivist will not comment on whether its product ever contained cocaine other than to say cocaine has never been an added ingredient another thing not mentioned pepsi whose ads helped inspire the cola wars and sparked the creation of new coke "im not sure saber rattling is what people would enjoy " says mark greatrex a senior coke marketing executive overseeing the museum a pepsi spokesman says of the snub "coke is years old its easy to be forgetful at that age " as for pepsico inc based in purchase n y it doesnt have a corporate museum one of its bottlers runs an informal tribute to the sodas history in the drugstore in new bern n c where pepsi cola was first served to customers in visitors can buy a fountain pepsi there and some memorabilia but thats about it
