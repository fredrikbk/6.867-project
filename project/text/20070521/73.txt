fashion faux pas hurts wal mart slow sales of designer line show higher end clothes remain a weak spot wal marts struggles in fashion apparel appear to be worsening stacks of unsold clothing are clogging store aisles and pressuring profits now wal mart stores inc s first designer line by designer mark eisen has been pulled from several hundred of the more than u s stores that carried it according to a person close to the situation a wal mart spokeswoman confirmed the line had been pulled from some stores but didnt know how many wal marts chief financial officer says clearing out stocks of unsold clothing is going to be a chore and could pressure margins all summer "were a little heavy in apparel " thomas m schoewe said in an interview last week "its all about getting the stores cleaned up right now " the flush inventories mark a significant miscue from a year ago when karen stuckey a wal mart apparel merchandising executive said of the addition of mr eisen and the retailers new found fashion focus "were going to rock in apparel " the setback suggests wal marts apparel problems go deeper than a misfire with ultratrendy attire that led to a sales stumble late last year at that time an in house designed line of skinny legged pants and nightclub wear called metro turned off customers who went shopping elsewhere wal marts inventories jumped in the fiscal first quarter ended april to &# billion from a year earlier driven by unsold apparel home decor and outdoor products about &# billion of the increase represents unsold spring clothing and home goods that are expected to depress profit through the summer analysts estimate the wal mart spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimate the latest woes involve wal marts efforts to bring brand name designers into its orbit wal mart is seeking to better compete with target corp j c penney co and kohls corp which have a reputation for higher end clothing than what wal mart carries a year ago wal mart signed mr eisen a former anntaylor stores corp design executive to put some sparkle into its george line of everyday womens apparel which although successful outside the u s has been weaker here mr eisen known for his lines fit and styling launched knitwear label karoo in the karoo line sells at high end retailers such as bergdorf goodman neiman marcus and nordstrom mr eisen developed a collection of womens sportswear within the broader george line called george m e for the designers initials it featured &# cardigans and &# suede jackets among other items wal mart showed the collection at new yorks fashion week last year gathering positive reviews but problems surfaced almost immediately the fall line was supposed to appear in mid august but wal mart put the apparel in stores a month early too soon for many shoppers to fill gaps in other lines patricia edwards a portfolio manager at financial services firm wentworth hauser &amp violich says little marketing of mr eisen or his line followed the fashion week launch wal mart customers who didnt shop at neiman marcus were unlikely to have heard of him she said "wal mart is so good at providing things based on price that im not certain theyve yet grasped how to promote items that arent solely based on price " the wal mart spokeswoman declined to make executives available to comment mr eisen didnt return calls seeking comment a person close to the designer said sales had recently improved now that the line appears in fewer stores the inventory overhang has several analysts paring this years profit estimates by as much as five cents a share citing the effect of working through the excess inventories and weaker sales bank of america now expects wal mart to post annual profit of &# a share about of its revenue comes from apparel "when of your business is not doing what you want it to thats a lot of drag " ms edwards says "its going to be a drag until they get it right the question is when will they get it right " wal mart has a couple of bright spots in its fashion stable a line of young mens fashions called exsto and introduced in was expanded to stores from the original the company is planning to make exsto fashions available in boys sizes as part of its back to school line the spokeswoman said wal mart says george m e remains a part of its apparel strategy and that it will announce a freshened line later this year it also recently nominated retail turnaround guru allen questrom to its board mr questrom helped revitalize penney and barneys new york inc and engineered federated department stores inc s acquisition of macys despite its fashion efforts wal marts customers in polls dont list the retailer as their first choice for clothing purchases says wendy liebmann president of consulting firm wsl strategic retail "people who shop wal mart regularly think of wal mart as the no or no place they shop most often" for apparel she says customers dont yet perceive the company as a credible arbiter of fashion she says wal marts fashion woes surfaced last year with the in house line of nightclub wear called metro its gold lame vests and skinny legged pants fell flat with customers leading to anemic same store sales last fall just as wal mart was preparing for the holiday sales rush wal mart initially planned to introduce metro in just stores but increased the number to last year in an effort to become known as a fashion source it pulled the line out of stores earlier this year overall the retailer has roughly u s wal mart stores complicating a turnaround
