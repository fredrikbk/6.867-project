the china trade chinas acrobats may be famous for their contortions but u s politicians are close behind in their intellectual distortions over the u s trade deficit with that country as the two nations prepare for their latest strategic economic dialogue in washington this week congress and the bush administration are demanding a more rapid renminbi appreciation to "solve" the "problem" of trade imbalances this isnt the way to run a global economy that is on the greatest spurt of growth in more than years treasury secretary hank paulson has tried to use these twice yearly discussions to improve u s china economic understanding but in making a floating chinese currency the focal point of progress in bilateral trade relations the administration is giving political cover to congressional red scare tactics weve seen this kind of exchange rate brinksmanship before in the fall of the u s and germany got into a public tiff over the value of the dollar against the deutschmark which helped to precipitate the stock market rout known as black monday this time around the threats are mostly from congress last year senators lindsey graham and chuck schumer pulled their notorious plan to impose a duty on chinese imports but theyre working on some kind of sequel if beijing doesnt revalue the renminbi in the house republican phil english and democrat artur davis want to relabel china a "market economy" so they can impose dumping duties ways and means chairman charles rangel and trade subcommittee chairman sander levin are urging "retaliation" against china under section of u s trade law to address chinese currency "manipulation " its little wonder that vice premier wu yi who is leading her countrys delegation to the talks this week considered not coming by focusing on the exchange rate the administration and congress are playing with fire and demonstrating a keen misunderstanding of how the deficit came into being simply put china overinvested in industrial sectors in the s while it was opening itself up to trade by acceding to the world trade organization chinese exports to the u s soared especially as it began assembling japanese south korean and other countries goods and slapping a "made in china" label on them to argue that a stable exchange rate is the root of the bilateral surplus is fundamentally misleading this is a structural story if anything the exchange rate stability has spurred trade and investment by removing currency volatility from business calculations the bush treasury has been part of the political problem by not coherently explaining the benefits the u s derives from china trade u s consumers get cheaper goods from television sets to t shirts the center for strategic and international studies estimates the benefit to u s consumers totals around &# billion a year and it may be higher some u s manufacturers have been hit hard by the competition but its impossible to credibly claim the u s as a whole is suffering when the jobless rate is and incomes are rising faster than they did at the same point in the s expansion the mainland also provides a broad based manufacturing platform that keeps u s companies competitive and their exports rising as ms wu noted on these pages last week china is americas fastest growing export market growing last year according to treasury hsbc estimates that processing factories which finish goods often made elsewhere in asia generate the vast bulk of chinas trade surplus implying that other parts of the mainlands economy are running a trade deficit china also runs a trade deficit with its asian neighbors for china trade with the u s has helped underpin a revolution in the standard of living particularly in the coastal cities cars computers and apartments are common now for an emerging middle class the rising prosperity is spreading to the countryside too since rural incomes have been growing faster than in urban areas put all this together and free trade is helping china emerge and integrate peacefully into an increasingly globalized interdependent world chinas creaking financial system remains the biggest threat to the mainlands economy state owned banks dominate lending and they are piling up a new stack of nonperforming loans as the economy expands regulators have been slow to open up key sectors to foreign competition and have failed to liberalize the capital account to allow chinese investors to allocate money more efficiently add a weak rule of law superficial intellectual property protections opaque financial disclosure and rampant corruption and theres plenty to complain about as washington is doing in four cases it has filed with the wto but the u s cant dictate the pace of chinese liberalization and protectionism will only retard the progress by weakening economic reformers in beijing this week in washington the chinese delegation will try to explain all of this to u s audiences including congress and president bush but americans need to hear it from their own leaders too the way to blunt congressional protectionists isnt to adopt their arguments but to rebut them and point out the risks to our shared prosperity of a u s china currency war see related letter "letters to the editor currency speculation stabilizes free rate" wsj may
