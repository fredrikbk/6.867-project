an inventor in s gave tips on going from smart to rich the toughest part of inventing isnt solving problems its figuring out which problems are worth the effort "a few years ago an inventor patented a device that caused an electric motor to rock a chair " wrote raymond f yates in "now imagine if you will the sad spectacle of anybody too lazy to rock his own chair no wonder he could not make money if he had expended the same effort on something that was actually needed he might be wealthy today instead of being sadder but wiser " mr yates a self taught engineer inventor and technical writer tried to nudge other inventors in the right direction with his book " needed inventions " published by wilfred funk inc mr yatess book was a list of ways people could alleviate certain nuisances and defects of life and get rich for their trouble "we often see clever and simple devices for sale which cause us to chastise ourselves with some such remark as why i could have thought of that years ago and made a lot of money with it certainly you could have but you didnt " the purpose of his book he said emphatically was "to suggest where to start " today years later mr yatess docket is a reminder of the many ways the world has changed in a lifetime and the ways it hasnt "we have bells on typewriters for indicating the end of a line but nothing to indicate the end of a page " he noted other needed inventions in the s "a mans garter that can be cleaned" and "bullet proof insulators for telegraph poles hunters seem to take great delight in popping off the green glass insulators now used " yet the world still lacks as mr yates called for a cure for the common cold not to mention "a bathing cap that will not leak and yet will not fit so tightly as to cause a headache " if you made a list of the inventions you thought were needed you would also be painting a profile of yourself "invention is really a systematic form of criticism " mr yates wrote and people tend to criticize the things that annoy them in their daily lives mr yates for example seems to have found most commonplace devices excessively noisy a few of his inspirations a noiseless washing machine a noiseless lawn mower a noiseless cafeteria tray a noiseless toilet a noiseless valve for radiators a method of laying wooden floors so they will never squeak a bed spring that doesnt squeak an automobile door that will never rattle a noiseless typewriter that is truly noiseless and repeating himself as he occasionally did a device that can be attached to typewriters that will prevent noise i would also bet that mr yates smoked a pipe as he makes several clever suggestions for improving the experience a pipe that will clean itself during the process of smoking a match that would keep flaming on a windy day long enough to light a pipe shaving was obviously not one of mr yatess favorite moments "the perfect answer to the shaving problem is yet to be devised " he lamented suggesting "shaving soap that could be sprayed on the face " while mr yates recorded most of his inventions in no particular order he did make a top list that proves he wasnt a trivial thinker his top three needed inventions all concerned energy a way to transform energy into power with less waste a more efficient way to store energy and better light bulbs fourth was perfection of rapid transportation including possibly "magnetic levitation as a means of overcoming the problem of friction " others were better televisions "a personal television receiver that would fit into a vest pocket" artificial or transplantable eyes for the blind and a cure for cancer published during world war ii his book had many ideas for military applications such as "free machining heat and wear resisting steel bars for machine gun barrels " also "a machine gun that would fire wooden slugs from a cartridge belt for boys who like to play with war toys " mr yatess son brock yates an author and free lance writer who covers the automobile industry recalls in an interview a "wonderful father" who tinkered in his basement as a boy and an adult in addition to science his father who died in at the age of was interested in colonial history antiques and restoration the elder mr yates did smoke a pipe his son says and he may have become sensitive to noise from his years of living in new york city mr yates had some odd ideas "a slot machine that will deliver ice cream cones" and "hotels are in need of an article that will quickly and efficiently peel bananas " but some of his visions were on the money "a means of automatically setting pins in a bowling alley that will entirely eliminate the use of pin boys" "individual saliva ejector for dentists" "a safety match box that must be closed before the match can be struck" and "a means by which the essence of tea or coffee can be crystallized so that it can be readily dissolved in hot water " now as mr yates exhorted his readers "get your thinking cap on ideas today royalty checks tomorrow " email me at cynthia crossen wsj com carol hymowitz is on vacation
