as sleepy sectors stir economy may wake up without consumers prodding economic growth in the u s has hit its slowest pace in four years and only brisk consumer spending has kept it from falling more with retail sales slumping in april is the economy headed for trouble surprisingly economists say the answer is probably not consumer spending might be flagging but parts of the economy that were a drag in recent quarters may be regaining traction that suggests stronger growth not recession lies ahead it also suggests the federal reserve will be in no hurry to cut interest rates indeed it has even got some economists predicting that the feds next move when it comes will be a rate increase the consumers supporting actors turned in especially weak performances in the first quarter housing construction plunged business investment was tepid the trade deficit widened and government spending added little oomph consumers increased spending at a inflation adjusted annual rate but economists expect the pace to decelerate to around this quarter as home prices have stagnated or declined in many areas over the past year consumers have sharply scaled back the amount of money they borrow against the value of their homes through "cash out" mortgage refinancing and home equity loans this has deprived many consumers of financing streams that were increasingly being used to pay for renovations or separate purchases so the prospects for a near term rebound depend particularly on business investment and exports there are reasons for optimism including a favorable inventory scenario heres a snapshot of each inventories as the economy cooled last year many companies found themselves with excess stock particularly home builders car makers and the suppliers that depend on them the result was a sharp pullback in inventory accumulation that now appears to be over a development that portends production increases business inventories declined in march although still above year earlier levels they were above year earlier levels in august inventories in the languishing auto industry are running below year earlier levels the u s commerce department says one big exception is the u s housing market inventories of unsold homes are still near historical highs depressing new home building elsewhere though it appears that the beginning of another inventory building cycle will contribute to growth "inventories are probably pretty flat now " said mike englund chief economist at action economics a boulder colo research firm "i think were at the turn " business investment capital spending on plants buildings machinery and software is a big wild card it went south toward the end of last year and remained soft in the first quarter executives seem to have grown cautious as the housing slump has deepened and the outlook for productivity and profit growth has become less certain but so far this year profit growth hasnt sagged quite as much as some anticipated leaving many businesses with hoards of cash they can steer to capital purchases if the mood strikes noting plans by cable companies and telecommunications firms to increase capital spending federal reserve governor frederic mishkin last month predicted a rebound in business investment this year "business balance sheets are strong and although profits have slowed profit margins remain elevated " mr mishkin said "the continuation of a moderate economic expansion is likely over time to restore confidence and lead to a firming in business investment " temporary factors may have depressed spending earlier this year a federal rule limiting diesel emissions for example likely contributed to a drop in orders for heavy trucks and related parts in march though orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft jumped after declining the previous two months more recent indicators have pointed to a resurgence in manufacturing activity and industrial production that suggests business investment which accounts for roughly of economic activity may be picking up "its not to say the great mystery of why business spending has been soft will be solved but its getting better " said drew matus a lehman brothers economist trade strong global growth together with the recent weakness of the dollar have created what should be an excellent climate for u s exporters most economists chalk up the decline in exports in the first quarter to a statistical fluke that will soon be undone in iowa al jon inc a manufacturer of machines used by scrap metal and solid waste removal facilities has completed a &# million expansion to keep up with export demand the company used to make machines a year now it will be able to make one a day michael senske chief executive of pearson packaging systems a spokane wash maker of assembly line packaging equipment expects export shipments "to increase dramatically in the second and third quarters " to be sure the inventory reversal will likely only provide a temporary jolt and rebounds in business investment and trade arent a guarantee of solid growth as jan hatzius a goldman sachs economist puts it dont assume the "subtraction of minuses " such as fading drags from weak inventory buildup or residential construction will automatically yield overall growth rates above especially if the housing market continues to be a drag
