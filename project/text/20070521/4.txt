americas a circus but no bread "the characteristic feature of the market price is that it tends to equalize supply and demand " ludwig von mises "human action " the venezuelan government will seize control of radio caracas television on sunday finally making good on a threat to silence one of the countrys most important independent news sources it is no coincidence that this is happening at a time when venezuelans are suffering a shortage of key foodstuffs free speech protections in venezuela have been steadily eroding for the past eight years and most other television stations already practice self censorship with the expropriation of rctv there is only one other independent voice globovision left standing this assault on free speech has even provoked criticism by the organization of american states which has been silent about president hugo chavezs many other offenses against democracy having built his claim to legitimacy on the spurious assertion that he presides over a democracy you can bet that mr chavez would not have gone after rctv unless he deemed control of tv news vital to his survival it may indeed be the reason is because the economy has been so mismanaged that a crisis now appears unavoidable how it will end in rationing and hunger or hyperinflationary madness is hard to say but when the whole thing comes a cropper the last thing the president will want is tv images of popular protests that could be contagious from the earliest days of his presidency mr chavez made it clear that he intended to vastly expand the states economic power in he started politicizing the state owned oil company pdvsa and hollowing out its professional engineering and marketing staffs shortly thereafter he took to expropriating farms factories and apartments when venezuelan money began to flee he slapped on capital controls more recently he has forced international oil companies to hand over venezuelan operations and surrender majority control he has nationalized the largest telephone company and the most important electricity utility he is now threatening to take over the banks as government takings always do these assaults on property rights have badly damaged output and investment yet the harm has been greatly compounded by three other pernicious policies price controls profligate government spending and inflation of the national currency the bolivar heres how chavez economics "works " as petro dollars pour into state coffers the government takes them to the central bank to get new bolivars printed which are then pumped into the economy through government spending mr chavez has also been regularly increasing wages the result is a consumption boom under free prices too many bolivars chasing too few goods would produce inflation that would show up at the supermarket checkout counter but price controls make that impossible instead serious shortages are emerging free prices are to an economy what microchips are to a computer they carry information as austrian economist ludwig von mises explained in his legendary treatise years ago it is free prices that ensure that supply will meet demand when mr chavez imposed price controls he destroyed the price mechanism and so it is that the venezuelan egg is now a delicacy the chicken an endangered species toilet paper a luxury and meat an extravagance white cheese milk tuna sardines sugar corn oil sunflower oil carbonated drinks beans flour and rice are also in short supply the reason is simple producers have no incentive to bring goods to market if they are forced to sell them at unprofitable prices ranchers hold back their animals from slaughter fisherman dont cast their nets food processors dont invest in equipment and farmers dont plant those who do produce find it makes more sense to take their goods across the border to colombia or to seek out unregulated black markets importers also have little incentive to work these days even though the country needs food from abroad some things like wheat are not grown in venezuela other products like milk sugar and potatoes are imported to supplement local supplies but the chavez government has made it difficult to buy a dollar at the official exchange rate of bolivars and if an importer has to buy dollars at the market rate of bolivars it is impossible to make a profit under price controls even imports not subject to price controls can be difficult to find since import permits and licenses as well as dollars are hard to come by this is putting a crimp in more than just the food supply according to local press reports some of the countrys air fleet has been affected by delays in getting spare parts and the automotive industrys supply chain is hampered by a lack of access to dollars earlier this year hospitals began complaining that the servicing of medical equipment has been delayed because spare parts are not available hospitals are also reporting shortages of medicines for diabetics antibiotics and hypertension drugs price controls on construction materials have damaged the reliability of supply to stock the state owned grocery stores called mercal the chavez government goes shopping abroad with dollar reserves of course mercal shelves are often bare as well moreover some enterprising government employees seemed to have learned something about market economics the venezuelan media is reporting that mercal supplies are turning up for sale just across the colombian border where market prices prevail venezuelan policy makers cant be this dumb the intention is not to feed the country but to destroy the private sector and any political power it might still have in this environment survival independent of good relations with mr chavez is nearly impossible in the revolutionary handbook capitalist producers and importers who buy things from the imperialists will be replaced by socialists living on cooperatives that will feed the country the only trouble is that that effort is not going well as jose de cordoba reported on the journals front page on thursday lack of knowledge equipment incentives and organization have left the co ops "mostly a bust so far " to end the shortages all mr chavez would have to do is lift the price controls but with inflation already running above he no doubt fears the price jump that would follow much safer to seize rctv and accelerate the consolidation of the military dictatorship when the crisis comes the chavistas will be ready
