seeking new ceo some boards skip the stars directors enter negotiations with limits on pay perks on tap backup candidates last september directors of sharper image corp ousted its founder and chief executive officer richard thalheimer after two years of losses and a long sales slump then they set out to replace him without paying big bucks even if that meant forgoing potential stars in march the specialty retailer landed an experienced outsider named steven a lightman without giving away the store mr lightman years old formerly ran a direct marketing unit of charming shoppes inc his contract at sharper image lacks some typical ceo perks such as a supplemental pension and is "a very good example of where the board did the right thing " suggests mark reilly a chicago executive compensation consultant with no ties to the company sharper images experience is out of the ordinary boards seeking outside ceos as corporate saviors often become enamored with a single candidate then give deals that pay well even if performance suffers "when they find the person they think will make a difference the cost is immaterial " says pearl meyer a new york pay consultant who advises boards by contrast sharper image directors passed over certain contenders as too expensive entered talks with pay targets in mind identified back up candidates and hired savvy lawyers to negotiate the final details and the sharper image boards approach is starting to spread "i see an emerging trend of boards growing backbones" by offering outsiders less generous contracts mr reilly says he cites george jones the latest ceo of borders group co whose unvested stock options and restricted shares will be worthless even if he quits for good reason including in his contract involuntary relocation or is terminated without cause another example j edward coleman the new ceo of computer maker gateway inc received one fifth as many stock options as his predecessor did the year he joined initially sharper image directors "wanted a god " recalls jerry w levin an investor and turnaround specialist appointed chairman and interim ceo following mr thalheimers dismissal shortly after beginning the ceo search board members asked mercer human resource consulting to analyze the ceo compensation at retailers similar in size to sharper image which had revenue of &# million in the fiscal year ended jan based on mercers findings mr levin told the board in january it should be prepared to pay an annual salary of &# to &# an equal amount of potential bonus and roughly stock options a year he said directors needed to offer "the higher end of that range" to attract any of their top three contenders all current or past ceos of publicly traded corporations identified by recruiters korn ferry international the potential price tag dismayed board members "everybody raised their eyebrows " remembers morton e david chairman of the nominating committee and former ceo of franklin electronic publishers inc "nobody was happy with the numbers" amid sharper images declining revenue he explains "money was an issue for some people it was the prime issue " directors decided to seek alternative candidates who had not run public concerns and likely would cost less mr david says they gave mr levin authority to offer such a candidate "materially less" than a seasoned public company chief would have demanded at a january dinner party in tucson ariz mr levin was seated next to mr lightman who had headed catalog and online retailer crosstown traders inc until selling the closely held concern to charming shoppes in he stayed on as president until resigning from charming shoppes in january of this year his extensive direct marketing experience persuaded mr levin to woo him for sharper images no spot mr lightman could have ignored the overtures he says he made more than &# million from crosstowns sale and "was looking at several other ceo positions " however the chance to revive a well known consumer brand intrigued him he says he informed mr levin that he preferred a "pay for performance" deal that would provide him with "modest" severance if things didnt work out he trusted mr levin "to bring me a fair package " he continues during a feb lunch at an italian restaurant in tucson mr levin handed mr lightman a handwritten outline of a pay deal it offered a &# salary a &# bonus this year and stock options intended to cover three years of awards in the fiscal year ended jan mr thalheimer had been paid &# in salary no bonus and was granted stock options to bolster his bargaining position mr levin had lined up two backup prospects and discussed compensation terms with one candidate mr levin says his experience on the other side of the table negotiating his own contracts as ceo of sunbeam corp coleman co and revlon inc helped him deal with mr lightman mr lightman objected to only one item on mr levins list he wanted sharper image to cover his hotel meals and travel costs for four months rather than three to give him more time to find a home near sharper images san francisco headquarters directors agreed they employed two outside attorneys experienced at negotiating ceo contracts to hammer out a final agreement a pair of tucson employment lawyers advised mr lightman a new executive severance plan largely crafted by mr levin lists reasons for which the board can fire mr lightman for cause including minor infractions such as negligent defacement of company property he collects two years salary and part of his final bonus as severance if he quits for good reason for example in his case a salary cut unless most other top officers experience a similar reduction or relocation of his principal place of employment more than miles from san francisco "the severance plan is tough but fair " mr lightman says mr thalheimer had been guaranteed a supplemental pension of at least &# a year plus a &# million severance payment under his contract directors could have terminated him for cause and withheld the promised sum only after a felony conviction or similar serious misdeeds directors nevertheless chopped more than &# million from mr thalheimers severance to offset his windfalls from favorably priced options a december regulatory filing stated the retailer later restated financial results for three fiscal years and the subsequent quarter ended april following an internal review of option granting practices mr thalheimer pocketed &# million in severance &# million in retirement benefits and a &# office allowance last month he declined to comment about his exit package or the completed option probe "this is where i want to be " mr lightman said on april the day he moved into the corner office fixing the loss ridden retailer could take a while however first quarter sales for the period ended april fell to &# million the company reported on may mr lightman hired a new finance chief last week and pledges to "share my vision for the company" when he releases its delayed annual report later this month the new ceo is content with his pay deal if sharper image flourishes "i will be amply rewarded " mr lightman says but "youre not entitled to get an unlimited percentage of the company for not performing "
