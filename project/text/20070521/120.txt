the doctors office nursing homes help patients but burden family doctors facing more liability risk and unpaid work ben brewer decides he needs to scale back online edition "we have a nice home that we worked all our lives for im not going to a nursing home id rather die first " said my patient punctuating her convictions with a whack on the armrest of her wheelchair severely arthritic affected by a stroke blind in one eye and diabetic my patient required around the clock care she tried home health but she was too much work for the caregivers she fired her visiting nurses and then pleaded to have them back she was convinced her family was plotting against her the last one to see the obvious she relented after she was hospitalized for pneumonia and was too weak to get to the bedside toilet since she moved to the nursing home she hasnt fallen her diabetes is under better control and she isnt abusing laxatives anymore the home is where i now see her not every doctor provides nursing home care anymore its hard to balance an office practice hospital work and trips to the home while im going to continue to care for my patients who are in nursing homes or move to them ive decided i need to scale back when it comes to new patients in nursing homes when a patient of mine requires nursing home care i visit them there new patients have to be evaluated in person within hours of admission then every days for the first three months then every two months if the doctor doesnt get there in time the nursing home can be cited for a violation by the state inspectors right now im a couple of weeks behind on rounds at one of the homes and caught up at the other three i try to make my rounds on days when my office is closed for holidays or when the weather is too bad in the winter to leave town several times a year if im behind on my visits ill go on nights or weekends i get multiple faxes or calls from the nursing home daily they call after hours if someone falls or is found sitting on the floor even if there is no injury or if the nurse makes a medication error or if someone appears to be getting sick any time of the day or night they send orders to be signed in duplicate for everything theyve called or faxed about all of this results in a significant amount of uncompensated care meanwhile my elderly patients are living in their homes and independent living settings longer these days that means the patients in nursing homes tend to be sicker and less medically stable making more uncompensated work and more liability risk for the doctor last year i made visits at four different homes i continue to do it because in our rural area the homes have a real problem with access to doctors and i have about patients living in nursing homes i have mixed feelings about the decision not to take on new nursing home patients as i believe patients get better care if a doctor who knows them is available for questions otherwise the doctor on call or the medical director of the home a contract staffer directs problems to the emergency department this drives up the cost of care with unnecessary hospitalizations and extra testing the homes rely on medical directors for supervising medical affairs at the home but thats a job thats often more liability than its worth after a local home was fined by the state for failing to notify a doctor promptly about a sick patient none of the doctors at the hospital wanted to be the medical director i decided the liability climate had become too risky even though id done the job at another nursing home before they paid &# per month to take calls when other doctors didnt answer their pagers take new patients that no one else wanted and attend staff meetings expanding community services seem to help keep the elderly in their homes longer however our hospital recently shuttered its home health services unit citing high costs and low utilization an adult daycare service also failed financially in the last few years for many nursing homes remain the only viable option without primary care doctors involved in nursing home care there will be a deficiency in basic care leading to higher costs and decreased quality unfortunately were moving toward the day when its as tough getting a doctor to the nursing home as it was getting my patient there
