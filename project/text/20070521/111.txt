selling detergent bottles big shrink suds makers challenge convince consumers less isnt really less laundry detergent brands are about to face a messy marketing challenge convincing consumers to pay the same old prices for about half the detergent by the end of this year detergent bottles across the board will shrink by almost that is the result of pressure from powerful retail chains such as wal mart stores which are eager to fit more bottles on shelves and detergent makers desire to cut their production costs instead of simply putting half the detergent in a smaller bottle though makers including market leader procter &amp gamble unilever and henkel have come up with more concentrated detergent the companies say consumers will be able to wash the same number of loads with half the detergent but the trick is selling that notion to shoppers in some ways it is a safe move for the detergent makers because all the major brands are making the move in lock step come next year shoppers simply wont be able to find giant bottles of the major brands anymore still there is huge potential for consumers to be confused and even irritated which could lead to headaches for the companies "people will be mad washing machines will overflow and people will call customer hot lines a lot " says bruce cohen a consumer products strategist for consulting firm kurt salmon associates "these companies have to hold their hands and really explain whats going on " in the age of suvs club stores and super size fast food consumers have become conditioned to think bigger is better when it comes to detergent moms and dads for years have believed more suds mean a better chance of getting rid of grass stains and spaghetti sauce blotches this isnt the first time in recent years detergent makers have downsized their bottles some niche brands have done it and unilever in late rolled out a triple concentrated option called all small &amp mighty but the idea took on a whole new dimension earlier this month when p&amp g announced it would make the switch with its entire detergent portfolio p&amp g accounts for more than half of the &# billion u s liquid detergent market according to euromonitor international inc its five brands include market leader tide as well as gain and cheer the company is rolling out the new detergent regionally beginning with the south in september the rest of the industry including unilevers all and wisk brands henkel owned purex and church &amp dwights arm &amp hammer and xtra is following suit so if for example a retailer now sells a ounce bottle of tide that washes loads of laundry in the suggested retail price range of between &# and &# it will soon be ounces but will still wash loads of laundry and still carry the same suggested price range retailers are pushing the big shrink in detergent bottles because when their shelves are full with smaller bottles they lose fewer sales to products being out of stock and less employee time is spent replenishing product retailers also save on transportation costs because more of the smaller bottles can fit on a truck meanwhile manufacturers which over the past two years have been hit hard by high oil prices save on the petroleum based plastic packaging as well as the costs of shipping to retailers unilevers all small &amp mighty has done well so far selling &# million in detergent since its launch but it has benefited from being personally promoted by wal marts chief executive lee scott as one of his favorite examples of a green product most detergent makers arent loudly touting the green friendliness of their new smaller bottles instead p&amp g for one plans to emphasize claims that its concentrated formulas are more potent than what they are replacing says alessandro tosolini the companys vice president of north american fabric care during a market test in cedar rapids iowa p&amp g ran a tv ad that introduced all its brands new shapes and highlighted the potency of the new formulas "ultra small and ultra powerful so one small cap can get your whole wash clean " a voice over crooned also playing a critical marketing role the humble bottle cap marketers are divided on how it should be designed with the new bottles henkels purex and unilevers all have narrow lids to pour into p&amp g and church &amp dwight on the other hand say that a cap with a broader base and shorter sides is helpful in convincing consumers that they need a smaller amount and is easier to balance "its less likely to get on their hands and theyre less likely to miss when pouring " says kevin kuchinski vice president for fabric care at church &amp dwight see related letter "letters to the editor just what we dont need smaller detergent bottles" wsj may
