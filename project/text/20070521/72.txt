eurolinks daily view cardiologists warning may be health alert for glaxo online edition cardiologist steven nissens analysis linking the widely used diabetes drug avandia to a potentially increased risk of heart attacks is bad news for glaxosmithkline plc used to treat type diabetes the drug last year generated world wide sales totaling &# billion about seven million people world wide have taken avandia including about a million currently taking it as anna wilde mathews reports dr nissens analysis issued by the new england journal of medicine was based on data gathered from public sources and combined studies a form of research called a meta analysis it showed a higher risk of heart attacks and a elevated rate of cardiovascular death though this result didnt meet a standard statistical test for significance the results of a meta analysis arent considered as strong as those stemming from a single large clinical trial in addition dr nissen didnt have access to the companys raw data so he couldnt analyze them in some important ways still he calls the analysis "very concerning " adding "a doctor should consider these findings in deciding whether to use the drug " cardiac dangers are especially serious for diabetics who already have a sharply increased risk of heart disease officials from glaxosmithkline and the u s food and drug administration said monday that other evidence

changes monday raising prices for chinas exports of steel and metal products as further steps to trim its surging trade surplus the moves will clearly be too narrow to have much effect as andrew batson reports but more targeted export taxes and other actions might offer more potential according to li jin and shan li in a commentary on our opinion pages china could consider levying environmental and energy taxes on its exports to properly account for the burden of the export sector on the environment and energy consumption mr jin assistant professor of finance at the harvard business school and mr li former ceo of bank of china international argue that the real solution to what they see as a short term imbalance isnt to focus on the yuan exchange rate a solution they call suboptimal because it addresses the terms of trade rather than trade itself rather they say if both the u s and china move one step back and focus their negotiation on trade rather than exchange rates they might find ample room to restore the trade balance amicably specifically the u s could consider loosening restrictions on technology exports to china where u s companies are losing out to their japanese and european competitors they say though the u s harbors reasonable concerns about limiting military use technology exports to china there are vast areas of nonmilitary use technology exports particularly environmental protection and energy efficiency technologies that china desperately needs china could also actively invest its newly generated trade surplus directly in the u s in the form of foreign direct investment they say since this prevents the trade surplus from entering chinas financial markets and fueling the oversupply of domestic liquidity it also helps create jobs in the u s
