this years survey timing was especially important in when stocks took investors on a roller coaster ride of wild jumps and dizzying falls as concerns about interest rates and the economy waxed and waned the dow jones industrial average surged nearly points in the first five months of the year only to give back most of those gains before mounting a powerful rally to record highs in the second

nuvelo inc while he rated it a buy and scored with a sell rating as the stock plunged more than at the end of the year "we are not going to be day traders " says candace browning head of research at merrill lynch &amp co but if analysts are "convinced that theres going to be a move in a stock they need to call it " thats precisely what merrill lynch analyst michael linenberg did with prescient calls that lifted him to the no spot among airline analysts a six time winner in these rankings mr linenberg in july downgraded several stocks to hold from buy he felt airlines had had a good run and were due for a breather in september he switched his tune and issued buy recommendations the results speak for themselves amr corp the parent of american airlines inc which returned during the year

although there are many ways to rank analysts including popularity among institutional investors this survey is strictly quantitative and based solely on stock picking skill the data were compiled verified and reviewed by thomson financial using a scale that gives credit for timely buy and sell recommendations every analyst whether a well known veteran at a major wall street firm or an unknown rookie at a small regional firm had to meet the same requirements and was subject to the same standards this years best on the street analysts are featured in the articles and listings in this edition of the journal report while the big wall street firms with dozens of analysts scooped up lots of awards many of this years winners came from small research firms in places like plainsboro n j west conshohocken pa and independence ohio "weve seen the growth of smaller more specialized research shops and i think every year were going to see more and more of them " says mike thompson director of research at thomson financial "the industry is changing " one force behind the emergence of smaller research firms increased demand from hedge funds and private equity firms such investors "are creating a lot of economic incentives that are leading to new research companies " says mr thompson analysts at these small firms often found under the radar companies that offered opportunities for

tracking small companies was key to sidotis success started in with just eight analysts sidoti follows only companies with market values of less than &# billion founder and chief executive peter sidoti says his firms analysts try to avoid the pitfalls of small stocks with shaky fundamentals by never recommending stocks that arent profitable sidoti analysts also pay close attention to a companys cash flow relative to its stock price a strategy that was successful in "that may be why we did well because thats whats worked well in the market " mr sidoti says several firms that performed well in previous years were tripped up by last years volatile market a g edwards &amp sons a unit of a g edwards inc the no firm with nine awards a year ago fell to no on this years list with just three winning analysts citigroup inc which ranked second a year ago sank to th place credit suisse a unit of credit suisse group standard &amp poors corp a division of mcgraw hill cos and j p morgan chase &amp co which rounded out the top five a year ago all failed to place in the top in this years survey greg sigmund director of research for a g edwards says the st louis firms analysts were overly cautious heading into the second half rally that sent the dow industrials to new records "in the face of a strong market in i think we may have been a little too conservative " he says while the firms buy calls performed well last year he says there were a number of hold ratings on stocks that also put up strong returns warning investors when to avoid a stock can be as crucial as urging them to scoop up shares morgan keegan &amp co s laura champine placed sell ratings on home furnishing retailers bombay co and pier imports inc which helped propel her into the no spot in the specialty retailer and services category morgan keegan is a subsidiary of regions financial corp rick murray who last year was an analyst with raymond james &amp associates inc a subsidiary of raymond

extremely difficult to time the market average investors trying to move quickly in and out of stocks often get taken to the cleaners numerous studies show the best bet is to invest in a broadly diversified basket of stocks and let it sit for years moreover rapid buying and selling of stocks can have onerous tax implications and trading expenses may pile up hurting overall returns "if you keep paying those expenses it really adds up " says russel kinnel mutual fund research director at morningstar inc "thats why people like warren buffett are buy and hold investors "
