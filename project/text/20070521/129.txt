traffic jam as meth trade goes global south africa becomes a hub cape town gangs trade rare shellfish for drugs chinese russian ties cape town south africa welcoming a visitor to his apartment on the outskirts of this city igshaan "sanie" davids wore only silky maroon boxer shorts festooned with brightly colored ducks and the slogan "totally quackers " his ample belly sloping out far beyond the waistband tattoos of the statue of liberty the american flag and the u s dollar adorned his arms and back knife and bullet scars pitted his body mr davids is a leader of a cape town street gang called the americans south african law enforcement officials say the gang initiates its members with rites that twist the meaning of u s symbols its motto is "in god we trust and die we must " members say their handshake ends by placing the right fist over the heart in what they describe as a variation on u s citizens reciting the pledge of allegiance "were businessmen always rolling " mr davids said these days he said about the best business going is tik south african slang for methamphetamine gangs can obtain the drug or its ingredients from chinese sources in exchange for abalone poached from south african waters say south african officials and mr davids the china south africa connection is one example of the unlikely alliances some dealers are making as the methamphetamine trade expands globally south africa has become a significant market for methamphetamine with government statistics showing an explosion in the drugs use centered in the cape town area it is also an emerging smuggling hub as ingredients for the drug make their way from asia and other places to wealthy countries such as the u s local and western officials say while cocaine and heroin may come to mind more readily as drugs smuggled across continents methamphetamine and its ingredients also travel circuitous routes in part because the u s and other countries have revved up methamphetamine control efforts since u s state and federal laws have restricted the sale of cold medicines that contain pseudoephedrine a "precursor" chemical used to make methamphetamine mexico and hong kong have also cracked down on trade in precursors "we now see precursor chemicals from india and china being rerouted through new places like cairo and south africa before going to mexico " karen tandy head of the u s drug enforcement administration said in a speech last year once in mexico the precursors feed the "super labs" that make methamphetamine and supply american users u s law enforcement officials say south african smugglers have sent precursors to russia disguised as luxury bath salts and to australia secreted in bottles of chardonnay according to government communiques and officials familiar with the intercepted shipments cargo sent to mexico from china via the south african port of durban contained about boxes of electric fans which hid more than three metric tons of a methamphetamine ingredient according to interviews with law enforcement officials and a u s government statement south africa has several attractions both as a market and as a trade hub for drugs incomes are higher than in most of africa it enjoys the banking and transport systems of a developed nation with direct flights around the world and efficient seaports telephone and internet service is reliable at the same time the country suffers from an "overloaded criminal justice system straining hard just to deal with street crime " the u s state department said in its international narcotics control strategy report this year its long borders are porous and crime syndicates from eastern europe asia and elsewhere have gained a foothold since the fall of apartheid methamphetamine and its chemical cousins are used by million people world wide more than heroin and cocaine combined according to the united nations office on drugs and crime an estimated million americans reported using methamphetamine at least once in the previous months according to government data methamphetamine a cheap and powerful stimulant that is usually smoked gives users a surge of euphoria confidence and libido the u s government describes methamphetamine as an addictive drug that can cause mood changes violent behavior and with long term use permanent psychological damage one corner of the trade can be found in the cape flats a vast and crowded patchwork of townships slums and squatter camps just outside of cape town this is where the apartheid government once forced "colored " or mixed race people and blacks to live while the city itself home to south africas parliament was reserved almost exclusively for whites law enforcement officials describe the "americans" as the largest of the cape flats street gangs and mr davids who is colored as a powerful gang lord he regularly appears in gang stories in the local tabloids often on the cover headlines or photo captions frequently refer to him simply as "sanie" or "sanie american " in interviews mr davids at times declared he has abandoned all illegal activity and now earns his living through a construction business but at other times he described in detail how he trafficked in methamphetamine and when pressed on his largest current source of income he said "tik is bigger than everything " the americans gang has its own interpretation of the american flag according to mr davids and other gang members the red stripes on the flag stand for blood and killing whereas the white stripes symbolize the clean work of making money the stars stand for the gangs "senators " leaders in the cape flats many neighborhoods recently a man who gave his name as nigel came to mr davidss home sat down on his living room sofa and handed a wad of cash to one of mr davidss close associates in return while mr davids sat across the room watching nigel received a clear plastic bag of a white crystalline substance which he inspected carefully before putting it in an opaque plastic bag an associate later identified the substance as methamphetamine the gangs have access to a valuable natural resource the haliotis midae species of abalone that teems along south africas coast considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac in china hong kong and taiwan the shellfish can fetch more than &# a pound in asian retail markets according to south african law enforcement officials south africa has declared the species protected and placed quotas on harvesting it but poachers face little risk of getting caught and usually only small penalties if discovered law enforcement officials say poachers even dive for abalone near robben island about miles from cape town where nelson mandela was imprisoned for most of his years of captivity cape flats street gangs organize teams of divers who can harvest a ton of abalone in as little as a day that amount can fetch nearly &# from chinese syndicates known as triads in the s the triads began supplying the gangs with methaqualone a sedative once marketed in the u s as quaalude and known in south africa as mandrax as mr davids tells it in he gave his chinese contacts samples of mandrax which they chemically analyzed and then procured by the next year he says the chinese were flooding the market with mandrax often trading it directly for abalone today triads based in hong kong are a major supplier of methamphetamine and its precursors according to law enforcement officials and some gang members along with south africas national police an elite investigative unit called the scorpions that reports to the national director of public prosecutions pursues organized drug rings mr davids says the triads sometimes barter methamphetamine directly for abalone the transaction is convenient for both sides and hard to trace because no money is involved mr davids says if he has &# worth of abalone and trades it for methamphetamine he can turn around and sell the drug for &# "for two days more work i make an extra rand " or about &# he says mr davidss life has been marred by frequent violence he says gunmen tried to assassinate him last year while he was driving his children to school an account confirmed by law enforcement officials he almost never goes out to movies or other entertainment says his longtime girlfriend razia abdullah "hes got a lot of enemies " she explains during his own rise to power mr davids says he killed "about seven" people one of mr davidss older brothers was murdered and his younger brother faces charges in the murder of two men last year mr davids and his brothers attorney said a plea bargain was being negotiated but the protracted legal trouble has not been cheap mr davids said he was funding his brothers top drawer legal team at a weekly cost of the equivalent of about &# due every monday last year south african police arrested a chinese man ran wei who now faces trial for illegal possession of abalone according to a person with detailed knowledge of the case seized accounting records documented abalone purchases totaling about &# million over less than three years mr weis lawyer michael sun says his client has pleaded innocent and denies wrongdoing "abalone is quick money i like it more than anything else " says mujahid daniels he and his brother in law raqeeb "ricky" oaker are reputed leaders of junior mafia another gang in the cape town area but they couldnt be more different from mr davids also in their mid s messrs daniels and oaker dress like models they operate a trendy nightclub barmooda where they say they dont allow any illegal drugs in an upstairs office they monitor patrons on sleek computers hooked up to surveillance cameras when they see someone suspicious or an attractive woman they click on the image to magnify it the junior mafia doesnt have nearly as many members as the americans say law enforcement officials but its client base is wealthier in interviews messrs daniels and oaker denied being involved in illegal activity and said that while they started the junior mafia they arent involved now later mr daniels acknowledged trading in abalone and mr oaker said he smuggles diamonds both men come from the cape flats and now live in a middle class suburb called observatory after two taiwanese gangsters were murdered in mr daniels was accused of ordering the crime allegedly to avenge an attempt to kill mr oaker during the trial two witnesses against mr daniels were murdered mr daniels denied any involvement in the killing of the witnesses and was acquitted of all serious charges in the taiwanese gangster case mr daniels says "making your own tik and selling it" is one way to profit but dealing in precursors to methamphetamine is also lucrative "whoever controls ephedrine controls the market " he says speaking generally law enforcement officials say gangs may act as middlemen between foreign suppliers of precursors and south african labs that cook up the final drug south africas pharmaceutical and chemical industries imported more than kilograms of the precursors in the last year for which full figures are available according to the south african police service some precursor chemicals get diverted to the illicit market according to a report released this year by the vienna based international narcotics control board mr davids says he works with crooked managers at some south african pharmaceutical companies which he didnt name to obtain the precursors and supplies the chemicals at a profit to makers of methamphetamine officials play down the diversion issue deven naicker national head of antinarcotics for the south african police service acknowledges diversion takes place but says it is "not to a very large scale " maureen kirkman head of scientific and regulatory affairs for the pharmaceutical industry association of south africa says ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are "very tightly controlled " south africa has mounted serious counternarcotics efforts it has shut down large illicit methamphetamine laboratories and it has operated a precursor chemical monitoring program since it is also the only country in southern africa that participates in project prism the international campaign to control specific methamphetamine precursors according to jonathan lucas who heads the southern africa regional office of the united nations office on drugs and crime mr davids says some methamphetamine hes involved in trading doesnt stay in south africa but gets exported to europe and america some smugglers hide the drug in decorative doors featuring african carving obscuring the scent from sniffer dogs with coats of primer and varnish he says however the main shippers of drugs to other countries from south africa are international syndicates officials say three officials said a sophisticated ring is currently shipping precursors through south africa to mexico via other countries including the congo the shipments include chemicals diverted from a south african pharmaceuticals company and sent to the congos capital kinshasa packaged as legitimate cold medicine two of the officials said in april a joint russian south african sting operation shut down a ring that allegedly sent more than kilograms of ephedrine to russia often packaged with bath oils and soaps officials in both countries say south africa wants to extradite an alleged ringleader a russian living in south africa who is reportedly a member of the hells angels biker gang according to an official with knowledge of the case the russian denies
