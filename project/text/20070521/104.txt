politics &amp economics political device goes corporate washington political veterans increasingly are taking their mastery of sophisticated new campaign techniques into the corporate world the latest is white house political director sara taylor a year old data whiz as a top strategist and number cruncher for the bush cheney re election effort for instance ms taylor helped perfect political "microtargeting " a system for squeezing votes from neglected segments of the electorate based largely on reams of data about such things as voter demographics and personal spending habits experts say there is potential for introducing lessons learned on the campaign trail to the corporate sphere "theres a value add to bring to the business world" from recent campaign cycles says bruce newman a professor at chicagos depaul university and editor of the journal of political marketing microtargeting was originally developed by corporations and their marketing experts and businesses continue to make sophisticated use of consumer data to tailor offerings political operatives say they have honed the strategy by simplifying and speeding up the analysis process using it to more effectively zero in on voters emotional triggers and concentrating more closely on finding potential new supporters not just retaining current ones these refinements were largely pioneered by the bush cheney camp in and that model is being embraced by both republican and democratic candidates in the race some experts caution that the techniques of campaigning arent sure fire a temple university professor kevin arceneaux says he found that one microtargeting campaign last year actually made targeted voters less likely to support the intended beneficiary a democratic candidate for the state house in pennsylvania but ms taylor and other veterans of see a big future for taking their data mining lessons back to the business world particularly in helping corporations focus on potential customers core feelings about buying a product or service ms taylors departure friday after eight years with president bushs political team had been anticipated she says she is choosing from several private sector employment options where she expects to put her campaign skills to work "microtargeting lets you pinpoint not only the issue an individual cares most about but also what it is about the issue that is most likely to motivate the person to support a candidate " ms taylor says "that could be true of a corporations products too " some private sector types say that data improvements have helped the best political marketers become as good as or even better than top business marketers still "i wouldnt say that the political space is more advanced than the corporate space " says michael fassnacht of chicagos draftfcb advertising agency campaign people say the high pressure nature of elections has forced them to simplify their processes and speed up results a typical corporate campaign might aim to move a products market share by two or three percentage points over a quarter a national political campaign with its enormous stakes and relatively short timeline might have to move its candidates market share by points or more in a matter of weeks in swing state new mexico mr bush gained points among latino voters in compared with in part by playing to concerns about education the issue was getting little attention at the time but ms taylor and others spotted it as a concern among that demographic political campaigns also have proved adept at homing in on the emotions that ultimately motivate people including positive feelings and negative ones such as fear and dislike "you look at the people you have to motivate and what motivates them and sometimes its a negative message " said blaise hazelwood another veteran of the bush cheney campaign who served as political director for the republican national committee she set up her business grassroots targeting in offering research to campaigns she has begun branching out to corporate clients including a major airline indeed some marketers and experts say corporations increasingly are embracing that approach they point to apple inc s ad campaign featuring a young hipster representing its mac computers who mocks a nerdy guy representing personal computers using microsoft corp software to be sure negative messaging can be a dangerous weapon for corporate marketers because of the risk of alienating existing and potential customers but in an increasingly global and competitive marketplace "somehow you have to differentiate yourself " says mr newman of depaul another difference between the campaign and corporate worlds is that businesses have to keep making sales day in and day out so theyre more constrained in the claims they can make there are even tougher legal restrictions on businesses about the validity of claims notes peter swire an ohio state university law professor veterans of the bush cheney campaign also believe their experience finding and delivering new voters is a particularly promising niche even what party a voter supports can be useful as a marker for whether that person is a potential buyer of a product ms taylor says others see much potential for cross pollenization between political and corporate marketing another group of bush cheney veterans including voter contact director adrian gray has formed a business that aims to create social networks around products and brands to supplement traditional mass marketing it is modeled in part on the campaigns huge sophisticated volunteer network "im finding theres tremendous interest in applying very creative approaches" from the campaign trail says ken mehlman the bush cheney campaign manager who recently left the rnc to tend to corporate clients at law firm akin gump strauss hauer &amp feld llp those approaches include not only microtargeting but better integrating a campaign message into multiple levels of marketing such as ads and web videos as well as better use of the web to respond to crises
