the daily fix curlin wins thrilling preakness but his win is the belmonts loss online edition on saturday at pimlico street sense and jockey calvin borel once more came from behind racing to the front of the pack at the homestretch the rest of the story seemed set street sense would capture the preakness and three weeks of debate would begin anew was this the horse that would capture the belmont and deliver a triple crown for the first time since affirmed in or would the extra distance scuttle street senses dreams as it has so many but it was not to be another horse was coming up hard too and curlin whod stumbled coming out of the gate beat street sense by a head in a thrilling finish hard spun was third the same three horses topped the kentucky derby with street sense the winner and curlin to show "one can watch hundreds of races at every level of the sport without seeing a horse do the things that curlin did in the last half mile of the preakness " andrew beyer marvels in the washington post "the colt had stumbled coming out of the gate and didnt get a chance to display his natural speed this may have been a blessing in disguise because the leaders were setting a torrid pace a half mile in seconds " while the three horses put on a great show the belmont will now inevitably be diminished street senses trainer carl nafzger said saturday that hed bet against street sense running in the belmont and hard spuns camp was noncommittal in the new york times joe drape wonders if street sense and curlin are beginning a great rivalry reminiscent of that between affirmed and alydar theres the travers stakes and races against older horses culminating with octobers breeders cup classic but there are reasons to skip the belmont "street sense is not only the derby victor but he was also the year old champion already he is worth perhaps &# million as a stallion prospect " but can it be a great rivalry without the third leg of the triple crown the los angeles timess bill dwyre is frustrated "the sport of horse racing is certainly a different animal " he writes "everybody involved preaches the need to do things to help it but just about everybody involved is an independent contractor whose first interest is in helping themselves " what the sport needs he writes is a commissioner "somebody paid for by the industry as a whole and given major power in it had a person with vision and foresight been in place saturday this is what he or she could have done with the knowledge that these three horses are all for real all special the commissioner could have quietly visited the three trainers curlins steve asmussen street senses carl nafzger and hard spuns larry jones the commissioner could have told each that were the top three from the derby to finish that way again and it be a fairly compelling and competitive race he or she would release a statement immediately afterward that statement would say that all three had agreed to do everything possible to get their horses to the belmont so the rivalry could have another viewing there could have even been a news conference after the winners session quick fast all three trainers nod agreement to this commitment contingent upon the post preakness health of the horses instead what happened was that each was predictably and understandably noncommittal about the belmont " in detroit the anaheim ducks were trailing the detroit red wings with less than a minute to play in game of the western conference finals a series tied at and then pow a deflected goal from scott niedermayer sent the game to overtime and then wham into overtime teemu selanne delivered the winner and the ducks led the series in the los angeles times helene elliott relives that fatal moment for detroit as the wings andreas lilja muffed a pass and the puck wound up on the stick of mr selanne just feet away from goaltender dominik hasek "selanne had no time to think " she writes "in truth he didnt need to ponder his next move not after having scored regular season goals and in postseason play over nhl seasons a right handed shooter he went to his backhand and sliced a shot that was high and sweet and true " in the detroit free press mitch albom begins with that first goal "the puck hit the stick shaft and flew up in the air it kept going fluttering like a caffeine laced butterfly over the top of a bewildered dominik hasek and into the net before the goalie could make even a late swipe with his glove goal forty seven seconds left officially on the clock you couldnt draw that shot in a laboratory hit stick fly up go over goalie forty seven seconds " to continue the detroit newss john niyo tells the tale of the unfortunate mr lilja who stoically endured all the questions afterwards insult to injury mr lilja scored his first ever playoff goal not that it mattered later "his teammates knew better than to say anything " mr niyo writes "theres a reason the losing locker room is silent after a playoff overtime game in the nhl and this is it when you lose its because somebody screwed up " a mournful mr lilja contributed this piercing quote "its a pretty short trip between hero and disaster " a great game and unlike the finale between the ottawa senators and buffalo sabres people got to see the whole thing in the miami herald david j neal explains that the sens sabres game on saturday exceeded the three hour slot nbc had for it threatening to cut into the walk up to the preakness and got flipped to versus "nbc found itself forced to commit heidi iii the icemen disappeareth " he writes "the succession of decisions that led to an nhl peak moment tumbling to a low moment demonstrates why the nhl is where it is in terms of tv visibility in the u s " the san antonio spurs beat the phoenix suns friday night to close out an emotional controversial western conference semifinals series and less than hours they were hosting the utah jazz in the conference finals spurs jazz no problem the washington posts michael wilbon writes that the jazz "found that beating the rag tag golden state warriors in the second round is nice but the spurs are an entirely different beast bigger stronger more experienced more resourceful more disciplined better coached " thats part of an appreciation for a team he sees as on the verge of being nba royalty "the names change but the results dont it used to be david robinson sean elliott avery johnson and steve kerr now its manu ginobili tony parker bruce bowen and robert horry the only constants are tim duncan in the hole gregg popovich on the bench and winning the san antonio spurs are now the team that makes black and silver look like championship colors " its practically a law of physics rafael nadal cant be beaten on clay until yesterday roger federer ended mr nadals astonishing streak at two years and matches beating his rival in the final of the hamburg masters "suddenly the french open which starts this sunday promises to be fascinating having been viewed previously as yet another coronation for the king of clay for the past two seasons " writes mark hodgkinson in the age adding "only rarely over the years could a world no beating a world no have such shock value but that was a reflection of the hold that nadal has had over federer on clay the claycourt rivalry between roger and rafa is now a proper rivalry of course as federer knows beating nadal in a roland garros final will be a much bigger ask would federer have beaten a fully functioning nadal yesterday perhaps not nadal will refresh himself and will be a different opponent if they meet in paris plus it would be best of five sets " tip of the fix cap to reader sean dougherty found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to
