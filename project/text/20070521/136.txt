are high in energy can be good for pigs and cattle mr funderburke says trail mix often contains chocolate and dried fruit which supply sugar and nuts which provide fat and protein but too much fat and salt from foods like potato chips can depress animals appetite and cause them to eat less that isnt good for producers who want to pack as many pounds as possible on their animals in many places

spread across the country in ethanol producing states some farmers have been able to mitigate high corn costs by feeding their animals dried distillers grains a corn mash left over from ethanol production but in states without ethanol plants distillers grains arent always readily available also many farmers say the product lacks sufficient nutrients others say their animals dont like the
