the morning brief chinas dual roles for private equity online edition the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here the investment of &# billion of chinese foreign reserves in private equity powerhouse blackstone group is only the most headline capturing aspect of the much broader role china plays in the buyout boom to look back at just the past couple of years of private equity deals a succession of one blockbuster eclipsing another is to see a variant of inflation at the corporate purchase price level a reflection of all the money out there seeking higher returns of investment and a lot of the liquidity is provided indirectly by china a more direct role emerged over the weekend with news that china will use &# billion of its roughly &# trillion in foreign exchange reserves to buy a stake in blackstone a move that coincides with blackstones planned &# billion stock market listing as the financial times and the wall street journal report that follows the chinese central banks moves friday to tighten interest rates and raise banks capital reserves an effort to rein in runaway economic growth at home and nominally loosen limits on how much the yuan can appreciate each day against the u s dollar all this comes ahead of a high profile trade delegations trip to washington this week and the journal notes the blackstone deal and continuing investment in u s entities "could help restore some equilibrium to chinas accounts with the u s " viewed through another facet of the global finance prism the blackstone deal gives china a more overt role in a private equity environment it has sort of been underwriting for some time the private equity juggernaut is being driven by several factors particularly low yields that have resulted from excess global saving and liquidity the organization for economic cooperation and development says in a report out today and the low yields which have allowed hedge funds and other investors to use leverage to buy higher yielding assets "risk pushing leverage and equity prices in parts of the corporate sector to excessive levels " the oecd says "as the leveraged buyout process moves into its mature phase deal multiples are bid up in the industries and companies where the activity is concentrated the strong growth of capital available to private equity resulting from strong investor demand together with readily available finance increases the pressure to find new deals " this in turn drives down investment yields into line with interest rates the oecd also considers too low and "as this process continues it becomes more risky " where is all this liquidity coming from last year for example the biggest source was china in the months that ended in january china accumulated &# billion in reserves bringing its total then to just over &# trillion the recycling of most of those reserves into u s treasury bonds is a major factor keeping u s interest rates low and that has helped the private equity groups pursue a wealth of corporate operations that once might have seemed out of bounds as for the risk the oecd says "it is important here not to shoot the messenger as some pundits are wont to do " asserting that "private equity is a source of change and market efficiency " but it warns private equity firms to "stress test their ability to cover" a change to "more normal levels of interest rates " it encourages the lending banks and financial intermediaries that thrive off the private equity boom to stress test their exposure as well and to "maintain strong credit checking processes even if" they shift debt from their balance sheets to other investors through derivatives and other means and it suggests "there may be some role for private equity industry bodies to help with transparency by better clarifying fair and reasonable rules of the game " another big buyout this time in wireless in yet the latest record price for a private equity deal goldman sachs groups buyout arm and tpg capital agreed last night to pay &# billion for wireless operator alltel a deal the wall street journal notes is the biggest such foray into the wireless business "the deal could signal still more ambitious gambits by buyout shops which have shown increasing interest in telecom and wireless assets " the journal adds the buyout consortium plans to pay &# per share for the fifth largest u s wireless operator about a premium over alltel shares closing price on friday there had been speculation about alltels future for months since alltel a conglomeration of regional carriers put together in a series of acquisitions said earlier this year it was weighing various options for its future as the new york times reports but "it is unclear how alltel shareholders will react " the times says "in recent buyout attempts shareholders have sought to reject deals in hopes of pushing the buyers to pay more " new spark in the tinder box of lebanon the lebanese army this morning tightened a siege around the palestinian refugee camp outside of tripoli where militants thought to be allied with al qaeda launched an attack yesterday and the standoff has all the ingredients of so many factional confrontations and the ugly civilian endangering violence they sparked that have torn apart lebanon in the past government troops were pounding

that seem to leave lebanon permanently on the brink of one civil war or another "while anxious not to seem weak in the face of the militant challenge military experts say the government and the military also want to avoid any scenes that might draw comparisons to the israeli attacks on palestinian camps in the west bank and gaza " the times says lebanese citizens yesterday were cheering on
