shipping lines push rates rising cargo costs may hit retailers and manufacturers shipping lines are working to turn the tide on freight rates this year with potential implications for retailers manufacturers and others heavily dependent on overseas cargo last year overcapacity contributed to declining rates for containerized shipping in which primarily manufactured goods ranging from clothes to electronics to toys are packed into or foot long metal boxes and loaded onto enormous container ships that reduced costs for many importers but resulted in lower profits for many shipping lines including market leader ap moller maersk and caused losses for others higher fuel costs made things worse this year shipping lines locked in negotiations with their customers are pushing to maintain or even increase the rates they charge to transport goods from asia to north america the worlds busiest routes for containerized trade "shipping lines are holding very firmly to their positions without giving in to rate reductions " says sunny ho executive director of the hong kong shippers council mr ho expects to see a cut of no more than in rates although the council isnt a party to the trans pacific talks now under way some companies that buy from its members are and mr ho tracks progress toward new month rate agreements at least two shipping lines are pushing for single digit increases an executive for one of them said it has succeeded in raising its charges for the overland portion of shipments that arrive at ports on the west coast and then continue onward by train these so called intermodal shipments will now cost an additional &# per foot container to reflect the the higher fees that railroads are now charging the shipping lines this executive added that his company has reached agreement on about two thirds of its annual contracts so far shipping typically accounts for just to of the total cost of a container of garments or toys hauled from china to the u s or europe but major retailers and other shippers do their best to shave pennies off their rates to maximize their competitive position at home for historical reasons the trans pacific rates are set in annual negotiations between individual shipping lines and each of their customers currently the cost of shipping a foot container from hong kong to the u s can range from &# to the west coast to &# to the east coast via the panama canal to &# to the east cost using a faster overland rail connection from a west coast port rates from asia to europe tend to be set for a period of just three months so adjustments are more frequent than on trans pacific routes predicting freight rates is a challenge that defies a straightforward analysis of the supply and demand for shipping unlike shipments of iron ore and other bulk goods there is no spot market for containerized freight and freight rates like futures prices for oil and other commodities hinge on market sentiment the secretive talks have overrun their normal april deadline shippers and freight forwarders point to an overhang of shipping capacity and are demanding rate reductions shipping lines are digging in their heels one shipping line executive says his company is in a stronger bargaining position than in because its u s customers appear likely to run uncomfortably low on inventory ahead of the years peak pre christmas shipping season "its a little early to tell" how current talks are progressing says peter gatti executive vice president of the national industrial transportation league a trade group of shippers and other businesses that use shipping lines his group is on guard for attempts by shipping lines to pass on what it sees as excessive fuel surcharges and other ancillary fees because these fees are lumped together with the underlying freight rate to form a single all in rate quote shippers complain of a lack of transparency and suspect that shipping lines often add on ancillaries as "a disguised rate increase " mr gatti says shipping lines tougher talk comes amid a brightening outlook for their bottom line prices for the bunker fuel that ships burn have eased meanwhile on the revenue side demand for asian products in europe has surged even if the container lines dont succeed in their trans pacific rate ambitions higher volumes and freight rates for european shipments could offset any impact from a slowing u s economy and overcapacity of ships deployed on china u s routes "in our view the outlook for the container shipping industry has turned positive given expectations of stable freight rates and lower bunker costs " standard &amp poors said in a march investor note shipping routes from asia to europe are the worlds second busiest for containerized trade after trans pacific routes and theyre getting more crowded as european manufacturers take a cue from u s companies and outsource much of their production to china clarkson plc group a london ship brokerage forecasts that container traffic between asia and europe will grow by this year to million foot container equivalent units or teus that contrasts with an expected increase to million teus for shipments between asia and north america freight rates from china to europe are already rising investment bank ubs forecast in a february research report that asia europe trade rates would rise overall by this year before easing slightly to rise by in and again in
