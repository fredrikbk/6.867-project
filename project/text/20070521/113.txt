someone cried and ran it certainly wasnt me while i enjoy a good story as much as the next person who writes them for a living i have been disappointed to find myself misrepresented by a recent book in an anecdote that your review repeats may "tvs go go years get a closeup" jeffrey stepakoffs "billion dollar kiss" alleges that during a business pitch meeting for the tv series "dawsons creek " which i was working for as a freelancer i burst into tears and ran out of the room i did write two freelance episodes for "dawsons creek" over two seasons of the series but not only did i never have any contact with any of the studio or network executives on the show i have never cried in a professional meeting in my entire year show business career as i am currently seven and a half months pregnant i am not unfamiliar with personal expressions of emotion but this story simply never happened at least not to me it appears mr stepakoff has left show business written a sad attempt at a tell all and moved to georgia to lick his wounds i on the other hand have a movie i wrote called "the hottie and the nottie" coming out soon starring a young woman not unfamiliar with media attention herself paris hilton heidi ferrer santa monica calif
