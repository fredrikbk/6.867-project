retailers add risk in easing loan terms national retailers of big ticket items such as houses boats and motorcycles arent the only companies facing the prospect of more late payments and losses on their consumer loans these days so too are smaller regional retailers but unlike mortgage lenders which have been forced to tighten their underwriting standards amid the subprime meltdown these smaller players and even some bigger niche players are trying to encourage customers to keep buying by offering more zero interest loans and extended payment plans "at the end of the day you do what it takes to get business " says dennis fink chief financial officer of haverty furniture cos a home furnishings chain based in atlanta in the first quarter of loans that haverty made to customers were no interest for longer than months compared with a year earlier those considering investing in regional retailers need to closely examine their customer financing operations in some cases there is a risk that their loans could go bad in others easy loan terms are artificially boosting sales either way investors need to figure out how the underlying business is really performing and how the market is valuing it special financing enables customers to buy goods for a small monthly payment for retailers whose sales have been hit by higher gasoline prices and the housing slump these promotions improve marketing and sales growth but can also increase the risk to their own future finances and their loan portfolios credit quality "youre certainly going to lower the likelihood that customers will ever pay you " says stephen ryan accounting professor at new york universitys stern school of business like subprime mortgage loans which are for risky borrowers special financing promotions tend to "appeal to people who are cash constrained and have poor credit histories " he adds the possible upshot as with the subprime mortgage shakeout that has seen some of the loans go sour and pushed dozens of lenders out of business is that these easy consumer financing deals can go sour and weigh on the retailer making the offer the risk is amplified when companies extend payments further into the future for customers who have missed a monthly deadline a practice known as "re aging " it can also have the effect of making loans appear healthier than they really are for example re aging can allow a customer who is more than days late making a payment on a month loan to cover only the interest that month in exchange the company extends the lending period to months it then categorizes the account as current allegations of fraudulent re aging at conseco inc led to lawsuits and helped push the insurer toward its bankruptcy court filing in "we dont see re aging as a way of masking" delinquencies says william nylin executive vice chairman and chief operating officer at conns inc a year old specialty retailer based in beaumont texas which sells appliances electronics and furniture in stores in texas and louisiana "we see it as a way to allow customers to pay the loan out to maturity its our experience that you get a high percentage of payment " conns stretches out about of its loans to current status once every six months mostly boosting month loans for as long as months at the end of about of conns total loan portfolio was extended to riskier borrowers while the rest was to those with better credit histories conns says the loss rates on both its prime and so called secondary or riskier portfolio are both just that is lower than many big credit card issuers which are in the to range on friday conns shares fell cents or to &# in p m composite trading on the nasdaq stock market bringing its market value to almost &# million the share price is up about since the start of the year the stock has a relatively low valuation trading at times estimated per share earnings compared with for the broader retail sector according to thomson financial conns says it hasnt seen any deterioration in any of its loan portfolio even though it finances nearly of its sales to a mix of prime and subprime customers "there is no big housing slump going on in texas and louisiana right now " says mr nylin conns converts its receivables into securities for sale to bond investors but because it is a retailer and not a bank it isnt required to follow guidelines laid out by the federal financial institutions examination council for re aging and recording losses on consumer loans the council recommends that re aging occur not more than twice in five years on a loan and for losses on unsecured loans to be recognized if they are days late conns recognizes losses on its secured loans when they are days late "theres been an increasing trend to rely on the secondary portfolio and less on the primary portfolio to drive growth " says anthony lebiedzinski an analyst at sidoti &amp co which doesnt own any shares in conns mr lebiedzinski has the equivalent of a "hold" rating on the stock while conns does charge higher interest on the secondary portfolio "theres also higher risk " mr lebiedzinski adds
