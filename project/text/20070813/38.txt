how a company made everyone a team player american corporations love teamwork but few companies are as smitten as icu medical inc at the san clemente calif maker of medical devices any worker can form a team to tackle any project team members set meetings assign tasks and create deadlines themselves chief executive george lopez says hes never vetoed a team decision even when he disagreed with it these teams have altered production processes and set up a k plan among other changes teams have been in vogue in business since the s now companies are experimenting with different kinds of teamwork as competition and complexity increase and business problems cross departmental or geographic boundaries consulting firm accenture ltd has scores of globally dispersed teams serving clients teams at international business machines corp share information on internal web sites using "wiki" technology that allows collaboration online google inc assembles teams of three or four employees to assess new ideas most big companies assign teams for projects icu which has around employees is unusual in that it allows workers to initiate the teams its "rare that a company says go form your own team and go address this issue " says ben rosen a management professor at the university of north carolina chapel hill dr lopez an internist founded icu in by the early s the company had about &# million in annual revenue and was preparing for a public offering demand for the companys clave product used in connecting a patients iv systems was skyrocketing dr lopez needed to figure out how to ramp up production icu had fewer than employees but was expanding rapidly handling the booming growth and demand "was an overwhelming task for one entrepreneur ceo " says dr lopez years old he was still making most decisions himself often sleeping at the office then he had an epiphany watching his son play hockey the opposing team had a star but his sons team ganged up on him and won "the team was better than one player " says dr lopez he decided to delegate power by letting employees form teams hoping it would help him spread out the decision making and encourage input from people closest to the problems some executives hated the idea his chief financial officer quit putting the new system in place dr lopez told employees to form teams to come up with ways to boost production it didnt work with no leaders and no rules "nothing was getting done except people were spending a lot of time talking " he says after about a year and a half he decided teams should elect leaders which brought a vast improvement in he hired jim reitz now the human resources director who helped him create a structure with a minimum of bureaucracy they developed core values "take risks" and so called rules of engagement "challenge the issue not the person " at the same time icu started paying teams rewards based on a percentage of the cumulative salaries of their members it worked employees embraced teams today to teams finish projects each quarter often meeting once a week or so the typical team has five to seven members and the company allots &# quarterly to reward those that succeed teams have propelled changes over the objections of top executives dr lopez worried about the cost didnt want to institute a k plan but acquiesced after a team recommended one he now concedes the plan has helped in retaining employees dr lopez can veto team decisions but says he hasnt yet for teams to work employees need to feel they have authority he says a veto would "really have to be worth it " dr lopez says the team would have to be putting the company "on a pathway to destruction " so far that hasnt happened icus revenue grew last year to &# million though the company projects that revenue will decline this year its stock has climbed more than sixfold in the past decade many teams have delighted executives a few years ago don ramstead who planned manufacturing schedules at the time watched a forklift inefficiently shuttle parts back and forth between a molding site and a warehouse he talked with colleagues and proposed a team to reconsider the manufacturing process for the clave still one of the companys top sellers the team which ultimately included the director of manufacturing and the head of logistics in six months cut the process to nine steps from saving at least &# annually mr ramsteads cut of the reward was about &# dr lopez whose hobbies include competitive free diving which involves descending underwater as far as he can while holding his breath thinks the extreme team approach could probably work only in a company culture similar to icus "the way i created this company the employees sort of follow my personality and my personality is to be very competitive " he says "in a competitive environment this is what works best it allows these people to take control they can do as much as they want to do and can advance as much as they want " jeff polzer a harvard business school professor says teams generally amplify a companys culture healthy cultures tend to produce collaborative teams while divisive political cultures become more so the strategy can be effective as long as companies impose ground rules to prevent chaos says mr rosen of the university of north carolina but mr rosen and others say teams can also be inefficient and distracting it "has to be done in a culture where people understand they just cant blow off everything else theyre doing " he says at icu team members dont get a break from their regular jobs serving on teams is technically voluntary but some employees with special expertise are "requested" to join "its above and beyond your job " says business applications manager colleen wilder who has served on many teams in the years at icu "you still have to get your job done " the rewards can create tension ms wilder once balked at sharing a reward with co workers she thought had joined a team solely for the money she proposed dividing the money based on what tasks team members performed "i said you did nothing and i propose you get nothing " she says the team agreed the payment system has been changed to peg the size of the reward to the importance of the project "people started thinking we created a whole new product for the company and these guys painted the lunch room and theyre getting the same amount of money that we are " mr reitz says he encourages employees to question whether teams really met their goals or whether a project is significant enough to merit high reward levels over the years icu has instituted more rules to help teams function smoothly a group of employees created a page handbook that concretely spells out team operations for instance listing eight items for "what should we do at the first meeting " and addresses frequently asked questions teams must post notes of each meeting to the company intranet where any employee can offer feedback teams arent perfect but dr lopez says theyre better than the alternative a while back the information technology department ordered new laptops that many traveling staffers find too heavy "thats what happens when you dont form a team " he says "top down decisions are frequently wrong " rules of engagement icu medical provides these ground rules for employee teams challenge the issue not the person consider all options stand up for your position but never argue against the facts allow yourself the opportunity to seriously consider opposing views lose the words i and they once a decision is reached
