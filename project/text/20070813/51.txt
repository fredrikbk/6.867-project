new ceos may spur resistance if they try to alter firms culture employees who find themselves reporting to a new chief executive especially an outsider who has bought their company or been recruited to turn it around often face a roller coaster of changes new leaders typically reshape their senior executive team and the companys growth strategies the most wrenching adjustment occurs when a ceo changes the corporate culture the core values and ways of doing things that bind people to their jobs culture change may be what chrysler employees are bracing for as robert nardelli takes charge as ceo today mr nardelli who left his post running home depot earlier this year under fire for his rich pay package strategic stumbles and command and control management style says he will focus on executing a restructuring plan already in place but given his record its likely mr nardelli will quickly put his mark on the ailing auto maker during his six years at home depot he dismantled a culture in which store managers had great latitude to make decisions creating instead a highly centralized culture that stressed uniformity there were some pluses to his approach home depot had flagging sales and lacked automated purchasing systems when he arrived in after a long career at general electric mr nardelli upgraded systems and boosted profits but he also insisted that the company follow the procedures of six sigma a quality control system for eliminating waste managers complained they spent more time filling out forms than serving customers many felt demoralized and quit and they were frequently replaced by former military officers more accustomed to following orders mr nardelli also drew shareholder ire for the steep compensation he earned even as home depots share price declined at chrysler where his pay will be tied to chryslers performance he says he wants a relationship with veteran managers and union leaders that is based on "mutual trust " still chrysler now owned by private equity firm cerberus capital management llc must streamline operations even as it looks for new revenue opportunities the company has already announced job cuts as part of its restructuring and mr nardelli an efficiency maven may cut further meanwhile employees will be watching to see if mr nardelli understands that while chrysler is the smallest auto maker in detroit it takes pride in such accomplishments as having launched the minivan generally employees are more likely to support a ceo pushing strategic change if he or she doesnt at the same time run roughshod over their culture yet few new ceos take the time to learn about the culture they have inherited "they need to understand both the traditional purpose of a company and its philosophy or why precisely employees feel the work they do is important and how they believe their approach distinguishes them from others " says sheila margolis president of the workplace culture institute an atlanta based consultant "if a leader changes either a companys purpose or philosophy it will feel like a different place even if its name remains the same " what if a ceo believes changing a companys culture is necessary "if thats the case a leader needs to say clearly this is how it will be so employees can evaluate if the fit is right for them " says ms margolis "otherwise a resentful us versus them mentality sets in " and work quality and productivity deteriorate even ceos promoted from within must tread carefully when they make culture changes when ron sargent became ceo at staples five years ago he knew he needed to expand the company and better cement relationships with customers even though staples which had previously been run by its founder wasnt performing badly instead of suddenly changing work practices mr sargent polled employees about what was most important to them "we heard that people dont work here because they want to dedicate their lives to office supplies " he says "instead store associates said they mostly wanted to help others " that dovetailed with mr sargents goal to provide ever better customer service "whether someone sells eight of color black or of the blue folders doesnt matter nearly as much as making customers shopping experience easier " he says to nurture employees desire to do this he pushed decision making down the ranks launched training programs about products and began offering team based bonuses he also goes on the road frequently to gather information two weeks ago he visited stores in locations a typical schedule at every stop he asked employees what was going right and wrong among other things he learned that school locker accessories and a small rubber calculator are hot sellers and that staples gift cards cant be used easily online "its a glitch we have to fix and you dont learn things like this sitting in your office " says mr sargent staples now operates stores in countries up from stores in six countries when mr sargent took over and is the nations no online retailer behind amazon com "we do millions of sales transactions each week and im not involved in very many of them " he says "but theres a lot of power in our people at all levels believing in our culture " email me at inthelead wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj com forums
