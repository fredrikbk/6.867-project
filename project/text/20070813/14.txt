boss talk making paperless trails at lloyds under richard ward the london insurance market goes electronic gets less quaint london when richard ward joined londons storied lloyds insurance market as chief executive a little over a year ago he had a tough time understanding his new colleagues jargon heavy patter one thing wasnt muddled he knew he needed to modernize slapdash ways at the worlds oldest insurance market each day at lloyds thousands of insurance brokers shop for coverage on behalf of individuals and companies they bustle among scores of underwriters who sit in groups or "boxes " and write policies historically brokers and underwriters typically scribbled the rough details of policies for big ticket items like art tankers buildings or planes on slips of paper they often didnt bother to define key terms with the underwriters who write the policies in what mr ward calls a "deal now details later" culture lloyds is mutually owned by its "members" companies and individuals who are the insurers who underwrite the policies written in the market over the years these insurers have written coverage on everything from satellites and skyscrapers to betty grables legs and keith richardss hands they also acquired a reputation for being overly aggressive at times writing coverage on risks and at prices other insurers wouldnt this led to big losses during industry downturns that threatened to topple the market several times in recent decades enter mr ward a year old physical chemist by training with no previous insurance experience in his prior job as ceo of the international petroleum exchange now ice futures but still called ip mr ward had changed the company from an old fashioned market of haggling traders into an electronic trading platform at lloyds he is trying to replace paper with electronic processing and accounting in a letter to insurers last month he threatened to publish lists of people falling behind his targets and to potentially limit the amount of coverage sold by those who keep relying on paper slips lloyds insurers expect to write policies with up to &# billion in premiums this year but lloyds has to change mr ward argues because it faces more tech savvy insurance hubs growing in places like bermuda dublin and dubai at lloyds offices just a few blocks from the site of edward lloyds th century coffee house where the market started as a place for ship captains and merchants to trade coverage on wooden vessels and cargo mr ward talked over coffee with the wall street journal about being an outsider trying to update an icon excerpts follow the wall street journal what did you know about insurance when you took this job mr ward i knew very little about insurance apart from a dictionary of insurance terms that my colleagues gave me when i left the ip it was very helpful because id never come across a business with so many terms phrases and acronyms of which i had no understanding the amount of jargon was really quite extraordinary i remember one of the first conversations i had here there were literally or acronyms or phrases that i just didnt understand wsj does your experience running a derivatives exchange or as a scientist help mr ward this business is mainly about people managing change and risk when i think about my previous job it was also about understanding risk change and people as well that is a common thread with science its a bit more tenuous but my time as a scientist prepared me very well for my career in business it taught me to think and analyze problems in a disciplined way wsj how do you wage a war against paper in a place thats used paper for more than years mr ward the expression ive used is that if you want to eat an elephant the best way to do it is with a teaspoon what im saying is that if you take a big dig into it you will choke i look upon the lloyds processes as the elephant we have to take small bites out of that elephant to make sure we can digest the changes were making were taking small bites with things like electronic claims filing and electronic accounting and settlement we are sorting out the quality of contracts and introducing the checking of contract terms each is a small bite but when you put them together i do think they will have a significant impact wsj is simply making sure that insurers and customers agree on details before a policy takes effect one of the biggest changes under way mr ward i found it odd that we had this "deal now details later" culture the percentage of certain contracts is rising the latest figures have us at over now were moving toward what id call a quality assurance phase that is a process of contract checking to ensure we have the right terms in the contract and that those terms are checked before an insurer takes on the risk wsj will handling more claims and policies electronically avoid having brokers lugging so much paper around mr ward the first day i came to lloyds i was in one of these wonderful wall climber lifts we have a lady came into the lift with a suitcase on wheels i said "have you been anywhere nice " and she said "im afraid these are just claims files " now of claims are being processed electronically thats good progress but from where im sitting its never fast enough by the end of the year id like all new claims to be processed electronically you should see some of these claims files from the past the sheer volume of papers with post it notes stuck on them wsj how much paper is the market generating each day mr ward a colleague of mine in the it industry estimated were generating about four tons of paper a day thats all going down to chatham a london suburb in these white vans i think theyre white ive never seen one they dont have lloyds emblazoned all over them we try to keep them below the radar screen the target weve set ourselves is that by march we crush the vans and all of it is processed electronically we might have a symbolic crushing of a van and it might become a piece of art somewhere inside or outside the building that might be quite appropriate to do once weve reached our goals wsj what levers can you pull to fight resistance mr ward there is willingness and acceptance of the need for change here obviously delivering that change is difficult when you talk to the ceos they say "absolutely we need to do this " but its the execution that is harder and the disconnect sometimes between ceos and the people actually doing the work its not easy to change behavior and culture we could always fine people but im not that comfortable with that the name and shame or name and praise league table idea is on the table too you might say here are the best now where are the rest of you i like that concept wsj premiums are falling or softening which can lead to big losses down the road mr ward we cant afford to repeat the mistakes of the past i think were making progress its interesting to compare and for instance in we had over &# billion in claims from the world trade center terror attacks and we reported a loss of &# billion in hurricanes katrina rita wilma led to claims of over &# billion but we had an overall loss of just &# million that tells people who come to our market that we are more disciplined underwriters we are not a place where you put everything on black and and spin the wheel wsj is there a concern about updating lloyds without chipping away at iconic features like the underwriting room mr ward we must be very careful to not throw out the baby with the bathwater there are many things about lloyds that are frankly just superb starting with the lloyds brand itself weve got an underwriting room full of individual entrepreneurs their willingness to consider new risks and the speed with which they can understand and price new risks is unparalleled thats a lloyds ism we need to keep for instance i believe we will still have an underwriting room in years because of the complexity of the risks being placed and the lack of standardization in contracts if there is more standardization maybe through the use of technology maybe the time frame will shorten but i havent seen two placement documents that are the same wsj where will lloyds be in years mr ward distribution will be increasingly important we see more business being placed locally so we need more local presences around the world in singapore weve established a lloyds underwriting structure in china we have a different model but we are there we are looking at the middle east south america as well as india  tips from richard ward on modernizing an icon  start by studying the organization inside out  isolate problems you need to solve  reward early adopters of change and challenge the slow footed  protect features that drawcustomers and make the place an icon  set challenging targets and erect unique monuments like a crushed white van when theyre met
