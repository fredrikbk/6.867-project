king of the u n the secretary general of the united nations is properly addressed as "your excellency " not "your royal highness " ban ki moon appears to have forgotten that distinction recently in a couple of royal edicts issued in his name the issue is taiwan tricky diplomatic waters to be sure but ones that the worlds top diplomat ought to be able to navigate successfully of all people mr ban a former foreign minister of south korea itself a divided country ought to understand the sensitivities taiwan is not a member of the u n nor does it participate in any of its affiliated bodies on one level taipei can therefore count its blessings and were tempted to observe that the u s should be so lucky but its exclusion is nevertheless a mark of disrespect however for the past years taiwan at least has had the satisfaction of reminding turtle bay of its existence through an annual application for observer status or in recent years an even humbler request for a study group to be set up to study its status after a couple of hours of discussion the agenda committee of the general assembly always votes to reject taiwans request it undoubtedly would have done so again this year had it got the chance this year however taiwan decided to go for the gold and on july president chen shui bian wrote mr ban a letter applying for membership but instead of forwarding it to the security council as required under rule of the councils rules of procedure regarding membership applications mr ban took it upon himself to return the letter he said through his spokeswoman that it "could not be received " mr chen followed up on july with a second letter noting that "according to the rules of the united nations only the security council and the general assembly have the authority to review and decide on u n membership applications the u n secretariat does not have the power to decide on such matters " that letter was also returned in both cases the spokeswoman explained mr bans decision to reject taiwans application by citing resolution the resolution under which the peoples republic of china was given the seat previously held by the republic of china at a press conference in california on july mr ban observed that "the position of the united nations is that taiwan is part of china " oh really mr bans interpretation of resolution goes well beyond what the general assembly actually decided in the wording is deliberately ambiguous noting merely that representatives of the peoples republic are the "only legitimate representatives of china to the united nations " the word "taiwan" does not appear in any case it falls outside the authority of the secretary general to interpret resolutions as he wishes and mr bans actions are unprecedented not even kofi annan acted so imperiously if hes allowed to put his own interpretation on resolution does he or a future sg get to interpret and act on all other u n resolutions as well the united nations is a membership organization not a monarchy if its members wish to reject taiwan thats a bad decision but its theirs to make its not up to mr ban see related letters "letters to the editor the war of words heats up over taiwans bid for u n membership" wsj aug
