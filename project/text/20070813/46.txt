in subprime aig sees small risk others see more insurer bases its take on valuation models but analysts find fault aig might not want to whistle too loudly as it strolls past the subprime graveyard exotic financial instruments linked to subprime mortgages are showing huge losses in debt markets and weighing on companies from lenders to banks to insurers but not at american international group inc or so its executives say the insurance giant did its best to reassure markets late last week that it wasnt going to get slammed by the crisis gripping mortgage and debt markets although aig sees mortgage delinquencies rising executives said during an earnings conference call that the bulk of its mortgage insurance and residential loans arent at risk the company also said it didnt see problems related to a kind of insurance contract or derivative it has written against financial instruments that include some subprime debt aig based its all clear signal for those derivatives on the fact that its internal models show that losses are extremely remote in the portions of the investment vehicles its insuring no likely losses means no reason to worry the company reasoned yet the companys valuation models seem to ignore the fact that those derivatives would likely take a haircut if sold in todays depressed market "theres no way these arent showing a loss " says janet tavakoli president of tavakoli structured finance inc a chicago research firm thats simply a market reality she adds that should be showing up in aigs results aig counters that it doesnt see any loss in the instruments value because they are insuring portions of financial vehicles that can withstand losses even under severe recessionary conditions "we disagree" with those questioning the companys valuation said elias habayeb chief financial officer for aig financial services a division of the insurer "i believe we come up with our best estimate of the fair value of these instruments based on all the information available to us and thats reflected in our financial statements " stock analysts seem satisfied by the companys response that there isnt a problem thats even though plenty of other companies in recent months have made similar claims only to see them upended by unprecedented developments in mortgage markets analysts at fox pitt kelton for instance said in a research note after aigs earnings that the instruments with subprime links were "the least likely to incur any losses in these deals " aigs share price rose cents to &# in p m composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange amid the subprime carnage that has seen financial stocks get slammed aig stock has held up fairly well accounting experts dont fault aig for using models to value the derivatives since there isnt a ready market for them but they also say aigs models need to take into account market conditions as well as investors views of the value and risks associated with a type of product the conflict over a slice of aigs books and subprime exposure underscores a bigger question facing investors are companies and investment funds realistically pricing hard to value securities or are they basing values on in house models that reflect wishful thinking that dilemma has taken on added urgency as investors try to figure out where mortgage losses may be lurking and as the securities and exchange commission checks to see if big investment banks are appropriately valuing securities both on their own books and for their customers accounts the issue goes to one of the most basic questions within financial markets namely how much is something worth that is often a difficult question for companies and fund managers when pricing securities that they arent actually selling even more vexing many securities linked to mortgages and other kinds of debt dont trade in organized markets like a stock exchange so prices arent easily available when markets turn sour valuing such securities becomes harder because buyers may disappear in aigs case the company says there isnt a market for the insurance contracts or credit default swaps in question because they are linked to particular pools of collateralized debt obligations investment vehicles that package debt securities often backed by mortgages the insurer said in a presentation accompanying its results last week that of the &# billion of such swaps it has written since about &# billion is linked to multisector cdos that contain a mixture of subprime debt aig said the portions of the cdos with subprime exposure that the swaps are insuring are "super senior" to other slices of those investment vehicles and that there are substantial loss buffers this means that in the event of defaults holders of lower ranked paper within the cdos experience losses well before aig since the swaps are derivatives aig has to mark them to market in each reporting period and record any gains or loses in their value as a charge or boost to profit the company says the value of the swaps on its books hasnt changed "significantly" since the first quarter or before mortgage and debt markets tanked aigs mr habayeb says the company records all its derivatives at fair or market values as per accounting rules in the models it uses to derive this fair value the company says it looks to the performance of the underlying assets expected losses credit ratings and interest rates as well as whats happening in the market ms tavakoli the research firm president argues that the drastic change in mortgage markets since april should gain greater weight in those estimates of value and that she says should result in aig showing some loss on the derivatives if that occurred the loss would be taken as a charge to profit the extent of any charge would be difficult to estimate even though it would likely be small compared to aigs recent second quarter net profit of nearly &# billion which was up compared with the same period a year ago it would let investors better gauge aigs subprime related risks
