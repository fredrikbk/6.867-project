the evening wrap no crunch in china online edition at a time when many investors are hoping central bankers will face down a credit crunch with interests rate cuts and cash injections officials at the peoples bank of china must feel theyre a world apart with the countrys inflation growing at its fastest pace since chinas central bank is under pressure to raise interest rates for the fourth time this year inflation data for july released monday by chinas national bureau of statistics showed a jump over the same month last year the cost of food led the charge with a significant contribution from the spike in the price of some meat and a nearly rise in egg prices over the summer amid popular unease over food prices premier wen jiabao has appeared in official photographs visiting meat markets as central bankers in europe and japan on monday were injecting fresh cash these inflation numbers added to speculation that chinas central bank will look to tighten its own money supply consumer price inflation may be the foremost factor fueling predictions that the peoples bank will lift rates again but its hardly the only red hot element of chinas economic explosion the countrys benchmark stock index which recently moved past the mark has already gained so far this year while increased foreign investment and mortgage lending have also added fuel to the economys brisk growth as chinas inflation moves higher and the prices of export goods also increase trade with the u s and other major markets is likely to feel the impact as things stand the prices of chinese goods have been climbing faster than at any time since the u s began tracking them separately in higher interest rates would likely lead to a stronger yuan that could help slow food price increases and in general give chinese consumers more spending power which if used on foreign goods would slow the flow of cash into an economy sporting a massive trade surplus surging food prices come at a politically sensitive time in china as the countrys elite prepare to meet this fall for the communist party congress beyond its domestic impact this once every five years meeting could lead to a shakeup at state controlled companies that in turn may lead to increase volatility in share prices as foreign investors with little corporate transparency to go on are left to speculate how the pivotal meeting will affect those firms since the last meeting in november more of chinas big state firms have floated ipos making this the first communist party congress with acute interest for global investors bush bids
