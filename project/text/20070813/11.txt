back to failing schools in a couple of weeks tens of thousands of underprivileged kids will head back to failing public schools in metro atlanta school choice proponents are eager to provide these students with alternatives but the local school boards wont let them welcome to another sorry example of the education empire striking back against reformers in the past four months there have been no fewer than charter school start up applications submitted in the atlanta area and all but two have been rejected school choice opponents employ many tools to stop reformers including capping the number of charters in a state and forcing charters to pay rent out of operating funds but one of their most effective weapons is simply restricting who can grant charters under georgias charter school law only local school districts have this authority and theyve made it clear that these alternative public schools are not welcome in dekalb county the local school board rebuffed indea snordens charter petition on the dubious grounds that it was submitted too late the school would have had a math and science focus and its rejection came after jim mullins the districts "charter liaison" and a vocal opponent of school choice spent months giving ms snorden the runaround try again next year she was told in june the atlanta school board spurned an application from ed chang a teach for america alum who wanted to start a charter that would target the low income black children who tend to be relegated to the citys worst schools mr chang told us his goal was "graduate every child" and so his enrollment model centered around not accepting more kids than he would be able to educate properly the board held that against him rejecting the application on grounds that it was too "exclusionary " and so atlantas black teens will return to high schools that have nearly twice as many freshmen as seniors to fully appreciate the lengths some districts will go to deny education choice its hard to beat what happened to nina gilbert last month ms gilbert wants to start a college prep charter school for girls in gwinnett county it would serve students who now attend schools where of blacks and of latinos graduated last year and qualified for free or reduced price lunches the first objection from the local school board was that the school model violated title ix gender discrimination statutes and that the district would invite lawsuits from civil rights groups like the naacp so ms gilbert produced a legal opinion that said single sex charter schools do no such thing and are permitted under federal and state law she also produced the head of the local naacp who supports the school and read a statement from the organizations state and national chapters that said they take no position on charters or single sex education and didnt appreciate the local school board invoking them as a reason to deny ms gilberts application the board finally acknowledged albeit grudgingly that ms gilberts school model complied with state and federal law but it still denied the application on grounds that an all girls school in its view was "not moral" and "just not fair" to boys the board also chided ms gilbert for such petty matters as omitting from her proposal the names of the bus drivers and bus monitors she would use to transport schoolkids as for the two charter proposals that were approved in metro atlanta both originated with the district itself which means that the schools unlike those proposed by ms snorden mr chang and ms gilbert will be extensions of the public school bureaucracy rather than the independent operations envisioned by the law and therein lies the problem "whats going on here is not only an argument against the public school establishment " says jeanne allen of the center for education reform "its also an argument for more charter school authorizers " in california arizona florida and elsewhere universities mayors nonprofits and others outside of the existing public school bureaucracy all have the power to authorize charters each of those states has hundreds of charter schools while georgia has only last spring georgia passed legislation that made education funding more equitable by requiring local school districts to begin financing transportation and food services for new charters just as they do for other public schools and legislation has been introduced to allow municipalities and universities to become chartering authorities for peach state pupils stuck in rotten schools these changes cant come soon enough see related letter "letters to the editor the appalling arrogance of public school officials" wsj aug
