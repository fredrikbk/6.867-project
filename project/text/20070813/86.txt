string of disappointments that is sapping the confidence of investors in the big drug companys long term growth prospects wyeth of madison n j which disclosed the agencys decision friday said it believes it will still win approval for bifeprunox but acknowledged it could take one to two years to address the fdas concerns and refile the application to the agency also friday wyeth and partner viropharma inc said safety concerns had caused them to stop giving a drug for hepatitis c to patients in a midstage study the companies will work with the fda to "determine the appropriate path forward " wyeth said the setbacks come after a bigger disappointment in late july when the fda issued what is known as an approvable letter which typically indicates the agency needs more information before it will approve a drug for wyeths experimental drug pristiq for menopause symptoms the agency called for a yearlong study to allay safety concerns related to the drugs effects on the heart and liver pristiq which is also under review at the fda as a treatment for major depression had been viewed as the strongest sales prospect among wyeths new drugs under fda review in april wyeth also received an approvable letter for osteoporosis drug viviant the company expects a new ruling on that drug near the end of the year wyeth terms the fda actions as "a temporary setback" and says in a statement that its "strong pipeline " including pristiq and bifeprunox "will have a positive impact on our long term growth " wyeth has defended pristiqs safety and said it doesnt expect the fdas concerns about the drugs menopause use to delay its approval for depression in early but many analysts believe pristiqs competitive prospects have been weakened while wyeths profits have been strong lately the string of bad news raises concerns over how the company will compensate for a future drop in sales of two of its blockbuster drugs antidepressant effexor xr and acid reflux drug protonix the pills accounted for combined world wide sales of &# billion last year about of the companys revenue and both are expected to face generic competition for the first time in the u s in or early

pipeline has been a chief reason investors have viewed the company as a safe bet in recent years in contrast to shares of other pharmaceutical companies struggling to develop new pills to replace aging blockbusters approaching patent expiration "this shelter has not been as secure as investors had hoped " said michael krensavage a drug analyst at raymond james &amp associates which has done noninvestment banking work for wyeth in the past year "the roof is leaking " the company has had some pipeline success this year winning approval for torisel a kidney cancer drug and lybrel a birth control pill but even with those drugs on the market and others pending fda review many analysts predict wyeths sales and profit will decline in or wyeth reported earnings of &# billion in up from the previous year on an increase in revenue to &# billion in addition to effexor and protonix top sellers include rheumatoid arthritis drug enbrel and the pneumococcal vaccine prevnar both products that wyeth expects to show continuing strong growth wyeth says the recent fda actions reflect "the current regulatory environment and the complexity of developing newer medications that treat more challenging disease states " just of new drug applications are approved during the fdas first review cycle the company says the fda puts the number at about for standard applications though the percentage varies from year to year ultimately about of new drug applications win marketing approval the agency says many in the industry believe the fda under scrutiny for its handling of drug safety issues has become increasingly cautious about approving new drugs still "wyeth is experiencing unique execution challenges " says jami rubin a drug analyst for morgan stanley neither pristiq nor bifeprunox has great advantages over drugs already on the market she says an issue that likely contributed to the fdas reluctance to approve them morgan stanley does both investment and noninvestment banking business with wyeth and both the firm and ms rubin own wyeth shares wyeth is also making big push in alzheimers disease and expects to move an alzheimers drug into late stage development this year alzheimers is especially challenging for drug development but "if the drug works it could be a potentially huge opportunity for wyeth " ms rubin says another worry for wyeth is generic drug maker teva pharmaceutical industries ltd which is involved in a legal battle against wyeth over protonixs patent wyeth is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop a potential launch of a generic version of protonix by teva and the israeli company has agreed not to move forward with a launch until a denial of the injunction or sept whichever comes earlier
