frequent flying small jets more trips worsen airport delays faa likes bigger craft but passengers airlines prefer busy schedules at p m last wednesday planes from all over were lining up in the air to land at new yorks la guardia airport over the next hour flights were scheduled to touch down but there wasnt room for them all thirty three arrived late one by three hours with runway space this scarce you might think that airlines would use big planes that can carry lots of people instead of those flights involved small commuter aircraft five of them were propeller planes the nations air travel system approached gridlock early this summer with more than of june flights late by an average of minutes the mess revved up a perennial debate about whether billions of dollars should be spent to modernize the air traffic control system but one cause of airport crowding and flight delays is receiving scant attention airlines increasingly bring passengers into jammed airports on smaller airplanes that means using more flights and increasing the congestion at airports and in the skies around them at la guardia half of all flights now involve smaller planes regional jets and turboprops its the same at chicagos ohare which is spending billions to expand runways at new jerseys newark liberty and new yorks john f kennedy of traffic involves smaller planes according to eclat consulting in reston va aircraft numbers tell the tale u s airlines grounded a net large planes from through but they added regional jets says data firm airline monitor as air travel woes have spread some aviation officials and regulators including the head of the federal aviation administration have begun saying delays could be eased if airlines would consolidate some of their numerous flights on larger planes just two problems with that one is that airlines like having more flights with smaller jets the other is that passengers like it too illustrating the phenomenon three airlines flying out of midsize raleigh durham n c send flights a day into la guardia all but one of the flights use small planes thats fine with david sink a durham insurance executive "there are lots of flights so time wise it worked out well for me " said mr sink recently taking an american eagle flight home given a choice between more flights or larger planes hed prefer more flights the faa once could tackle congestion by limiting the number of takeoff and landing slots but congress in voted to phase out slot requirements to open up the airways to competition from low fare carriers the faa sets a limit on how many takeoff and landings it can safely handle at each congested airport but airlines are free to schedule as they want if there are too many planes because of overscheduling or just delayed flights stacking up the faa slows down the flow of airliners at la guardia for example the faa allows aircraft movements a takeoff or a landing is one movement an hour for commercial airlines in good weather if high winds or storms drop that rate lower the faa asks airlines to cancel or delay flights and sometimes the bottleneck comes not on runways but in the air when planes from multiple airports are trying to get a spot on specific routes into or out of the area much of the traffic into and out of new york meshes together onto specific routes in the washington d c area when there are too many planes its like multiple lanes of cars squeezing into a two lane tunnel trying to tackle airport crowding the faa last year proposed a complicated plan to force airlines to increase the average size of the planes they land at la guardia faa administrator marion blakey questioning the use of many smaller planes and their more numerous flights says that "from the standpoint of passengers and from the standpoint of getting the best use out of high priced real estate this is not the way we should be going " but the faa plan encountered fierce opposition and is in limbo "a solution eludes us " ms blakey says smaller cities say they need the small planes in order to be connected to the nations transportation system only with smaller planes can a city the size of say madison wis have nonstop service to la guardia travelers of course much prefer nonstops for speed and reduced hassles airlines like the economics of small planes for one thing theyre usually flown by lower paid pilots and flight attendants from commuter subsidiaries or contractors smaller jets also let carriers bulk up their schedules without flying lots of empty seats the combination of smaller jets and more numerous flights makes airlines schedules more attractive to high dollar business travelers those regional jets planes with fewer than seats dont just flit to small towns airlines cram them into their big hubs too delta air lines flies regional jets between atlanta and both chicago and new york united air lines flies regional jets out of ohare to six cities atlanta st louis pittsburgh salt lake city montreal and charlotte n c all in the p m to p m rush three quarters of the flights between la guardia and toronto are on planes with fewer than seats the upshot flights a day all competing for a shot at a runway the small plane conundrum is at least in part a byproduct of the financial troubles of the airline industry after sept airlines grounded older larger jets that were gas guzzlers the big jets werent needed when traffic dropped dramatically after the terrorist attacks airlines substituted small regional jets subcontracting the flying now traffic is coming back but many airlines have deployed most of the widebodies they have in international flying which is more lucrative because it faces less price competition and because of their financial woes u s airlines havent been adding many large jetliners since domestic traffic by mainline airlines has increased in terms of revenue passenger miles which is the number of miles that paying customers are flown airline monitor says but traffic on airlines regional partners which fly the smaller aircraft is up the average size of jets flown by u s airlines including the widebodies on foreign routes is seats down from a decade ago meanwhile flight delays have worsened every year since according to the bureau of transportation statistics in the january june period four years ago just under of flights arrived on time in the comparable period this year only did the three big airports in the new york area are the worst for late flights but unlike in las vegas what happens there doesnt stay there new yorks delays cascade across the country a late arrival for one flight means a late takeoff for another which will arrive late in dallas or seattle or denver or a flight from orlando fla to pittsburgh might be delayed because the washington area regional traffic control facility moves a stream of new york bound planes to the west around storms clogging the route the pittsburgh flight would use the problems dont arise just in bad weather friday july saw good weather in most of the country but in whats called a ground stop the faa barred the takeoff of flights headed to newark too much volume forced controllers to keep planes waiting on the ground to take off sometimes for hours continental airlines says that in of junes days the faa imposed a ground stop or ground delay program on flights headed to newark in response to congresss mandate to phase out slot requirements the faa has completely eliminated them at kennedy and airlines have poured in more flights through may this year the number of passengers at jfk is up from a year earlier but the number of flights is up says the port authority of new york and new jersey which operates that airport la guardia and newark liberty flights using smaller planes leapt at jfk in that period says the port authority faa officials have reduced but not yet fully phased out slot requirements at la guardia searching for a new remedy the faa last year proposed minimum average sizes for the planes that fly into and out of la guardia currently planes using the airport average seats the agency says it proposed that airlines fleets would have to average to seats depending on how many of their flights went to small communities the faa estimated this plan would reduce delays at la guardia by "promoting larger aircraft is the only means to increase passenger access to la guardia " said the faa proposal but opposition from airlines and smaller communities was so strong that the plan is basically dead says the agencys ms blakey foes of the plan included the port authority which considers aircraft size at la guardia an airport issue the port authority says it could bring about larger planes simply by writing aircraft size requirements into gate leases it says its studying such an idea former american airlines boss robert crandall says congress should let the faa go back to controlling slots matching scheduling to capacity airport overcrowding is "fixable but its not fixable without major policy change " the former amr corp ceo said at a recent conference another proposal change the structure of landing fees airports now set them by weight a small jet pays a smaller landing fee than a large plane even though its use of the runway is the same why not charge a flat fee per landing suggest some economists or even charge the small jets more to encourage airlines to shift to fewer flights on larger jets yet another idea is to tie landing fees to the level of demand through the day so theyd cost more at peak hours this would encourage airlines to spread out flights and use bigger planes says dorothy robyn a consultant at brattle group and former aviation adviser in the clinton administration she says the current system "guarantees overuse of the air traffic control system because airlines arent charged the true cost " airlines say tinkering with landing fees which are only about of total costs wouldnt change their behavior because customers want the convenient service possible when they use lots of smaller planes carriers say less use of small jets would make it harder for them to offer off peak flights "we put regional jets into some markets because we dont have demand at certain times " says david seymour vice president of operations control at us airways group inc airlines add that less use of smaller jets also would reduce connection options for people on long transcontinental or international trips with its commuter affiliates using smaller planes us airways flies nine trips a day from la guardia to also congested philadelphia international airport there most passengers connect to other flights the arrangement allows us airways to offer new york customers more options for long trips carriers contend that without changing rules the faa could do a better job of moving traffic into and out of the northeast they note that jfk has four runways but usually only two are used at once the reasons are complicated and include a limited number of permissible flight paths as well as bottlenecks that can result in the washington area a push this year to use three jfk runways at once has had mixed results an almost decadelong effort to redesign the designated airways around new york to move airplanes faster and more efficiently is still bogged down in regulatory review neighborhoods that might face more noise have been trying to derail the plan in congress the faa says it is doing the best it can with old equipment and a surge in flights the agencys ms blakey says she thinks airlines will eventually have to switch to larger jets because of the costs that delays impose on the airlines in inefficient use of planes and fuel even such a shift wouldnt fix all the delay issues though she says "la guardia is always going to be a bottleneck " with delays climbing airlines face a tough choice unless the faa can boost capacity carriers have to accept delays or else reduce flight frequency not wanting to risk losing passengers to competitors airlines are showing scant interest so far in consolidating their numerous small plane flights into fewer flights with bigger planes on nov american airlines will offer new nonstop flights between new york and flint mich american will send a morning flight to la guardia and a flight back to flint at p m adding to the competition at la guardia for precious runway space the jets american will use seaters
