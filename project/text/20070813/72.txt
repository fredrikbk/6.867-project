the daily fix woods wins his th major despite daring challengers online edition tiger woodss decade long dominance of the pga tour has obscured the narrow margins by which he wins majors his first four grand slam event victories included blowouts by eight and strokes but since then hes never won by more than five yesterday woods clinched the pga championship his only major of the year by holding off ernie els and woody austin to win by two strokes columnists today celebrate woods for his tenacity "woods did a lot of memorably tough minded things over four days at southern hills " sally jenkins writes in the washington post "he solved an intricate bandbox par course that was not supposed to suit him tying the course record in the second round he survived the hottest major championship ever on record with temperatures in the s that beat down and left him so thoroughly sweat soaked he needed a full size bath towel to dry himself lastly he emphatically answered late charges on the back nine sunday from austin and els reducing the last holes to punctuation on his round of for a two stroke victory at under " the performance reminded st petersburg times columnist john romano of that of a club fighter "the tiger of today is not quite the same man he was a decade ago " mr romano writes "he is married his father has passed away and he has a newborn daughter the tiger of today is more reflective and less single minded and hes more interesting " the dominant woods might return and make things less interesting if he could solve his woes from the tee hes th on tour in driving accuracy minneapolis star tribune columnist patrick reusse with advice from teaching pro paul shepherd and other golf observers says woodss swing has suffered since he joined up with teacher hank haney "were dealing with more than paul the oldtimer and more than a minor touring pro in their anguish in seeing this version of the tiger swing " mr reusse writes "many others have talked about tiger getting stuck when he hits his driver and yet it matters not hes strong enough and flexible enough to get the club except the driver to the ball better than anyone in the world hes cutthroat enough to bury an opponent face to face or unflappable enough to survive any challenge that appears from elsewhere on the golf course " mr austin mounted the least likely challenge yesterday his foot putt for birdie on yesterday was "a career moment and it was electric " sports illustrateds gary van sickle writes "with that roar austin a former bank teller bartender and stockroom clerk a man who didnt make the pga tour until he was woodss current age let it be known that he had the worlds best player in his sights a native of tampa who lives in the big city lights of derby kan austin has fought the yips injuries poor vision and fear itself he once whacked a putter over his head so hard and so many times that the shaft bent over his skull certain viral video fodder if only youtube com existed a decade earlier but from now on he will be known as the daring runner up of the th pga championship " lets have more daring challengers requests mark cannizzaro in the new york post "golf needs more players to step up and show theyre unafraid of making a run at the worlds best player there are too many players like stephen ames woods playing partner in yesterdays final pairing who talk themselves out of challenging woods before the first ball of the round is struck ames whos a bit goofy by nature sat in the press room saturday and when asked about the historical negative effect being paired with woods in the final round of a major has on players said he expected the same would probably happen to him well it did ames who was defeated before he had dinner saturday night shot a final round and might as well have been the standard bearer carrying the pairing scoreboard around " and fewer cliches please requests fellow post columnist phil mushnick "locked into their unconscious habit of trying to sound like erudite urbane brits american sportscasters when dropped off at golf tournaments get goofy " mr mushnick writes he never again wants to hear "if he successfully negotiates this bid for birdie he will have authored a " toronto star columnist chris zelkovich meanwhile has his bone to pick with the tv coverage "throughout the broadcast the cbs guys seemed amazed that the outcome was even in question " mr zelkovich writes "at one point announcer jim nantz told viewers this has been a lot more interesting than many people speculated those people mostly worked for cbs " at least they didnt file a column five years in advance from the u s open when woods presumably passes jack nicklaus on the all time majors list as david whitley does today in the orlando sentinel speculation canned storylines and pre edited segments dominate lots of sports tv these days in a recent column espns le anne schreiber hoped the network would return its focus to the games "many of us are forced to multitask away great swaths of our lives and part of the reason we tune in to games is to be swept up in the natural flow of innings and quarters sets and rounds " ms schreiber wrote a new york yankees game broadcast years ago and re played last week reminded record columnist j p pelzman of a simpler better time in tv sports "tv broadcasts will never go back to the way they were " mr pelzman writes "if anything expect the screens to be even more cluttered in the near future but for one night it was nice to remember a simpler time " speaking of the yankees they won games or two fewer than the pace of this years team back when reggie jackson was leading the team in homers wins was good enough to finish games out of first place in these days of smaller divisions and the wild card the hot yankees since the all star break after a weekend sweep of the cleveland indians are tied for a playoff spot but new york sun columnist tim marchman points out that the club has the toughest remaining schedule of al contenders while the first place boston red sox have games left against the tampa bay devil rays st louis post dispatch columnist bernie miklasz examines another preseason favorite one that like the yankees was picked by a plurality of fix readers in our seasonlong contest to win their division the st louis cardinals have also trailed for most of the season but have closed the gap with the milwaukee brewers and chicago cubs in the nl central and play both teams in the next week mr miklasz says it hasnt hurt that manager tony la russa has made moves urged by fans and reporters "the cardinals are playing with enthusiasm and energy " mr miklasz writes "theyre having fun theyre grinding through games playing hard the starting pitchers are attacking opponent lineups with renewed resolve and composure in other words this is la russas kind of team hard nosed relentless resourceful " woods is marching toward jack nicklauss record of majors in tennis roger federer is taking aim at pete samprass record of majors but federers three set loss in the rogers cup final yesterday to novak djokovic raises the possibility that the worlds no player may have left behind his own period of dominance "pete sampras won majors before his th birthday " tom perrotta writes in the new york sun "he won only three more in his last four years on the tour largely because of a dominant weapon his serve the more versatile federer may have the best forehand in history but theres nothing more useful in tennis than being able to club winners out of ones own hand during a serve a skill that federer lacks federer who turned last week needs three more major titles to tie samprass all time record of and though hell likely win that many and perhaps a few more more of those victories will follow scraps such as this years five set wimbledon final the most memorable and moving of federers career than the drubbings of years past " found a good column from the
