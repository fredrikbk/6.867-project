massacre by japanese troops known as the rape of nanking some chinese are taking it upon themselves to heal old wounds where their governments have failed movie makers are investing millions of dollars in projects hoping to engage japanese and even western audiences in accounts of the december tragedy in which the japanese imperial army stormed what was then chinas capital and slayed hundreds of thousands of residents at an auditorium at nanjing university the city has changed its name a more modest production is taking place english professor liu haiping worked for more than a year to recreate the event onstage with a cast of nine chinese and japanese students the sino japanese war remains so sensitive that plainclothes police dispatched by the university sat in the audience on opening night prepared for any unrest "the school is very worried that the students might act emotional and start a riot afterwards " mr liu said he called the production a "high risk" venture in the absence of government level concord chinese cultural groups said they want to muster some goodwill using soft diplomacy china and japans governments have failed to agree on such basic issues about the rape of nanking as whether japan has apologized in a manner china finds acceptable and what was the exact civilian death toll a complicated matter because the executions began under the pretext of killing soldiers in civilian guise china puts the civilian toll at while the japanese government has approved textbooks that cite estimates of "over " deaths including to civilians in spring anti japan protests over the textbooks erupted in several chinese cities the memory of the massacre and japans failure to satisfy demands for an apology have become a rallying point for expressions of chinese nationalism which the beijing government may be reluctant to stifle keeping the peace has benefits for both sides japans top trading partner is china and china is japans no

japanese prime ministers have said the war was one of aggression for which they are sorry in march a group of academics formed the japan china joint history research committee to address contentious historical issues yet according to jeff kingston director of asian studies at the japan campus of temple university the committee pits state backed chinese academics against "revisionist" japanese with little sympathy for chinas view of the war so "there is no chance in the world they are going to compromise " japanese committee chairman shinichi kitaoka calling mr kingstons charge of revisionism "nonsense " acknowledges "the fact that the war is a tragedy " but mr kitaoka said he would like the chinese to "stop looking at history where relations were most awful " "if we can come to a point where we can agree to disagree then its a kind of success " he said meanwhile cultural efforts continue some projects have aimed to bring people from both countries together while others simply want to put a spotlight on the war and force discussion about it in any case with at least four major film projects in the works a broad audience will be exposed to the history of the incident

and tokyo in a play that though couched in an allegory about the construction of a japanese factory in china alluded to the war the play was co written by chinese director li liuyi and japanese director oriza hirata neither of whom speaks the others language initially both men clashed they fought over how explicitly the actors should refer to world war ii mr li wanted straight facts but mr hirata preferred subtle hints about japans role in it in the end mr li gave in removing any direct mentions of the war "for me this project wasnt about politics " he said at nanjing university mr lius student production also faced strong initial resistance for his young actors mr liu had picked an obscure japanese play set in nanjing that ended with a japanese character apologizing for the death of a chinese that script shocked the plays student director michiyo oi the script "was too much for me its a clear apology from the japanese side" for the war she said ms oi said her mother at first worried about her daughters safety she feared ms oi might get lynched in nanjing just for being japanese but ms oi said her mother cried with joy when the production later came to tokyo filled with pride that her daughter had taken part in a project that drew two rival countries together ms oi who in junior high school used a textbook that contained only one line about the nanking massacre said she took on the project to decide for herself whether the event had been exaggerated or even fabricated she spent a week interviewing chinese victims in nanking hoping to find ideas for an alternative

released in english chinese and japanese this year with funding from the japan international christian university where she graduated the japan icu and nanjing university plan to get their students to
