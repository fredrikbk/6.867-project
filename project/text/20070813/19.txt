battered auto parts makers could face more pain job losses may hasten as detroits big three shift buying overseas while the struggles of detroits big three auto makers make headlines u s auto parts makers have slashed more than four times as many manufacturing jobs as the big auto makers during the past six years and the shakeout appears likely to accelerate in that period about supplier manufacturing jobs have been eliminated in the u s compared with about auto assembly jobs according to the bureau of labor statistics large suppliers that have recently filed for bankruptcy protection such as delphi corp and collins &amp aikman corp are each eliminating more than jobs general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler llc have shown some progress toward restructuring their unprofitable north american operations likewise some parts makers have become more efficient competitors delphi is expected to emerge from bankruptcy protection with lower costs and only a fraction of its prebankruptcy work force last month lear corp shareholders rejected an offer by investor carl icahn to buy the majority of the company he doesnt own with an eye toward better results ahead still industry observers say woes among parts makers could get worse as the u s auto giants shift more purchasing to lower wage countries in part to offset their own high labor costs at the same time asian auto makers such as toyota motor co are producing more cars and trucks in the u s but they use fewer traditional u s based suppliers than their detroit rivals many small u s suppliers are succumbing to higher raw materials prices and pressure from lower cost competitors now tightening credit markets are drying up the easy money that allowed suppliers to delay or fund slow restructurings say supplier and auto maker purchasing executives if u s vehicle demand doesnt pick up from the sluggish pace of the past three months more parts makers could start to skid the largest auto supplier trade group estimates that about north american auto parts makers are being eliminated or consolidated each year the trade group predicts there will be about north american parts suppliers by down from in the supplier industry is estimated to be a &# billion business globally by revenue with about &# billion of that from north america according to various studies "this last year weve really been seeing our smaller suppliers that is those who have annual sales of &# million or lower start to struggle or go under mostly because theyve been hit by the rise in raw materials like plastic or steel " said bo andersson gm head of global purchasing mr andersson buys about &# billion of products and services from suppliers globally including in north america gm a few years ago had about suppliers globally "wed like to keep those small suppliers because they have something we dont have at gm an entrepreneurial edge so we will try to help them keep going " he said gm buys about &# billion a year from vendors in north america ford meanwhile wants to slash at least half of its global suppliers fti consulting a new york based firm involved in the bankruptcy proceedings at delphi and tower automotive inc says the slowing of the debt market will hasten the pace of auto supplier liquidations bankruptcies and consolidations "the caution thats currently being experienced in the credit markets increases the likelihood that some suppliers will be unable to restructure due to their inability to raise some additional financing or refinance their existing debt " said randall eisenberg senior managing director with fti "if they cant fund the turnaround they may run out of liquidity " small suppliers said arvinmeritor inc senior vice president phil martens are also suffering because "they arent globally diverse are too dependent on one customer or even too dependent on one product line " arvinmeritor of troy mich is a maker of parts such as brake and suspension systems with annual sales of about &# billion in part led by the gm funded buyouts at delphi the job losses at parts suppliers have quickened through the first six months of thirty thousand positions were eliminated bringing auto parts employment down to in there were about such jobs the center for automotive research a research group says trends indicate supplier employment could shrink to about by as about auto supplier jobs are trimmed each year geographically many suppliers and supplier jobs are shifting out of states like michigan ohio and indiana and going south to states like alabama or further south to mexico and also to asia "we call it island hopping as suppliers jump south and then east to china " said sean mcalinden chief economist with the center "the pressure is from all of the global purchasing groups to cut the cost of manufacturing " mr mcalinden said auto makers cant buy everything overseas some components such as air conditioning units are too big to ship economically other parts are so cheap it would cost more to ship them long distance than to manufacture them in the u s wages for many remaining u s auto parts workers arent as lucrative as they were according to bureau of labor statistics data auto parts workers on average make about &# an hour compared with the &# average hourly wage for all u s production workers in the average gap was wider in percentage terms back then parts workers on average earned more than &# an hour compared with about &# an hour for manufacturing workers as a whole auto assembly jobs by comparison now pay about &# an hour that reflects the tendency of asian and european auto makers to pay their u s employees at roughly the same hourly rate as employees represented by the united auto workers at plants owned by the detroit auto makers though their benefits arent as rich the next trend which could eventually stabilize auto supplier employment in north america may well be a wave of asian based auto suppliers pushing to open up plants in the u s said jim orchard president of the north america business of french parts maker faurecia sa terry kosdrosky contributed to this article
