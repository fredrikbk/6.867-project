sign up for the e mail here karl rove is quitting the bush white house in an interview with wall street journal editorial page editor paul gigot mr rove says he thinks "its just time " that hes "got to do this for the sake of my family " and that he would have left earlier but didnt want to depart on the sour note of last falls republican rout by democrats in the midterm elections so effective aug mr rove says he will relinquish the job of white house deputy chief of staff and longtime role of political overseer for the career of president bush he expresses to mr gigot a belief that future developments in iraq and congressional jousting this fall over domestic wiretapping and taxes will work to mr bushs advantage and help restore the republican brand name tarnished as it has been by the war contentious national security policies and washington scandals and give the party a "very good chance" to keep the white house in the election it is such branding of both republicans and democrats that brought mr rove so many plaudits in the world of political strategists not least mr bushs description of his aide as the "architect" of his bosss victories but if he was sometimes known as "boy genius" in mr bushs crowd mr rove was slammed as an evil genius by his critics who thought they saw his hand guiding the white houses post harnessing of the terrorism issue across the spectrum of political and policy fights mr roves mastery of direct mail and voter turnout campaigns drew respect even from his opponents but it was his teams ability to negatively define democratic candidates in enough american eyes and paint republicans as the surer hands in anxious times that often seemed to make the difference until last fall there is much debate among republicans these days on whether blame for the defeat should go to messrs rove and bush or to the republican congressional candidates themselves mr rove still blames the latter and sometime between the and votes the white house seemed to lose control of the iraq narrative his own role in the cia leak case which led to perjury convictions for former vice presidential chief of staff i lewis libby and huge legal bills but no legal jeopardy for mr rove didnt help the administration and the politics exported from the white house to the justice department the state department and other executive branch agencies has contributed to the investigative fodder of a now democratically controlled congress but the white houses claims of executive privilege have thus far shielded him from the direct fire of capitol hill testimony though as mr gigot says the timing of mr roves departure lets him leave on his own terms it is uncertain who will take charge of mr roves daily duties but its a pretty safe bet that the new political chief wont have anything approaching the closeness to mr bush enjoyed by mr rove whose only rival in that respect might be vice president dick cheney mr rove says he is done with political consulting but that he leaves the scene as a "myth theres the mark of rove " ecb boj act but overseas markets are ok most asian financial markets closed higher today and at midday all the major

transsexuals laying the groundwork for future syndication stars like oprah winfrey and jerry springer and yet mr griffins own persona is what stood out and lingers as a personification of his era more than the luminaries or topics he featured what the posts tom shales describes as "that form of celebrity unique to television a professional personality someone whose singing despite a big band career
