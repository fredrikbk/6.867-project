the mark of rove washington these are the days of republican doubt with president bush fighting an unpopular war congress in opposition hands and a presidential field trailing democrats in nearly every poll but dont tell that to karl rove mr bushs political alter ego who even as he prepares to resign from the white house after six and a half years sees recovery ahead sitting in the book lined living room of his townhome on saturday afternoon a relaxed cheerful and typically rambunctious mr rove hands over two sheets of paper on which he has tapped out a pair of outlines one says "up to now " and summarizes what he thinks are the achievements to date of the bush presidency the second "months ahead " lays out an agenda for the next year and a half "he will move back up in the polls " says mr rove who interrupts my reference to mr bushs approval rating by saying its heading close to " " and "higher than congress " looking ahead he adds "iraq will be in a better place" as the surge continues come the autumn too "well see in the battle over fisa" the wiretapping of foreign terrorists "a fissure in the democratic party " also in the fall "the budget fight will have been fought to our advantage " helping the gop restore through a series of presidential vetoes its brand name on spending restraint and taxes as for the democrats "they are likely to nominate a tough tenacious fatally flawed candidate" by the name of hillary rodham clinton holding the white house for a third term is always difficult given the pent up desire for change he says but "i think weve got a very good chance to do so " if that quinella pays off however mr rove will have to savor it from somewhere other than his west wing office hes resigning effective aug years after he began working with mr bush on his campaign for texas governor years after they began planning a white house run and after months in the political cockpit of a tumultuous presidency "i just think its time " he says adding that he first floated the idea of leaving to mr bush a year ago his friends confirm he had been talking about it with others even earlier but democrats took congress and he didnt want to depart on that sour note he then thought hed leave after the state of the union but the iraq and immigration fights beckoned finally chief of staff josh bolten told senior white house aides that if they stayed past a certain point they were obliged to remain to jan "theres always something that can keep you here and as much as id like to be here ive got to do this for the sake of my family " mr rove says his son attends college in san antonio and he and his wife darby plan to spend much of their time at their home in nearby ingram in the texas hill country mr rove doesnt say though others do that this timing also allows him to leave on his own terms he has survived a probe by a remorseless special counsel and lately a subpoena barrage from democrats for whom he is the great white whale he shows notable forbearance in declining to comment on prosecutor patrick fitzgerald who dragged him through five grand jury appearances he wont even disclose his legal bills except to quip that "every one has been paid" and that "it was worth every penny " what about those who say hes leaving to avoid congressional scrutiny "i know theyll say that " he says "but im not going to stay or leave based on whether it pleases the mob " he also knows hell continue to be a target even from afar since belief in his influence over every administration decision has become well faith based "im a myth theres the mark of rove " he says with a bemused air "i read about some of the things im supposed to have done and i have to try not to laugh " he says the real target is mr bush whom many democrats have never accepted as a legitimate president and "never will " it is his long and personal relationship with mr bush that has made mr rove arguably the most influential white house aide of modern times the president calls him to chat about politics on sunday mornings and they have a contest to see who can read the most books mr rove is winning ive known mr rove for years and spoken to him hundreds of times yet i cant recall a single instance where he disclosed how his views differed from mr bushs mr bolten hasnt decided on a replacement and mr roves duties may yet be divided up mr roves political influence has been historic notwithstanding the rout of his crucial insight in was recognizing that mr bush had to be both an alternative to bill clintons scandalous behavior and "a different kind of republican " in the presidents party gained seats in both the house and senate in a first midterm election for the first time since and in for only the second time in history a president won re election while helping his party gain seats in both houses of congress the other time was much has been made of john kerrys ineptitude but the senator won some eight million more votes than al gore did in and mr rove claims democrats outspent republicans by &# million thanks to billionaire donations to "" committees yet amid a difficult war mr bush won by increasing his own vote by nearly over winning of u s counties the rove ken mehlman turnout effort was a spectacular achievement if it did nothing else that victory put john roberts and samuel alito on the supreme court a big debate among republicans these days is who bears more blame for messrs bush and rove or the behavior of the gop congress mr rove has no doubt "the sense of entitlement was there" among republicans he says "and people smelled it " yet even with a unified democratic party and the war he argues it was "a really close election " the gop lost the senate by its vote margin of defeat in montana and in the house the combined margin in the seats that cost control was votes a prominent non beltway republican recently gave me a different analysis arguing that the white house made a disastrous decision to "nationalize" the election last autumn this played into democratic hands and cost numerous seats "i disagree " mr rove replies "the election was nationalized it was always going to be about iraq and the conduct of republicans " he says republican chris shays and independent democrat joe lieberman survived in connecticut despite supporting the war while republicans who were linked to corruption or were complacent lost his biggest error mr rove says was in not working soon enough to replace republicans tainted by scandal what about that new gop william mckinley style majority he hoped to build isnt that now in tatters as the country tilts leftward on security economics and the culture again mr rove disagrees he says young people are if anything more pro life and free market than older americans and that despite the difficulties in iraq the country doesnt want to be defeated there or in the fight against islamic terror he recalls how democrats thought driving the u s out of vietnam would also help them politically "instead democrats have suffered ever since on national security " he says mr rove also makes a spirited defense of this presidents policy legacy sometimes more convincingly than others on foreign affairs he predicts that at least two parts of the bush doctrine will live on the policy that if you harbor a terrorist you are as culpable as the terrorist and pre emption "there may be a debate about degree " he says "but its going to be hard for any president to reverse that " hes less persuasive on medicare where he insists that market reforms and health savings accounts are building a "critical mass" of popular support that will make them unrepealable yet democrats are even now trying to kill medicare advantage blocked only by the promise of a veto if mrs clinton wins in the medicare drug expansion may prove to have been all spending and no reform he also insists that social security reform was worth the failed effort and that mr bushs ideas will be adopted inevitably by some future president i ask if given mr bushs falling approval ratings in due to iraq he shouldnt have pushed for something less ambitious not a chance "you cannot advance on the fronts you want to advance if youre playing mini ball " he says once again sounding like mr bush as for he says americans "do want change " but "every election is a change election" even in when ronald reagan was popular the gipper famously said at the nominating convention for george h w bush that "we are the change " adds mr rove "i dont want to be pollyanish about it but if we keep our nerve and represent big things well win " he wont cite a favorite if he has one among the gop candidates though he has friends in the various campaigns hell offer advice if asked but at years old says he is done with political consulting hed like to teach eventually but he has no specific job plans save to write a book on the bush years which "the boss " as in mr bush "has encouraged me to do " as for what his own white house mistakes have been mr rove winces and says "ill put my feet up in september and think about that " and what about jeb bush in mr rove first says with a tone of skepticism "ask jeb " then he adds "you better get a younger man my wife would kill me " mr gigot is editorial page editor of the journal
