on the road to jalalabad afghanistan sen hillary clinton has cynically charged that we are "losing the fight to al qaeda and bin laden" in afghanistan but on my eighth trip to afghanistan last month i saw that the trend lines are up not down the first encouraging sign came in dubai as i boarded my flight for kabul afghanistans main private air carrier kam air has recently added a second daily round trip between kabul and dubai once in kabul i bought a new sim card for my mobile phone and found that what would have cost me &# a few years ago and &# in september last year now cost only &# not surprisingly mobile phones have spread to a broad section of afghanistans million people with the two major providers awcc and roshan claiming a total of three million subscribers up from two million in september last year amin ramin managing director of awcc estimates that his company alone will count two million subscribers by the end of and three million by the end of i spotted similarly hopeful trends in three heavily pashtun provinces nangarhar laghman and khost in eastern afghanistan but first its important to note that to talk about "reconstruction" is the biggest lie in afghanistan before the soviet invasion in afghanistan was long one of the poorest countries in the world and has never had a lot of infrastructure there are ruins in the country of course but of them are in or near kabul itself most of afghanistan lives much as it always has subsisting on small scale farming and trading we can do nothing about many of afghanistans barriers to development for starters of its land area is non arable it has also never had a broad distribution of income or land according to afghan australian historian amin saikal up until the early s when king amanullah gave crown lands to the poor only of peasants worked their own properties this is why many foreign development experts working in kabul say privately that if in a couple of decades afghanistan reaches the level of bangladesh which in had a per capita gdp of about &# per year one of the lowest in the world then they will judge their time in the country a success but i am more optimistic jalalabad the largest city of eastern afghanistan with people is now just a three hour drive to kabul on a good road recently built by the european union another hours drive brings you to mehtar lam capital of afghanistans laghman province on another good road funded by usaid the u s is now planning to start a second provincial reconstruction team prt in nangarhar province and it will be staffed by military reservists who are farmers and ranchers in civilian life this second prt will work with local farmers in nangahars lush river valley while also building infrastructure to get crops to market cold storage facilities and local roads air force lt col gordon phillips the commander of the existing prt says that blacktop roads will link all district centers in the province to the main road to kabul by the end of this year "every day we open to new accounts " says maseh arifi the year old manager of the jalalabad branch of azizi bank one of afghanistans two homegrown consumer banks the branch opened at the end of last august and has accounts next door rival kabul bank has opened accounts totaling &# million in two years the bank accounts represent about of adults of jalalabad and doesnt count some of the most prosperous locals who commute to peshawar to do their banking in nangarhar awcc and roshan together have about mobile phone customers of the adults further south is khost a province that received little help from the central government in recent decades now construction cranes hover over khost city with modern five and six story office buildings and shopping centers rising amid grimy two story concrete bazaars the united arab emirates uae recently finished building a new university in the city and this month the afghanistan investment support agency an investment facilitating agency is inviting overseas khostis to come discuss building an industrial park both kabul bank and azizi bank opened their khost branches in the summer of and each have about accounts both branch managers expect their numbers to double this year the numbers are low because some local residents view even non interest bearing accounts as un islamic competing fatwas have been issued by various mullahs on the topic about people have mobile phones in the province many of its men emigrated to the uae and saudi arabia and did well for themselves as merchants as many as overseas khostis about a million people live in the province send &# million to &# million annually to their families at home usaid spent just &# million in the province from culturally khost has always been an outward looking place its not an opium producing province in the s and s it was a stronghold of the khalq communist party as the party provided a vehicle for the ghilzai pashtun to challenge leaders from other tribes the pashtun population is also about literate according to babaker khil a member of parliament from khost khost should really take off when its linked to kabul by a blacktop road construction of a &# million kilometer long khost gardez road is slated to begin next spring it will be built by usaid and is supposed to be finished in september the u s army which moves at a much faster pace than usaid expects to link of the population of khost to the main provincial road by the end of this year there have been no conventional attacks on coalition or afghan security forces in so far but the long border with pakistan makes suicide bombings and improvised explosive devices ied an ongoing threat the insurgents are seeking "soft targets" such as civilians there have been at least ied explosions this year killing more than two dozen afghans and wounding one american but encouragingly ieds were found and reported by locals before detonating in khost twelve other devices were turned in by locals looking for reward money "weve got the wholehearted support of of the population here " major timothy kohn of the nd airborne told me "the mullahs have put out fatwas against suicide bombers saying that the victims of these bombings are the martyrs not the extremists thousands of people attended peace rallies in the city " the most economically backward of the eastern provinces i visited is laghman its people eke out a living by working rice paddies and wheat fields along the alingar and alishang rivers even the provincial capital mehtar lam is so small you could miss it driving by it has only a couple of two story buildings in the bazaar still an astonishing of laghmans adults have mobile phones also implying that a good percentage of the women have phones too nangarhar and laghman are also known for relatively high levels of education and in the eastern region overall unicef reports that this year children were enrolled in school up from and six times the figure for laghman is never going to be rich but air force lt col robert ricci the mehtar lam prt commander points out that the district of qarghayi had afghanistans highest per hectare wheat production last year the new nangarhar prt will help the local farmers here too while mr riccis team fixes the roads so that farmers in remote areas can bring their crop to the provincial capital and from there to kabul the prt is planning to blacktop the dirt road from mehtar lam to the most remote district capital daulat shah kilometers away at a cost of around &# million security in laghman is better than in the frontier provinces but there is a well established route for al qaeda taliban and other fighters to cross from pakistan and make their way north through laghman a suicide bombing in april seems to have been a turning point in laghman the bomber killed a mullah and several schoolgirls and according to mr ricci local residents were so angry that they left the bombers body parts on the road refusing him burial since then just nine ieds have been detonated in laghman while were turned in by locals of course one suicide bombing or ied is one too many but every society is violent in its own way the killed by ieds and suicide bombers in khost could be compared with the murders in some american cities with around khosts one million population there were murders in san jose in indianapolis and in detroit afghanistan is still a poor rural country with a mainly illiterate population but its improving rapidly and with the exception of helmand province and a few bad districts in uruzgun kandahar and loghar its much like any number of developing countries in terms of security we cant give every country everything theyd like and it will take decades for the rule of law to be as firmly established here as it is in the west but we can and are helping the afghans pull themselves up to the next rung on the development ladder ms marlowe is author of
