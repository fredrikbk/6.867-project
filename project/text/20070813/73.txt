the doctors office an unexpected birth upends a doctors day online edition sometimes one phone call changes everything in the midst of a routine morning of blood pressure treatment well child care and ear aches a pregnant patient started bleeding at home sitting in her easy chair she just started to bleed it was enough to fill a bath towel and wasnt stopping thirty two weeks into her second pregnancy her babys placenta was separating too soon she was having a partial placental abruption one of the most feared complications in pregnancy and an emergency that threatened the lives of mother and child i told her id meet her at the hospital i pulled my partner out of the exam room in the middle of a patient visit and we hopped in her car for the mile trip my partner kicked the car into passing gear and we overtook a convoy of trucks speeding along the prairie two lane traffic was heavier than usual for a weekday we were both getting anxious nine miles from the hospital i got the call the nurses found the babys heartbeat when the patient arrived then they lost it the surgery crew was getting her ready but two experienced nurses couldnt find the babys heartbeat the mother was still bleeding and the lab was preparing a blood transfusion she was only a few centimeters dilated and would need a c section my heart sank i said a prayer for the mother and the baby when a good nurse with more than years experience in obstetrics cant find the heartbeat i fear for the worst in minutes a lot can happen a bleeding mother can die the nurses moved her to the operating room as we barreled down the highway we pulled up to the hospital and sprinted past the husband talking to his wifes family on the cellphone when we arrived the nurses had found the babys heartbeat after a frantic two minute search usually it takes less than seconds when things are going well the baby was still alive the relief that poured over me was intense the odds were long but we still had a chance to help this baby a baby born at weeks usually has difficulty breathing because of immature lungs after the hemorrhage and weak heartbeat this baby would likely need neonatal resuscitation and intensive care our rural hospital doesnt have a neonatal intensive care unit neonatologist or pediatric intensive care expert we dont have an infant ventilator because the state doesnt license our hospital for that level of nursery care those specialists and the technology they use to help babies like ours are a helicopter ride away if only it were that simple on this day the helicopter wasnt able to fly we were on our own but had no time to worry about that there was no meticulous five minute hand scrub just a quick smear of antibacterial hand gel i got into the blue operating gown and sterile gloves in a blur our nurse anesthetist started the general anesthesia my patient went to sleep not knowing if her baby could hang on long enough for the surgery or not we didnt know either i drew a scalpel across the womans lower abdomen cutting through the skin and fat to the muscle underneath as quickly as i could i pulled apart the strong crimson abdominal muscles to open the thin nearly transparent lining of the abdomen with the uterus in view i made another incision in the front of the uterus to get to the baby i widened the opening with my fingertips the babys tiny feet came first followed by the twig like legs and the hips the tiny arms were stuck by the head and i had to pull them down across the body to get the baby free i gently flexed the head smaller than a tennis ball and the baby was delivered it was a boy he was blue pale and floppy like a rag i unwound the umbilical cord from around his neck he didnt cry he wasnt breathing and he looked more dead than alive i cut his cord and handed him to my partner "he has a heartbeat " she said my hopes rose "its above " even better she breathed for him with a bag and oxygen mask made for premature babies he slowly turned pink and began to breathe on his own he let out a tentative little cry that got stronger with practice he flexed his tiny arms and legs and started to wriggle at lbs oz he was the smallest baby ive ever delivered at this rural hospital in the two weeks since hes put on weight and stayed off the ventilator his mother has recovered and is in good health nine miles north from gibson city is a stretch of flat farm fields that extend to the horizon under the unbroken sky a patch of prairie grass still grows along the old unkempt railroad line and black eyed susans wave in the breeze by the roadside theres nothing to mark the unlikely spot where a country doctor asked for a miracle and got one but i know its there
