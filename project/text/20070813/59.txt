politics &amp economics higher food prices to hit europe looming increases spur inflation worries agriculture policy shifts frankfurt the global rise in food prices is catching up with continental europe adding to mounting inflation worries and forcing changes to european union agriculture policy rising global food demand freakish weather and the trend to reroute crops for biofuels are pushing up food commodity prices globally standard &amp poors gsci excess return index which measures the price movements of eight agriculture commodities including wheat sugar and corn is up in the past year european shoppers are looking at some particularly stiff increases germanys dairy industry association said earlier this month that domestic prices for milk based products such as butter could jump as much as this year anglo dutch giant unilever said soaring global edible oil and dairy prices will increase its costs by more than million euros &# million this year and boost prices for products such as margarine italys association of pasta manufacturers said last month that a durum wheat squeeze will increase domestic pasta prices by this fall while food price inflation in many major economies has accelerated the impact in the countries that share the euro currency has been muted so far annual euro zone food price inflation was in june compared with in the united kingdom and in the u s in japan where other prices keep falling the annual inflation rate for food excluding perishables was in june japans q p corp for instance lifted mayonnaise prices for businesses and consumers by about in june some economists say the strong euro has shielded the euro zone from some price increases most food commodities are priced in dollars so a stronger euro makes those products cheaper for european buyers the euro has risen nearly against the dollar since the start of the year and now hovers near record highs around &# and in contrast to the u k where a strong pound also damps commodity price inflation euro zone consumer demand has been relatively weak deterring producers and supermarkets from raising prices that is changing "euro zone growth has picked up and is therefore increasing the pricing power of retailers " says erik nielsen chief european economist at goldman sachs in london mr nielsen notes that falling unemployment could boost domestic consumption across the bloc rising food prices could be particularly relevant for the european central bank and borrowers across the continent unlike the u s federal reserve the ecb which sets euro zone monetary policy focuses on "headline" inflation that is inflation with volatile food and energy costs included that has some fretting that the blocs inflation rate will rise further than expected "were concerned " says nick matthews economist with barclays capital in london mr matthews expects inflation to hit later this year above the ecbs ceiling and says higher food prices could bump the rate up further before last weeks global credit crunch which prompted the ecb to pump billion euros into euro zone money markets most economists expected the bank to raise interest rates to in september from as inflation pressures including rising energy costs and robust economic growth mount but if market turbulence continues and the ecb keeps injecting money into the system a september rate increase is less likely while food prices are rising across the bloc germans may feel a particular pinch german dairy farmers have paid heavy fines million euros in for ignoring eu milk production quotas but now largely produce within legal limits a change that is squeezing supply particularly slack domestic demand has also kept retail prices low last year german prices for milk cheese and eggs were just of the eu average "germany in particular has room to catch up " says barclayss mr matthews but rising prices there "reflect supply pressures across the board " he says overall the factors pushing up euro zone food prices mirror the dynamics at work globally the push to use some crops to produce biofuels is one culprit changing weather patterns are another australias continuing drought means farmers there cant fulfill as many orders european farmers are stepping in particularly to meet milk product demand fast growth and changing palates in developing countries are also to blame germany is by far the eus largest dairy producer and its milk product exports from whey powder to soft cheese to eastern europe developing asia and oil producing countries has skyrocketed the value of german milk and cream exports to hungary rose to million euros last year from million euros in the value of whey powder exports to china over the same period jumped to million euros from euros economists expect global demand to keep climbing as developing market consumers continue shifting their eating habits from basics like bread to fare such as cheese and meat until those countries develop the capacity to meet their own demand economists say prices will continue to rise the food price jump has already prompted the eu to cut some subsidies for years high labor and production costs have kept european dairy prices above those in the rest of the world in response the eu used to offer dairy farmers refunds to make up the difference on products they exported at lower prices in those refunds totaled billion euros with global prices rising the eu started phasing out the program last year for europe economists say it is the dawn of a new era "suddenly theres a factor that was never visible in the domestic market " says stefan tangermann director for food agriculture and fisheries at the organization for economic cooperation and development "that is what do the chinese eat " yuka hayashi in tokyo
