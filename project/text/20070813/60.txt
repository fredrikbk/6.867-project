politics &amp economics huckabee iowa polls real winner arkansas ex governors second place finish to romney could shake up presidential race ames iowa the biggest winner of iowa republicans weekend straw poll of presidential rivals may well turn out to be not mitt romney whose first place finish here was expected but surprise runner up mike huckabee the guitar picking former governor of arkansas should mr huckabee capitalize on his second place showing here saturday to get a second look from demoralized republicans unhappy with their choices and to get much needed funding the repercussions could reshuffle the partys contest for its nomination social conservatives who have come to dominate the republican party could decide the candidate they have been looking for has been in the race the whole time languishing at the back of the pack with little money to promote himself that wouldnt be good news for kansas sen sam brownback who likewise has struggled to be that candidate or for actor and former senator fred thompson of tennessee mr thompsons still undeclared candidacy has been propelled by the argument that he could fill the perceived void of a true conservative and a southerner among the fields front runners of former new york mayor rudy giuliani arizona sen john mccain and mr romney the former socially liberal massachusetts governor now running as a social conservative but mr thompson has delayed entering the race to some supporters chagrin and didnt compete in saturdays straw poll "with every day that passes huckabee fills that void" for conservatives argued south carolinas former republican gov david beasley a recent huckabee convert who helped work the crowds for his candidate at iowa state university "i really believe now that the conservative voters will begin to coalesce behind mike huckabee and its going to be infectious in new hampshire and south carolina" states that along with iowa hold the first presidential nominating contests next winter mr huckabee ebullient after an outcome that surprised even him said he offered experience and "a different kind of republican not a wholly owned subsidiary of wall street " messrs thompson and brownback werent the only ones to see trouble in the iowa results and in mr huckabees high place in them the nonbinding straw poll is a much criticized event outside iowa since the wealthiest candidates not only pay the &# a ballot cost for supporters but also provide food lodging transportation and entertainment but mr huckabee nearly broke was among several candidates with a shoestring operation who heavily relied on supporters to dig into their own pockets his showing what mr huckabee a former southern baptist minister variously characterized as a david and goliath story or a miracle of the loaves and fishes somewhat overshadowed the news of mr romneys victory mr romney a wealthy former venture capitalist had spent huge sums for the straw poll his &# for a consultant to organize the effort was alone more than the &# that mr huckabee estimates he spent altogether mr romney rented buses mr huckabees supporters had to find their own way where mr romney hired bands to play saturday at the huge hospitality space he rented mr huckabee entertained the older crowds himself with his band capitol offense jamming at one point to the s hit "free bird " with messrs thompson giuliani and mccain opting not to compete actively mr romney was widely expected to win by more than to over the next highest republican his of the tally to mr huckabees fell short of that also disappointed was mr brownback who has based his candidacy on an appeal to the antiabortion and antigay marriage christian conservatives in the party base he and mr huckabee have been vying to be their candidate after coming in third with mr brownback said he will campaign on but like mr huckabee he has gone into debt and now he faces the possibility that conservatives and their money will now go to mr huckabee that social conservatives have been conflicted was evident saturday in mr brownbacks own tent for supporters in the searing heat on the isu grounds arlyne cornelson years old of des moines said she voted for mr brownback on the recommendation of her friend sara morris the two finishing the barbecue lunch provided by the brownback campaign showed their ink stained fingers to attest to their having voted but mrs cornelson added "huckabee is a strong christian man so its kind of a hard choice " later as mr huckabee rushed into a coliseum to meet reporters after the results were announced two women in "brownback" t shirts separately stopped him both clearly recognized him and congratulated him as if he were their candidate and each suggested to him that soon he may be once they had gone mr huckabee explained that each woman had wanted to be for him but for separate reasons felt they had to initially support mr brownback the presidential straw poll first held the summer before the election as a fund raiser for the iowa republican party has emerged as a traditional first test of candidates appeal and organizational strength bringing out the most committed and conservative partisans the type who also will turn out for iowas winter caucuses when the votes really count mr giuliani and sen mccain both suspect among social conservatives decided not to compete though their names were on saturdays ballots along with mr thompsons each got only about of the votes cast a poor showing that surprised many including iowa republican party chairman ray hoffman despite their absence from recent months courtship of state party voters perhaps most embarrassing was mr mccains th place votes which put the one time front runner just ahead of last place john cox a businessman from chicago mr thompson got twice as many as mr mccain for seventh place and more votes than eighth place mr giuliani the ames straw poll was certain to fulfill what has become a traditional role of winnowing the big early field tommy thompson the former three term wisconsin governor and bush administration health and human services department secretary had said he would end his campaign if he didnt come in first or second he came in sixth california rep duncan hunters ninth place finish had republicans predicting he would exit soon fourth place and fifth place went respectively to reps tom tancredo of colorado and ron paul of texas impressive showings for two men with narrowly defined candidacies mr tancredo is running against illegal immigration and secondarily income taxes with anti immigration sentiment high among iowa republicans some republicans thought he might come in second in the straw poll mr paul meanwhile has built a fanatical following that has embraced his libertarian message and antiwar anti interventionist views supporters came at their own expense from as far as washington state to help out though only iowans could vote mike huckabee born aug in hope ark married
