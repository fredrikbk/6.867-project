buried treasure in america and the russian bears polar aspirations i would like to add a historical footnote to prof eric posners informative piece "the new race for the arctic " opinion aug about a russian mini sub depositing "a capsule containing a russian flag onto the seabed at the north pole" and thereby symbolically claiming much of the arctic ocean floor for russia your readers may be interested to know that there are two recorded and documented precedents in russian history for such activity the first came on june when lt gen ivan v jakobi the governor general of siberia sent a secret instruction to two russian merchant explorers instructing them to bury at various points along the alaska shore iron plates proclaiming "this land belongs to the russian empire " russia did not give up her claim until she sold alaska to the u s in the second precedent came early in the th century this time from their alaska base the russians targeted the coasts of northern california and the future states of washington and oregon the architect of this operation was alexander a baranov chief administrator of the russian american co in alaska between and baranov dispatched three company ships to survey the west coast from the strait of juan de fuca to california they carried small metal plates engraved with the words "this territory belongs to russia" and they had instructions to bury them at strategic points along the washington oregon and northern california shores to my knowledge no one knows exactly where the plates are buried but metal detector enthusiasts might find the search challenging basil dmytryshyn professor emeritus of history portland state university portland ore if simply planting a flag on a piece of land establishes ownership for a country then the u s took possession of the moon on july peter tutini bowie md if russia were to control the arctic it would attempt to recover any such reserves allowing their productive use on the other hand if the u s were involved it is likely that environmental and political forces would deter drilling given the choice i would prefer the russians douglas criner westmont ill prof posners piece is the best of several recent articles highlighting issues surrounding the russias aggressive move to claim sub sea arctic lands all the way to the north pole what most of these writings fail to do is remind readers that the u s senate has yet to act to provide advice and consent for united states accession to the united nations law of the sea convention as long as the senate fails to act we have no right to membership on the u n commission that reviews and comments upon nations technical submissions to prove claims to extend their continental shelves beyond nautical miles which is what russia is now doing the key parameters necessary to make a claim involve bathymetry sediment thickness and existing limit lines sophisticated seismic technology used in this process ironically has been developed in large part by the u s offshore oil industry and yet there are no american experts playing a role in the evaluation of claims in addition to navigation over flight and security issues it is the prospect of finding new hydrocarbon reserves below deeper and more remote waters not only in the arctic but all over the world that is driving these claims brazil ireland and norway are among the most recent nations to make submissions they are among nations which are party to the law of the sea convention here at home were the u s to become a party to the convention we would be in a position to submit claims to extend our existing limits as much as any nation particularly off alaska paul l kelly president gulf of mexico foundation houston
