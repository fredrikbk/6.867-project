raising the cone of silence the editorial "get smart in washington" aug does not discuss the fact that the administrations proposal to gut the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa isnt about listening to foreign to foreign calls its about undercutting constitutional and statutory protections from intrusive and abusive government actions this rush to gut fisa comes after a federal judge denied a "blanket warrant" request encompassing multiple targets fisa judges very rarely deny warrant requests and this one unusual instance in which a fisa judge ruled against the administration is no reason to gut the law in fact it should give congress great pause about whether it should be stampeding ahead this is the same administration that has gone to great lengths to mislead congress and the american public about the illegal warrantless wiretapping program and hide basic facts about the program from the media congress and public review now it wants congress to grant president bush these extraordinary powers to spy on americans without ever coming clean about the extent of the lawbreaking when sweeping legislation is pushed through congress at the last minute especially when it has a dramatic impact on our rights and freedoms nothing good ever comes out of it members of congress must not legislate in the dark and allow the administration to bully them into casting another hasty vote they will soon regret instead lawmakers need to stand up to the white house and carefully consider any changes they might make to this vital law that is designed to protect our civil liberties anthony d romero executive director american civil liberties union new york
