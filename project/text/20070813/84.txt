tilted scales on tribal land an arson leads to murder prison american indians can face unequal justice prayers at sweat lodge lodge pole mont in bobbi jo wing and her husband were convicted of helping burn down a ramshackle house on the fort belknap indian reservation at the time the fire started the couple say they didnt know that ms wings year old cousin was asleep in a back bedroom the girls badly charred body was later found after the house collapsed in what had once been the basement because ms wing years old and her husband are both members of a native american tribe they were tried in federal court since the arson caused a death both were charged with felony murder which automatically turned into a first degree murder charge and a mandatory life sentence ms wing is now at a federal correctional institution in dublin calif her husband is serving life in a colorado prison there is no parole in the federal system but if the crime had taken place off the reservation just five miles to the east or southwest the case would have gone to a local prosecutor the likely state charge deliberate homicide carries a penalty as low as years with the chance of parole after as little as years according to the local state prosecutor and the state attorney generals office indian tribes once had control over the dispensation of justice on reservations but federal laws some passed a century apart have whittled away that authority and critics say helped create a legal system thats often separate and unequal in the u s supreme court ruled that the dakota territory court had no jurisdiction in a case in which a member of the lakota nation killed a fellow member on tribal land the decision overturned a death sentence and effectively gave exclusive jurisdiction for crimes to tribes congress uncomfortable with the decision passed the major crimes act in taking away the tribes authority to prosecute murder manslaughter rape assault with intent to kill arson burglary and larceny that meant serious crimes committed by indians on reservations could be prosecuted only by the federal government because the tribes dont have jurisdiction for serious crimes committed on their lands outcomes of cases can be uneven in some cases the federal government doesnt have the resources to prosecute such crimes allowing criminals to slip through gaps but native americans who do end up being prosecuted face a federal system that has become tougher in recent years since the s congress has been toughening federal penalties by adding mandatory minimum sentences which are often more severe than those handed out by states coupled with that was the abolishment of parole in the federal system as a result american indians especially the million or so living on tribal land can face harsher punishments than non indians for what are effectively local crimes say tribal officials and legal experts utah federal district court judge paul cassells a former federal prosecutor says the federal sentencing guidelines were designed with a different set of criminals in mind such as multiple violent offenders and yet "we give everyone the same sentence even when we know and everyone in the courtroom knows its not the right thing to do " in blaine county mont where the fire took place prosecutor donald ranstrom says he would have weighed the fact that the death was unintentional and that the defendants were involved in a rescue attempt all three options available to him were less severe than the punishment the couple received whatever the sentence the couple would have been eligible under state law for parole after serving one quarter of it the federal "guidelines and statutory requirements are very restrictive " says mr ranstrom "its a train wreck anyway you look at it " there are american indians serving time in the federal prison system thats more proportionately than any other racial group according to census and bureau of prisons data tribal members living on reservations are incarcerated at a rate of more than per residents the next group is african americans who are imprisoned at a rate of per the rate of incarceration only partially tells the story according to a study commissioned by the u s sentencing commission a federal agency that creates the guidelines federal judges use in sentencing it showed that indian offenses amount to less than of the overall federal caseload but constitute a significant portion of the violent crime in federal court "over of manslaughter cases and over of sexual abuse cases arise from indian jurisdiction and nearly half of all the murders and assaults arise from indian jurisdiction " said the report fort belknap reservation like many reservations here is far from any major population centers great falls the closest is miles away the communities on the reservation are spread over square miles making them even more isolated lodge pole is one of the larger ones situated in the little rocky mountain chain where farming and ranching are the primary occupations two years ago ms wing who is about feet tall with long black hair was attending fort belknap college in a health program she says she wanted to do research for the tribe on a contaminated water problem she also worked with teens on the reservation supervising those who were considered by the tribal court to be at risk for drugs and delinquency before it burned the house she lived in was a small wood frame structure with three bedrooms a basement and a carport it had neither plumbing nor a well water had to be hauled in in five gallon jugs and blue water bottles from about a mile away residents had to use an outhouse april began as a big party to celebrate multiple birthdays around that time cousins friends siblings aunts and uncles all tribe members gathered at the decrepit wood frame house ms wing was the primary guest of honor it was a saturday and her th birthday was the following week angel lynn denny ms wings second cousin was there too she left at one point and went home to call her parents who were at a basketball tournament with her younger siblings "we told her she had to leave because there was drinking " says ms wings husband kenneth arcand in a phone interview from the federal prison in colorado where he is serving his sentence there was beer and whisky some participants left and went to local bars before returning mr arcand and ms wing say the alcohol brought out simmering animosities over a central question who owned the house the land had been in the family for generations evidenced by a vacant one room log cabin that had belonged to ms wings great grandfather but the house itself was claimed by two branches of the family that of ms wings father and that of her uncle a fistfight broke out two years later no one is sure who started the fight or who came up with the idea to burn the house what the participants do agree on is that most were drunk the fire that caused the most damage began in the living room according to court documents the party goers evacuated and were standing outside the house when a young teen began crying says ms wing ms wing says her cousin angel had returned to the house unnoticed and had been asleep in a back room several people including mr arcand tried to go back inside but were turned away by the heat and smoke according to court testimony "i ran through the back door and tried to get into the house but the flames were already climbing up the wall " he recalls the crowd formed a human pyramid to boost would be rescuers through the bedroom window one of the rescuers thought he found the girl but was overcome by the smoke and couldnt pull her out according to court testimony after the body was discovered tribal police realizing the crime was out of their jurisdiction called the federal bureau of investigation during questioning the couple confessed to setting the fire but later recanted they were released on their own recognizance and later received instructions through the mail on when to report to court at the time prosecutors were operating under instructions from attorney general john ashcroft to pursue the severest possible charges in all cases the federal district of montana followed the instructions in according to the u s sentencing commission defendants there received sentences nearly double the national average mr arcand recalls thinking that he and his wife would be found not guilty because concluding that they had set out to purposely kill the young woman "was wrong " it took the jury in great falls less than four hours to convict them as he sentenced ms wing federal district judge sam haddon noted that a state court would have handed down a more lenient sentence but he continued "my personal preference what i would do as an individual if not constrained by the law is itself in the view of the court irrelevant " he said the court was "obliged to impose a sentence of life imprisonment " during their subsequent appeal the ninth u s circuit court of appeals upheld the convictions one judge on the three judge panel richard clifton while upholding the convictions wrote "separately to express my dismay at the consequences of the result we reach " judge clifton continued "it is appropriate that the defendants be seriously punished for what they did but these life sentences do not square with my concept of justice " he expressed hope that the executive branch might intervene to reduce the sentence anthony gallagher the federal public defender who defended ms wing says a clemency request for a pardon or commutation is his last option the supreme court decided in june not to take the case recently congress has begun discussing changing the way jurisdiction is decided on tribal land a committee with the federal bar association has taken up the cause of pushing for changes as well as the national association of criminal defense lawyers sitting in a conference room at the womens prison outside oakland calif ms wing wiped away tears as she talked about her cousin acknowledging how the incident has torn apart the tribe and her family she says she has come to terms with the possibility she wont see her home or husband again ms wing was offered a plea bargain that would have given her years but she wanted to go to trial "we knew we would face life but i wanted the truth to be known that there was no malice and we didnt know she was there " she says she and mr arcand once worked at the tastee bite cafe in chinook ms wing was a waitress he had worked his way up from dishwasher to cook in letters written on their behalf before they were sentenced the owners of the cafe karen and frank latray said they sometimes left the couple in charge "i trusted them to operate the business in these occasions and also trusted them with the money i knew every penny would be in the till and accounted for until i returned " ms latray said in court papers now ms wing reports for work at a m at the prisons garment factory which produces parachutes for the military and blankets used in disaster relief there she works on a computer and helps develop cost estimates for the products the prison produces remembering the battle for the house which led to her cousins death is painful she says "it was just greed " ms wing has written to her cousins immediate family asking forgiveness but says they havent responded "my life is nothing compared to angels " ms wing says "nothing can ever replace her life i do pray i get a second chance but i know god has a plan " she says "im not saying hell take me out of here but i know he has a plan " the spot where angel died is marked by a foot white cross friends and family have left a softball and a pink portable cassette player at its base symbols of the teens love of music dance and sports a small herd of horses graze at the site of the burned structure and the outhouse is barely visible through the tall grass less than a mile away there is a sweat lodge resembling a cloth covered igloo behind an uncles home heated by granite rocks in a pit several times ms wings parents have gone there to sweat moral and physical impurities out of their system in preparation for a three day fast and a sun dance where they have prayed for the incarcerated couple and ms wings deceased cousin angels father bruce denny sitting in the family living room that has become a shrine to the teen says the incident has forever changed his family at first he refused to believe she was dead "i was in shock i went blank there im still inside myself " he says "her high school class just graduated i couldnt go to the ceremony i just couldnt " mr denny says he hasnt thought about whether the life sentences are just "i just went with what the system said the punishment should be " he says "we live by a system and whatever the system gives thats what i go with "
