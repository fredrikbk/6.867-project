computer chip makers pick up pace in multicore race a race to cram more electronic brains on computer chips is accelerating and prompting new moves to address the difficulty of programming such complex creations in one development advanced micro devices inc has set a date of sept to deliver a long awaited chip called barcelona that is crucial to its battle with rival intel corp that amd product puts four calculating engines or processor "cores " on a single piece of silicon intel meanwhile today plans to press a recent advantage over amd by expanding a family that bundles two dual core chips together the company is adding a model with unusually low power consumption and a fast high end model it also is using aggressive pricing many of intels four processor models now cost the same as comparable dual processor products "weve really eliminated every reason not to go to quad core " said kirk skaugen a vice president in intels digital enterprise group others have pushed the multicore concept even further sun microsystems inc which last week discussed a new version of a chip with eight processor cores today will provide new details about a core chip arriving next year that chip code named rock may attract more attention for another feature built in circuitry for minimizing a bottleneck that has prevented software from fully exploiting multicore chips "so far the software revolution has not happened " said marc tremblay a sun senior vice president if rock can ease the programming problem "we think its a pretty big deal " for years chip makers boosted performance by increasing the internal timing pulses on chips a measure called clock speed without any effort programmers found their creations kept working faster those easy gains have all but ended because high clock speeds consume too much electrical power so chip makers began boosting the capacity of their chips by adding more processors exploiting that capability relies in part on breaking programs apart into sequences of instructions called threads that can be executed simultaneously not all software uses threads effectively even those that do can face a problem because of safeguards built into chips to prevent conflicts as two threads seek to draw the same piece of data from memory such as spouses simultaneously trying to access the same bank account mr tremblay said those safeguards which work like locks mean that other threads often wait around before they can do any useful work sun predicts rock will be the first chip that builds in a widely discussed technology called transactional memory it doesnt prevent contention over data it detects conflicts that occur and repeats any operations affected by them said mark moir a sun senior staff engineer software prepared to exploit the technology should see big performance benefits he said other companies are considering hardware changes to help programmers exploit multicore chips intel for example is considering adding built in circuitry that takes over a function called a task scheduler ordinarily a piece of software that maps out which processor core should execute specific threads said sean koehl an intel technology strategist amd for its part is expected to propose expanding the basic set of instructions for the widely used x chip design starting with a function called a profiler that monitors operations on a chip and can allow software to make speedy decisions about the best ways to carry them out the sunnyvale calif companys initial barcelona model will operate at two gigahertz a slower clock speed than some analysts expected intel by contrast said it is raising the maximum clock speed of its four processor xeon products to three gigahertz from gigahertz
