markets crisis tests resolve of fed officials washington as an academic federal reserve chairman ben bernanke studied the policy mistakes that led to the great depression and the ways dislocations in financial markets can affect the rest of the economy now he is getting a chance to put theory into practice amid strained credit markets and a volatile stock market the fed the european central bank and their counterparts in other parts of the world last week pumped billions of dollars and euros into money markets to keep short term interest rates from rising as demand for short term funds overwhelmed the supply it was the biggest such maneuver since the sept terrorist attacks for its part the bush administration declined to lift regulatory limits on mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac to allow them to buy more mortgages president bush and treasury secretary henry paulson instead sought to bolster confidence a key commodity at times like this by emphasizing the fundamental strength of the global economy how mr bernanke and authorities around the world respond in the days ahead will affect whether the crisis passes without lasting damage or deepens to the point where the fed and other central banks set aside anxieties about inflation and reluctance to appear to be bailing out investors who made bad bets what more can policy makers and regulators do the next step would be for the fed to cut interest rates to make borrowing cheaper affecting banks hedge funds businesses holders of adjustable rate mortgages and consumers and credit more available overseas the european central bank bank of england and bank of japan could defer previously anticipated rate increases a serious deterioration in markets or spreading credit crunch could prompt a quick fed move futures markets have priced in the possibility of a rate cut even before the feds next scheduled meeting sept if the situation doesnt improve a sept rate cut is likely but if markets stabilize and credit begins to flow normally as fed officials hope the central bank is likely to hold its key rate at a while longer to fend off inflation the bank of japan is set to weigh rates next week and the ecb on sept todays turmoil is creating obvious comparisons to then a financial crisis at first crippled emerging asian economies without threatening the u s or other western economies but when russia devalued its currency and defaulted on foreign debts in august it sent a shock wave through global markets in early september then fed chairman alan greenspan declared the u s couldnt "remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world experiencing greatly increased stress " a few weeks later hedge fund long term capital management imploded trading in numerous markets came to a near halt the new york fed organized a rescue of ltcm and the fed cut interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point between late september and mid november the u s escaped recession whether todays credit crisis looks as bad is a subject of intense dispute "in a lot of big boys were really scared " said a former government official and veteran of "right now a lot of the big boys are saying how can i profit from this that feels a little different " big corporations such as merrill lynch kraft foods citigroup ibm even bear stearns &amp co have been able to sell debt recently by one quantifiable indicator the episode isnt yet as severe as when markets are stressed investors pay more for the most liquid or most easy to sell securities in the spread between yields on the most heavily traded treasury debt the easiest to sell and less heavily traded but still secure treasury issue widened by more than two tenths of a percentage point that was a huge gap that showed just how risk averse investors had become in recent weeks the analogous spread has widened less than two hundredths of a percentage point but comparisons are difficult the greatest stresses today are in markets that were far less important in their evolution since then has made it much harder for regulators or wall street ceos to know precisely where the risks lurk among todays big fears that commercial and investment banks thinking they have used derivatives to lay off the risk of defaults will discover they effectively bought insurance from hedge funds whose financial survival depends on credit from those same commercial and investment banks that big firms are exposed to troubled markets in ways they dont realize or havent disclosed or that players with heavy borrowing will have to dump their holdings and make everything worse one unusual feature of the current crisis is that the problems started in the u s in the subprime mortgage market but seem to be most acute in europe consequently the ecb has been more aggressive than the fed in putting money into markets to relieve strains the german government not the u s has had to organize the rescue of a troubled institution ikb deutsche industries bank ag which had invested heavily in u s mortgage backed securities todays crisis in large part reflects an inability to accurately value collateral such as pools of mortgages and uneasiness about the computer models used to value complex securities that leads those who have money to insist on higher rates and tougher terms and in some cases to keep more money in reserve just in case the authorities goal isnt to stop prices of stocks bonds and mortgage backed securities from falling as the market reassesses risks it is to prevent either a generalized loss of confidence that freezes markets or a generalized credit crunch in which even credit worthy borrowers cant get loans in an unusual move that reflected unusual circumstances the fed last week encouraged dealers through which it operates to offer government guaranteed mortgage backed securities alone as collateral for short term loans instead of the usual custom of using them with treasury debt and bonds issued by fannie mae and freddie mac the fed hasnt done that at all this decade the move sparked some speculation that the fed was trying to prop up the price of mortgage backed securities in a statement friday the federal reserve bank of new york cited a desire for "operational simplicity " outside analysts said the fed was trying to make it easier for dealers to finance their inventories of mortgage backed securities and possibly to avoid aggravating a possible shortage of treasurys available for use as collateral officials outside the fed aware that their most significant contribution may be to avoid undermining public and investor confidence have been careful not to suggest anything approaching panic mr bush took off on a planned vacation christopher cox chairman of the securities and exchange commission is on vacation in alaska though in touch with his staff mr paulson did two television interviews on wednesday and has been invisible since the market turmoil prompted the presidents working group on financial markets the treasury the fed the sec and the commodities futures trading commission to trigger protocols established by mr paulson shortly after he took office last year they include a detailed list of who is going to call financial institutions risk managers traders and chief executives to keep tabs how often they should call and the like when he first joined treasury from goldman sachs mr paulson instructed emil henry then the treasury official in charge of financial institutions to craft guidelines for five or six "meltdown" scenarios one was a catch all "general withdrawal from risk taking " others include a liquidity crisis stock market meltdown and oil shock the working group has held conference calls principally among staff at least once a day in recent days just last tuesday at a regularly scheduled meeting the fed decided to leave rates unchanged and reasserted that its predominant worry remains inflation since then credit markets have grown tighter and problems have spread from subprime mortgages to larger mortgages and asset backed commercial paper "if credit is becoming more restricted and the fed doesnt do anything it is accommodating a tightening " said ray stone of stone &amp mccarthy research associates some fed officials worry a rate cut now might suggest the bank is focused on the markets rather than on the economy others see a growing economic justification for easing some analysts suspect mr bernanke who has been in office for months will be reluctant to cut rates in order to expunge belief in the "greenspan put" wall streets term for the perceived readiness of his predecessor to cut rates and bail investors out of bad decisions a put option protects its holder against investment losses senior fed officials insist the fed never acted that way noting that it raised rates in even though that inflicted damage on the bond market and it didnt protect stock market investors from heavy losses early in the s mr bernanke they say will be motivated by conventional considerations growth inflation and financial stability kara scannell contributed to this article
