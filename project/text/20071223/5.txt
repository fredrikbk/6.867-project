love &amp money so many gifts but so hard to say no my mother in law called earlier this week she was taking our four year old daughter to dance class and she said she had forgotten to bring the gifts my wife amy had bought for our daughters dance instructor i relayed the message to amy but to myself i was thinking just one thing "the dance instructor who dont we give gifts to " its one of the challenges of the season everyone is flush with holiday spirit and wants to play santa to seemingly everyonewho orbits their life no matter how remote the orbit and they want you to pitch in but theres not enough money to stretch across everyone you happen to interact with from time to time whether its colleagues asking for money for the office cleaning crew or soccer moms and dads wanting to buy a gift for the assistant coach or parents at school looking to reward a gym teacher the holidays inevitably bring out a rash of requests to open your wallet a little wider such requests are made so easily but they arent so easily refused giving a little something to the people who touch your life is hardly a new concept i remember my grandparents would stick a few extra dollars in an envelope for the milkman in our home amy gives gifts to our kids teachers and apparently our daughters dance instructor she also gives a gift to our cleaning lady those decisions are easy to make because we decide on our own who gets what but what do you do when you get a request to contribute to someone elses holiday gift what do you do when youre one of dozens of people receiving an email from somebody you barely know sure you can say no but with so many people hitting "reply to all " do you want to be known as the person who apparently wasnt willing to bring cheer to somebody else eric a friend in atlanta says that while you can ignore the first email "its very difficult to ignore the follow up email where theres only two or three holdouts " "im at a complete loss " he says for knowing how best to manage such a situation my friend anne in minneapolis has a long list of responses to help her navigate such situations one of my favorites on her list "i prefer to give gifts one on one but thanks for including me " that response anne says "is a polite way of saying you dont dig the group scene without announcing whether you intend to give a gift " not everybody though is bothered by the requests tara a friend in pennsylvania says her third grade daughter has four main teachers and seven "specials" teachers for gym art music and other classes tara says she couldnt afford to give them all a gift but by pooling money the class raised &# enough for nice gifts for all the teachers and she says nobody knows who gives and who doesnt the only downside of group giving tara says is that "unless everyone gets together to present the gift the person who collects the money often gets all the credit so in some ways donating to the office collection is truly selfless they are never going to know you gave them anything so there really is nothing in it for you other than knowing you helped someone out during the holidays " but thats reason enough to do it tara says "most of these people on the receiving end of email collections are people who can really use the dough cafeteria workers teachers and security guards " she says "so open up your wallet and give &# scrooge " i asked amy her thoughts on this since she is the resident elf in our family she sees merit in the practice "parents for instance always give to their kids teachers but what about the school nurse or the front office workers who make the school run i can see why moms would send around a note asking to contribute to a gift to show those people they are appreciated too " that said amy recalls that when our son was younger moms would call to solicit contributions for the teachers "and i always felt pressured to contribute to whatever the moms in the class were doing even though id already bought presents for his teachers because i was a new parent at the school and i didnt want to look like i was being cheap " she says she eventually realized that "its just silly to worry about that someones not going to judge me if i dont want to participate now i say thanks for calling but i bought something on my own " still she knows that peer pressure can make people feel uncomfortable during a christmas adopt a family effort at her office this year a sign up sheet hung on a wall where people would note whether they were participating "that can be real pressure to sign up when you see all these other peoples names but they dont see yours " amy says "but we made it clear that no one should feel obligated to participate after all these requests are happening at every school and job and church and organization that people are involved with you cant expect everyone to contribute to every request that comes along " jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal email lovemoney wsj com
