eurolinks daily view foreign fund seekers like merrill might fill gaps with payout cut online edition the money is rolling in from the middle east and far east but not quite rapidly enough to fill the holes in western bank balance sheets isnt it time for wall streets limping titans merrill lynch citigroup and morgan stanley to follow ubs and scrap their dividends the latest to go cap in hand to asia is merrill it is close to getting a &# billion capital injection from singapores temasek that certainly will be a useful step toward shoring up its capital base but the investment bank has already taken a &# billion write down under its old boss stan oneal the new chairman john thain is expected to take an additional &# bilion or so hit if so temaseks cash would only fill roughly of the gap nixing the payout to shareholders which was &# billion over the last year would nudge merrills capital further in the right direction its a similar story with the other banks that have come a cropper as a result of this years credit crunch citibank would save the most it spent &# billion on dividends in the past year thats more than the &# billion it has just raised from the abu dhabi investment authority so far only ubs has both tapped eastern funds for cash raising &# billion from singapores gic and a mystery investor thought to be from saudi arabia and dispensed with its cash dividend valued at &# billion in the past months the total savings from these two moves will be &# billion more than filling the &# billion hole left by its write downs of course banks dont like to abandon their dividends this normally goes down badly with shareholders but the main alternatives selling assets at knock down prices or raising capital on expensive terms arent attractive either whats more at least the new eastern shareholders wont complain theyve cut deals that guarantee them high coupons for several years regardless of what happens to ordinary shareholders there is of course another option the banks could operate with depleted capital bases but slam on their lending brakes its not clear that this would be in shareholders interests as their banks would be ceding market share to better capitalized rivals but theres also a broader public policy issue slamming on the brakes would exacerbate the credit crunch central banks have been trying to put out the fire by spraying hose pipes of cheap public money if shareholders quibble over losing their dividends the authorities should give them a shove ubs mystery shareholder it was russias actions that befuddled former u k prime minister winston churchill when he said the country was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma much the same could be said today of the swiss and some of the steps taken by their banking system ubs the swiss bank has answered the riddle surrounding subprime mortgages and their related instruments by adding mystery selling a stake to the singapore government whose intentions arent entirely clear it stuffed the whole mess inside an enigma by proposing an unnamed middle eastern investor as a buyer of an additional stake the identity of that mystery investor has fueled the rumor mill could it be the omani government or perhaps the saudi crown prince this opacity has irritated some swiss shareholders its hard to blame them theyre touchy after a two stage &# billion write down and an abrupt change of chief executive that came with no guarantee that the losses are over holders of less than of the shares arent obliged to reveal their identity but the banks board the same one that led it into the crisis is now asking shareholders for blind trust that it has found a suitable investor to help guide the way out its fair to wonder if a willing buyer in this circumstance may not want some additional influence in return for its money ubs is putting the matter to shareholders next year the board hasnt decided whether the vote on the dilutive stake sales will be a package deal or whether investors will be allowed to opt for singapore but not the veiled buyer either way identifying the new shareholder be a helpful gesture opacity has been a big part of the problem for banks this year theres no need for more nintendos wii shortage millions of kids and parents wont have a wii under the christmas tree this year whats strange is that they suffered the same fate last year nintendos hot game console is still suffering shortages some months after it was introduced in the u s this isnt a case of santas elves having insufficient production methods it is more likely a case of the japanese group trying to manufacture a buzz nintendo denies the shortage is intentional yet its usually easy enough to scale up the manufacture of electronic devices the company has almost doubled production to million units a month further increases should have been simple enough for the relatively unsophisticated device and its difficult to think of another gadget that experienced shortages lasting more than a few months let alone more than a year whether intentional not or somewhere in between the shortage has benefits for nintendo its rather odd but scenes of parents rioting over wiis only seem to encourage children to ask for them and parents to resort to more desperate measures this buzz undoubtedly persists after the tinsel has been taken down its telling that the retail price of a wii remains stubbornly high while rivals prices get slashed theres a cost though nintendo may be forgoing &# billion from console sales this holiday season according to analysts and nintendo is running the risk that would be players might defect to rivals such as the xbox or playstation that could reduce profits that come from selling games to new players more than three quarters of profit comes from software rather than hardware in each gaming cycle if customers defect nintendos shortfall will look like a gigantic blunder hugo dixon jeffrey goldfarb robert
