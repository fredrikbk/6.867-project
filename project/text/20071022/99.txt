why firms are returning to their roots in corporate boardrooms across the globe the commodity boom is producing a back to basics boomlet aluminum giant alcoa is getting out of the plastic wrap and some automotive businesses newmont mining the worlds second largest gold producer by output plans to jettison its merchant banking unit and anglo american the no mining company by output has put its tarmac road surfacing unit on the block economists call it respecialization companies call it focusing on core assets and it comes and goes in cycles in the first phase companies with cash and ambition make acquisitions aimed at broadening their business lines the idea is to cushion the blow from a bad year in any one business the trend continues until wall street decides those companies have become too diversified and starts favoring "pure plays " or a conglomerate stumbles because it has gotten too big to manage profitably then the pendulum swings back after some board directed soul searching companies begin to shed tangential operations "corporate history is littered with companies buying beyond their core competency " said joseph quinlan chief market strategist at bank of america whats different this time around is that the continuing commodity boom and the emergence of a handful of dominant global players is driving the respecialization trend if alcoa wants to compete with anglo australian rival rio tinto it cant afford the distraction of plastic wrap indeed the metals business itself is so strong that it makes little sense to go too far afield mining iron ore copper or aluminum for example is far more profitable than the businesses of processing it another factor is that the supply of such metals is limited by mother nature the earth has only so many tons of ore and no one has figured out a way to commercially manufacture replacements heavy demand and global competition make it more urgent than ever for companies to secure those limited resources before some rival does there is a downside to respecialization even though the castoff businesses tend to be lower margin they still provide a cushion in inevitable downturns but the pressure to specialize wont go away anytime soon market watchers have been predicting a drop off in the price of certain commodities for several quarters but demand remains resilient pumping up the earnings of most commodity companies in the past when companies have had strong earnings they have often gone out to buy related businesses prompting a flurry of merger and acquisition activity think of it as accessorizing this time though there are two parallel tracks for m&amp a activity one for buying very select and core assets and the other for selling extraneous businesses "in this cycle there has been a lot more capital discipline for companies to not overextend themselves you are not seeing the conglomerence " mr quinlan says for one thing the recent tightening of credit makes even cash rich companies more prudent and more focused companies tend to be more successful in their core businesses they are better able to wring out still greater efficiencies and profits making side businesses less critical to the bottom line stiffer competition in the noncore businesses also whittles away what were once easy profit centers meanwhile thanks to freer trade and globalization corporate powerhouses are emerging from every corner of the world ready to eat the lunch of even long established leaders who take their eyes off the prize what further distinguishes the current round of respecialization is the china phenomenon china with its manufacturing prowess as well as india the middle east and other developing nations are driving up demand and with it prices for so much and so many raw materials that there is less need for producers of these materials to bother much with processing them "in early periods of industry development there is a strong incentive to integrate forward and backward to avoid losing market power " says robert w crandall senior economist at the brookings institution thats why auto makers owned steel plants and car rental companies steelmakers owned timberlands railroads and trucking companies but as a company becomes larger and more diverse it has more trouble spreading its expertise and ultimately becomes less efficient conglomerates generally learn this lesson the hard way mr crandall says ""people make &# million and then they think they are smarter than everyone else "" he says companies like alcoa also are returning to their roots in part as a defensive move in the past few years miners rio tinto and bhp billiton and brazilian iron ore producer companhia vale do rio doce have been growing rapidly and raking in huge profits they concentrate on mining and selling commodities and have relatively few other operations rivals essentially have no choice but to follow suit or they could end up as takeover targets as was the case with alcan this year rio tinto purchased alcan for its primary aluminum assets and aims to sell off the canadian companys noncore businesses hoping to escape a similar fate alcoa said this month that it was taking an &# million charge to sell off its packaging and automotive businesses in an effort to focus on its mining and refining businesses likewise norsk hydro which had significant investments in oil and gas stripped down this year to become primarily an aluminum company in the end consumers are the ones who benefit from industries that respecialize once industries such as aluminum steel and automobiles get out of so many side businesses smaller innovators have a chance to come in and compete for the market share in the side businesses which sparks competition and ultimately lower prices and the mature industry itself better wrings out inefficiencies within its core business making its product less expensive
