boss talk npr chief ken stern rides the airwaves unlike commercial radio public stations flourish opportunity in podcasting in an era when commercial radio seems to be floundering national public radio is hitting its stride some million people tune into its programming each week up from million a decade ago it has more than member stations up from a decade ago in some places like seattle its "morning edition" is consistently the most popular morning drive show on any radio station it is expanding foreign coverage winning more underwriting dollars and forging into the digital age with online streams and podcasts much of this growth has occurred under ken stern nprs chief executive who joined as executive vice president in but there are clouds on the horizon the average listener is getting older each year member stations everywhere face more competition from all kinds of new media options that didnt exist a few years ago like satellite radio the wall street journal interviewed mr stern about how to keep npr fresh in a rapidly changing media environment excerpts wsj your audience growth is impressive but the time each person spends listening to npr each day is declining what can you do to keep listeners tuned in longer mr stern all media face a lot of challenges of keeping people focused on their products if you look at the statistics time spent with any media is going down its fragmented across all sorts of different platforms the answer is better radio if we do that were going to hold people there are also multiple opportunities to engage with npr and public radio content on podcasts or listening online theres an extremely high opportunity for people to engage with our content in ways that arent measured by the standard time spent listening category wsj a small portion of public radio budgets comes from federal organizations like the corporation for public broadcasting why is it important for the government to support public radio mr stern its important to building civic society its important to democracy its important to public discourse lets not forget the vast majority of money from the federal government from the appropriation for public broadcasting goes to stations as opposed to national public radio in washington the last locally controlled locally held locally driven medium in this country is really public broadcasting support from congress for that is incredibly important when we say only of funding for public broadcasting comes from the federal government thats true but its much higher in cases of rural stations and minority stations and those are the ones that would be most hurt by cutbacks in federal funding wsj could npr survive without public funding mr stern yes as a company we could but wed be a lesser company for it because the organizations that couldnt survive the rural and minority stations are really a critical component of the community of public radio and npr if you go to rural communities often the only station in town is the public radio station wsj your biggest show is "morning edition " with million listeners you have some public radio competition now your own new morning show geared toward younger listeners "the bryant park project " plus another morning show is coming next year from a consortium of radio providers including wnyc the bbc and public radio international wont they cut into that core "morning edition" audience mr stern im not worried about the state of "morning edition " its the second most listened to program in radio commercial or noncommercial after the rush limbaugh show its the signature of high quality news in this country its grown enormously its continuing to improve were fortunate now that were going into a multichannel universe where there is in fact an opportunity for multiple purveyors of news and information to reach audiences im actually quite optimistic about the future wsj where is the new morning show running mr stern youre seeing it on a lot of different places youre seeing it on hd channels extra digital stations available on certain radio models youre seeing it on sirius satellite radio youre seeing it online and on podcasts there are markets where you have multiple npr stations in a single city and stations looking for differentiated services i think thats actually one of the things driving wnyc theyve got two stations theyve got "morning edition" on both theyre looking for some differentiation between the two i think thats a very sensible strategy for stations to pursue wsj next month npr will launch an expanded online music service to introduce people to new songs and artists wont that compete with stations that already offer strong online music services mr stern npr and public radio stations around the country are already huge tastemakers in the music area the truth is most of the content you cant find unless youre in the broadcast signal of these stations or you happen to have to have some type of map that allows you to navigate the hundreds of web sites of public radio if we can draw together this huge american archive of content in the music area thats something very powerful and well add more on top of it wsj npr is taking a strong position that the new internet royalty rates for streamed music are too high but some performers say they deserve higher fees how do you answer them mr stern npr and public radio have always been very close with the artistic community we really see ourselves as partners its always been our desire to see fair fees paid to performers for the value they derive i actually havent met a lot of those performers who are worried public radio is not paying enough ive seen and met lots of performers on the way who are concerned that higher fees might drive npr and public radio out of the internet business because if that happens and we have to cut back our service or stop serving the american public that would be bad for audiences and it would be worse for artists npr and public radio stations drive an enormous amount of awareness and sales for artists wsj in joan kroc heir to a mcdonalds fortune died and left &# million to npr can you provide an update on how that money is helping mr stern the kroc gift was an extraordinary gift but it was for the permanent endowment and the money generated off the endowment is about of our budget we have to go out and raise the other every year when we got the kroc gift after a period of reflection and consultation with our stations we made two commitments we knew that we had to invest in more reporters both domestically and internationally we committed to and when we got to we stopped another thing we did we wanted to honor mrs kroc and her vision for npr and for the future and created the kroc fellowships in which we bring in three extraordinary young people every year for a year nine months at npr three months at a member station to build the future of public radio we have just welcomed the third class
