nissan races to make smaller cheaper cars industry shifts strategy as big vehicle sales fade simplifying the doors atsugi japan at a top secret session on car designs at a nissan motor co technical center chief product strategist carlos tavares recited the companys ambitious new mission to sell an expensive looking small car for the price of no frills models and somehow make a profit on it engineers grappling with this task for a year presented seven drawing board variations of a small car with a stylish rocket shaped body and oval headlights reminiscent of marquise cut diamonds but the designs just werent cheap enough to make said mr tavares "all of this is costly " he grumbled "we still have a lot of work to do " small low cost cars have abruptly become the next frontier for the global auto industry after almost years in which major car makers dismissed such vehicles as a low profit afterthought as gas prices keep rising consumer tastes around the world are shifting toward smaller more fuel efficient cars in the u s drivers are trading in gas guzzling suvs like the nissan armada for smaller models like the subcompact honda fit in developing markets where sales are exploding first time drivers are starting out with the smallest cheapest cars global demand for small cars is expected to grow by to million vehicles by with the growth coming mostly from developing markets according to auto research firm csm worldwide inc demand for big suvs during that time is expected to drop to million vehicles toyota motor corp recently said it may launch a car priced at around &# as early as aimed at large developing countries such as brazil russia india and china chrysler llc is tying up with chinas chery automobile co to make small cars for export world wide including the u s small cars are expected to dominate many auto makers displays at the tokyo motor show opening wednesday the industrys shift poses a challenge that no car maker has managed yet to meet how to make decent profits trucks and suvs earn to margins which for many popular models can mean &# to &# profit per vehicle even the best selling small cars like honda motor co s fit and toyotas yaris subcompact earn margins for manufacturers of just to about &# per car in emerging markets the cars are sold with fewer profit boosting features so car makers earn even less "most car makers are considered to be doing well if they break even on small cars " says tokyo based j p morgan analyst takaki nakanishi tokyo based nissan owned by renault sa of france has embarked on a particularly aggressive strategy nissan whose fortunes surged on its big suvs and high performance sports cars now is trying to reinvent itself as a maker of low priced "entry cars" aimed at the developing worlds hordes of first time drivers far behind the leaders in china nissan is trying to forge ahead in india and other emerging markets where it says it plans to offer a stylish car for &# to &# as early as and then will try to get its starter price down to &# its even exploring a venture with a maker of electric rickshaws to make a &# car the year old mr tavares is leading the charge for nissan the intense portuguese executive described by colleagues as having "gasoline in his veins " races single seat cars for fun and decorates his sparse office with framed pictures of race cars for his current mission he has assigned nissan engineers to study renaults boxy basic logan model produced by the companys dacia affiliate in romania for cost cutting inspiration yet mr tavares also insists that a new low cost car retain what he calls the "emotive" design of more upscale vehicles its important that an entry car not be seen as the "emerging market car " mr tavares says but rather something that makes owners feel like theyve entered the middle class nissans plan to get below &# is controversial says ashvin chotai head of asian auto industry research at consulting firm global insight inc "lots of people say the cost structure is just not feasible " but nissan managers say mr tavares sets tough goals and sticks to them "just when you think cost is under control hell flip to another topic and say the quality is a problem or im concerned about roominess " says thomas lane corporate vice president of product planning every little thing counts says mr tavares who calls building profitable small cars "the most demanding exercise for an auto company " mr tavaress success is crucial for nissan and year old ceo carlos ghosn when mr ghosn took over in the car maker hampered by management mishaps and a string of unattractive models was on the brink of bankruptcy with an operating profit margin of just mr ghosns turnaround relied on big models with high margins that sputtered in the past year leading to nissans first annual profit decline in seven years in the year ended march whats more while nissan focused on boosting profit margins and gaining u s market share it fell behind in the worlds fastest growing markets nissan entered china nearly two decades after volkswagen ag the market leader there by passenger car sales and five years after no general motors corp ford motor co already produces and sells several small cars in india while suzuki motor corp and hyundai motor co are ranked first and second by sales volume there nissan last year offered just one model in india and sold a total of cars forcing a determined game of catch up "we have to imagine different ways of making low cost cars " says mr ghosn who also heads renault in mr ghosn then renaults head of manufacturing and engineering put mr tavares in charge of renaults most crucial line of compact cars the megane and scenic series mr ghosn a brazilian born frenchman and mr tavares are both native portuguese speakers though they typically communicate in french and english the engineer had demonstrated his small car savvy while working on renaults tiny clio ii subcompact and other models under his leadership the megane and scenic got sportier aerodynamic grills and curvier trunks and became renaults most popular line accounting for more than a third of the companys auto revenues in in mr ghosn sent mr tavares to work on midsize cars at nissan where he soon became an executive vice president and a member of the board of directors this past april he effectively became mr ghosns no in tokyo just after the company reported its profit decline mr tavares concluded that nissan should focus a lot more on emerging markets to boost stagnating world wide sales but competition was already heating up rival toyota for instance outsold nissan by more than in markets outside north america europe and japan with million sales to nissans nissan had one secret weapon the no frills logan packed with little tricks that lowered its production costs to just half of renaults other small cars known within the company as the "conquistador car " it has helped renault enter more than markets and is built in seven countries including iran morocco and colombia "this is a simple car that can be produced everywhere in the world " says program director gerard detourbet at &# to &# the boxy car is one of the best selling models in the developing world mr tavares urged nissan engineers and product designers used to designing more expensive cars loaded with features for the u s and japan to memorize everything about the lowly logan down to how costs were trimmed for each part and how much each part costs to ship for instance the logan has a bumper and grill that are one continuous part which renault says can cut the cost of the front end by roughly half though it raises the price of repairing front end damage rear view mirrors on the right and left side of the car are almost exactly the same and the windshield is less curved than other models also cutting costs by about half because the parts are simpler to develop and produce renault says nissan is applying some of those benchmarks to its pear shaped tiida subcompact currently its best selling compact car world wide and known as the versa in the u s where it starts at &# on a visit to a factory in thailand last year mr tavares noticed that the complex shape of the tiidas door panels meant that half as many tiida doors as logan doors could be stacked in a shipping container his product planners said the higher priced tiida needs more complex doors than the logan he recounted but "i told them lets be serious " mr tavares says he told them to start "making sure when you design a part that they can be piled together " finding cost cuts on the tiida has helped product planners apply the change in thinking to new models he says they are focusing on details such as how much a certain kind of speedometer or door handle will add to production costs japanese auto makers also have been in a heated race to build the roomiest small cars and nissan engineers are working on ways to comfortably fit luggage and five passengers without making the car bigger and heavier overall mr tavares hopes for a big payoff in india where just eight of every adults own a car and car sales are growing by about a year analysts estimate about of million cars sold last year were small cars nissan plans to build entry cars for india and nearby emerging markets in a new factory to be jointly owned with renault and indian jeep maker mahindra &amp mahindra ltd some would eventually be exported to developed markets in europe and elsewhere though those would have to comply with tighter safety and environmental standards nissan says it could ultimately produce and sell a car in india for as little as &# and has started working with partners renault and indian electric rickshaw and motorcycle maker bajaj auto ltd to try to come up with a &# car indias tata motors ltd already plans a "peoples car" next year that it says will cost rupees or about &# analysts and competitors say massive scale would be needed to turn a profit and tatas initial sales target is two million units over the first five years tata will give few details about the car but a spokesman says it will have four doors four to five seats and a cubic centimeter rear engine similar to the size used in "minicars" sold in japan there also has long been a &# car in india built by suzuki and its indian partner maruti udyog ltd whose joint venture holds more than half the entire indian car market the maruti lacks the pizzazz nissan seeks its rudimentary design is basically unchanged since it was introduced in it took around years to become profitable eventually accounting for nearly of cars sold annually in india by the mid s but its peak may have passed last year maruti suzukis slightly more upscale new model the alto which sells for &# more was twice as popular nissan hopes its down market strategy will eventually increase profits by building brand loyalty so entry car consumers will trade up to a higher margin nissan model by contrast rival honda doesnt want to compromise its brand image by selling a model cheaper than its &# city subcompact in india honda can count on its motorcycle sales to build its identity in developing countries "we believe people will pay a premium for our cars " says takanobu ito hondas chief operating officer of automobile operations likewise toyota pushes its corolla in emerging markets but it acknowledges that its &# pricetag is too high and is looking at changing tack with a low cost car "maybe were behind" on that trend says a company spokesman nissan also is moving production to low cost areas and using more local suppliers in place of longtime japanese suppliers this year at its thailand plant nissan cut its parts imported from japan from an already low to it also is soliciting more local staff and input instead of relying on designers and engineers in japan nissan and renault plan a joint business center in chennai india in early mr tavares says he hopes local input will help designers cut costs and generate sales by offering only features consumers want in each country at a recent corporate strategy meeting to discuss the companys plans in india nissan executives spoke determinedly about turning india into a global small car hub but when people within nissan challenge mr tavares on his plans he says he reminds them of what renault did with the logan "any time you need to achieve a cost breakthrough people will tell you that its not possible " mr tavares says
