copy of the preliminary ipo prospectus reviewed by the wall street journal alibabas revenue in the years first half was million yuan &# million more than the same period last year it has about million registered users and since it began charging for some services a few years ago has amassed more than paying members net profit this year is expected to more than triple to &# million but as alibaba has expanded so has its exposure to problems from counterfeiting to product safety in its preliminary prospectus alibaba acknowledges that in providing a way for importers and manufacturers to communicate online it risks listing tainted products and counterfeits "we anticipate that certain items listed on our marketplaces infringe third party intellectual property rights or that suppliers list products and services that are substandard or potentially controversial " it says the nonprofit international anticounterfeiting coalition says it considers alibaba to be a platform for counterfeits one of its members rob holmes ceo of ipcybercrime com llc a private investigator that specializes in helping brand owners identify violations of intellectual property rights says alibaba is "a major thorn in the side" of his clients manufacturers peddling counterfeit products use the "buying leads" section as a way to find customers mr holmes says another problem some suppliers who have legitimate contracts with apparel brands covertly produce unauthorized lots of the products and sell them on alibaba mr holmes says "i would say about a third of the product on alibaba is gray market easily " he says the company declined to comment because it is in the quiet period before its ipo but alibaba says on its web site that it regularly cooperates with intellectual property rights owners industry associations and government agencies to fight against violators "alibaba com respects intellectual property rights and we expect our users to do the same " the statement says in
