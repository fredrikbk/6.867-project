the morning brief eu says microsoft has capitulated online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here little more than a month after losing its appeal microsoft seems to have resolved the major antitrust disputes putting it at odds with the european union by granting access to key "interoperability" details about the windows operating system to open source software developers just after noon in brussels the european commission announced the u s software giant had agreed to make three "substantial changes" that will bring it in compliance with the commissions precedent setting ruling against the company the commission had ruled that microsoft illegally abused the dominant market position of windows by refusing to share "interoperability information" with rivals who needed that information to make their software able to compete with microsofts on the windows platform and last month the european court of first instance essentially upheld the decision rejecting microsofts argument that release of interoperability information would let rivals copy its products and hurt its own ability to innovate without the sharing of such information the court said there was a risk microsoft could eliminate competition to comply with the decision microsoft has agreed to give access to the interoperability information to open source developers reduce the cost of such information to a one time euro &# fee and cut the royalties for the licensing of resulting products to from nearly "the agreements will be enforceable before the high court in london and will provide for effective remedies including damages for third party developers in the event that microsoft breaches those agreements " the commission said "these changes mean that open source competitors to microsoft will be able to provide businesses with competitive innovative alternatives to microsoft work group server products knowing that they are fully interoperable with microsofts windows desktop operating system " the commission said it would soon resolve how to punish microsoft for past non compliance with its rulings on the issue which had included the imposition of a million euro fine though that also covered another big outstanding issue and it noted microsoft could still be punished additionally if it fails to comply with "those obligations" in the future competition commissioner neelie kroes trumpeted what she described as a victory that would resonate for both microsoft rivals and computer users "it is regrettable that microsoft has only complied after a considerable delay two court decisions and the imposition of daily penalty payments " she said "however the measures that the commission has insisted upon will benefit computer users by bringing competition and innovation back to the server market " about an hour later microsoft said it was giving up the idea of another appeal todays announcements made no mention of the other big allegation against microsoft in the ruling and subsequent loss last month in the appeals court microsoft was accused of unfairly using windows dominance to gain an edge in the digital media market against such rivals as realnetworks by bundling its windows media player with windows the appeals court had sided with the commission on that one as well ruling microsoft obtained "an unparalleled advantage with respect to distribution of its product and to ensure the ubiquity of windows media player on client pcs throughout the world " but changes in the marketplace for digital media seem to have made that compliance issue moot ftc chief declines formal intel probe u s lawmakers members of the federal trade commission and rival advanced micro devices have all requested that the ftc join south korean and european regulators in opening a formal antitrust investigation of intel but government officials and lawyers involved in the proceeding tell the new york times that ftc chairwoman deborah majoras has rejected their requests the korean and eu regulators are looking into the practice of intel the worlds no maker of computer chips of offering large discounts to computer companies on the condition they dont use products from amd which has struggled to compete while the ftc has been conducting an informal review of amd complaints for more than a year ms majoras has declined to "elevate the inquiry to a formal investigation which would give staff members the authority to issue subpoenas and compel testimony from executives of the companies involved " the times explains "the action by the foreign regulators and the debate at the ftc is part of a fierce and protracted legal political and public relations battle between intel and amd over the global market for microprocessors " the paper says and that fight the times adds is one of the biggest antitrust issues in the u s and abroad "intel executives said the difference between american and foreign antitrust was that americans view it as protecting competition while the others use it to protect competitors " while amd and its allies argue intels pricing regimes are aimed at maintaining "a near monopoly on the chip market" and thus violate the sherman antitrust act an on a separate regulatory front the european commission this morning said it has extended an antitrust review of googles acquisition of doubleclick until the middle of next month to give it time to examine googles proposed remedies for any concerns microsoft and some other have been vocal critics of the deal arguing it will give google a dominant position in online advertising markets bear stearns chinas citic close to deal bear stearns and the chinese investment bank citic securities are close to a deal in which they would each invest about &# billion for a stake in the other and potentially team up for business in both the u s and asia people familiar with the matter tell the wall street journal "the investment highlights chinas increasing financial prowess on the global stage and the eagerness with which western firms are hoping to penetrate the insular chinese financial sector which is undergoing unprecedented growth but it wasnt immediately clear how much entry bear stearns would gain there " the journal says on a separate sino american front a new new york times cbs news poll indicates that "recent disclosures about tainted food lead coated toys and other dangerous imports from china have caused some concern among american consumers but not a wholesale rejection of chinese made goods " the times reports thirty five percent of respondents said chinese imports were more dangerous than products from other countries but "a majority said the recent wave of recalls just created a perception that chinese imports are more harmful than imports from other countries " the times adds and "said they were aware of a products country of origin when they made a purchase " turkey poised to hit kurds in iraq following a weekend attack by kurdish rebels that killed at least more turkish soldiers near the iraqi frontier turkey plans to hit back at kurds across the border despite appeals for restraint from the u s prime minister recep tayyip erdogan tells the times of london turkeys patience is running out "whatever is necessary will be done " he said "we dont have to get permission from anybody " mr erdogan also described a "serious wave of anti americanism" that is sweeping turkey called the u s war in iraq a failure and warned that if the u s congress approves a resolution accusing the ottoman turks of genocide against ethnic armenians during the first world war the u s "might lose a very important friend " the weekend attack was the most serious in recent memory by militant separatists from the outlawed kurdistan workers party the new york times notes and coming just days after the turkish parliament approved military action it seemed designed to provoke "we dont want to go into northern iraq its a mess " suat kinikli a lawmaker from mr erdogans party and a member of the foreign affairs committee tells the times but "i think weve passed the threshold it looks like for two days or three days there will be a holding off and a waiting period unless the u s comes up with something magic in the next few days which is highly unlikely well probably go in " the tough road ahead for bhutto pakistani opposition leader benazir bhutto yesterday called on the government to
