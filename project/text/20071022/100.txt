world of noises sounds and unsweet melodies i enjoyed your article on sloppy airport signage "to clarify sloppy signage airports hire wayfinders " marketplace oct but i had to cringe at the suggestion that the next wave of signage would include "talking signs and video signs " thats one thing we dont need when i wait at a gate at ohare international airport every few seconds i hear "the moving walkway is ending please look down " because its so loud speaks at both ends of the walkway and is always droning in my ears it becomes meaningless then theres the equally meaningless message repeated over and over at midway international airport telling us that no one will be allowed beyond security without a boarding pass well duh why do i need to hear that message if im already sitting at the gate whether im in the grocery store trying to ignore tvs blaring infomercials in the produce section and at the cashier stations or riding a bus on a line that cant afford to run on sundays but strangely has enough money to spend on more tvs blaring ads to the trapped passengers i cant hear myself think let alone read something even while awaiting a case on jury duty people who dont want to listen to the daytime tv playing in the main room have to walk to a stark back room where one can still hear the tv mumbling through the open door maybe if people had more opportunity to think they wouldnt need all this extra signage micromanaging each successive move brendan conner la grange park ill
