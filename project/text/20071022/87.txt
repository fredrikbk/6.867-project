the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources terrorism how the u s is vulnerable to insect attacks insects one of the oldest biological weapons could be a simple and cheap way for terrorists to inflict major damage on the u s writes jeffrey a lockwood in the boston globes ideas section which covers intellectual debates armies have long used bugs to spread disease among their enemies the black death arrived in europe after the mongols catapulted flea ridden corpses into the city of kaffa on the black sea says prof lockwood a professor of natural sciences and humanities at the university of wyoming those who fled from the city brought with them bubonic plague which killed million people in the th century more recently the japanese killed at least chinese in the s and s by dropping disease carrying fleas and cholera coated flies from planes according to a symposium of historians recent outbreaks of insect borne diseases suggest the u s isnt properly prepared to handle a deliberate attempt to infect people or destroy crops and livestock says prof lockwood since arriving in the u s in the mosquito borne west nile virus has killed and sickened nearly people a lack of national coordination left local authorities wasting time with poorly targeted spraying campaigns and missing opportunities to stop the diseases spread a terrorist could easily introduce rift valley fever which is similar to west nile virus but deadlier to the u s with only &# worth of supplies and a plane ticket from an afflicted african nation says charles bailey director of the national center for biodefense at george mason university slow moving insect borne diseases could also destroy millions of dollars of crops and livestock before they could be eradicated to effectively combat the problem prof lockwood recommends stockpiling vaccines and chemicals to kill various insects he says there also needs to be a reversal in a recent cut to funding for research into natural predators for problem insects finally the department of homeland security needs to put a higher priority on protecting the u s s agriculture a government accountability office report this

economists a survey conducted by yann algan of the paris school of economics and pierre cahuc of the sorbonne found that only of french people trust each other the th lowest percentage in a survey of nations only portugal and turkey had a lower level of trust newsweek internationals tracy mcnicoll says that the economists also found that compared to other nations the french have a greater distrust of such official institutions as the judiciary or unions and also find it easier to justify bribes or accept state handouts they arent entitled to the economists say that france wasnt always this way the suspicion of others emerged during the nazi occupation of world war ii and "a wary eye on ones neighbors and a penchant for regulation that would presumably ensure equal treatment " ironically regulations and bureaucracy only thickened the atmosphere of distrust the authors say the unavoidable "opaque negotiations with bureaucracies that handed out favors" has eroded the faith in state institutions meanwhile some regulations have fostered distrust between people and businesses for instance rules affording significant protections to tenants have made landlords highly wary of new lodgers so that despite an apparent housing shortage vacancy rates in paris can reach as high as more profoundly frances "trust deficit shackles the capacity to adapt reform and innovate " the authors say the dependence on regulations to compensate for a lack of trust in all kinds of relationships has slowed the economy they estimate that if the french were as trusting as the swedes who topped their survey frances unemployment rate would be three percentage points lower than the current and that the economy would be larger newsweek international oct mental health tv character is therapeutic
