hollywood writers threaten to strike over contract woes an emphatic strike authorization vote from movie and tv writers sets the stage for a day negotiating window that will test hollywoods appetite for a showdown over how writers are to be compensated in the digital age members of the writers guild of america overwhelmingly voted on friday in favor of authorizing a strike if they fail to sign a new labor contract with the studios by the time their current agreement expires on oct nearly half of the wgas voting members cast votes with of those who voted in favor of authorizing a walkout if negotiations for a new contract fail while hollywoods writers could strike as early as nov much depends on what happens between the guild and the studios when negotiations resume today since the two sides began formally meeting in mid july no progress was made until early last week when the studios took one of their most contentious proposals off the table officials from both sides say a disruptive strike isnt a foregone conclusion when the contract expires on oct it is possible that the writers would stay on the job if progress is being made towards a new contract these people say but numerous issues are keeping the two sides far apart at the top of the list is the question of how to pay writers for use of their work when it is distributed on the internet and via other digital media the guild is also seeking to renegotiate dvd residual payments its members receive there has been little movement on any of these issues on either side if the writers do strike hollywoods already frantic movie and television machine could be disrupted much earlier than the studios feared studios in recent months have ramped up their production schedules ahead of the potential work stoppage a strike would have little impact on what the public sees in movie theaters for months to come because of the long lead time involved in filmmaking the impact on television which works on a shorter turnaround would be seen much more quickly the writers contract talks come ahead of negotiations with both the directors guild of america and the screen actors guild whose contracts expire on june many industry officials earlier predicted that if the writers couldnt forge a new deal by the end of october they would negotiate a temporary extension or work without a contract and link up with the other two guilds next spring to leverage their position now however people in the industry say if the writers strike the door could be left open for the directors to negotiate an early deal with the studios much like they did three years ago if the directors sign a new contract it could set the precedent for the other two guilds and force the writers into a less desirable deal a spokeswoman for the dga declined to comment on whether the guild was planning to negotiate early but people familiar with the situation say the dga could begin negotiations as early as next month
