imf puts off big questions on voting shares funding washington the members of the international monetary fund largely deferred making decisions on big issues facing the institution during a weekend of talks leaving a host of problems for incoming chief dominique strauss kahn who takes over nov the weekend sessions included discussions over how to reallocate votes so big developing countries have a larger say how to finance the imf so it doesnt operate in the red and how to set rules for government investment funds operated mainly by developing nations "the imf should be more relevant" to a changing global economy said south koreas finance minister kwon okyu reflecting the view of many developing nations "that should be based on more legitimacy each member should reflect views according to its economic power " all the multilateral financial institutions are having problems adjusting to a global economy where many developing nations have bulging financial reserves and financial markets are ready to lend money to impoverished nations but the imf may face the biggest challenge the world bank and the regional development agencies have clear missions combating poverty the imfs goal of promoting global macroeconomic stability is moreamorphous it is especially challenging because rich countries have long ignored imf recommendations and poor countries are now in a position to do the same in the past the imf put together multibillion dollar packages to bail out troubled countries in exchange the countries opened their economies and made other overhauls now the imf has little leverage because few countries need its money it has &# billion in outstanding loans down from &# billion at the end of developing nations say they would listen more if they had a bigger say voting shares are based on a complex formula intended to reflect a countrys relative economic weight but all sides concede that china india and other fast growing nations are underrepresented but to give the new powers a greater percentage of the votes the old powers mainly in europe would have to take smaller shares members agreed this weekend that a recalibration "should enhance the representation of dynamic economies" but that has been obvious since the negotiations began more than a year ago the bargaining will be overseen by mr strauss kahn a former finance minister of france "thats what we are here for " said mr strauss kahn who was in washington for talks on the sidelines of the meeting "i have said on several occasions that this institution will be reformed and it will be " one possible compromise europe which has seven seats on the imfs member executive board might be willing to give up some to developing nations similarly the imf communique spoke approvingly of a plan to sell some of the funds immense stock of gold to fund its operations but there was no solid endorsement let alone a specific deal unless the imf reworks its finances the imf calculates it will operate in the red uncertainty over imf financing has held up approval of &# million in debt forgiveness for liberia even though the imf management and shareholders have said they want a deal the imf needs approval from some of the same big developing nations that have been pushing for a greater say in the institution those nations have argued that the u s liberias historic ally and the imf should come up with additional funds under international rules the imf debt issue must be settled before other financial institutions can write off the rest of liberias debt and the country can qualify for fresh financing another issue that dominated discussions at the imf world bank and earlier at a meeting of the group of seven leading nations was the rise of so called sovereign wealth funds which are government investment vehicles that control between &# trillion and &# trillion in assets at a friday dinner finance ministers of the g the u s canada britain germany france italy and japan invited representatives from eight countries with wealth funds to discuss the issue the imf has been studying possible codes of conduct for such funds but it will have a lot of competition in that effort
