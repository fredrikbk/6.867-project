for boards firing or keeping a ceo can be tough call citigroup inc s directors stood by chief executive charles prince last week as the nations largest bank reported a drop in third quarter earnings but the expression of support did little to allay speculation abut mr princes future the reason boards of directors of struggling companies typically trumpet their faith in the chief until the day they force him or her out deciding whether to unseat a leader poses a dicey dilemma for directors wait too long and they risk letting a bad situation get worse act too quickly and they may short circuit a potential recovery and create a demoralizing power vacuum "nobody has mapped this process so well that they could give you a cheat sheet " says paul danos dean of the business school at dartmouth college in new hampshire and a director of general mills inc and bjs wholesale club inc frequently mr danos suggests the decision comes down to "whether you have someone to replace him with " more directors are struggling with the issue at a time of growing board authority increasing investor impatience and shrinking ceo tenure as at citigroup directors of alcatel lucent and motorola inc also recently backed ceos patricia russo and ed zander respectively amid shareholder complaints earlier this month sprint nextel corp ceo gary forsee resigned after his fellow board members launched a search for his successor and on friday a union group demanded the immediate departure of countrywide financial corp s angelo mozilo the founder of the biggest u s home mortgage lender "cannot be trusted to steer countrywide out of the morass into which he has led it " said william patterson executive director of ctw investment group the investment arm of labor federation change to win its unions pension funds own about million countrywide shares mr mozilo couldnt be reached to comment countrywide didnt comment about the union groups letter sent to the countrywide board even these days directors often act reluctantly board members feel uncomfortable pushing aside a chief executive whom they chose and like says jeffrey sonnenfeld a senior associate dean at yale university school of management "the devil we know is better than the unknown " many tell mr sonnenfeld but directors tend to lose confidence and replace a chief executive when they see serious ethical lapses among other factors that can tip the balance are a pattern of business mistakes concealment of critical information from the board and an extensive exodus of senior management they are less likely to change leaders simply because a few institutional investors gripe about a depressed share price sometimes board members faith is rewarded general motors corp ceo rick wagoner seemed endangered last year as gm sales fell losses mounted and billionaire kirk kerkorian holder of a big gm stake agitated for big changes jerome york mr kerkorians top representative briefly joined gms board and criticized mr wagoner for moving too slowly to fix deep seated problems such as high employee costs declining car sales and overlapping brands but mr kerkorian unloaded his entire stake late last year and mr wagoner remains in charge gm said thursday that third quarter vehicle sales grew despite continued declines in north america gm also recently concluded a new labor agreement that will allow it to cut costs by billions of dollars and shift health care expenses to a union administered fund gms share price has nearly doubled since april "the company is looking better " says charles elson head of the weinberg center for corporate governance at the university of delawares business school and a director at autozone inc and healthsouth corp "its a classic example of where the board stuck by the ceo " he adds on the other hand mr elson says directors of home depot inc "should have moved earlier" to oust former ceo bob nardelli who quit in january mr elson thinks home depot directors were slow to react to growing investor concerns about mr nardellis sizable pay package his management style the depressed share price and inroads by rival lowes cos "it will take a long time to reinvigorate the morale of their employees and get customers back " mr elson says frank blake the home depot executive who succeeded mr nardelli soon decided to shed the wholesale supply business but home depot got less than it initially expected for the unit because of the summer credit crunch and since mr blake took command its shares have fallen farther amid the housing downturn home depot directors insist they didnt wait too long to remove mr nardelli they promoted mr blake to vice chairman last fall then discussed succession for months before concluding the company needed fresh leadership one person close to the board recalls "not only did the board act in a timely fashion but in an orderly and complete fashion " this person says directors remain convinced mr blake "is everything this board expected and desired in a leader " says kenneth g langone home depots lead director mr nardelli declined to comment through a spokesman for chrysler llc where he is now chief executive activist investor ralph whitworth who played a key role in events leading to mr nardellis departure believes sprint nextel directors were also too patient signs emerged late last year that sprint was losing ground even though it had paid &# billion to buy a hot rival the year before millions of its cellphone subscribers had defected to competitors remaining customers were switching to less profitable calling plans mr forsee "lost credibility with investors over a year ago " maintains mr whitworth whose relational investors llc owns roughly of sprints shares outstanding "as soon as ceos lose credibility they should be out of there " a sprint spokeswoman has said the board decided to seek mr forsees successor because "it is the right time to put in place new leadership to move the company forward " paul saleh the finance chief will lead sprint until the board completes its search through an acquaintance mr forsee declined to comment this past weekend of course many deposed ceos think their boards forced them out too soon specialty retailer sharper image corp terminated richard thalheimer its founder and chief executive in september after two years of losses and a long sales slump the move occurred the same month that directors formed a special panel to review stock option grants including those to mr thalheimer and said the company would restate financial results mr thalheimer urged board members to postpone action until mid "i felt we were on a trend line that showed improvement " and the accounting discrepancies didnt involve fraud he says "but they disagreed with me " the founders ouster shocked long time colleagues hurting morale and productivity recollects craig trabeaux former executive vice president of retail operations "it was a major distraction" for employees who feared wider job losses and store closings he says steven a lightman an outsider named sharper images ceo last spring has yet to revive the companys fortunes the retailer recently reported a wider loss for the fiscal second quarter ended july september same store sales fell with no turnaround in sight "its easy to say the termination was premature " mr thalheimer contends jerry w levin sharper images chairman and former interim chief executive says the board is "confident it made the correct decision" in removing mr thalheimer he also notes that the unanimous vote "included two long tenured directors chosen by richard thalheimer " a turnaround specialist mr levin joined the board in july with support from a dissident shareholder group directors chopped more than &#
