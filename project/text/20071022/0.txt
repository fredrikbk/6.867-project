a different animal seeks the no post often its not no carl bass says an odd thing happened to him when he became chief executive of software maker autodesk last year "my iq jumped points and i became much funnier " jokes the year old bass who had been autodesks chief operating officer for the previous two years but the greater deference his employees paid to the intelligence and wit of their new ceo had a downside too mr bass says he couldnt be as frank and critical as he had been when chief operating officer he feared employees would overreact "when youre ceo what youre saying is so amplified you have to be very careful " says mr bass his experience shows why the gap between no and no in a company is often bigger than many realize ceos not only perform different tasks from their second in commands who commonly focus on running operations they have to act differently too that means the two roles often demand very different personality traits say people who have been there ceos talk about getting acclimated to the limelight longtime chief operating officers say they are used to working behind the scenes and submerging their egos their jobs focus them inward on the companys problems while ceos spend much of their time convincing outsiders of the companys strengths the very talents that make a great chief operating officer like finicky attention to detail can get in the way when you are in the top seat ceos are supposed to strategize not micromanage when board members go searching for a new no they must decide whether they want someone who is a solid operations specialist or someone theyre grooming to be no if they want a chief operating officer with the ambition and drive of a ceo they may find a no who doesnt have the patience to play second fiddle for long says john thompson a vice chairman at executive search firm heidrick &amp struggles international who has handled ceo and chief operating officer searches for companies such as google and dell or they may find their newest executive reluctant to take the next step the chief operating officer business forum a network of california operating chiefs of midsize to large companies this month discussed with its members the pros and cons of moving up to ceo about half of the members present at the discussions said they didnt "want the headache" of the top post says william e shepard founder of the forum "there was a lot of talk about the persona " says mr shepard who has held both roles as ceo "you have to have the fearless willingness to put yourself out there some people said i dont want to do that its not who i am " murray martin felt the role of ceo was a natural fit for him he became ceo of mail processing equipment maker pitney bowes in may after three years as operating chief although he worked under the same ceo for years in a variety of jobs but mr martin can understand how executives with more retiring personalities wouldnt like the transition one of the biggest differences between the two jobs he says is how much time is spent on external affairs when he was operating chief mr martin says he only did speaking engagements when he wanted to now he is talking to the public at least once or twice a week including investor meetings lectures on the companys diversity initiatives and speeches to groups such as the conference board on how to expand through acquisition ceos and operating officers can of course have traits in common both jobs call for a high degree of leadership skills intelligence and business smarts a company might work to make the two jobs more in sync to smooth the way for a move up the ladder in that case the deputy executive would be given the kind of strategy setting responsibilities more commonly associated with ceos and pushed into external roles talking to the companys board and investors that was the case with autodesks mr bass who became operating chief in but even mr bass says he didnt covet the ceo role before he was tapped some aspects of the top job such as lobbying politicians dont really suit his personality he says it is important for the ceo to weigh in on issues such as patent or immigration reform but "it feels like a huge waste of time " confesses mr bass he tends to be more interested in products than public relations yet he must be a cheerleader for the company in front of analysts shareholders and the community its vital that a ceo consistently project a positive attitude to help keep up morale in the no role it was ok "to be more curmudgeonly " he says in the end hed advise chief operating officers considering the leap to ceo to take a hard look at their personal tastes "figure out the things you like best about your job " he says "then figure out what you have to do as ceo and whether you can put up with it " email phred dvorak wsj com carol hymowitz is on assignment
