technology a special report how do you say translation software is at last good enough to help companies do business in other languages thanks to the internet companies can leap over most geographical barriers to conduct business globally but language barriers remain a tough hurdle increasingly though translation software is making it easier to do business in other languages while computer translation isnt perfect human input is still needed to ensure complete accuracy the latest programs are faster and more accurate than earlier generations of translation tools thats helping businesses decipher foreign language web pages news reports and documents translate company communications for foreign workers and reach customers around the world in their own languages ford motor co uses translation software from systran sa of france along with some human input to convert vehicle assembly instructions written in english into four languages spanish german portuguese and dutch it also uses software from applications technology inc of mclean va for translations from english to turkish nestor rychtyckyj a ford technical specialist in artificial intelligence says that while machine translation still isnt accurate it has improved over the years and is good enough to convey the substance of instructions to foreign workers "machine translation just makes the process more efficient" than it would be using human translators alone mr rychtyckyj says "were saving a lot of time and effort " ford based in dearborn mich writes new assembly instructions not only when it comes out with a new model but also when it changes the manufacturing process for existing models sometimes for example the company decides to use different parts or tools to build its cars instructions for each vehicle may change three to four times during each model year the new instructions are usually written in english and then fed into fords translation systems the software includes a customized glossary of about terms compiled by ford with each term preprogrammed to be translated into one of the five languages if the new instructions contain words or phrases that dont match the ford glossary the software runs them through a more general built in dictionary in addition ford uses human translators periodically to monitor the translations for accuracy workers in foreign plants can see the results on fords computer system the next morning and print them out mr rychtyckyj says the results are mostly accurate up to in german for example inaccurately translated instructions havent led to any significant mistakes in how a car is built he says because people usually spot the translation errors before they become a problem at plants where workers speak languages not covered by the current system there are engineers and other employees who speak english and can provide oral or written translations of new instructions mr rychtyckyj says but ford plans to expand its use of machine translation beyond the current five languages with russian next on the menu he says translation software also offers greater efficiency when it comes to translating material that customers will see like web sites or product packaging but when dealing with the public where mistakes can embarrass a company and discourage customers the human element becomes more critical industry experts say "no one thinks you can depend solely upon a machine " says chris boorman chief marketing officer for sdl plc a british maker of translation software "i do not believe you can ever take the human out of language when it comes to publishable" content he says dimitris sabatakakis chief executive of systran concurs "the first purpose is to provide users with immediate access to translation " he says of translation software "its not a perfect translation you cant publish it as is but its useful " systran sells desktop software packages for individual and corporate users ranging from &# to &# per user it also offers a subscription online service and licenses its technology to web sites including google inc s popular search engine google has used systrans technology to provide its users with translations of web sites for several years if search results include a foreign language web site the sites listing will have a "translate this" tab next to it clicking on the tab will for instance display a french web site in english its not perfect but at least its comprehensible googles translation of the main web site of french aircraft maker dassault aviation sa for example displays the title of a press release as "dassault aviation entered of full foot a new industrial era " clicking on the "english" tab built into dassaults own web site produces a more fluent title "dassault aviation steps into a new industrial area " google also has been developing its own translation software which it uses to translate web sites written in chinese and arabic googles technology is different from other translation software google feeds massive volumes of existing translations of text into a program which uses that material to perform new translations by determining the statistical probability that a word or phrase in one language is equivalent to that of the other says peter norvig googles director of research the source text can include matching articles from news sites written in both chinese and english or european union documents that are translated into the languages of the groups member countries he says other translation technologies rely on preprogrammed dictionaries and grammatical rules to perform translations googles translation tools arent designed to help businesses publish information mr norvig says "it might be good for a first draft but youd want someone to look it over " sdl and some other makers of translation software supplement their offerings with a technology called translation memory which stores translated words phrases and sentences so that they dont have to be translated again every time they recur that speeds up the translation process for instance a manufacturer of television sets can store the translations of the manuals for every set it makes in the sdl program along with the original documents each time the company needs to translate a manual for a new television set the software will automatically reproduce the translations of any wording that matches past manuals as well as translating any new material a human translator can then fix any mistakes or make any desired modifications in the automated translations rather than being employed to do the translation from scratch lionbridge technologies inc of waltham mass offers a service that incorporates all three elements of translation machine translation translation memory and human translation customers submit content through the internet to lionbridge and pay by the word anywhere from a few pennies to cents a word depending on the language and format of the content says rory cowan lionbridges chief executive a big lionbridge customer is microsoft corp the software giant used lionbridges technology and human translators to help translate about million words of documentation connected to microsofts edition of visual studio a suite of tools used by software developers the documentation includes an electronic user manual and other information posted on a microsoft web site or included in cds about of the material was handled by translation memory software because it had appeared in earlier translated versions of visual studio documentation says fabrice fonck a general manager for developer content at microsoft his group is responsible for translating content from english into eight languages including french spanish and german the rest of the material was run through machine translation by lionbridge and then verified by lionbridges human translators mr fonck says this was the first time mr foncks group added machine translation to the process previous translations had been performed with a combination of translation memory and human translators the savings on the multimillion dollar project from relying less on human translators were in the to range he says "we wanted to try this new process to drive productivity drive down costs and in the end come out with a quality product " mr fonck says mr
