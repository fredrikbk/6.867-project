politics &amp economics social issues dog giuliani conservatives in south carolina prove to be a tough sell greenville s c at a recent republican party barbecue dennis jones and state rep garry smith greeted each other like old friends they chatted about dessert recipes they joked about being smith and jones they lamented washingtons big spending ways but when the conversation turned to republican presidential candidate rudy giuliani messrs smith and jones were more like messrs hatfield and mccoy mr smith smiled sweetly but made it clear to mr jones the county giuliani campaign chairman that he doesnt think much of the former new york city mayor or his record as a social moderate "hell have a hard time taking my guns away " mr smith warned mr jones its pretty frustrating being rudy giulianis man in what may well be the most conservative county in one of the most conservative states in the union statewide mr giuliani is doing surprisingly well in south carolina most polls show him tied for the lead in the republican nominating contest with former tennessee sen fred thompson the souths favorite son in the race mr giulianis support seems strongest on the less conservative coast his political history of supporting abortion rights gay civil unions and gun control along with his personal history of infidelity and divorce make him a tough sell among the bible believing folk of greenville county which accounts for one in of the states republican primary voters greenville is a particularly stark example of the challenge mr giuliani faces nationwide in his quest to lead the party over the weekend he confronted it directly with a speech to a convention of religious and social conservatives in washington telling the "values voters summit" that he came "with an open mind and an open heart and all i ask is that you do the same " the results were mixed the audience gave him a relatively warm reception but in a straw poll of nearly family research council members mr giuliani placed eighth of nine candidates with less than of the vote in greenville the giuliani campaign has left matters in the pinky ringed hands of the year old mr jones a gregarious blue eyed retiree from new jersey a lifelong republican mr jones spent a career in the pharmaceutical industry and served in local elected offices in new jersey and pennsylvania before retiring to greenville in he likes that at restaurants here many people pray before eating though he doesnt do so himself his republicanism is of the low tax strong national defense law and order live and let live brand he couldnt care less if gay men marry each other he and his wife have a framed photo of the twin towers in the living room even before sept mr jones liked the way mr giuliani handled new york city "you had drunks lying in the street " he says "you had those guys who came out and washed your windshield rudy took care of all of that everybody said new york couldnt be tamed and rudy did it " so mr jones was quick to volunteer after mr giuliani declared his candidacy earlier this year it hasnt been easy and sometimes the campaign itself seems to make things tougher when mr giuliani spoke at the county republican party convention this spring he declined to buy a &# full page ad in the program even though former massachusetts gov mitt romney did so "giulianis own campaign didnt see the value in purchasing an ad in the convention program " says county republican chairman samuel harms still cross about the slight to soothe bruised feelings mr jones paid for a half page ad himself at the convention mr romney won a delegates straw poll mr giuliani came in a distant fourth mr giuliani came through town earlier this month for a brief public meet and greet at a local coffee shop perhaps people showed up inside mr jones ran into doug wavle who represents greenville on the state republican executive committee mr wavle describes the county as "bible believing" and predicts peace wont come to the middle east until "the lord jesus christ returns to earth " mr giuliani he says doesnt meet the strict moral standards he and his neighbors set "im here just to be a good host " mr wavle told mr jones "this is not my candidate and you know why " asked during the event how well hed do among the local social conservatives mr giuliani pointed to polls that rank him high among evangelical voters mr giuliani is betting that sept caused a fundamental shift in the party leaving republicans who once have voted on social issues willing to support a moderate candidate strong on national defense "the big surprising news is how strong a candidate i am in south carolina " mr giuliani told the crowd but the republicans of greenville county seem particularly resistant to his message "americans have become far more accepting of the stances which giuliani has carried forth " says frank s page pastor of first baptist church in nearby taylors and president of the national southern baptist convention "that being said i do believe in greenville county he will face serious opposition " mr jones says poor organization is also hurting mr giuliani here for months he has been attending republican functions handing out campaign literature that he has photocopied himself and looking enviously at the glossy brochures stickers and dvds at the romney table earlier this month ryan meerstein the state campaign director finally sent him giuliani buttons and a small packet of brochures "ive been telling ryan send us the ones on abortion the ones on gun control and the ones on health care " mr jones said "a lot of people here have questions about those " mr jones brought a few buttons to the coffee shop event where a campaign official advised him to "keep those for the hard core people weve got stickers for everyone else " that evening mr jones went to the &# a head barbecue for the upstate republican womens club he chatted with bob taylor dean of the college of arts and sciences at bob jones university a conservative christian school in greenville mr taylor told mr jones bluntly that if mr giuliani wins the nomination he might not vote for him and he wouldnt be the only one to abandon the party "ive got a tough row to hoe " mr jones said on the drive home "theres no doubt about it "
