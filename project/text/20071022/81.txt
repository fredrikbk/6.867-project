news editor sue shellenbarger discussed how a growing number of employers are imposing or trying out "no email" fridays or weekends the idea is to encourage more face to face and phone contact with customers and co workers and to give employees a reprieve from the ever rising email tide here are excerpts from readers responses to a question asking how they would feel if their employers imposed email restraints "fantastic we dont have to do uncompensated labor i wish the company would get rid of beepers and cellphones too dont bring your work home " "i personally am not obligated to work at any time and like many of my co workers am free to work from home whenever its convenient in cases of weather or special personal circumstances this is very helpful losing it would result in a lot of complaints nobody will get mad at me for not checking email out of normal business hours " "if they ever tried to take it away for more than a day it would be a disaster email is a tool it isnt bad in itself of course it can be abused by people who would tend to abuse any system " "i think restricting email would be a great way to enforce the work life balance to which many employers pay lip service " "most employees are addicted to their email and would collapse completely if prevented from accessing email i sit at conferences and seminars where hardly anyone is paying attention to speakers they are too busy checking email nothing in those emails is that important of the time its more a combination of addiction and self importance " online today see more reader comments and join
