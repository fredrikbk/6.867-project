office technology inside out employees often use unauthorized technologies at work does that compromise security or enhance productivity two experts debate the issue how much leeway should office workers have to try out new technologies on company computers for many employers the answer is clear none at all corporate it departments already have their hands full with viruses hackers spyware and data breaches without having to worry about employees making those problems worse by adding unauthorized software or devices security experts warn that a companys insiders are responsible for most security headaches intentionally or inadvertently yet most employees who work regularly with computers can think of dozens of ways that unauthorized technology makes it easier to do their jobs whether its web based email programs for sending large files or flash memory drives for taking work files home and it isnt just individuals whole departments are turning to online software providers for applications to handle business needs without the approval or often the knowledge of the it department to discuss the pros and cons of this "shadow it " we invited tom tabor chief information officer of pittsburgh based health insurer highmark inc and douglas merrill chief information officer at google inc to take part in a recent email exchange with journal report news editor michael totty here are edited excerpts from their debate the wall street journal how much freedom should companies give employees to use their own technology mr tabor as a health insurer government contractor and medicare intermediary highmark is bound to strict regulations regarding the use and security of members information particularly personal health information therefore we need to ensure the software our employees are using is controlled and the information accessed and maintained is auditable regulations limit our ability to allow employees to leverage their own software programs however we recognize that employees just want to be productive we also recognize that there is a new generation of employees entering the work force that want to work how they want when they want and where they want to get the job done while this may be advantageous it is also a management issue as far as maintainability support and potentially cost this will increasingly put pressure on management to rethink how we arm our employees with the tools they need to do the job we ask of them this puts large regulated companies like highmark in a not so enviable situation when deciding what to allow and what to restrict in the end any software that makes our employees more productive is a good thing however we must also abide by our responsibility to keep our members information tightly managed mr merrill users expect the tools to be simple to use as well as powerful and they entrust very sensitive data to us financial information in google checkout or user preferences for igoogle we must and do expend a great deal of effort ensuring that data remains secure we are not the only company building terrific software that people might want to use at work i believe we should let them by using the work of thousands of developers world wide and the support provided by their organizations i can redirect my technology staff to work on the most critical problems we face thus using consumer software is a win both for google employees and our it staff when i was home this morning i was a mixture of employee and "consumer " i didnt stop being a consumer when i arrived at the office many of these terrific consumer applications work many of them are very secure and your users already know how to use them so why should i give up access to them when i go to work tom your point about highmarks regulatory burden is quite compelling and i completely agree that protecting customers data is at the top of the priority list i think the differences between regulated and unregulated companies are vanishing however google is a publicly traded company so we are covered by sox the sarbanes oxley act which requires companies to ensure the integrity of corporate records also our campus doctors store their information online so we have hipaa controlled data the health insurance portability and accountability act governs privacy of patient information and of course we have personal information that we safeguard dearly both because of various regulations and because the trust of our users is our business since we all face a myriad of regulations including californias notification rules which require consumers to be notified if their personal data has been lost or stolen we have to find efficient ways to provide the required controls in the past we would have done that by putting big walls around our organizations and ensuring those walls were impregnable in todays world we all connect to third parties to provide services such as employee payroll other benefits building security and the like because of these connections we already have lots of holes in the walls this sometimes leads to a desire to lock everything down but you cant actually lock down all sources of risk employees are creative and will find ways to get their jobs done even though their methods may sometimes expose their employers to risk this truth that employees will accidentally expose you to risk drives a different security model we must give up trying to control everything and instead focus security on the few places that are most critical let me give an example laptops get stolen such thefts have been a source of major data leaks for many organizations google employees use google apps premier edition which provides email chat and document creation and collaboration employees store their email and documents in a google data center not on their laptops if someone steals one of our laptops they will not get confidential data i dont have to worry much about the possibility of losing data because of a laptop theft i dont have to try and fail to control everything about the endpoints i can be far more flexible in allowing employees to use different software mr tabor our employees are armed with a variety of productivity tools these include standard email and office software but also instant messaging document and content collaboration whiteboarding web conferencing carrier based wireless access etc for those employees who have laptop computers the hard drives are encrypted so they can work with sensitive data locally without the fear of the data being compromised if the laptop is lost or stolen we also employ two factor authentication for remote access through our vpn virtual private network to ensure only those who are authorized gain access to our network if sensitive data needs to be shared via email we have a secure email capability for external communication that ensures the data is seen by only those who need it so what dont we allow our employees to do we do not allow access to any web based email instant messaging or wi fi access we do not see material impact to our employees by restricting access to these additionally we do not allow noncorporate flash drives cameras and other personal devices to be accessed via usb ports on pcs and only system administrators have the capability to install software on pcs we attempt to provide internally the capabilities that employees use outside the office in a controlled manner this way we reduce the risk of compromising member information and protect the stability of our computing infrastructure having said that we are constantly looking at these "shadow it" capabilities and determining which ones we should "open up" and if not how to provide a similar capability where possible and practicable wsj how much say do employees have in deciding when to bring in new technologies and what technologies to adopt mr tabor we have a formalized technology acquisition process that allows employees to submit technologies for review by the it organization through this process employees have a say in what technologies are considered in fact it was through this process that internal instant messaging was made available a few years back and since then has been used as a daily part of employees productivity suite wsj douglas how do you deal with problems when employees are allowed to make their own technology choices mr merrill at google most people who run windows are set as power users not administrators this allows employees to install some things and change some machine settings but not everything basically we try to protect our employees from themselves if they want administrator access they just have to ask for it but in general most people dont need it and you are right tom you could provide many of the functions through closed software by doing so you probably do gain more control on the endpoints but there are downsides worth considering first following googles strategy provides additional flexibility for your workers im crafting this response in an airport using the wi fi here i wrote the last one on a train focusing so much on endpoint control gives up opportunities for your workers to give more of their time in different contexts next there are positive side effects that benefit your employees i spent most of my life maintaining two calendars my work one and my personal one by using google calendar as our work calendar my employees and i dont have to do this i simply overlay my personal calendar on my work calendar this makes it easier for your workers to balance work and life finally lets not underestimate the costs of running that collage of closed software estimates range widely but many cios are spending to of their budgets simply keeping their idiosyncratic infrastructure alive this leaves no more than cents on each dollar to spend innovating on tools to make our business more effective mr tabor yes there is a cost to providing this kind of flexibility but that cost in our case is nowhere near cents on the dollar admittedly the google software options as well as many others are very good and make sense for many companies we continue to evaluate these types of software offerings in light of our highly regulated environment with the belief that we can continue to introduce innovative cost effective and productivity enhancing technologies in the end it is a balancing act employees will continue to push for the latest and greatest and management cannot ignore the options while considering the costs and risk to the overall environment the good news is we have choices the bad news is we have choices mr merrill tom your closing line is the best quote of this entire exchange choice is key for good and for ill although many employees will love the new world change makes our jobs in it harder we cant put that genie back in the bottle consumer technology will spring up in business all over the world but we can prepare
