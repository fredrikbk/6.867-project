the daily fix red sox maul indians pen advance to the world series online edition the curse of rocky colavito lives on the cleveland indians once commanding a lead in the american league championship series saw their season end last night as the boston red sox savaged their bullpen for eight runs in two innings an win that gave boston its th pennant baseball fans have long debated which is worse a tight agonizing game that ends in defeat or a blowout that turns hope into folly in the indians final game of their fans suffered both "what a fold " mourns bud shaw in the cleveland plain dealer "clevelands clocks and hearts were set on tribe time one minute closing time the next the final touch was rafael betancourt the good raffy in this postseason dressing as roberto hernandez a week and a half short of halloween third base coach joel skinners double clutch looked to be the tipping point until betancourt went tilt not sending kenny lofton home in a game exemplified the final three pratfalls of the series with the boston red sox but thats not why the indians were outscored in three consecutive losses a sure confident team looked suddenly overcome by the size of the stage " the indians blog the disappointment zone dissects mr skinners failure to test manny ramirezs arm by sending mr lofton home as the tying run before trying for perspective " wins tied for the best in baseball even with four fewer home games than every other team in the league c c sabathia is the likely cy young winner and fausto carmona will finish in the top five ryan garko showed he can man first base for years to come betancourt transformed into the best set up guy in baseball jensen lewis and rafael perez emerge as scary arms in the bullpen even though they both began the season in the minors the rally pies and kenny lofton turning back the clock this was a great season which is why it hurts so much right now for the red sox meanwhile its another gutty comeback and a warning to the colorado rockies remember them that some awfully big bats await them at fenway park wednesday night manny big papi sure but the rockies also best beware of kevin youkilis who perhaps ought to be rechristened the greek god of hits and dustin pedroia with boston returning to the world series it falls to columnists to put the last shovels of dirt on the grave of the noble star crossed red sox at fenway last night there was no sign of bucky dent buckner or aaron boone but plenty of the dropkick murphys kevin millar and dancing papelbon "and so the sox are in the world series for the second time in four years which hasnt happened since james michael curley and george herman ruth prowled the narrow streets of boston " dan shaughnessy writes in the boston globe adding "this must have been what it felt like in the early days of fenway when the royal rooters ruled and the red sox were regular hosts of baseballs autumnal showcase from through the sox won three world series they did not win again until the beginning of a magical october run that has resumed over the last four days " "gone forever are the red sox of yesterday " writes tony massarotti in the boston herald "in boston during the baseball season there is now only an endless succession of tomorrows " the bosox of old he writes "made critical blunders and paid for them dearly and were reminded year after year after year that they had made unforgettable unforgivable mistakes not now not anymore now when the red sox trail by a series score as they did against these indians people cite instead of or or or the red sox celebrate their heroes instead of vilifying their goats and the good things are anticipated more " with the world series matchup set the fix is proud to announce its world series odesters jason sindler will do the honors for the rockies while mike bonafide pays homage to the red sox look for their odes tomorrow and wednesday and the fix would like to tip its cap to tim cahill our indians odester the indians loss left mr cahill on the sidelines but the tribe will be back and we hope he will be too before game an unhappy distraction pitcher paul byrd admitted in the wake of a san francisco chronicle story that hed used human growth hormone baseball didnt ban hgh until january a week after the chronicle says mr byrd made his final purchase mr byrd a thoughtful man whos frequently spoken about his christian faith without being strident about it didnt hide from the media holding an impromptu press conference against a brick wall at fenway park there he insisted the hgh was to treat a pituitary gland condition noted that hed paid for it with his own credit card and had it shipped directly to him and said hed been tempted to take more than the prescribed dosage in order to put more life on an average fastball but never done so on the other hand mr byrds insistence that major league baseball knew of his condition and how he treated it was apparently news to mlb and the indians and two of his prescriptions were written by a dentist suspended in for fraud and incompetence in the plain dealer terry pluto writes of his desire to believe mr byrd and of his doubts "i consider the indians pitcher one of the best people ive met in sports " he writes "weve had some long discussions about life away from sports about dealing with temptations on the road we talked about trying to live our faith and not coming across as a phony or being better than anyone else and how we say we want to follow god and know there are times when we fell so short " undoubtedly mr pluto speaks for many fans when he writes that "i so want byrd to be clean on this issue but this is a mess " in the nfl it was a sunday for nailbiters the chicago bears were stuck on their own down against the philadelphia eagles with to go a philadelphia crowd baying at them and no timeouts no matter brian griese whose helmet audio had cut out led the bears yards hitting muhsin muhammed in the end zone for a yard td pass with nine seconds to go in the chicago sun times rick telander writes that mr grieses audio malfunction "may have been a wonderful thing freed of any connection to the mother ship and all the controlling influences of men in polyester wearing headsets and paid to tell him what to do he directed as miraculous a come from behind drive as bears fans have seen in well frankly i couldnt tell you " the washington redskins had to survive fourth quarter points from the arizona cardinals to escape with a wild win the final seconds saw arizona use three quarterbacks score a touchdown miss a point conversion recover an onside kick and just miss a yard field goal great game story from the ap here "if the redskins dont survive yesterdays game its not a reach to call it the beginning of the end a defining moment that would set in motion coach joe gibbss second retirement from coaching after this season " writes mike wise in the washington post and in denver the broncos jason elam connected for a yard field goal as time expired good for a win over the pittsburgh steelers "what the broncos did against a strong pittsburgh team while playing without injured center tom nalen receiver javon walker and cornerback champ bailey cannot be underestimated " mark kiszla writes in the denver post "missing so many veterans this is a young denver team and the confidence of the kid broncs was shaken in football terms it was as close to a must win as the sixth game on the nfl schedule can possibly be " tip of the fix cap to reader don hartline found a good
