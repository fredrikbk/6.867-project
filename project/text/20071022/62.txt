prior loans future pain bank lending jumps providing a cushion but outlook isnt good since midsummer bank lending to businesses has risen at the fastest rate in more than years providing a cushion for the economy as lenders cut back on mortgages and other forms of loans but the lending outlook doesnt look nearly as promising in part because of billions of dollars in losses they have recorded and because some lending was forced on them because of commitments made before the recent turmoil if banks cut back it could cause a full blown credit crunch which could hit an already slowing economy "i think were taking a little harder look at deals " says michael bauer executive vice president in charge of commercial lending at mainsource bank a &# billion indiana lender that has continued making business loans even as troubles in the housing sector spread his book of business loans is up about from a year ago and he has the resources to keep lending but he thinks loan growth next year could slow to mr bauers bank hasnt been hit directly by market turmoil still he says "were not going to chase after the marginal deal as we did a year or two ago " james b edge jr president and chief executive of morgan bros bag co is on the other side of the table his richmond va company which has less than &# million in annual revenue makes cloth and burlap sacks used to package ham peanuts and other products in july he tried to increase his &# credit line with bank of america corp to expand some product lines but was turned down he expects to get the money elsewhere but adds "it feels like there is less cash in the system " the good news is banks can keep lending if they want to their finances are much stronger than they have been during previous credit busts commercial banks in the u s have a total net worth assets minus liabilities of &# trillion or of total assets well above levels considered to be healthy "these banks have significant capacity for absorbing additional loans and mortgage backed securities as needed if they want to do so " says charles calomiris a columbia university economics professor and historian of credit shocks this might be surprising given the huge amount of lending that has occurred in the past several years the explanation lies in the sweeping changes that have transformed the financial system in the past two decades before many of the loans banks made sat on their own books when loans went bad banks suffered and stopped making new loans leading to a credit crunch now loans often are packaged into securities and sold to investors the bond market at &# trillion is bigger than the stock market and many bonds sold to investors are effectively packages of mortgages car loans credit card debt and other conventional bank products banks have built up strong capital positions as securities markets have taken on a bigger role this capital has enabled them to keep lending when in the past they would have turned off the spigot nationwide commercial and industrial lending the critical loans that fund corporate activities like share buybacks and plant expansion has risen at an astounding annual rate since late july and overall u s bank balance sheets have increased at a annual rate according to federal reserve data for commercial and industrial lending it is the fastest growth rate for an week period in more than years regional banks in particular have had significant increases in lending fifth third bancorp for example said commercial and industrial lending rose in the third quarter from a year earlier even as other loan growth slowed the problem is in many cases banks never expected to make these loans they had extended backup credit lines to such companies as tax preparer and mortgage lender h&amp r block inc in august when h&amp r block which has struggled to rid itself of its subprime lending unit couldnt borrow in the securities markets it tapped &# million of the &# billion credit line it has with a group of banks to meet its cash needs calling the banks "a more stable source of funds " besides credit lines banks have been forced to take on loans they made to private equity firms seeking to buy publicly traded companies normally the banks would have sold these loans off to investors but when there werent buyers they had to hold on to them lehman brothers holdings inc estimates more than &# billion in buyout loans still need to be sold by the banks in the months ahead some banks also are at risk of having to take billions of dollars in more debt onto their balance sheet because of troubles with some off balance sheet lending vehicles these factors contributed to the dreadful results reported by the major banks last week among the hardest hit was citigroup inc which had its capital cushion fall just below its target level j p morgan chase &amp co which held up better is being conservative "weve been very careful in our middle market lending " james dimon j p morgans chief executive said wednesday because securities markets are global problems that might have been confined to the u s previously now spread around the world in europe where banks have borne a heavy
