experimental therapy to cure insurance woes doctors try prepaid plans some say fee system cuts costs boosts care dr woods legal battle wheeling w va vic woods walk in clinic here sees patients six days a week and logs roughly visits a year its sparsely furnished waiting room is packed much of the hour day with people seeking care for conditions ranging from sore throats to chest pains despite the booming business dr wood and his staff another doctor and four physician assistants have battled strong head winds to keep the clinic going rising administrative costs and flat insurance reimbursement rates make it tough to cover basic expenses one in five patients lacks insurance others are saddled with sky high deductibles last year dr wood even cut his annual salary by half to help keep the clinic afloat in an attempt to turn the tide dr wood is trying a new approach one that he hopes will one day sustain his practice for a monthly fee of &# per individual or &# for a family the clinic provides unlimited primary and urgent care those who enroll in the prepaid plan get office visits lab work x rays and as many generic drugs as the clinic can provide dr wood is one of several hundred doctors across the country offering flat rate pay in advance plans though still experimental proponents argue that the approach tackles two crises in u s health care the rapid decline of doctors practicing primary care medicine and the growing number of americans who are either uninsured or underinsured "ill sign up one patient at a time if i have to " says dr wood who has so far enrolled people in his plan the streamlined system he says cuts down on administrative hassles and costs compels more office visits and delivers better profits than one that relies on insurance dollars "i cant see my practice surviving for the next years without this model " he says prepaid plans and the opposition they face from various industry and regulatory factions show how the medical establishment remains at odds over the delivery of basic care insurers say that high medical and drug fees force them to police doctors treatments and rates physicians argue that the hassles of processing insurance claims and referrals means less time with patients at the conflicts root say health experts is a medical payment system that tends to reward expensive procedure based care over routine family doctor visits "we all talk about how wed like primary care to change but we dont pay for those activities " says paul ginsburg president of the center for studying health system change a washington d c health policy research group "thats why you have doctors trying to fund these services in a new way " while specialists incomes have held steady family physicians and internists have seen their incomes shrink because of flat or falling reimbursements over the past decade their ranks have fallen dramatically and the number of medical students who are going into the discipline has declined by half according to the american academy of family physicians a recent study in the british medical journal said that the average american logs barely minutes a year with a primary care physician half the time spent in other developed nations that helps explain why the u s spends much more on health care than its economic peers yet still fall behind on basic indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality rates prepaid plans arent intended to replace more comprehensive coverage rather physicians like dr wood see them as filling an important gap in primary care his main targets are individual patients with basic medical needs and employers who want to supplement costly high deductible plans a former state trooper dr wood trained as an osteopath a physician whose specialty is the musculoskeletal system in he took a job as medical director of a hospital owned clinic called doctors urgent care which offered the services of a family physician as well as some emergency room type care "all my friends in medicine said dont go there " recalls dr wood now years old "but i had a vision of providing full scale primary care people need health care after hours too " in he bought the clinic the idea to sell prepaid primary care he says hit him after reading a magazine article about doctors in affluent communities marketing "concierge" services for annual retainers of as much as &# those high end services give patients hour cellphone access to their doctors longer same day appointments and other extras but a bargain basement version he figured could be inexpensive for patients ensure better care and be more profitable for his business unlike traditional insurance which is priced to spread the risk of high cost illnesses like cancer across many people prepaid care is more like a gym membership giving people medical access for a fixed cost to determine his fees dr wood says he estimated that the average adult would need about itemized services a year from blood tests to x rays he leveraged his good relationship with the ohio valley medical center an area hospital to get lab work performed at low medicare rates he also put together a list of generic drugs that he could buy directly from wholesalers drugs for chronic conditions such as high blood pressure he made available at &# for a monthlong supply patients who needed to be on antibiotics and other short term acute care medicines would get them at no extra charge in november dr wood took out a quarter page ad in a local newspaper that began "attention ohio valley residents are you ready for a new concept in health care delivery " he also called on a few local health insurance executives to explain how they might offer insurance plans that worked together with his approach david yuncke a private music instructor was the first to sign up joining his wifes company plan would have cost &# a month so hed gone without coverage for four years and avoided seeing the doctor tests from his first visit with dr wood in late showed he had a high cholesterol level of after getting more regular checkups and medication his cholesterol level has since dropped by half "i get more than my moneys worth " says mr yuncke "if you dont have something very serious this is wonderful " even though he says he plans to eventually sign up for more comprehensive care he doesnt plan to stop seeing dr wood prepaid plans have raised concerns among insurers and some regulators that patients might forgo broader health coverage or get ripped off if the approach took off it might become a competitive threat to insurers business especially if doctors can provide prepaid care without having to jump the same regulatory hoops as health insurance soon after dr wood began advertising his plan he received a call and a letter from the states insurance commissioner saying he was essentially operating as an unlicensed insurer he was asked to stop offering the service unlike medical practitioners insurers are required to submit rates for state approval they also must provide evidence that theyre financially solvent with adequate reserves "otherwise they can end up walking off with other peoples money " says commissioner jane cline plus she adds "we dont want someone who has a full benefit plan to jump to this plan because of the price " dr wood stopped advertising but took the battle to the state legislature using a &# line of credit to drum up a lobbying campaign some of the funds he used to hire extra staff to fill in for him while he traveled back and forth to charleston to fight for his cause a bill that would have exempted him from the states insurance statutes passed in the state senate but eventually died in the house he found a lucky reprieve in late when he cornered gov joe manchin at an election fund raiser intrigued the governor appointed him to a task force charged with tackling the states uninsured problem after more than half a year of meetings the task force called for a three year experiment with prepaid care as part of a legislative package the measure was enacted into law last spring rules and regulations for prepaid plans vary from state to state but the basic idea may have a better chance of catching on here in west virginia than in most states west virginia has one the lowest median household incomes in the country many residents cant afford to spend much on health care a once thriving city at the height of the coal boom wheeling now has half the population it did years ago with many workers toiling in low paying service jobs three clinics including dr woods are participating in the statewide experiment half a dozen more are applying through the states health care authority which is overseeing the pilot project dr wood says he hopes most patients and local employers who sign up for prepaid care can use it to supplement a catastrophic or high deductible plan but some of his patients like george lenz and michael lujano simply cant afford anything else both men were diagnosed with hiv infection years ago and the couple had health insurance until though neither has aids and the hiv virus remains at undetectable levels in their bodies their insurance premiums climbed from &# a month to roughly &# by the time they were forced to drop coverage "then no doctor would take us " says mr lenz who owns a downtown hair salon with mr lujano they eventually scored an appointment in nearby pittsburgh but the bill was prohibitive a single round of lab tests to monitor the virus cost &# and they put off further visits mr lenzs mother alerted them to dr woods ad and in august the two men joined his subscription plan dr woods model includes the blood workups necessary for proper monitoring if either were to need more specialized care or costly drugs however the plan wouldnt provide for that even so "this is a step in the right direction " says mr lenz insurers in the state have been examining the merits of prepaid plans one of west virginias biggest mountain state blue cross blue shield says it has been exploring whether to design an insurance product that would complement dr woods plan the idea to allow patients to apply the monthly retainer they pay his clinic toward the deductibles under their regular insurance plan the insurer is still on the fence about such a plans cost effectiveness "but we want to see if theres opportunity here " says fred earley general counsel and senior vice president of mountain states external operations others have written off prepaid plans as a bad deal "the price seems awfully high for just primary care " says t randolph cox a charleston w va lawyer and lobbyist who represents several of the states biggest insurers "if youre sick youre better off having the opportunity to go to a specialist or a hospital " some local business owners say theyve saved big by taking the prepaid route phil santinoceto is one of them after several years of premium increases he says his medical billing and management company was paying more than &# a year to cover himself and his employees in a single year he got hit with a rate hike last year he included dr woods plan as part of the firms medical benefits he also switched to a major medical plan with a higher deductible the result monthly savings of &# this year instead of a premium increase his insurer actually lowered rates by largely because the staff used less specialty care required less time in the hospital and used dr woods clinic for nearly all of their primary care "thats the first time weve seen a rate decline in years " says mr santinoceto dr wood meanwhile says hes currently signing up new prepaid patients at a rate of about a dozen a month he projects that enrollees would be enough to support the clinic "im going to take this as far as i can " he says "primary care is the one area of health care that every patient needs to participate in and this is the way to do it "
