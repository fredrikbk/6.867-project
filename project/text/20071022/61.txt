politics &amp economics u s rebuffed food fraud case the justice department received allegations in june of illegal dealings between a major army contractor in kuwait and a u s food producer but ultimately declined to support the case the previously sealed civil lawsuit seen by the wall street journal alleges that public warehousing co of kuwait received kickbacks from richmond wholesale meat co "in exchange for retaining richmond and allowing richmond to charge higher prices than other potential subcontractors " the justice departments civil division declined to support the lawsuit this february a month after justice issued subpoenas in a criminal investigation of public warehousing based on similar allegations about its dealings with other u s food companies the lawsuit filed in federal court in philadelphia by an iowa businesswoman alleged collusion "to overcharge the u s government by millions of dollars " alan grayson lawyer for iowa pork trader beth hanken and her firm midwest ventures inc said justice told him it turned down the case for insufficient evidence mr grayson said the justice departments civil division has turned down at least civil false claims act cases involving iraq war contracting fraud the justice department said it had declined to support some cases involving iraq contracting fraud but didnt say how many "the department is currently conducting a number of investigations into allegations of fraud and potential civil false claims act cases stemming from the work of government contractors in iraq and the middle east " spokesman charles miller said in a written statement "the department takes such allegations seriously and is dedicating substantial resources to investigating these cases thoroughly and aggressively " the justice department declined to address the details of ms hankens case "we cannot provide any further comment on any ongoing government investigation " mr miller said the case isnt on the electronic public court docket a federal judge ordered it to be unsealed if justice declined to take the case under the civil war era false claims act u s citizens can file cases known as qui tam suits to recover money stolen from the u s government the justice department then has the option of joining the case and any settlement is shared among the plaintiffs with the bulk going to the government public warehousing "has never been served with a qui tam complaint and until we are served we must assume that any complaint that has been filed remains under court seal " the firm said "therefore it would be inappropriate and a violation of the law for pwc to comment " the company issued a statement saying reports last week on the federal criminal probe of its pricing practices were "inaccurate" and contained "misinformation " because the government helps set and approve all of its prices the company confirmed it is under investigation for fraud a top official at richmond wholesale hasnt responded to messages seeking comment no one at the company could be reached yesterday the official at justice responsible for deciding whether to pursue false claims act cases has until recently been peter keisler a bush appointee who is acting attorney general and a nominee for a seat on the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia mr grayson a democrat who ran unsuccessfully for congress last year alleges that mr keisler has turned down numerous iraq fraud cases to protect the administration from political damage justice said that isnt true "although we cannot comment on the number of cases that are under investigation or under seal or on the investigations and the manner in which they are being investigated we do not agree with any statement that might suggest that the department is not giving these cases due consideration for political or other improper reasons and there is no support for such a conclusion " mr miller said justice said it has reached four iraq related fraud settlements for a total of &# million in more than four years of the war which has cost taxpayers more than &# billion officials insist efforts to recover stolen funds are in the works "simply because some cases alleging fraud in iraq have been declined does not mean that there is fraud that has been ignored nor does it mean that there are not other matters that contain meritorious allegations that are being investigated and pursued " mr miller said ms hanken was in kuwait on business when iraq invaded in before the first gulf war and was briefly held captive by iraqi troops after her release she campaigned for the liberation of kuwait and testified before congress "i didnt do that so pwc could rip off american taxpayers " she said in an interview "i am sick of getting jerked around " ms hanken alleges that richmond and public warehousing executives sabotaged her efforts to sell meat products to the military by colluding to produce disparaging information about her companys products and performance she alleged that "richmond is overcharging pwc for meat products and pwc is overcharging the government " agents from the pentagon the internal revenue service and the federal bureau of investigation are probing whether public warehousing passed on to the government improperly high prices from u s food producers in return for incentive payments from those producers and their agents ms hanken alleges that an official at the defense supply center of philadelphia a pentagon contracting agency improperly provided a copy of her complaint to the chief executive of public warehousing prompting the kuwaiti firm to threaten to sue her for defamation reached at home recently the official gary shifton declined to speak to a reporter
