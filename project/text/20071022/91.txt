southwestern towns it ran into a big problem high attrition combined with the small populations meant the offices were running out of people to hire "it felt like we had employed everyone in town " says denise thompson a flowers human resource executive the shortage prompted flowers to overhaul its approach to staffing executives increased efforts to retain existing agents and expanded their network of home based agents to reduce reliance on local labor markets it is a cautionary tale for the call center industry over the past decade companies have sought to lower costs by sending call center jobs overseas to places such as india after customer complaints of poor service some companies sought alternatives closer to home particularly in small cities with low wages and little competition for workers but as flowers discovered that strategy doesnt always pan out the conditions that attracted one company often attract others pushing wages higher and triggering turnover in a small city "youre going to burn through that in a couple years just about everybody who could work there has worked there and has moved on " says tim houlne chief executive of working solutions in

change their staffing model they raised wages though a spokesman declines to divulge details they instructed managers to focus on retaining workers when workers said they didnt like working seven straight days during peak times managers agreed not to schedule agents for more than six consecutive days flowers also bolstered supervisor training tina bayless site manager for ardmore says she recently attended a course that recommended giving workers specific feedback such as acknowledging a sales increase rather than general praise "when they feel like youre paying attention to the details of their performance it makes them feel better instead of just saying oh good job today " ms bayless says she relayed the lesson to her managers flowers also expanded its pool of home based agents around the u s to about from about a year ago ms thompson says tapping those agents during peak times eases demands at call centers to reduce isolation and stress among the home agents flowers
