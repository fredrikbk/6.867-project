whats your workout a gridiron workout beats the grind once a week pr executive trains like an nfl star online edition the executive kristen hammer never imagined she would be in the best shape of her life at age nor did the maniacal philadelphia eagles fan ever dream shed be able to replicate the drills she watches players run through when she attends the teams preseason training camp each year "i was never very coordinated growing up and i didnt play any sports " says ms hammer but once a week ms hammer works out like an nfl player running through ladders laid down on turf jumping hurdles doing box squats and suicide sprints and performing other agility strength and speed drills for the past two years shes been exercising with a trainer at velocity sports performance a national fitness training center chain with a branch in midtown manhattan ms hammer is the senior vice president of nancy j friedman public relations an agency that specializes in travel hospitality and lifestyle industries she is " and weighs pounds and lives in new york citys hells kitchen neighborhood the workout two years ago ms hammer was watching espn at the gym and saw a commercial for velocity sports performance "they showed an indoor track and turf and hurdles i thought this looks different than the regular gym " she says at the time her workout consisted of using weight machines twice a week and doing cardio twice a week recently engaged she was looking for a way to tone up for her wedding she went to velocity for an assessment and discussed her goals and current workout with a trainer after being videotaped doing standard exercises like lunges and squats she watched the video with a trainer who pointed out where she needed to improve her form and technique then she had her first minute session which included a warm up cardio and strength "i couldnt move the next day " she recalls "i went into the office and was so sore but i like to feel like i did something " ms hammer was married this past may but decided to continue her weekly workouts at velocity she organizes the rest of her exercise program around that thursday session coincidentally her boss nancy j friedman also trains there "we compare workouts " says ms hammer "she boxes for minutes and i might try incorporating that " thursday mornings ms hammer wakes at a m and takes a taxi from her apartment to the training center where she completes an intense minute full body workout session with her trainer justin goonan she never knows what he has in store for her which is part of the fun she says the facility consists of a yard four lane track a yard football turf field and "toys" like kettlebells jump ropes stability balls hurdles and medicine balls unlike a typical gym there is hardly a weight machine in sight ms hammers minute warm up consists of functional exercises she starts out putting slipper like coverings on her feet and slides back and forth on a slideboard then its over to the track where she skips jogs backward shuffle steps sideways and draws each leg up and around as if she was clearing an imaginary hurdle mr goonan then yells out drills that one might perform in high school gym class at one recent session ms hammer ran quickly through a ladder laid on the ground then pushed a weighted plate across the turf until she hit a wall at the wall she picked up a medicine ball and tosses it sideways times on each side another series might consist of slow controlled one legged squats or pulling a weighted sled down the track or balancing on a bosu stability ball while tossing a medicine ball to mr goonan few of the exercises are flattering to perform and ms hammer says sometimes she gets embarrassed "the most ridiculous looking is a side slide i do on the track " she says "i look like an ape " the drills are non stop except for quick breaks for water and by the end of minutes ms hammer is dripping in sweat muscles shaking from exhaustion she cools down by jogging home other centers across the country offer similar programs for professional amateur and recreational athletes such as the high intensity center athletico sports performance center in mccook illinois st vincent sports performance center in indianapolis and chelsea piers bluestreak sports training in new york city ms hammer has to carefully plan her workouts for the rest of the week to make sure shes not too sore for her session "i could never run the day before " she says the night before her session ms hammer takes an hour long aqua aerobics class taught by a former rockette at the pool in her building the day after she swims laps in the pool for about minutes and also does some stretching in the water "i couldnt work out as much as i do without putting the pool into my routine " she says "the swimming helps me recover " she says ms hammer has a gym in her building on mondays she does an hour of cardio in the morning alternating between minutes on the elliptical machine minutes on the stair stepper and minutes on the treadmill "if i mix things up i dont get bored and im not hogging the machines " she says she saves her strength training for the weekends usually for an hour in the morning on saturdays ms hammer focuses on her upper body using mostly machines such as the assisted weight dip machine on sunday she works her lower body using some machines but also doing lunges squats and step ups ms hammer alternates between completing three sets of ten to repetitions and two sets using a higher weight until exhaustion the diet "i am really disciplined during the week and eat whatever i want on weekends " says ms hammer she eats a bowl of high fiber cereal and drinks two cups of coffee in the morning she doesnt like to eat before she does her football workout so by the time she gets home she says shes "starving " and will usually have an egg white omelette during the week shes busy with business lunches typically a salad with grilled chicken or other protein she usually makes an omelette for dinner if shes not out for business or with friends ms hammer doesnt have a sweet tooth but says she does like greasy foods and her biggest indulgence is pizza she tries to avoid drinking too much alcohol "i really feel like i have gained weight during a week that i have two glasses of wine here and there and then a big night out " when shes traveling for work she makes sure at least one meal per day is balanced and low fat she also drinks green tea and water throughout the day the cost ms hammer pays &# per year to use the gym and pool in her building this includes group exercise classes each minute workout session at velocity costs &# "given what i do the price is justifiable " she says "if i was paying that just to have someone show me how to use the same machines i already know how to use then i wouldnt do it but im given variety every week sometimes i go two months without repeating an exercise " she estimates that she spends about &# a year on workout clothing running shoes bathing suits swim caps and swim goggles most of which she purchases at shopping outlets the effort ms hammer says she struggles not to hit snooze when the alarm buzzes in the morning "i had to change my entire schedule to fit in working out " she says "if i leave it until after work i end up working late or having another commitment " she sets out her workout clothes and ipod the night before she also tries to avoid late work events on the night before she trains as well as work dinners and salty foods "if im tired it majorly impacts my balance " says ms hammer "and if i eat salty food the night before no matter how much gatorade i drink the next morning i can only workout at " ms hammer is also diligent about keeping her once a week training appointment if shes traveling for work then she reschedules her workout for earlier in the week she typically travels for work three times a month for three day stretches and always packs gym clothes "if you have them with you youll at least try to fit in a workout " she says "i make sure i do something at least one day when i travel if you dont have that discipline your routine can fall apart " the benefit ms hammer says that shes noticed improvement in her balance stability and coordination and shes become more toned her form has improved as well and ms hammer says shes more creative with her own workouts "instead of only using machines when i exercise on my own i have a greater range of potential non machine based exercises " still ms hammer adds "im not going to do suicide sprints or box jumps by myself "
