the afternoon report the economics of truth online edition three american economists won the nobel prize for work that centers on how mechanisms such as markets and auctions can get people to admit how much something is worth to them americans leonid hurwicz eric s maskin and roger b myerson were awarded the nobel prize in economics monday for their study of "mechanism design " an abstract branch of economics that employs daunting formulas and heroic feats of mathematics mechanism design is decidedly clear eyed in its approach understanding always less than perfect circumstances of economic exchanges one way to understand the "mechanisms" these distinguished dismal scientists study is to think about an auction for say a picasso painting its a pretty efficient way of getting people to admit by bidding how much they value the painting and according to tyler cowen a professor of economics at george mason university and well known economics blogger essentially these economists use math to analyze and describe that process of "trying to get people to tell the truth or reveal information " jeffrey ely an economics professor at northwestern university who works in the field explains mechanism design as a sort of reverse engineering of game theory a field in which people try to understand how individual incentives and structural rules interact and result in certain behaviors but instead of just understanding the rules of existing systems mechanism design focuses on designing them in such as way that a certain outcome is achieved "they developed the basic tools for thinking about institutions in this way " mr ely said of todays award winners alvin roth is a professor of economics at harvard university who has used some of the theories pioneered by todays nobel award winners to help design programs such as the process by which medical students are placed in residency programs at hospitals "you might say that before modern game theory economists looked at markets and other economic institutions sort of the way botanists look at plants as naturally occurring mysteries to be studied " mr roth wrote in an email "mechanism design takes seriously that markets are built by people and starts to ask what we can do with them what we cant and how best to go about it " as such their work has applications in a wide range of fields from regulatory policies such as the federal communications commissions somewhat abstract auctions of bandwidth on the wireless spectrum to the residency placement system devised mr roth to the kidney donation swaps highlighted in todays wall street journal and more generally the economists theories can be used as a framework to help identify when markets auctions or other mechanisms such as matching programs might be better or ill suited for providing a specific outcome at years old mr hurwicz is the oldest nobel winner ever according to the academy mr maskin years old is professor at the institute for advanced study at princeton n j and mr myerson is a professor at the university of chicago the award is officially known as the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences it isnt one of the original
