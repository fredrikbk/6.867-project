exorcising ghosts of octobers past despite housing slump crashes such as in likely to stay memories with the stock market booming lately many investors are putting aside worries about the housing slump and the summers credit crunch at the same time some are thinking about a looming anniversary twenty years ago this friday on oct the stock market crashed a memory that still gives veteran stock traders chills in a single day the dow jones industrial average fell points or its worst one day percentage drop ever not counting when the market reopened after being closed for more than four months during world war i for reasons analysts dont fully understand october has been the month for market crashes and other sudden drops it was in october that stocks crashed in falling over two days on oct within a day of the anniversary of the crash the dow jones industrial average fell for a drop of in two months but in most years october has been a fine month for stocks often marking the beginning of a fourth quarter rally that is what investors are banking on today as stocks trade once again near record territory after scary dips in february and august after two records this month the dow industrials are ahead this year "i think the fed has taken care of" the summers harrowing turbulence by cutting short term interest rates pumping money into the banking system and seeming determined to prevent recession says janna sampson co chief investment officer at money management firm oakbrook investments in lisle ill she was a young money manager in "i can remember standing in front of a quotron machine in a crowd of people and mouths were just hanging open " she says most investors today have little if any memory of the crash even many who do believe that despite surprising similarities between now and then there are enough differences to assuage their worries "the similarities outnumber the differences but again thats not to say a crash will result " liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at discount brokerage firm charles schwab wrote in a recent report as in the bull market has been running for five years and is looking somewhat tired the dollar was under attack in as it has been this year as autumn began the u s and its trading partners were bickering about the weak dollar then as now the u s was nervous about its large trade deficit and the inroads of big asian exporters japan back then china today foreign investors were pouring money into the u s in big buyout firms dazzled wall street by taking major companies private just as they did this year in both years lending markets faced disruptions this year as in sophisticated investors thought they could use computerized techniques to protect themselves from market drops and in both years they failed in investors planned to sell futures in case of a downdraft a technique known as portfolio insurance they discovered that when too many people tried to sell the same futures at the same time there werent enough buyers this summer sophisticated hedge funds using mathematical models discovered that if too many tried to cover similar bets at the same time they all could suffer heavy losses but some of the root causes of the crash appear to be missing today a big problem years ago was that stocks had risen too far too fast at their august high the dow industrials were up more than for alone a stunning short term gain they slipped after that falling especially heavily just before the crash this year the stock gains have been more moderate at their record close of last tuesday the dow industrials were up for the year the dow finished on friday at instead of declining as october wears on stocks have rebounded stocks dont look as overpriced today as they did in today the companies in the standard &amp poors stock index trade only a little above the historical average of times profits for the past months in the s&amp p was at more than times profits interest rates are much lower than they were then and inflation which was causing the federal reserve to fret in appears to be moderating at least for now indeed one of the most significant differences between then and now is the feds position in to fight inflation the fed was raising interest rates and tightening credit conditions which made bonds look attractive compared with stocks and amplified worries that stocks were overvalued alan greenspan then the fed chairman didnt loosen the credit reins until after the crash this time the fed already has stepped in lowering target short term interest rates and pumping money into the banking system frozen credit markets are a bigger worry than overvalued stocks and the feds early action has helped stocks rebound investors are putting a good deal of faith in fed chairman ben bernanke who spent years as an academic studying the great depression and the role the fed can play in preventing a recurrence "if anybody in the world would know the dangers of a situation like this it ought to be ben bernanke who became quite well known for his studies of it " says richard sylla a financial historian at new york universitys stern school of business despite the continuing housing crisis and difficulties that many borrowers still face raising money many investors believe the worst of the years troubles are over while they wouldnt be surprised to see some stock jitters crop up around the time of the anniversary they see stocks continuing their rebound "hardly anyone is thinking about" the crash says phil roth chief technical market analyst at new york brokerage firm miller tabak mr roth thinks u s stocks may surprise people by declining further but he thinks there are bigger risks in foreign markets which have risen more rapidly "the next crash will probably be where the most speculation is the most speculation now is not in u s stocks not many of them anyway the speculation is in asia primarily china and india " mr roth says another source of reassurance frightening though was with some stock brokers literally ceasing to answer their phones on the day of the crash the worst was over on that day unlike when the crash led to the great depression the economy kept growing in the crash actually marked the markets low point and stocks recovered the next day beginning a new bull market right then by years end stocks had risen enough that the dow industrials showed a gain for the year some investors now worry that current economic problems could be worse than in and could be longer lasting even without a crash or a bear market the crash was about overvalued stocks and rising interest rates and it didnt seriously hamper economic growth the troubles this year include the threat to consumer spending from the housing slump and credit problems "the disaster in was different than others because it happened so fast it was hard to know how far the tentacles were going to reach " says steve finerty chairman of argent capital management in st louis "of course in after three or four months it was ancient history i dont think it is going to be that way this time but you never know things can change fast " corrections &amp amplifications the dow jones industrial average rose when the stock market reopened on dec after a month hiatus during world war i however because of a recalculation of the average in when new components were added historical data appear to show a decline from july the last trading day before the hiatus based on the historical data the abreast of the market column on oct incorrectly suggested that the dow industrials fell after the hiatus wsj oct
