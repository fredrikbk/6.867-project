theory &amp practice why silicon valley is rethinking the cubicle office intel and its peers aim to use space better improve productivity intel corp is often credited or blamed for popularizing the office cubicle now it is joining some prominent silicon valley peers in reconsidering the concept the chip maker emulating experiments at companies such as cisco systems inc and hewlett packard co is planning tests in three u s locations of new office layouts plans include tables where several users can plop down with laptop computers multiworker desks and lounge like settings with armchairs all a far cry from the mazelike grid of tall gray cubicles in most intel buildings behind such tests is a growing recognition that classic dilbert style cubicles have many shortcomings for one thing they tend to block visibility without blocking much noise from other cubes "it gives you this incredibly false sense of privacy " said carl bass chief executive of software maker autodesk inc who is pushing for more open layouts at his own company cubicles can prompt odd behavior people who have studied them said it is hard to see if colleagues are busy so some cube dwellers will send emails to a neighbor about a simple question that could have been answered more easily in a conversation some technology companies never adopted cubes microsoft corp for example promotes quiet and concentration by giving most workers offices with doors that is costly chris hood a manager in what h p calls its workplace program said contact and collaboration boost productivity for many employees rather than make isolation the norm employers should provide quiet zones for when they are needed he said corporate bean counters meanwhile seize on the expense of office space that is often empty as workers spend more time traveling telecommuting or meeting with colleagues at the same time the rise of wireless networking has made it easier for workers with laptop computers to be productive while dropping in at unassigned desks or open tables networking company cisco which began adding open desk and seating options in estimated improved use of its offices has reduced space related costs in remodeled areas by sun microsystems inc is particularly aggressive about flexible work styles the computer maker estimated that about of its employees work from home or a remote office as many as two days a week to accommodate these workers when they are in the office sun offers drop in desks and places terminals in offices cafeterias and other common spaces intel which helped promote wireless networking in laptops would seem an obvious candidate for such offices cubicles are a part of its egalitarian self image like its philosophy against reserved parking spaces and other perks for top managers the result in most intel offices is pretty grim observed comedian conan obrien in a visit to intel headquarters in may that turned into a popular internet video "it makes people feel that they are all basically the same that there is no individuality there is no hope " he said before mr obriens visit intel began considering changes as part of efforts to improve efficiency said neil tunmore the companys director of corporate services in an internal survey of employees said intels cubicle scheme didnt promote innovation he said about favored the cubicles others voiced no strong opinion he said many workers said they wanted more common spaces mr tunmore said paradoxically they also wanted less noise in cubes people are often unaware of how much noise they are making compared with workers in open seating plans he said a typical floor at intels headquarters building in santa clara california holds workers and has conference rooms the rooms are often booked but empty because the demand leads employees to reserve them if there is a chance they will be needed mr tunmore said in one of its tests intel plans to add small conference rooms to a floor for meetings of two to four people and a dozen "private audio rooms" for private conversations that arent possible in cubicles as with most things inside intel there has been plenty of debate about the issues where people in jobs such as marketing tend to want open offices for example employees in product groups favor cubes mr tunmore said there were noticeable differences of opinion among intel sites he added intel stressed the tests dont mean it is headed for companywide changes but mr tunmore said "what we are finding is we will never please everybody in the company " time to remodel for those considering trading in their cubicles here are some lessons from silicon valley technology companies survey the work force would employees welcome a change talk to peers have other firms tried new office layouts one style wont fit all workers some collaborate others work alone offer drop in spaces for road warriors and telecommuters consider "quiet zones" for concentration and confidentiality esthetics count
