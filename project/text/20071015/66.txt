sometimes moving up makes it harder to see what goes on below executives know success in business depends on identifying and fixing problems before they become crises it is the most basic rule in management no matter how smart your strategies seem on paper if you dont know how theyre being executed and whether there are urgent problems you wont be successful the higher executives climb the less likely they are to know what is and isnt working at their companies many are surrounded by yes people who filter information others dismiss or ignore bearers of bad news "ive heard so many executives tell employees to be candid and then jump down their throats if they bring up a problem or ask a critical question " says yogesh gupta president and ceo of fatwire a software company that helps businesses manage their web sites mr gupta was determined not to do that when he was recruited to fatwire from ca in august since then he has spent hours talking with his employees and seeking the advice of his nine senior managers all but one of whom are veterans of the company he has frequent private meetings with each member of the management team so they will feel freer to be candid with him in that way he can ask the important questions what am i doing wrong what would you do differently if you were running the company whats the biggest thing getting in the way of you doing your job well already he learned from these talks that fatwire should beef up its staff in marketing and in product development others have counseled him to improve fatwires customer support processes every time he has gotten good advice privately he has found a way to publicly praise the manager so others will come forward with suggestions "i know i have to say you did the right thing to speak up again and again because employees fear theyll get blamed if they say anything negative " says mr gupta ken siegel an organizational psychologist and president of the impact group in los angeles believes that most ceos avoid learning what their employees are thinking and doing he advises those who want to get to the truth to assemble a senior team of people with diverse points of view "instead of surrounding them with executives who think just like they do they need people down the hall who are their opposites have very different strengths and push them to see reality differently " he says whats more common is for ceos to find one confidante to confer with who usually isnt a direct report riza berkan ceo of hakia a search engine start up talks several times a week with board chairman and investor pentii kouri "he gives me a perspective i dont have about people as well as finance matters " says dr berkan a computer scientist when an investor said he wanted to attend board meetings "i was ready to get into a fight but pentii encouraged me to win his understanding" and convince him that only directors would attend executives at big companies who have many layers of management between themselves and front line employees face the biggest challenge finding out how their strategies are actually working those who want accurate information must commit to spending time in the field often and on their own where they are away from handlers and can coax employees to be forthcoming about problems kathleen murphy ceo of ings u s wealth management unit which sells a variety of products from annuities to financial planning services oversees employees she holds town hall meetings with large groups of employees but admits the sessions "are mostly for me to push my message out because people are less candid at big meetings " so she also meets regularly with smaller groups of managers at all levels of her division once when an operations group complained about a convoluted work process she agreed the change they proposed was more efficient but she says she doesnt always act on what she hears believing that executives have to filter out the inevitable complaints from the crucial information and ideas that create a productive and congenial workplace an upbeat executive ms murphy has teamwork in her dna she grew up negotiating with her five siblings for elbow room at the dinner table and played lots of sports she says she has a "low tolerance" for people who are complainers "theres a big difference between candor that stems from caring about doing things better and negative energy which can be toxic " she says after reorganizing her division recently ms murphy sat through several meetings at which managers made suggestions and expressed their concerns she encouraged everyone to voice their objections but made her case that the changes would help them expand the business and better serve their customers they went through "a few rough sessions " she admits but in the end they found common ground her listening made all the difference now moving to a new building shell be next door to her customer service staff email me at inthelead
