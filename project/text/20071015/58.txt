politics &amp economics new hurdle for nuclear plants licensing system seen by utilities as too slow amid rush for supply the nuclear regulatory commission spent the past decade simplifying the process of licensing the next generation of nuclear power plants intending to avoid the delays and cost overruns of the past but unexpected hitches are appearing as utilities and vendors skip voluntary steps of a process many companies already find too slow the nuclear revival got its official kickoff last month with an application from nrg energy inc princeton n j for the first new nuclear plant in three decades the nrc is preparing for nuclear power plant applications by including as many as nine this year from the start potential applicants are signaling they will depart from the nrcs partly voluntary plan not one of the expected applications is expected to conform exactly to the nrcs preferred process dale klein chairman of the nrc said reality is diverging from "our best laid plans" because "weve been overcome by events " those events are the industrys desire to quickly find new power sources nuclear power is expected to make a comeback in part because utilities are under pressure to reduce reliance on other power sources such as coal fired plants that pose environmental problems at the same time many utilities see their electricity reserves thinning in the face of rising demand congress has added to the nuclear rush by lavishing potentially billions of dollars of subsidies on builders of the first few reactors the first two units for example qualify for federal risk insurance of as much as &# million apiece it drops by half for the next four and then disappears first movers also qualify for a production tax credit these circumstances are prompting the power industry to accelerate the shift toward nuclear power as a result some companies are skipping some of the nrcs steps altogether or pursuing parts of the process simultaneously for example some seek reactor certifications at the same time other companies seek plant licensings hinging on those certifications mr klein said he hopes "our processes are robust enough" to handle all the variations "we need our plants far sooner than the process ever envisioned " said mike wallace president of constellation energy group inc s generation group the baltimore company hopes to have a new nuclear plant in operation in maryland in "but we wish wed had it in because we need the electricity " the new process at the nrc was intended to eliminate the problems of the past the old system forced companies to seek construction permits and later come back for operating licenses that led to massive cost overruns when plants had to be re engineered often after construction started to meet changing design criteria delays of a decade or more werent uncommon this time builders will have more certainty that when they start construction they will build plants that will pass muster the nrc process entails three parts equipment vendors seek certification for new reactor designs power companies seek early site permits and then they seek permission to build and operate power plants on the design front equipment makers like general electric co westinghouse electric co a unit of japans toshiba corp and areva sa were expected to get reactors certified first and then help utilities propose standardized plant designs using those reactors the nations fleet of nuclear plants includes different designs by the nrcs count before seeking the combined construction permit and operating license the nrc wanted utilities to first seek approval for their proposed plant sites to determine their suitability that the commission said would speed up the process of going through a standardized application process early site review wasnt required but it was strongly recommended the nrc committed to a month schedule for processing applications once it had reviewed them for completeness when nrg energy submitted the first full application for a plant the plans immediately departed from the preferred process nrg decided to skip the early site permit process for its south texas site because it plans to put two new reactors next to an existing nuclear station it picked a ge designed reactor that was certified but in so it already is out of date in some respects nrg is seeking permission to make modifications that reflect a decade of operating experience in japan and technology advancements like better computer controls the approach contains some risk for utilities modifications sought by equipment vendors as part of certifications are decided once and for all by the nrc but modifications sought by utilities as part of plant licensing can be challenged in each case in the past this provided an avenue for lengthy delays by opponents four reactor designs are certified for u s use but only two the earlier ge design picked by nrg and a westinghouse design called the ap have attracted interest from u s customers the westinghouse design has been selected by the most companies westinghouse got its reactor certified in december but it is back at the nrc asking for changes in its design some fix errors some come in response to nrc requests for example the post sept requirement to design plants to withstand airline crashes and some are sought by customers the nrc review is expected to take a couple of years in the meantime several power companies are expected to submit their combined construction and operating license applications constellation which is expected to submit an application soon also decided to skip the early site review for its maryland location it has picked a reactor by french based areva that isnt certified for u s use areva intends to submit a reactor certification request to the nrc by year end and hopes to have approval in tom christopher chief executive of arevas u s unit said it will be challenging to have reactor certification and plant licensing occurring simultaneously pursuing approvals on parallel tracks could be a problem for ge and its customers too ge got off to a rocky start in in efforts to get certification of its newest reactor the "economic simplified boiling water reactor " the nrcs mr klein said he told ge "to get their act together" and he has seen improvements but certification isnt expected before three customers led by dominion resources inc submit applications to build plants based on the design andy white head of ge hitachi nuclear energy ges joint venture with hitachi ltd said ge underestimated the volume of information the nrc would require it has since beefed up its certification team corrections &amp amplifications the nuclear regulatory commission has proposed a new rule to assess how new nuclear plants could be built with greater ability to resist the effects of a large commercial aircraft impact the rule if adopted likely wouldnt apply to westinghouse electric co s ap nuclear reactor a politics &amp economics article monday incorrectly said westinghouse is seeking to modify its certified reactor design partly in response to an nrc requirement wsj
