a proposal to strengthen retirement security for all i appreciate martin feldsteins comments in his oct editorial page commentary "social security compromise " regarding my proposal and what it might accomplish my principal goal in introducing the proposal is to strengthen the retirement security of all americans by increasing the supply of savings the proposal will also provide a critical source of capital that can make u s businesses more competitive while i believe social security can be strengthened this proposal will supplement not supplant social security this is a fundamental difference between my proposal and what the president envisioned as his reform proposal i am hopeful that democrats and republicans can agree that additional savings on top of social security is the best way to move forward on this important issue rep rahm emanuel d ill washington
