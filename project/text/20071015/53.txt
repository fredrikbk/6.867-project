plan to save banks depends on cooperation of investors the planned bailout of bank sponsored lending vehicles is an attempt to build confidence in a part of the credit markets that remains largely frozen in the wake of this summers debt market turmoil if investors can be persuaded credit market problems are under control it will save the banks from having to take big hits to their reputations and their balance sheets it also would prevent the recent financial tremors from spreading through the overall economy in the form of a new credit crunch ironically by working with the u s treasury department to develop the plan big banks such as citigroup inc are admitting things are bad and that their options arent pleasant investors appear more than willing to focus on the positive in the past few weeks they have applauded as banks and investment houses took about &# billion in losses related to their exposure to troubled mortgages and leveraged loans bidding up financial stocks and sending u s stock markets to record levels the risk is that the plan ultimately requires the implicit cooperation of investors if they get more frazzled rather than calmed by the bailout debt markets could tumble further potentially making the plan more expensive and risky citigroup and other banks are struggling with so called structured investment vehicles or sivs which are off balance sheet vehicles that issue short term commercial paper and medium term notes the proceeds are invested in higher yielding assets such as mortgage backed securities the banks earn a profit from the spread between the paper issued and what they invested in citigroup was the leader in this market with about &# billion of the &# billion outstanding bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co dont have sivs but have agreed to take part in the bailout plan helping to organize the vehicle that will pool siv assets banks typically agree to provide in an emergency funds equivalent to to of a sivs assets banks are realizing that investors may have been too confident believing banks were fully backing sivs that put the banks in the potentially awkward position of having to provide even more support to protect their reputations "banks have reputations to protect in business and political interest far removed from the world of sivs and the blow to a banks reputation that may be occasioned by a failure of a siv may be more than the bank can tolerate " ratings provider moodys corp wrote in a recent report on sivs the stakes are high if the plan doesnt work and the credit markets remain nervous sivs might have to dump their assets onto the market at fire sale prices that could spark another wave of write downs among financial institutions globally banks also would be hurt another way they would have to bring the sivs assets onto their own balance sheets that could force banks to cut back on lending which is what government officials are most worried about it also could spell the end of sivs because banks may no longer be willing to use this structure which could lead to a tightening of lending investors have plenty of reason to be wary too the implicit acknowledgment by banks that sivs are in such trouble could reignite fears about the quality of assets underpinning commercial paper that could spark new debt market turmoil if investors again shy away from such vehicles preventing the vehicles from rolling over their ious the banks moves may strike some investors as eerily reminiscent of the bailout of long term capital management in by a group of investment banks after the hedge fund nearly collapsed in the wake of a debt crisis if the banks plan backfires by spooking markets prices of government bonds could jump even as stocks of financial institutions face another round of selling that could help to depress the broader stock market that is what happened when the credit crunch gathered steam in late august panicked investors shunned commercial paper and money market accounts in favor of safe haven government bonds that market seizure put pressure on the banking system and raised fears about the overall economy prompting the federal reserve to cut interest rates hedge funds and other large investors reacted with cautious enthusiasm to news of the rescue plan which calls for the creation of a large fund to pool siv assets "its great for banks like citigroup " said doug teitelbaum who runs bay harbour management a &# billion new york hedge fund "its a smart pathway to a more orderly work through of the problems any time people inject enough liquidity to avert crisis the market reacts positively but it doesnt solve the problems of consumers and their ability to service and refinance their home loans " if siv losses continue to mount banks could be forced to re evaluate whether they can legitimately keep the vehicles off their books that point was hammered home in a discussion paper issued by the center for audit quality an influential accounting industry group sivs and other off balance sheet vehicles called conduits which are big issuers of commercial paper have to offload any potential losses to third party investors to stay off a sponsoring banks books deepening losses within a siv can mean that the bank starts to share in that loss the center for audit qualitys paper said banks need to periodically reassess whether they are being exposed to such losses if so a bank "would be required to consolidate" the vehicle unless it takes actions to reduce its exposure the paper said the plan being contemplated by citigroup and other banks by transferring siv assets and possible losses to a new vehicle would likely address this concern and prevent banks from having to consolidate the vehicles there is one silver lining should the citigroup siv plan cause alarm in markets any sign that another credit crunch is looming could prompt the federal reserve to cut interest rates further that in turn could give further support to stocks gregory zuckerman contributed to this article
