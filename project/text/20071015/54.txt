politics &amp economics can food industry police itself new safety system likely to focus on prevention but trust is an issue washington food industries and federal regulators are increasingly advocating the same solution following a rash of food borne illnesses have companies police themselves and take action to prevent outbreaks but this system of "preventive controls" has worked in the past only with adequate regulatory enforcement and industry support neither of which is guaranteed "the reason you have regulation is some companies dont have the market incentive to meet high food quality standards " said mike taylor a food safety expert who worked in the administrations of george h w bush and bill clinton "the public doesnt trust a system that leaves it entirely to the industry " in recent years the number of illnesses caused by foods regulated by the food and drug administration including fresh produce and peanut butter has risen sharply according to an analysis of government and medical journal data by the center for science in the public interest a consumer group in washington traditionally the fda has reacted to outbreaks after they occur by focusing on preventive rather than reactive measures the industry would be required to do more self policing so regulators could focus their limited resources on riskier products a white house cabinet level group set up to address import safety problems has recently touted preventive controls as a solution the fda is likely to advocate preventive controls as part of a new food safety plan set for release as early as this month the food industrys biggest trade group the grocery manufacturers association has proposed that the fda require importers to vouch for the quality of foods and ingredients many of the groups biggest companies such as general mills inc and kraft foods inc already voluntarily apply preventive control measures on imports preventive control systems differ from industry to industry and company to company but in all cases businesses identify and control food safety hazards the beef industry has some of the most comprehensive systems after the agriculture department required it to adopt preventive controls by when cattle carcasses arrive at the slaughterhouse floor workers sample specimens to see how much e coli bacteria exist on the hide said dell allen a former food safety official for cargill meat solution inc a unit of closely held cargill inc the sample results are measured against standards for acceptable levels of bacteria the bacterial level continues to be measured during each step of processing that includes when carcasses are washed sanitized and rinsed and after the hide and innards are removed more testing occurs when the stripped down carcass is washed again pasteurized in steam chilled and cut up for sale meat with high bacterial levels is destroyed or cooked to kill the pathogens the agriculture department began requiring preventive controls for the meat industry in response to a e coli outbreak involving undercooked hamburgers at jack in the box restaurants that killed four and sickened hundreds to enforce the rule the agriculture department dispatched its plus inspectors who were already mandated by law to do daily physical inspections on meat before it was sold the agency also had plentiful financial resources although it regulates only one fifth of the nations foodstuffs it gets three quarters of food inspection funding though the meat industry initially resisted the making of the rule big players like cargill and tyson foods inc eventually invested millions of dollars to develop and apply better pathogen testing tools by the centers for disease control and prevention reported that the number of e coli infections involving meat and poultry had dropped by to per people in from there may be a recent uptick in the trend but the rule is still mostly seen as effective the fda by contrast has had less success implementing preventive controls for seafood under its rule which allowed for a two year phase in seafood processors and importers must identify what types of biological and other hazards are common to each of odd seafood species set up ways to prevent contamination and keep records for fda inspection but the agencys budget and number of inspectors were only a fraction of the usdas its rule also wasnt as strict it didnt require the industry to test for pathogens and it exempted about one third of seafood processors considered low risk don kraemer the fdas deputy director for food safety said the exemption has allowed the agency to focus on high risk seafood companies mr taylor the food safety expert worked on both the usda and fda plans he said the seafood regulations which required fda enforcement without granting the agency new powers "were pushing the limits of the fdas authority " some seafood businesses questioned the fdas right to request records and conduct inspections some foreign seafood producers balked at opening doors to the fda much of the food industry wanted to keep the fda "barefoot and pregnant " said william hubbard a former fda associate commissioner mr kraemer said some groups "had to be forced to do it right " but that most of the domestic industry became supportive a boom in food imports also hit the fda much harder the usda regulates mostly u s produced goods with only foreign countries allowed to ship meat to the u s through as many ports the fda by contrast has relatively little control over the foreign seafood processors shipping into u s ports when imports accounted for more than half of all seafood consumed in the u s in the late s and today the fda in the late s had planned to visit foreign countries to evaluate seafood safety standards but those plans were gradually abandoned due to costs and the challenges of dealing with myriad differing standards "the u s is flooded with an enormous volume of food from abroad where the risks to food are greater than ever before and at a time in which the fdas ability to protect our food supply is growing even weaker " mr hubbard said now the industry is looking to strengthen regulation including broadening the use of preventive controls apparently realizing that a weak fda affects consumer confidence and their bottom line several trade groups such as the gma and national fisheries institute are lobbying for more funding and authority for the agency to oversee food safety "we are susceptible to the weakest link " said john connelly the institutes president the fda has said it may ask for more authority and funding to back its food safety plan though agency officials declined to elaborate
