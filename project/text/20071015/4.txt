ahead of the tape an indicator thats lagging dow transports the dow jones industrial average may have recaptured its highs of the summer but there is a longstanding belief among some investors that if the dow jones transportation average doesnt catch up this is destined to become the little rally that couldnt dow theory which is based on investing guidelines first put forth by the wall street journal founder charles dow more than years ago says that new highs in the industrial average need to be confirmed by new highs in the transportation average on friday the industrial average rose points to a record the transportation average finished at below the record it hit in july mr dows basic idea was that if industrial companies were doing better they were shipping more and that benefited transportation companies both the economy and the stock market are different now industrial concerns arent the players they once were with many of the companies in the industrial average such as microsoft wal mart stores and walt disney reflecting that shift still investors who scoffed at dow theory when the transportation average started to shift lower in were soon sorry for it and they may be sorry for it this time around too last week truck leasing and logistics company ryder system cut its earnings outlook sparking a selloff in its shares last month fedex reduced its earnings expectations citing a sluggish economy the american trucking association reported last month it sees "softness in the trucking industry " much of the weakness is directly tied to the housing downturn which has cut into the amount of lumber and wallboard being shipped in the country more recently a slowdown in consumer spending appears to have been cutting into shipping traffic for the week ended oct the association of american railroads reported that the volume of shipping containers and truck trailers traveling on u s rails was down from the year ago period but theres reason to hope that the trouble in the transportation average may not hurt the stock market at large first transportation companies are largely domestic affairs generating nearly all of their revenue at home as last weeks unexpected narrowing of the trade deficit showed u s exports are growing at prodigious pace so long as that continues which is to say so long as the rest of the world keeps growing solidly the stock market may be able to fight off the domestic slowdown and the transportation stock slump also many transportation companies were up until july favorites in the hedge fund community there are relatively few public truck companies and railroads and that meant investors who decided that transportation was a good bet were all crowding into the same stocks when the stock market ran into trouble this summer with some large hedge funds forced into making large sales there was a rush for the exits in transportation stocks still while investors can take solace in the idea that the drop in the transportation average doesnt spell trouble it would be a lot more comforting to see it coming up fast in the industrial averages rearview mirror send comments to justin lahart wsj com corrections &amp amplifications the dow jones industrial average closed at a record high of last tuesday yesterdays ahead of the tape column incorrectly said that fridays close of was a record wsj oct
