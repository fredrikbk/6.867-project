pay tv wants bigger bite of asia market campaign incentives court media buyers mastering diverse field ad spending is booming across asia increasing annually at double digit percentage rates in markets from china to india now the regions pay television channels are fighting for a bigger slice of that pie cable and satellite have vastly expanded their reach in recent years they are available in at least of homes with televisions in most asian markets and nearly of homes in some while pay tvs asia wide advertising revenue has increased about in the past four years according to the cable and satellite broadcasting association of asia its share of spending on tv ads has hovered at about the industry thinks it ought to be about double that last month casbaa as the trade organization is known introduced a cooperative campaign to persuade advertisers and media agencies to spend more on pay tv casbaas members include international channels that offer regional asian feeds such as viacoms mtv asia and time warners cnn international with pay tvs niche channels "you can get much further reach and a much deeper reach into the audience " said simon twiston davies chief executive of casbaa "we have high quality viewers what is not taken into account by some media buyers is that these are the ones who can afford goods " casbaas "power of pay tv" campaign which it has been developing for about a year includes an extensive web site and visits to advertisers by the organization pay tv which is separate from free to air broadcasting includes channels that consumers pay to receive such as cable satellite and internet protocol tv advertisers and media agencies said they appreciate casbaas efforts to clarify pay tvs offerings but arent totally convinced by its argument that panregional subscription tv channels can deliver the customers they want richard davies vice president of media in asia pacific the middle east and africa for anglo dutch consumer products company unilever said he wants a strong pay tv industry it will give him more options to target a wide cross section of consumers with the ad budget he oversees of more than billion euros &# billion annually nonetheless "the vast majority of asia is still developing " he said "larger more nationally focused advertisers like ourselves tend to focus on domestic offerings at the end of the day thats where the majority of the viewership comes from " on average the pay tv industry gets about half its revenue from ads and the other half from subscriptions in asia it gets about from subscriptions despite a problem with signal piracy some asian pay tv operators are going out of their way to woo advertisers by offering unusual media buys or working to incorporate sponsors into programs most important the so called "peoplemeter" data that advertisers and agencies use to plan media purchases and figure out return on investment have been unreliable and inconsistent for pay tv in asias diverse markets buying ratings data from different sources in each market can cost more than half a million dollars for a single channel broadcast tv by contrast enjoys relatively comprehensive and reliable data as well as broad reach and localized programming casbaa is trying to address the data problems by making data about its members combined audience reach available for media planners on its web site even when marketers are targeting the relatively upscale and niche audiences that pay tv can deliver their own organizations arent always structured to buy ad time on a regional level as marketers have expanded their asian businesses in recent years many have shunned regional headquarters for local operations "clients have gotten a lot more clever about where they spend their money we dont want big media plans that deliver on numbers across all geographies " said david morgan regional director of interpublic groups universal mccann many advertisers such as some of unilevers beauty brands want to tailor ads for each local market that was once difficult to do on regional pay tv channels although many have added local feeds where they can insert local ads some marketers question whether the content offered by many of the regional channels is relevant to viewers while some broadcasters have developed local language channels many other channels simply feed subtitled english language programming around the region viewers appreciate the high production values but the programs dont necessarily resonate with them as much as local shows run by competing local terrestrial broadcasters axn a general entertainment channel owned by sony corp s sony pictures entertainment that airs u s shows such as "csi crime scene investigation " has tried to find a middle ground by producing its own shows last year it launched "the amazing race asia " an asian regional version of a reality game show popular in the u s thanks to that show "we have been able to pull in new advertisers onto the channel " said gregory ho vice president of advertising sales at spe networks in asia these include london based bank standard chartered plc and caltex a brand of petroleum products from chevron corp that is used in asia africa and the middle east the advertisers not only bought typical second spots for the show they also were mixed into product placements during the program and online activities surrounding it
