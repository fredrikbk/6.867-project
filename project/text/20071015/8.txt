blackwater vies for jobs beyond guard duty moyock n c even as blackwater usa seeks to extricate itself from a firestorm over the conduct of its private security forces in iraq company founder erik prince is laying plans for an expansion that would put his for hire forces in hot spots around the world doing far more than guard duty blackwater faces criticism in the wake of a sept shooting by the companys guards that the iraqi government says killed civilians a crisis that appears to threaten the companys livelihood yet at blackwaters headquarters here where the sound of gunfire and explosions is testament to the daily training of hundreds of law enforcement and military personnel mr princes ambition is on display mr prince wants to vault blackwater into the major leagues of u s military contracting taking advantage of the movement to privatize all kinds of government security the company wants to be a one stop shop for the u s government on missions to which it wont commit american forces this is a niche with few established competitors but it is drawing more and more interest from big military firms already the year old company which went from renting out shooting ranges for thousands of dollars in its early years to revenue of almost a half billion dollars last year is bidding on military work against industry giants such as lockheed martin corp and northrop grumman corp mr prince says he is planning to build blackwaters expertise in training transportation and military support while expanding into making everything from remotely piloted blimps to an armored truck called the grizzly that is tough enough to compete for the armys latest armored vehicle contract "we see the security market diminishing " mr prince said he added that the companys focus "is going to be more of a full spectrum " ranging from delivering humanitarian aid to responding to natural disasters to handling the behind the lines logistics of moving heavy equipment and supplies a continued increase in the outsourcing of national security work isnt assured "theres certainly a lot of questions about privatization that need to be asked " said rep david price d n c who has introduced legislation to broaden the jurisdiction of u s criminal law to cover battlefield contractors "i think this isnt just about one company this is about governmental practice that has gone quite far without oversight and accountability " still the defense department recently tapped blackwater to compete for parts of a five year &# billion budget to fight terrorists with drug trade ties the u s government wants to use contractors to help its allies thwart drug trafficking and provide equipment training and people lockheed martin northrop grumman and raytheon co are among those also in the running for the contracts to make good on blackwaters expansion plans mr prince must first extinguish the crisis raging over blackwater employees conduct as a private security force for the state department in iraq critics say blackwaters aggressive tactics while effective have unnecessarily led to civilian deaths and complicated already tense relations between the u s and the iraqi government investigators for the house oversight and government reform committee found that there have been reported shooting incidents and iraqi casualties involving blackwaters guards in iraq since the company has said it has done missions for the state department since june using its weapons just of the time the bush administration which has counted heavily on contractors to help the u s military in iraq and elsewhere has done little to directly help blackwater in the current controversy defense secretary robert gates has ordered a review of how security firms are used in iraq and the state department has distanced itself requiring that all private security convoys include a state department monitor to oversee their actions also last week blackwater withdrew from an industry association of defense services firms as the group began looking into whether blackwater was following the associations ethical and operational guidelines rather than hunker down mr prince has abandoned the low profile under which he has operated in part because of language in his contract with the state department and mounted a public relations campaign mr prince says he stands behind his people who are putting their lives on the line in one of the most dangerous cities in the world he adds that he has confidence that the federal bureau of investigation and state department will determine what actually happened during the sept shooting for blackwater the stakes are high because there is a steady stream of cash from the security work "were a lot smaller than you think " mr prince said according to state department testimony before congress blackwaters share of the departments world wide spending on security mainly focused on iraq costs the government &# million a year for guard work and another &# million for aircraft just six years ago blackwater didnt even register a blip on the defense industrys radar screen when he founded blackwater in mr prince wasnt yet years old and had just helped sell his familys auto parts business for &# billion betting that he could capitalize on his experience as a former navy seal he established a compound in north carolina to train elite forces in conditions as close to combat as possible there are signs everywhere at blackwaters moyock compound that mr prince is serious about making blackwater more indispensable to the government the company has a fleet of aircraft including small turboprop cargo planes that can land on runways too small or rough for the air force the companys aviation unit has done repeat business with the defense department in central asia flying small loads of cargo between bases also in the north carolina compound an armored car production line that mr prince says will be able to build of the brutish looking grizzly vehicles a year the project arose out of a need for blackwater to protect its security convoys in iraq drawing on mr princes family history in the automotive industry blackwater made sure that the vehicles are legal to drive on u s highways mr prince bought a foot civilian vessel that blackwater has modified for potential paramilitary use mr prince sees the ship as a possible step into worlds such as search and rescue peacekeeping and maritime training betting big on future work doesnt come cheap however and mr prince said that he has spent millions of dollars on research and development to come up with better airships and armored cars some observers say blackwater is positioned to land more military work despite the controversy over its operations in iraq "we learned in the last round of big army contracts congress can beat up on blackwater all they want without regulating them but it just ends up giving jobs to the brits and other foreign firms " said steve schooner a professor at the george washington university law school and a contracting expert "blackwater is going to grow and if they dont one of their competitors is going to " not just guns for hire some blackwater usa and affiliate businesses planes and helicopters maintain and operate aircraft fleet training teach military and law enforcement personnel shooting driving other skills security provide protective guards for state department and other agencies armored vehicles manufacture grizzly ied resistant armored vehicle seagoing vessel operate foot ship for training and other missions k train
