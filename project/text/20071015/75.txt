thinking big on global warming what is to be blamed for global warming since the s man made emissions of greenhouse gases have been designated as the principal culprit especially co emitted by the burning of coal and petroleum products numerous measures have been proposed to reduce these emissions and since climate change does not stop at national borders european governments the united nations and more recently the united states have tried to establish world wide emission goals by organizing a cavalcade of international conferences from the kyoto conference to an upcoming convention in bali yet no binding agreement has been reached on reducing global co levels let alone on the means to assure compliance decades into this debate we have neither widely agreed upon limits on future greenhouse gas emissions nor the administrative capabilities to implement such limits moreover climate scientists warn that emission controls alone may not stabilize the climate is there anything that can be done actually there is one approach rarely discussed at global warming conferences is to develop capabilities for increasing the fraction of sunlight that is reflected outward by the upper atmosphere back into space this approach is called "climate geo engineering " expressed in terms of the metaphor of the "greenhouse effect " it would work like this geo engineering would put a "parasol" over the greenhouse to deflect or of the sunlight that now affects the earth scattering this small fraction into space would reduce global warming in the language of climate science we would increase by a few percent the earths "albedo" the ratio of incoming sunlight reflected back into space relative to the total inbound from the sun we know it would work because it happens naturally all the time clouds routinely deflect sunlight and thereby cool the earth volcanoes when they erupt and inject millions of tons of fine particulate material into the stratosphere mostly sulfate aerosols have also cooled large regions of the globe mount pinatubo in the philippines erupted in and cooled most of the earth for a few years erasing for a short time roughly half of the global warming that took place during the entire th century the idea of artificially increasing the earths albedo is not new in a report by the national academy of sciences found the prospect of stratospheric albedo enhancement "feasible economical and capable " and there are a great many geo engineering options apart from adding sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere but beware do not try to sell climate geo engineering to committed enemies of fossil fuels although several geo engineering options appear to be highly cost effective ideological opposition to them is often fierce fashionable blogs are replete with conspiracy theories and misinformed attacks because of this intimidating opposition no serious geo engineering research programs have been started and without some small scale tests not enough data will be available to assess the benefits cost and possible harmful side effects of such approaches much could be learned about this other half of the global warming picture with a tiny fraction of the funds that have been allocated to climate change studies focused on greenhouse gas emissions those who now oppose climate geo engineering should understand that none of the suggested options is meant to be a free standing long term solution to global warming if the greenhouse effect continued to increase the geo engineering measures would not only have to be maintained indefinitely but also be gradually augmented to keep pace moreover accumulating co in the atmosphere would make the oceans harmfully acidic over the next few centuries clearly we need both adequately explored geo engineering options for contingent climate stabilization and truly effective practical measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases mankinds current energy system evolved during the th century as an offspring of the industrial revolution it may take almost as long to replace this system with the novel energy sources and distribution networks that future generations will need this huge transition would be greatly facilitated if geo engineering options are developed and tested to provide a safe breathing space without a massive global warming crisis mr ikle an undersecretary of defense policy for president ronald reagan is with the center for strategic &amp international studies mr wood a research fellow at the hoover institution is affiliated with the lawrence livermore national laboratory and intellectual ventures llc a version of this article will be published in the january issue of the national interest see related letter "letters to the editor calm down read this" wsj oct
