americas dancing with wolves the revolutionary armed forces of colombia aka farc holds some hostages but only one of those kidnap victims is important enough to have provoked the colombian government to release a captured farc leader in the hopes that the terrorist group might reciprocate by handing over this very high profile captive her name is ingrid betancourt a colombian born naturalized french citizen who has two french born children when she was a presidential candidate in colombia in ms betancourt went into the jungle to confront the farc against the advice of the government the military and the police the rebels grabbed her and she hasnt been seen since french president nicolas sarkozy has made her case a priority for his new government and it was he who pressured colombian president alvaro uribe in june to free farc bigwig rodrigo granda as a good faith gesture toward ms betancourts release not surprisingly the effort produced no humanitarian response from the farc instead it murdered hostages later that month now mr uribe has agreed to allow venezuelan president hugo chavez a farc ally to mediate negotiations with the guerrillas the hope is that the talks might free ms betancourt and nearly other "political" hostages including former senators a former governor members of the military and police and three americans who were contractors for the state department at the time of their capture olive branches for terrorists are not something mr uribe keeps in his quiver and for good reason appeasement in the past has only given the farc the upper hand when he became president in mr uribe pledged to end negotiations and fight the farc head on thats why his willingness to talk with the drug running terrorists with mr chavez in the middle playing peacemaker is so perplexing one explanation is that the barrage of criticism from the betancourt family french activists democrats on capitol hill and political enemies at home has simply worn down mr uribe in other words that farc propaganda is beating him but it is also possible that the colombian president fully aware of the dangers he faces in dancing with these wolves believes the risks are worth taking ms betancourt has become a cause celebre in paris her face is plastered all over town and the mayor has pledged to fight "unceasingly" for her release with french diplomat daniel parfait married to ms betancourts sister the national government is also involved on his first day in office mr sarkozy met with ingrids daughter and later phoned mr uribe to lobby for the release of granda colombian public opinion favors a deal to free these hostages some of whom have been held for years mr uribe and his policies remain popular but the nation is sensitive too to the plight of the victims families who live tortured lives of worry about their loved ones given these circumstances mr chavezs offer to act as a negotiator could have easily undermined mr uribe at home and abroad the venezuelan probably expected to be turned down leaving mr uribe looking uncooperative instead bogota took him up on the proposal colombia says that whatever can be done to win freedom for the hostages is worth pursing including an exchange of hostages for captured farc terrorists but not without conditions off the table is the guerrilla demand for the return of rebels simon trinidad and nayibe "sonia" rojas both have been extradited to the u s on drug trafficking charges and mr uribe says they cannot be considered part of any deal there are other conditions first in any talks the three americans must be considered part of the group a colombian senator who visited ms rojas in a texas jail reported that the former farc guerrilla says that she does not want to become an obstacle to the release of the americans and that her conditions in prison are far better then theirs in colombia second any farc rebels released will have to agree to put down their weapons or go to a third country this might not go down well with the farc leadership but if the past is any guide it would not be an especially high hurdle to clear most of the prisoners mr uribe has released during his time as president have happily abandoned narcotrafficking third mr uribe insists that the government will not surrender any part of the country to the farc that was tried during the government of andres pastrana as a way to work toward peace but the guerrillas used their "safe haven" to store weapons build bombs train recruits hold hostages and otherwise execute their war on the colombian people mr chavez can hardly be considered an honest broker here but by putting the ball back in the chavez court mr uribe may be the more clever negotiator it is an open secret in colombia that if mr chavez wants to succeed he can do so because he has the power to damage the farc the terrorists have camps in venezuela which is now their main trafficking route for cocaine and they move in and out of the country to dodge colombian forces if mr chavez fails his credibility and image will be again damaged internationally on the other hand if the negotiations succeed mr uribe will have shown that he is attentive to the suffering of the colombian people and is not too proud to cooperate with his venezuelan neighbor not a bad strategy but not one without risks the highest being the possibility that the media with the help of the betancourt family will continue to paint mr uribe as the villain for not being ready to give in to the farcs demands yet if that happens he wont be much worse off than he has been for the past five years and through it all he has improved colombian security like no president before him
