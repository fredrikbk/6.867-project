why india spurns china model lets rupee ride delhi the u s government regularly implores china to let its currency appreciate but it seems to be india that is answering the call both emerging asian nations have booming economies yet only india has allowed its currency the rupee to climb sharply against the dollar underscoring indias willingness to adopt a market guided approach to suppressing inflation and bolstering its new heft in the global economy while offering help to exporters whose products have become more expensive india so far has avoided the heavy buying of dollars that characterizes beijings monetary regime the approach is winning kudos from western governments and investment bankers but sparking debate in india where many are concerned about the potential economic threat from china since the start of the dollar has weakened against the rupee amid huge inflows of foreign capital foreign investors have spent about &# billion this year to buy indian stocks up from &# billion for all of last year sending the benchmark stock index to record levels indias economy expanded in the past fiscal year its fastest pace in years china boasting an even bigger economy posted expansion last year the fourth consecutive year of double digit growth its main stock index is hitting all time highs too but beijing confines foreign participation to a sliver of the market it has also kept its currency away from speculators after china unified its dual currency system in the yuans value changed little until when beijing widened a trading band allowing the yuan to strengthen about against the dollar to date since the start of the dollar has lost about in value against the yuan to blunt the yuans rise chinas central bank has aggressively bought dollars from exporters and invested in treasury bonds as well as other foreign currency holdings chinas foreign currency reserves now stand at &# trillion roughly six times larger than indias when finance ministers from the group of seven industrialized nations meet in washington this week they are likely to add their voices to treasury secretary henry paulsons appeals to china to let the yuan float more freely by contrast when mr paulson visits india later this month he will be scouting for new business opportunities not harping on the currency "indias experience shows clearly that a flexible exchange rate can be a valuable tool in restraining domestic inflation while maintaining strong growth " said brookly mclaughlin a treasury spokeswoman the debate over the rupees rise extends beyond currency values and to determining a strategy for spreading wealth in a still poor country backers of a stronger rupee say it rewards indian consumers and importers by making overseas goods cheaper while forcing exporters to become more nimble global competitors "if you keep on growing output then the benefits should flow back to the worker thats what development is about " said john llewellyn a senior economic policy adviser for lehman brothers subir gokarn the chief economist for indian credit ratings agency crisil ltd a unit of standard &amp poors also backs a strong rupee "longer term industry must come to realize that if the currency is going to do anything its going to get stronger " he said proponents of a weaker rupee warn that india shouldnt stray from chinas path of alleviating poverty which has been aided by its strictly controlled exchange rate thats allowed export industries to attract foreign investment generate factory jobs and lift worker incomes with such formidable competition in the neighborhood india is cutting its own throat by not following chinas example on the currency says surjit bhalla a new delhi economist who has recently completed a book on the two nations economies "its stupid not to consider what the story is with china especially when its currency is so out of line " he said mr bhalla is also the managing director of a research and advisory firm oxus investments india maintains vestiges of a strict capital control system one that once forced indian companies like infosys technologies ltd to obtain central bank approval before buying foreign computers the central bank still caps how much indian companies and individuals can invest borrow and transfer overseas these limits have been relaxed over the years but experts say further liberalization could ease upward pressure on the rupee by widening channels for dollars to leave the country indian authorities have sought to soften the blow of a rising rupee unveiling a package for exporters that includes tax relief and loan credits for certain agricultural industries the goal is to support exports without stoking inflation or disrupting indian investments overseas "we need to maintain a competitive exchange rate suitably low interest rates and subdued inflation " indias financial secretary d subba rao told an organization for economic cooperation and development conference last week "managing the impossible trinity is the biggest challenge " the most vulnerable industry is indias all important technology sector technology exports account for of indias exports to the u s relationships between indian outsourcing companies and multinationals have drawn india deeper into the global economy while helping to foster a young urban class of workers
