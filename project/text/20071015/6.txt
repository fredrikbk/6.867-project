art auctions in london scrutinized in crunch time london at the new bond street headquarters of sothebys more than people crowded the auction room aisles and milled in the street friday night vying to watch the first major art auction since the credit crisis hit global financial markets and the u s dollar weakened further this unusually large crowd saw a contemporary art auction where many buyers played it safe there were few bidding wars and most of the art sold at prices within or below the auction houses presale estimates unlike the soaring sums that have marked many auctions in the past few years "theres not the same irrational exuberance that we once saw " said mary hoeveler the managing director of citigroups art advisory service who was in london with clients this week "bidders were very measured " the first big art sales of the season take place in october when collectors flood into london for the frieze art fair a showcase for contemporary art from galleries from around the world and contemporary art auctions held by christies sothebys and phillips de pury after a summer of financial uncertainty dealers and collectors have been calling these october sales judgement week and some of those observers looking ahead to november auctions in new york see signs here that the heady art market may finally be slowing down but any fears of an art market crash in london proved unfounded both sothebys and christies met but didnt exceed their estimates for total sales at their big events over the weekend sothebys had estimated the value of works at its auction friday evening at gbp million to gbp million &# million to &# million and it earned about gbp million including commissions sothebys sold of its works lower than some of its recent contemporary sales where often more than of works have sold christies major auction of post war and contemporary art yesterday evening brought in gbp million with of the works sold that was within the total estimated value of gbp million to gbp million asked about the strength of the market jussi pylkkanen president of christies europe and also auctioneer for the sale said he believed the auction was "the strongest sale of the week" and noted chinese contemporary works sold particularly well tobias meyer world wide head of contemporary art at sothebys and the auctioneer at fridays sale says he doesnt see the market slowing "theres been a surge of interest from foreign buyers that makes the problem with credit in new york look very small the highest end sales have been taken over by european and russian buyers anyway " he said although the sober tone seen at sothebys continued during much of other auctions during the weekend works by contemporary chinese artists were an exception at christies auction sunday a painting by zeng fanzhi sold for gbp over its estimate of gbp to gbp pounds a work by fang lijun sold for gbp soaring above the estimate of gbp to gbp larry warsh a new york collector of chinese contemporary art who was in london says that the prices reflect a surge in new buyers from asia "the chinese works are scarce and with the chinese starting to buy there isnt enough work to go around " while contemporary chinese works sold well some pieces by popular artists such as damien hirst francis bacon and even reliable seller andy warhol went at the middle or the lower end of their estimate ranges mr hirsts painting "adenosine " estimated to sell for as high as gbp million didnt sell at all an oil painting by prominent german artist gerhard richter sold for gbp million slightly above its low estimate "it was interesting to see some real restraint evidenced by failed lots and lower end prices " said clayton press an art adviser from ewing n j in london this week "the frantic behavior of last year was gone " most vulnerable to a slowdown some dealers say are young contemporary western artists who have seen big jumps in auction prices in the past year or two in february a painting by scottish painter peter doig sold at a record for the artist of gbp million at sothebys in london quadrupling its pre auction estimate at sothebys friday one of his paintings fetched gbp near the lower end of the estimate of gbp to gbp mr hirst whose sculpture "lullaby spring" sold for gbp million in june a record at auction for a living artist had a sculpture "weve got style the vessel collection pink " sell for gbp friday barely over its low estimate "a lot of material that has already tripled in price is coming back onto the market and the auction houses are flooding the market with this material so people have rightly become a little gun shy backing away from buying the hottest artist at the top of the market " ms hoeveler says in a season of a plunging u s dollar and financial upheaval americans tended to stand on the sidelines at fridays sothebys sale of the buyers were american at london auctions in past years typically about a third of the buyers were from the u s said francis outred head of evening and private sales at sothebys meanwhile around of the buyers were from asia and the middle east and europeans accounted for donald rubell and mera rubell major contemporary art collectors and hoteliers from miami beach fla attended the sothebys auction but didnt buy "i cant afford it " mr rubell said "and not because of the credit crunch im squeezed by the pound more than the crunch " the biggest successes at the weekend auctions were works by contemporary indian and chinese artists a surprise to some who had predicted that the strongest sellers would be "safe" choices like well known u s and british painters in one of the few bidding wars at the sothebys auction two telephone bidders fought a nearly six minute battle over the painting "execution " by chinese artist yue minjun it sold for gbp million a record for a work of chinese contemporary art at auction
