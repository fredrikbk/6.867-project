boss talk is avons latest scent sweet smell of success bold moves high touch meets high tech business model help ceo andrea jung boost sales of sluggish company two years ago avon chief andrea jung faced some tough decisions growth was slowing in the companys most important global markets its stock plunging famed for its door to door sales avon found itself with the venerable business model faltering in the u s even as it prospered in developing markets and the company was saddled with a crowded stable of products and far too many managers in november ms jung told investors she was willing to make bold changes she announced plans to spend &# million over several years restructuring since then avon has cut employee ranks by and management by nearly she cut back on the number of products avon catalogs offer devoting more space to the most successful products and eliminating the rest she almost tripled avons ad spending over the past two years and she has made headway building avons overseas presence winning the first direct selling license in china and swelling its sales force there to more than early results are positive sales rose in the june quarter over a year ago after annual sales rose in although restructuring costs have hurt earnings avon has warned that its profit margins wont "approach" prerestructuring levels until next year while avon shares are up since the beginning of the year investors are still looking for definitive evidence that the turnaround is working in a recent interview with the wall street journal ms jung discussed the viability of door to door sales in the u s the economic opportunity of being an avon sales representative in a developing country and why shareholders should be patient with her turnaround efforts excerpts wsj many say that selling products door to door is outdated why do you think it still can work in the u s ms jung things have changed in many ways but one thing hasnt the need for personalized service were firm believers that our model when modernized with technology can be extraordinarily competitive so my mantra certainly is high touch meets high tech wsj what about in developing markets ms jung our advantage is clearly the opportunity to give earnings opportunity to developing market sales representatives that differentiates us from other great manufacturers of mass beauty products in addition to great branded products for good value first and foremost we offer women in those markets the opportunity to be economically independent and run their own businesses in many ways were the largest micro lender because we front our sales representatives their first order and that "mini loan" is paid back after they sell their first order that gets women into business for the first time wsj and you dont have to wait for retail channels in those markets to develop ms jung theres a russia way beyond moscow and st petersburg if you go to the smaller towns or less avon is there we dont have to wait for a retail infrastructure to slowly grow thats the beauty of it in china over of our business is outside the eastern seaboard cities wsj in addition to all the responsibilities of a ceo of a large multinational company you also play chief motivator for your sales representatives why do you choose both roles ms jung its a critical part of the job motivation is integral to our business model the avon story is all about bringing together women from all walks of life who believe that when they join the company they can change their lives the beauty of direct selling is the ability to inspire women to do things like run their own businesses and be successful in ways they never thought they could be attracting people to the earnings opportunity the great brand and the ability to sell and service customers as well as having pride in the company is very important im off to china for example this week and every time i go to any of our key markets i try to be with our sales representatives in the field its very renewing with all the stresses and strains of being a ceo of a publicly held company ive been one now for eight years or quarters i get a tremendous amount of energy from getting out with the front lines of sales representatives wsj avon has experimented over the years with selling its products in stores given the recent wave of department store consolidation and the increasing emphasis mass market stores are putting on their beauty departments would you try it again ms jung right now our focus really is on the direct selling channel and were committed to improving our representative value proposition focusing our investment and all of our energies on reinvigorating their earnings opportunities has the best payback and has gotten the most sales growth whether in the u s or in developing and emerging markets wsj how has the beauty consumer changed during your tenure ms jung the expectation of innovation and technology is just light years ahead of where it was when i started in this business years ago color cosmetics was really more about shades the concept of using innovation that a lipstick actually has to do something now not just have fabulous shades is a night and day change theres innovation in packaging formulas skin care technologies that get transferred to color technologies spf used to be in sunscreen only now there is hardly a product that doesnt have it you have to be part of a technology driven and technology resourced beauty company to win over the long run now wsj its difficult to keep investors patient for results during a multiyear restructuring what guideposts should the financial community watch for to see that its working ms jung our beauty revenue thats one of the top signs that i look at weve had double digit growth there for several quarters coming off of softer growth in investment in innovation advertising and brand competitiveness are working for us the other aspect thats very important to us is the health of our direct selling model were seeing a great ramp up in our active representatives as we focus on more technology and the additional tools were paying for were also looking at the frequency of our brochure cycles catalog distribution in central and eastern europe for example we used to send a brochure every four weeks now were doing it every three wsj some say that avons initiatives to reduce the number of products in the catalog will make it harder for representatives to sell can you explain why youre taking that step ms jung we believe a simplified line will make it easier to shop being educated on the benefits of each product just gets harder when the line is larger i think the key is as a representative told me having fewer products will make my job easier but just help me understand what is the replacement product as in if i bought this lipstick shade i should buy this similar one wsj youve been on recruiters short list for other ceo jobs for years why do you choose to stay at avon ms jung i have fallen in love with the vision of this company in a way i never imagined would be possible i came to avon in the early s as the head of marketing because i was enamored with the opportunity to do a brand transformation it was a very intellectual assessment of what the job and career would be i never anticipated the emotional resonance that the purpose of the company would have for me everyone dreams they might possibly have a job that combines everything you want to do from a business point of view but you always have this inkling that you should be doing something better for the world somehow i just tripped into this amazing privilege of doing both i have all the responsibilities running this public company but i also have avons philanthropy work which is so inextricably linked with what the company is at this point i believe were doing good and were doing well i think thats unusual wsj when you took this job there was much attention to the fact that a female was leading a company of avons size has the tone around women in positions of leadership changed ms jung i look now at the number of women now running companies much bigger than avon and i think that its extraordinary progress it didnt happen overnight but i am an optimist about the number of women who are at that ready to be a ceo level if i look back to the early s there werent a lot of women who had the operating experience even if they were in the senior management ranks today youve got more capable women in key operational roles in pretty much every industry who could take on the ceo role the next years is going to look so different from these last eight im encouraged
