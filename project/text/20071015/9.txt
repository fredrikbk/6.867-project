airbus amid turmoil revives troubled plane as top brass fought middle ranks rallied miles of wiring hamburg germany today european plane maker airbus will deliver its first a the worlds biggest passenger jet to singapore airlines ltd its been a bumpy ride building the leviathan plane which is almost two years behind schedule and &# billion over budget created havoc at airbus communication failures and chauvinistic conflicts that had long existed between the companys french and german operations exploded into a full blown crisis partly as a result airbus in sold fewer new planes than archrival boeing co for the first time since today as its a superjumbos move down the assembly line airbus is clawing back such turnaround stories often star a companys top brass but at airbus much of the credit rests with a few midlevel executives who found a way to fuse the companys balkanized units while the boardroom was in disarray one of them is rudiger fuchs a year old german engineer who forced designers engineers and assembly line workers at airbuss hamburg factory to start cooperating with the help of alain carcasses a french engineering manager mr fuchs also coaxed french electrical specialists into helping their german counterparts at an engineering office in toulouse france meanwhile airbuss boardroom was immobilized by infighting among french and german rivals two chief executives left within three months separately several managers at airbus and its parent european aeronautic defence &amp space co came under public fire after french prosecutors launched a probe into alleged insider trading of eads shares the probe is still under way airbus chief executive tom enders says the company recognizes what went wrong "the underlying problem was the lack of integration " he says "were taking voluminous lessons from that " airbus still has far to go before it restores full credibility among customers and recovers financial losses racked up during the a delays its turbulent experience with the a is a reminder that the manufacture of planes has grown so technically challenging that one slip up can haunt a company for years boeing which only recently recovered from huge production problems with its model a decade ago just revealed a new setback last week the chicago based aerospace giant announced a six month delay in delivering its first dreamliner next year the dreamliner is touted as a long range jetliner with unprecedented efficiency "it is ironic to see how boeing which had so much momentum now faces these major program challenges announced just days before the first a delivers " steven udvar hazy chairman of american international group inc s international lease finance corp wrote in an email "the pendulum keeps swinging in all directions " for years airbus operated as a complex consortium of independent aviation companies in france germany britain and spain airbus plants in each country would produce specific airplane sections such as wings cockpits and body tubes equipping them with necessary wires and pipes parts were shipped for assembly in toulouse and then flown to hamburg there seats galleys toilets and other interior elements were installed operations in various countries even factories within one country generally operated as standalone entities with spotty communication among them successful new ways of working often failed to spread around the company one result airbuss german operations struggled to build the model before the superjumbo managers say it succeeded only because the technology was simpler and the lead times longer then came the a the superjumbo was to be the largest passenger jet ever built it would have two decks each bisected by two aisles with stairways at each end it would seat around people a third more than the current largest airplane the boeing flying at full capacity airbus said the a would not only be the most cost and fuel efficient plane flying it would consume less fuel for each passenger mile than an economy car when airbus first set out to build the superjumbo in top executives pledged the &# billion project would force the pan european group to break down nationalistic barriers and cooperate better managers converted airbus from a consortium into a single company which they said would adopt standard factory and management procedures across its many plants and offices but the promised coordination never materialized worsening the problem airbuss german managers greatly underestimated the difficulty and time needed to wire an yard long giant wiring a superjumbo requires some cables a jumble of wires hidden behind walls that would extend more than miles they carry electricity to cockpit controls cargo doors toilet flushers reading lights and much more problems emerged in early before the first a prototype began test flights in toulouse as often happens these trial trips identified necessary changes to the as design most requiring alterations to wiring that meant engineers had to modify wiring blueprints and factory workers had to reroute cables in the dozen as that were already in production but the german designers couldnt keep up with the changes at the same time german factory managers were under pressure to keep building new fuselage sections for an increasing number of as that were coming down the pipeline as orders rolled in in april soon after the rewiring problems emerged airbus announced its first six month delay in initial deliveries singapore airlines would receive its first superjumbo in late by early german engineers still hadnt finalized wiring blueprints twenty planes were sitting almost complete in toulouse and in hamburg with only temporary wiring on june airbus had to announce a second six month delay this time the market panicked and eads shares in paris and frankfurt plunged as much as on the news two days later then airbus chief executive gustav humbert asked mr fuchs the head of cabin and cargo customization in hamburg to take charge of all a assembly in germany an avid sailor whose office is decorated with photographs of racing yachts mr fuchs joined airbus in after five years restructuring german missile and train companies an intensely focused executive mr fuchs had made his mark at airbus by successfully integrating disparate german operations that prepared interiors of models already in production mr fuchs quickly realized that the wiring problems signaled a much deeper issue not only was there little communication between the french and german operations teams across germany were working on different tasks drafting blueprints procuring materials and building plane parts without adequately communicating with each other there was no single manager to force integration and spot problems "nobody had a high level view or the power to rule the game " he says for example while one team at the hamburg factory worked on the planes metal body tube and another equipped the interior cabin nobody focused specifically on the wires that ran between the two mr fuchs recalls that lack of attention wasnt a big issue for the production of previous airplanes where wiring wasnt a critical element but the a was a different animal airbus had pitched the superjumbo as a luxury liner that airlines could pack with their most alluring cabin equipment including video consoles satellite phones and electronically controlled bed seats each of the a customers required a different wiring plan all were far more complex than for any plane built before as delays grew german managers blamed each other slowing production even further "the german team didnt accommodate rapid changes well and it became a downward spiral " says tom williams airbuss executive vice president for programs mr fuchss first order of business was hamburg where singapore airliness first a sat without cabin fixtures because wiring wasnt finished in early july mr fuchs for the first time compiled information from all german managers on the plane he realized there was no way to deliver it by year end to accelerate work he ordered engineers to move from their cushy offices to the factory floor near assembly workers and the plane itself to keep tabs on progress every day at p m production managers and engineers would gather in a so called "war room" with a big window overlooking the first superjumbo on the walls of the crisis room hung more than colored charts with labels like "engineering issues" and "red flags " each participant would update colleagues on the days progress and problems to keep them focused mr fuchs got rid of the chairs in the room and forced everyone to stand "when you stand for two hours you have to be concrete " says heiko lutjens an engineer under mr fuchs analyzing how he would rewire the next as mr fuchs realized that german engineers were using outdated and inefficient design software french engineers used newer programs but their german counterparts said their older programs did the job well enough and refused to adopt the french standards airbus executives say senior french executives had failed to force the newer programs on german colleagues as these problems grew clearer cultural tensions rose to the companys highest echelons top french managers at eads publicly blamed the airplanes woes on the germans pouring salt on the wound germans blamed french managers for airbuss organizational mess one sunday in august mr fuchs and his boss made a troublesome discovery sitting with mr fuchs charles champion executive vice president of the a program realized that german design software was so inefficient and the engineers were so overworked that they simply couldnt increase production as planned prodded by mr champion whose parents are french and english mr fuchs did something almost unprecedented for airbus he asked his counterparts in france for help mr fuchs visited mr carcasses a top engineering manager handling aircraft designs in toulouse to hash out an emergency plan a group of german engineers would move to toulouse french engineers would train them on french software and design methods the french engineers would in turn work on german parts of the a and report to mr fuchs for the first time ever the two nationalities would work as one on key parts of a major project "i could sense it was an historic decision for airbus " recalls mr carcasses soon german engineers from hamburg arrived in toulouse and paired with french mentors to make the germans feel at home french workers organized dinners at restaurants with local specialties such as duck foie gras and languedoc wines but the problems werent over in september new airbus chief executive christian streiff removed mr champion mr fuchss boss as head of the a program a month later eads executives revealed the superjumbo would be delivered two years late at a cost of &# billion then mr streiff suddenly quit in hamburg work rewiring singapore airliness first a had fallen behind because setting up the new team in france distracted mr fuchs "we lost focus " he says by late last fall mr fuchs was desperate to finish an electrical test that airbus had promised customers by year end in a last ditch effort to improve productivity he ordered his german engineers to move off the factory floor and finish their work inside the a itself to better advise assembly workers laboring on the cables productivity doubled within weeks on dec the plane passed its test with the plane finally wired correctly workers installed seats the galley and toilets they also started rewiring other as after singapores delivery today airbus plans to deliver more superjumbos next year by airbus aims to be churning out almost four each month which executives admit will be difficult in a further boost british airways plc two weeks ago ordered as ba chief executive willie walsh said he was "confident in airbuss ability to deliver a great aircraft " earlier this month mr fuchs was promoted to senior vice president in charge of all cabin and interior work across europe his franco german design team for the superjumbo now includes engineers in toulouse who communicate in english airbuss next planned jetliner the long haul a is being designed by multinational groups similar to the franco german team mr fuchs spearheaded
