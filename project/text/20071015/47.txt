northern vintage canadas wines rise with mercury growers try classy grapes shed punch line status mr kennedy sells his cows tappen british columbia two weeks ago a brief storm left the mountains above gary kennedys fields ominously capped in snow his pinot noir grapes needed another week maybe two in the sun the race was on harvest versus first frost "weve literally bet the farm that this is going to work " said mr kennedy a slight sinewy man of who is trying to make a go of winemaking miles north of napa valley "were right on the edge " such are the perils of winemaking canadian style as global warming encourages vintners to press ever farther north if all goes well for mr kennedy his four year old granite creek estate wines will hold onto its place as one of the most northerly winemakers in north america at least for a while the borders of the worlds grape growing regions are shifting away from the equator and toward the poles redrawing the world wine map in the process traditional winemaking powerhouses such as napa and parts of australia are struggling with excessive heat formerly frosty climes like this verdant corner of british columbia are beginning to produce first rate wines "there is concern in some areas and there is opportunity in others " says gregory v jones a professor of climatology at southern oregon university who is a leading researcher on the subject of viticulture and climate "canada will be one of the winners in the wine world " grape varieties traditionally harvested in europe such as chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon produce some of the worlds best wine and the most expensive but they are extremely sensitive to temperature the thermal niche in which these types of grapes thrive is narrow and the conditions required to produce a good vintage are narrower still thats one reason why generations of kennedys had mostly raised cows on the rolling cypress and pine studded hills here halfway between calgary and vancouver when mr kennedys children informed him they didnt want to take over the dairy he began looking for alternatives with a thriving wine business taking root in the okanagan valley to his south mr kennedy spent two years studying the regions climate data his conclusion winters were getting warmer summers hotter and the growing season longer four years ago after selling the cows he and his family took out a hefty bank loan and started granite creek mr kennedys winery sits miles north of the okanagan valley where british columbias winemaking industry has taken hold a broad deep lake lies at the center of the valley surrounded by jagged foot mountains the deep dry soil the long hot summer days and the limited precipitation are favorable for grape growing but the cold winters have always set limits on what could be harvested when farmers here first tried their hands at growing grapes in the s they used a cross between the heartier american varieties and their european cousins the harvest was pressed into jug wine and sold cheap "b c wine was the joke of the wine industry " says howard soon a winemaker who came to the okanagan in "nothing that came out of this area back then was particularly good " in as tariffs were removed hybrid grapes grown in the u s flooded the canadian market thinking that local grape growers would be unable to compete the canadian government paid vineyard owners to pull up their vines and plant different crops most grape growers in british columbia took the governments money and moved on but about a half dozen okanagan valley growers noting the absence of a serious cold snap for several years opted to forgo the payout and roll the dice they planted the delicate european grape varieties that had never before survived "i thought they were crazy " says mr soon who is today a senior winemaker at sandhill one of the biggest wineries in british columbia "i thought everybody was going to get frozen out and wed all be out of a job " the point at which cold becomes deadly for most plants that produce european varietals is about four degrees below zero fahrenheit says mr soon between and the temperature in the okanagan valley dipped below that mark times between and the number of deep freezes fell to in the last years the coldest recorded temperature was a half degree above zero says david phillips the canadian governments senior climatologist "the changes are slight but theyve been enough to make a big difference " says denise neilsen a research field scientist for the canadian government who has studied the valleys climate "the milder winters opened the door they are what made this industry possible " as the winters moderated warming an average of five degrees over that year span the growing season increased by days giving some of the slower ripening varietals a chance to mature at the same time average summer temperatures rose nearly four degrees increasing the speed at which the grapes ripened by the mid s okanagan winemakers were entering their still young wines in international competitions and being derided george heiss owner of gray monk estate winery was among the first to try to cultivate european grapes in the okanagan he remembers setting up a table alongside winemakers from australia and spain at an international wine competition in london "people would walk by and do a double take " mr heiss says "theyd say canada where do you make your wines in igloos " but as the vines matured so did the grapes they produced okanagan wines began to earn a reputation for balanced food friendly vintages and the wineries began to turn profits by this year the number of british columbian wineries had shot up to from in the value of the wine produced has increased more than fold in recent years canadian wines have begun to consistently win gold medals at european wine competitions wine and culinary tourism have taken off in the valley and development has followed farmland has jumped to about &# an acre from &# two decades ago albertan energy executives flush with cash from the oil rush have flooded the region building vineyards and second homes established winemaking regions are struggling to adapt to climate changes in spain winemakers are planting vineyards at higher elevations to escape excessive heat in france they are altering centuries old irrigation traditions to accommodate longer hotter summers prof jones at southern oregon characterizes the anxiety in napa as "worry not panic " in australia researchers say that up to of the grape growing land will be too hot to use by as the okanagan valley has flourished mr kennedy is betting the good fortune will reach north to his spread "im not necessarily a proponent of global warming " says mr kennedy whose grapes are now days away from harvest and have escaped frost so far "but i do know the climate has changed here and its having a pretty significant impact on the grape industry how long it will last i cant tell you were pioneers up here "
