business world chryslers new master it was the specter of bankruptcy that allowed ford and gm to win health care concessions from the united auto workers in the past months chrysler under the wing of its rich german parent was the odd man out and its not too much to say that last weeks cerberus deal was designed to afford chrysler similar leverage dieter zetsche the parent companys chief executive gave various reasons why daimler is ridding itself of chrysler winding up the most celebrated merger of modern times most were unconvincing and one was positively dazzling he said daimler had hoped that buying chrysler would turn it into a foreign brand in american eyes for which american consumers would be prepared to pay premium prices here apparently was the genesis of the lamentable "dr z" campaign in which mr zetsche himself was rolled out to remind viewers that chrysler was run by germans with the collapse of the daimlerchrysler experiment it might be useful to stop referring to "domestic" and "foreign" auto makers the important distinction is between auto makers bound by uaw contracts and those that arent chryslers labor costs are &# an hour higher than toyotas headed for a gap of &# by chrysler pays the same wage to uaw janitors and skilled craftsmen it carries idle workers on its books when no jobs are available most of all its on the hook for the untrammeled health care spending of unionized workers retirees and dependents an &# billion liability that toyota honda and nissan dont face this alone adds a cost of &# per car how it got this way is no longer interesting the tired debate over which stick figure "labor" or "management " is responsible for detroits uncompetitive labor deals both operated under the incentives of the wagner act the labor law that entrenched the uaw as the monopoly labor supplier to the big three detroit draws on the same talent pool as the rest of global industry and must pay a competitive wage its executives are no more overpaid or incompetent than anybody elses nor is it necessary to rub its face in the superiority of the toyota camry and honda accord no car company could humanly hope to compete in the basic sedan segment with a deadweight cost disadvantage of thousands of dollars per car detroit would be foolish to try likewise theres no point in bashing the homegrown auto makers for their dependence on gas guzzlers big roomy vehicles are precisely the vehicles americans have been willing to buy at prices high enough to cover a uaw labor bill give detroit a little credit here the shrinking three have kept their heads above water for decades by ingeniously inventing new vehicle categories like minivans suvs and personal pickups which non uaw auto makers have been forced to copycat management is sometimes simplicity itself concentrate on solving the problem that makes all the other problems soluble at chrysler that problem is labor costs especially health care thats what chryslers sale to the private equity firm cerberus is designed to do many news stories said the uaw is now cerberuss headache but facing up to the uaw is exactly how cerberus will see its way clear to making money oodles of it from its chrysler play by current standards chrysler wasnt in bad shape its sales held up better in the first quarter than fords or gms downsizing is already under way ceo tom lasorda foresees a profit margin on sales by an share of which would yield an annual &# billion return on cerberuss investment of &# billion but the really big payoff will be from health care and daimler will benefit too cerberus is not being paid to tow chrysler away as commonly alleged daimler will retain of the company making it the beneficiary of of the &# billion that as part of the sales agreement cerberus will put into chrysler but when does this pledged cash infusion actually start appearing on chryslers books the sale isnt scheduled to close until the third quarter when the current uaw contract expires cerberus will have something daimler didnt have the implicit threat of holding back funding and putting chrysler into bankruptcy if the uaw doesnt cough up in the weird world of the uaw having a profitable parent is a business liability that the deal overcomes private equitys arrival in the mainstream auto industry has been heralded with much gnashing of teeth about short termism ironically a source of disappointment to many in the peanut gallery may be that the gains from even modest health care discipline and productivity concessions are so potentially large that cerberus wont push for a more thorough shake up of chrysler say walking away from the uaw and hiring replacement workers as caterpillar did in its seismic showdown with the union there are good reasons not to go to war with the uaw labors political clout is needed in the impending fight over fuel economy regulation which given chryslers reliance on light trucks of its sales could blow up its turnaround plans more to the point a militant response by the uaw could easily stop the cerberus deal in its tracks and daimler would be forced to resume financial responsibility for chryslers labor relations but its too bad cerberus wont be the revolutionary force in the auto industry that many are hoping for a chrysler truly freed from the uaw would let us finally see how a homegrown auto maker could do in global competition while still providing good jobs at &# an hour just not gilded sinecures at &# an hour
