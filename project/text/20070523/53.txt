fiscally fit the urge to splurge terris aunt and uncle are divided over how much to spend in retirement online edition i spent mothers day weekend visiting my mom and two of her sisters and their daughters it was fun but inevitably the conversation migrated to a topic that occupies a unhealthy amount of my mothers familys thoughts whether theyll die before they can enjoy retirement aunt kathy is in her early s and retired my mom who just turned and her sister dee in her early s are nearing retirement going strictly by average longevity expectations its a bit pessimistic for these women to worry about dying soon according to the social security administrations actuarial tables my mom and her sister can expect to live into their early s their probability of dying within a year is only marginally higher than my own at age but perhaps these relatively young women have reason to be concerned all but two of their parents immediate relatives died by age including their parents and grandparents recently my mom and her siblings lost their oldest brother to emphysema and their oldest sister to breast cancer within the same year both were not yet my mom and her sisters believe the clock is ticking and no one is more certain of this than aunt kathy now the oldest living sibling her conviction has fueled disagreements with her husband al because aunt kathy feels her time is short she wants to use a chunk of their retirement savings to splurge on luxuries such as travel and vacations hosting their children and grandchildren "whats the use of scrimping and saving all our lives to get to retire and then we cant enjoy ourselves after all that hard work " she asks that makes uncle al nervous he worries that eating into their capital now even for minor luxuries could leave them in danger of outliving their savings "how do i know if i have enough now that i can spend a little or if i need to keep the money working " he asked me he doesnt share my aunts concerns about dying young theyre both fairly active playing a variety of sports and routinely gardening and landscaping their property and theyve had a battery of tests that havent turned up any serious health problems uncle als parents lived into their s he believes he and kathy have just as good a shot at doing so and maybe hes right aunt kathys belief that she wont live a long life isnt backed by longevity studies says dr michael roizen cofounder of realage com a consumer health information web site family history isnt nearly as important as individual behaviors what you eat whether you smoke how much you exercise in determining how long youll live "the standard accepted number is to of longevity involves your individual choices and behaviors " dr roizen says adding that recent studies involving identical twins show "its actually much closer to " in fact my aunts conviction that shes likely to die young could end up being a self fulfilling prophecy "the most powerful thing is denial the belief that its going to happen anyway so why dont i go ahead and have that cheeseburger " dr roizen says "the key to living longer is a change in the attitude to understand that behavior does have a major impact on how long you live " this realage test can estimate your true age based on your habits and family history that said family history is an important factor when developing a financial plan says wayne a starr a principal at bkd wealth advisors in kansas city mo mr starr says his firm pays particular attention to the likelihood that a client will suffer a long term illness increasing health costs and heredity is certainly a factor in predicting such troubles mr starr says hes dealt with couples like my aunt and uncle who worry about whether theyre spending too much or not enough in retirement "the spender doesnt think shes going to live as long as the saver so now youre in dangerous territory " he says the key to coming up with the right balance is communication "the most crucial thing is determining what it is they need to spend and what it is they want to spend " he says mr starr suggests couples like my aunt and uncle consider ways to adjust their financial plan as they go the rule of thumb is to aim for taking out no more than to of your savings during each year of retirement he says but cautions that "we have to make sure this pot of money will support that " to do so planners use software that will create a linear projection of savings growth "suppose we start out by taking out per year assuming inflation and we assume a conservative return " mr starr says that will give the couple an idea of whether or not theyll outlive their savings then he tweaks the numbers changing the withdrawal rate and investment return to show the couple what it will take to meet their financial goals "the planners job is to work with those numbers and find ways to compromise " says mr starr one possible compromise for aunt kathy and uncle al juggle their savings withdrawal rate by taking out a large chunk to splurge on a luxury this year and then living more frugally the following year if they choose to do this its important to revisit their investment strategy each year to ensure theyre still on target my aunt and uncle are fortunate that they have an investment property that could be sold if necessary and in a pinch a reverse mortgage on their primary home could help cover any shortfall if those options dont sit well an immediate fixed annuity an insurance product that provides a guaranteed stream of income no matter how long you live could also give uncle al some peace of mind i went to insurance quote web site immediateannuities com to figure out how much income his savings could generate depending on the product they choose an annuity could provide for uncle al aunt kathy or both while still leaving some money for their heirs im torn i think uncle als conservative approach to retirement planning is warranted but i share aunt kathys feelings about heredity and the role it plays in our lives im not optimistic about my own chances of making it into my early s thanks to genetics i may be susceptible to any number of conditions and illnesses diabetes heart disease stroke kidney and liver problems colitis and cancers of all stripes still in the next years advances in medicine may make life threatening illnesses and conditions manageable and ive started exercising and eating better over the last few years in hopes that when my husband gerry and i are retired well be getting on with living instead of worrying about dying do
