designing for the very poorest design often caters to the wealthy or at least the comfortable but what about the worlds poor design for the other an exhibit at new yorks cooper hewitt national design museum features products developed to improve the quality of life of people in extreme poverty the wall street journal online spoke with martin fisher co founder of kickstart international a nonprofit organization that develops technologies to help very poor entrepreneurs start businesses and paul polak of international development enterprises which aims to increase the earnings of low income farmers among other things both men have worked on designing pumps irrigation systems and other equipment sold to small farms tools which are now on display in the other exhibit whose lead sponsor is the lemelson foundation wsj com spoke to messrs fisher and polak about the challenges of designing products for the poor the wall street journal online some people think design is only for the wealthier parts of the world why martin fisher we buy time saving and labor saving devices and many of those arent that relevant for the poor they have a fair lot of time and labor what they dont have is very much money weve realized that an expensive item for a poor person something that costs about &# should be a money making device they spend money on a daily basis so they have to find a way to make money paul polak there are huge untapped markets in the other many designers have never run into that group or just havent thought about it that doesnt mean theyre not interested in it wsj com when you design products for the poor what must you keep in mind mr fisher the no items will be money making devices and money saving ones only if theyre extremely cheap you need something easy to maintain without many tools and something that can be easily transported because the poor live in remote areas it cant require a pickup truck human powered maybe no petrol and no electricity it has to be energy efficient youre dealing with watts of human power mr polak you have a whole different range of affordability when youre surviving on a dollar a day we see it a little differently on quality versus affordability people will pick a product that only lasts two years if its cheap but some of the design principles are the same as when you design for the rich you look at a tool and identify the key contributors to cost and look at ways to design around them wsj com does quality suffer when you make a product very affordable mr fisher were not that far off if you design a two year drip irrigation system or a one year pump that comes into your design criteria my only concern is that it does last for a year and doesnt break the first time its used theres a difference between something breaking versus wearing out after a year the quality control has to be good mr polak these are basically survival microenterprises whatever you design that is income generating must actually last long enough to turn a profit wsj com why do you sell your products instead of giving them away mr polak you cant donate people out of poverty although many people think so martin and i both feel that poor people have to invest time and money to move out of poverty in bangladesh president ershad was impressed with treadle pumps so he said would give of them to people in the district he came from then farmers stopped buying them local manufacturers had to close their doors and it set farmers back in that region two years mr fisher four reasons giving things away is bad its very unfair how do you decide who gets something and who doesnt its unsustainable where i give you something today and next year you need a spare part it kills or distorts the local private sector and its not being appreciated or used well its like being given a gift that ends up in a drawer it creates dependency and its not cheaper you still have to set up a distribution network wsj com what are some of the challenges to the adoption of your products mr polak in the beginning people felt it was all trivial i gave a talk at cornell years ago and the professors of engineering there really tore me apart they said how dare you push a technology that enslaves people we have a motorized pump and youre pushing coolie labor but we ended up selling a million and a half treadle pumps in bangladesh the conventional belief in the west is that technology is meant to take away the slave labor of the poor without recognizing that poor people in developing countries are working for five cents an hour modern technology doesnt fit now the situation is different we have design courses where students are learning to make a difference through this kind of design so all of a sudden the whole tone and the culture changed mr fisher convincing the farmers is also hard even convincing retail shops to stock these pumps is a challenge occasionally we had to use butcheries or hairdressers to sell our pumps because they were the only ones who would stock them youre selling an expensive item representing a big chunk of annual income and youre selling it to the poorest and most risk averse people in the world and people who have never seen technology like this before at kickstart about of our money goes to marketing we have to create awareness to convince them to come in to a shop and try out the pump it takes them a long time to decide they have to save up the money and know youre not a snake oil salesman eventually people learn about these things and make a decision but its a hard sell mr polak just to zoom this out a bit if you look at business in developed countries any venture capitalist knows marketing is of the issue if you look at the other as a customer group they may not be able to read and write you have to design a marketing and promotion program to a highly risk averse group and theyre risk averse because theyre rational if they make a mistake it can have terrible consequences you have to go back to the kind of marketing we did here years ago you maybe hire a local staff who can talk to farmers identify the farmers who are little better off design is much more than designing equipment designing a marketing strategy under these conditions is the most basic design problem how do you scale it up so you reach millions of them wsj com how do you interest young designers in working in this field and in staying in it mr fisher we need to get it to the point where there are a lot of jobs designing products for the poor we need to make this field as big and as commonly known as what happened in microfinance ten years ago you couldnt get a microfinance job but now you can its grown to a size where billions in donor money and investor money get poured into it
