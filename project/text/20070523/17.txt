at japans big banks drive for growth sputters about a year ago japans top three banks outlined ambitious plans to get back into growth mode they had finally gotten rid of the bad loan problems that had bogged them down for nearly a decade and were eager to boost their profitability so they could compete once again with rivals from the u s and europe as the banks report earnings this week it has become clear that the turnaround is taking longer than they hoped frustrating their investors including many u s mutual funds the three biggest banks by stock market value mitsubishi ufj financial group inc mizuho financial group inc and sumitomo mitsui financial group inc are counting on new areas such as mutual fund sales investment banking and wealth management for their growth but those businesses have been slow to take off meanwhile the banks mainstay lending businesses face tougher than expected competition one of the fastest growing businesses they beefed up in recent years consumer finance is posting big losses after the government imposed stricter regulations earlier this year on top of all that mitsubishi ufj or mufg and sumitomo mitsui or smfg were punished by regulators for lax compliance practices the difficulties are reflected in the banks earnings results for the fiscal year ended march mizuho the no bank after mufg said its consolidated net profit fell from a year earlier to billion yen &# billion after three years of rising profits on monday smfg reported that its net tumbled to billion yen due to a big loss in its consumer finance unit and a write down in its bond portfolio the bank had swung back into the black a year ago after posting a big loss in the previous year to write off its bad loans mufgs earnings are to be released today "these banks are desperately trying to improve their results and they compete like crazy " says simon davis a portfolio manager at putnam investments whose fund holds stakes in mizuho and mufg "youve had a nasty combination of lackluster growth margins under pressure and reasonably poor results " after rising strongly in in anticipation of the turnarounds shares of japanese banks were flat to slightly weaker last year and are down so far this year mufg has lost of its value while mizuho is off and smfg is down the weak earnings were expected in part because of the government clampdown on the consumer finance sector regulators lowered the maximum lending rate in an effort to rein in aggressive lending practices the move hurt the banks which had invested in or formed ties with those lenders many analysts predict a rebound next year as the banks put their consumer lending problems behind them rising interest rates in japan would also make lending more profitable investors seem to agree smfgs shares were actually up after its earnings report in part because it more than doubled its dividend to yen from yen last year mizuho expects earnings growth for the current fiscal year and is talking about buying back stock and raising its dividend says taizo ishida who co manages the &# million matthews japan fund which counts mizuho as a major holding thats further evidence that the banks have put their balance sheet woes behind them but the current weakness means japans big banks still have a long way to go to seriously compete with such giant foreign rivals as citigroup inc and hsbc holdings plc while japanese banks are less profitable and smaller than many of the global banking giants they are also trading at roughly times book value making them cheaper than many major banks by many measures including market capitalization and profitability the japanese banks lag way behind mufgs market cap at &# billion ranks th among the worlds biggest banks and is less than half that of citigroups &# billion bank executives vow to do better this fiscal year "this is the year when we will solidify the shift from recovery to expansion " masayuki oku smfgs chief executive said during a recent news conference but other problems highlight how vulnerable japanese banks have become because they have been so focused in the s and early this decade on cleaning up their bad loans analysts say the banks have skimped on investing in compliance at a time when authorities look at operations more closely in december the securities and exchange commission ordered mufg to improve its compliance practices after finding problems with procedures to block money laundering at its u s operations this forced mufg to shelve its plan to acquire the status of a financial holding company hurting its overseas expansion plans in japan mufg and smfg were punished by japanese regulators for lax compliance at domestic branches prompting the banks to invest heavily to bring their compliance capabilities up to date some analysts say they are concerned that the banks growth plans are too optimistic for example the banks plan to speed up overseas growth to boost profits signaling its intention mizuho last year listed its shares on the new york stock exchange and later acquired the status of financial holding company an act aimed at boosting investment banking business in the u s meanwhile in japan the low profitability of the banks core lending operations continues to be a problem margin from domestic lending has been razor thin because of the nations near zero interest rates while the bank of japan started raising rates last year after a long hiatus it has done so at a slow pace smfg said the margin from the parent banks domestic lending business declined to from in the previous fiscal year as the cost of raising funds by the bank increased more than the return it receives on its lending "banks are having a hard time raising lending rates because of too much competition among themselves " says ryoji yoshizawa banking analyst for standard &amp poors in tokyo analysts say too many banks are going after similar sets of corporate borrowers even as demand for loans remains generally weak rather than taking out loans many companies have drawn from their ample cash reserves or raised money in the bond or stock markets mr yoshizawa says the weak profitability caused in large part by low margin lending raises a concern that banks could end up with bad loan problems again if the economy slows and insolvencies increase analysts also say fast growth overseas is unlikely in the near future given that the banks relatively weak financial standings and small stock market values make large scale acquisitions difficult "banks outside of japan thought the japanese megabanks would go on a shopping spree again " says hironari nozaki banking analyst for nikko citigroup ltd "at this point that is very unlikely " mr nozaki says the capital bases of japanese banks though improved significantly recently are still much weaker than those of top western banks it may be "five or years until the japanese banks can catch up " he says
