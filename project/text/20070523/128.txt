tax report irs could be wrong so check returns one of the worst ways to start the day is to receive a letter from the internal revenue service questioning your tax return when that happens its tempting just to write a check and make the problem disappear but instant surrender may be a costly mistake accountants and lawyers say irs notices may contain significant errors and that more taxpayers should take the time to study them and fight back when they think their tax return is correct "you just have to be patient and persistent " says david lifson a certified public accountant at hays &amp co in new york and president elect of the new york state society of certified public accountants "of course you also have to be right " in view of the growing complexity of the nations tax laws its surprising the irs doesnt make more mistakes some accountants blame much of the problem on the rapid expansion of the alternative minimum tax one of the most devilishly complex tax systems ever invented by congress among the areas causing difficulty lately taxation of state and local income tax refunds for example consider the case of a los gatos calif man who received an irs notice last month from the agencys ogden utah center the notice said "the income and payment information e g wages miscellaneous income interest income tax withheld earned income credit etc that we have on file doesnt match entries on your form if this information is correct you will owe &# " according to the irs the man had received a california state tax refund totaling &# "since you claimed state and local taxes when you itemized deductions on your tax return you must report any refund or credit of those taxes as income on your federal tax return or the year in which you actually received the refund or credit " the irs said the californian assumed the irs was right and wrote out a check but before mailing it he asked his tax preparer claudia hill to look into it "he was all set to mail in that check " says ms hill owner of tax mam a tax services firm in cupertino and an enrolled agent which means she is authorized to practice before the irs "he wanted to know why i hadnt included" the refund on his return ms hill says she quickly realized the irs was wrong because of the intricacies of the amt which had ensnared her client ms hill says she has spotted the same irs error in letters to several other clients in recent weeks when she called the irs she was told the agency was taking steps to remedy the situation similar problems have been reported in other areas including new york a white plains accountant says a client received a letter this year involving a state tax refund when she pointed out to the irs that her client was subject to the amt the irs agreed she was right irs officials acknowledge some recent errors involving state tax refunds but say they have already taken action to resolve the problems an irs spokeswoman said the agency "realized the problem still existed" on erroneous state income tax refund notices for the tax year "a few weeks ago " she says the agency "immediately took action " and "we regret any problem this caused taxpayers " the irs says it processed more than million individual income tax returns last year and sent out more than million "cp " notices typically saying there appears to be some discrepancy on a return and proposing a tax change the irs spokeswoman says there were about notices involving state tax refunds that were sent "in error " some taxpayers may decide its easier to pay than try to figure out what the irs notice is about especially when it involves an arcane tax issue such as the amt confusing irs notices long have drawn sharp criticism even from within the agency irs national taxpayer advocate nina olson in her annual report to congress cited "lack of notice clarity" as "one of the most serious problems encountered by taxpayers " if you get a notice that doesnt look quite right dont always blame the irs tax mams ms hill says numerous errors are due to taxpayer flubs such as putting a deduction on the wrong line or neglecting to include proceeds from sales of stocks and mutual fund shares this year mistakes were especially easy to make because congress waited until december to extend the life of several deductions that had expired at the end of by that time the irs already had sent its tax forms to the printer thus those forms didnt have lines that specifically mentioned deductions for state and local taxes higher education tuition and fees or educators classroom expenses instead
