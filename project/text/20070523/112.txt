reverse mortgages gain favor wall streets interest in traditional mortgages may be waning for now but its appetite for reverse mortgages is picking up for years fannie mae the government sponsored provider of funding for u s home mortgages has been the dominant buyer of reverse mortgages which are home equity loans to senior citizens that dont have to be repaid until the home is sold or the borrower dies now lured by these products growth potential as baby boomers retire financial services companies including lehman brothers holdings inc ubs ag bank of america corp and deutsche bank ag increasingly are buying these high yielding loans from lenders with the idea of repackaging them into securities for sale to investors "you will see a steadier stream of securitizations backed by reverse mortgages " says patrick fitzsimonds a director at ubss investment banking division in new york "its always interesting for us to get into a new product area and were banking on reverse mortgages becoming a much bigger market " the bet by wall street in turn has started to drive more lenders to a market long served by just a handful of companies indymac bancorp inc wells fargo &amp co seattle mortgage co which is being acquired by bank of america and closely held everbank financial corp s bny mortgage co the more liquid the secondary market is the thinking goes the more money there is to be lent out rising competition among lenders may lead to near term profit pressures industry executives say but the resulting lowered costs may entice more consumers to take out reverse mortgages in the long run for instance indymac has said net income for financial freedom its reverse mortgage unit may drop to roughly &# million this quarter from &# million in the first quarter the culprit competitive pressures exerted by new entrants are causing the lender to make less on each loan jim mahoney chairman of financial freedom believes the units profitability will bounce back with more investors looking to buy reverse mortgages he says lenders will be able to "develop new products with more options and lower overall costs to seniors " an expansion in offerings should bolster volumes reverse mortgages which hit a record of some last year still represent a tiny fraction of the overall mortgage market the volume of reverse mortgages is expected to grow more than fourfold by this year moodys investors service expects to rate bond deals backed by reverse mortgages totaling almost &# billion last year the credit rating agency evaluated only four such transactions representing some &# billion by comparison wall street packaged and sold about &# billion of subprime mortgage securities in alone according to ubs securitizing reverse mortgages poses challenges a reverse mortgage borrower receives money in the form of a lump sum payment equal payments over time or a line of credit and doesnt send monthly mortgage payments to a bank as with a traditional mortgage with a traditional mortgage bond investors can expect a steady flow of cash passed through from borrowers every month but because of the lack of monthly cash flow from reverse mortgages current deals backed by those products require a significant number of loans the rationale is that the bigger the loan pool is the more likely it is that enough of the loans would prepay in a given month to generate cash flows to pay the bondholders ginnie mae the federal housing finance agency is looking into ways to structure deals backed by a mix of both traditional and reverse mortgages that would "allow slicing and dicing" of cash flows into various classes of the bonds says justin burch a senior mortgage banking analyst traditional mortgages and reverse mortgages have different risk profiles while the former carries the risk of consumer defaults the key risk that reverse mortgages pose for lenders and investors is that the principal outstanding plus accrued interest for the loan could exceed the value of the borrowers home in the fall ginnie mae expects to start guaranteeing bonds backed by reverse mortgages insured by the government called home equity conversion mortgages or hecm the move says ginnie mae president robert couch will increase liquidity by providing capital market funding sources to hecm lenders hecm loans which limit the amount homeowners can borrow currently represent about of all reverse mortgages to cater to people with higher value homes lenders such as countrywide financial corp for example increasingly are creating their own products that dont have a loan limit and many lenders led by bny mortgage have been offering their lower priced version of the traditional hecm loan furthermore indymacs financial freedom expects to introduce a suite of new products over the next several months aimed at bringing down the overall costs for borrowers "without wall street getting into the reverse mortgage market " says craig corn co president of bny mortgage "its possible that some of the products that are being offered now wouldnt be offered "
