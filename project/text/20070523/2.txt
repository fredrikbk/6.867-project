agents secrets in russian murder case a long list of enemies ex colleague is charged in litvinenkos death tale of videotape moscow one spring night in three agents of the federal security service the main successor to the soviet kgb rousted a moscow journalist from his bed the agents said they had an urgent request they needed to make a videotape in case they were murdered eight years later one of them did die alexander litvinenko poisoned in london last november by a rare radioactive isotope called polonium yesterday british authorities charged a former security service colleague andrei lugovoi with murder and asked moscow to extradite the man russia has ridiculed accusations that the kremlin played a role in mr litvinenkos death and says it wont extradite mr lugovoi who had tea with mr litvinenko in a london hotel just before he fell ill mr putin has said russia had no reason to kill mr litvinenko who wasnt a spy but a mid level officer of the security service known as the fsb roughly the equivalent of a field agent of the fbi mr putin said mr litvinenko had no secrets to reveal but the tape and interviews with former colleagues present a more complex picture they show how mr litvinenko made enemies of bosses and colleagues pushing to expose what he saw as crimes and abuses and dragging people into murky political battles the broadcast helped set off a scandal over the methods of the fsb which was then headed by mr putin the tape which has not aired since was reviewed by the wall street journal on the tape the agents complained for nearly two hours that their bosses were sending them on illegal missions involving extortion and assault most recently they said they were trying to dodge an order to kidnap a local businessman and if necessary kill his police bodyguards now the agents feared they would be punished for their disloyalty they said they were scheduled to meet the security service director in the morning and wanted the videotape stashed away for safekeeping in case they disappeared "they could detain us and conduct some kind of experiments " the leader of the group col alexander gusak said on the tape "im familiar with how all this is done " mr litvinenko athletic and boyish looking with a shock of blond hair said he too feared for his life later that year he made a decision that would set the stage for his break from the security services flight from russia and his death in london trusted to keep the videotape secret he instead turned it over to a prominent tycoon who later aired excerpts on national television mr litvinenko then held a news conference denouncing the security service known as the fsb afterward he and some of his cohorts were fired from their jobs and he was jailed on criminal charges mr gusak who also was fired and other colleagues were furious with mr litvinenko mr gusak says colleagues came to him afterward to offer their sympathies and one offered to kill mr litvinenko asking "shall i bring you his head " mr gusak says he responded "dont bother hes scum " another crucial player in the litvinenko saga is boris berezovsky the tycoon who aired the tape the move backfired on mr berezovsky who was trying to gain influence by discrediting top fsb officers and two years later fled to london to avoid prosecution mr litvinenko soon followed him there at one point mr lugovoi also worked for mr berezovsky british prosecutors did not say yesterday that mr lugovoi was working for anyone in the murder of mr litvinenko british police say mr lugovoi and another former security officer left a trail of the rare polonium residue that traced back to russia where most of the worlds supply for commercial use is produced in government run reactors the isotope is normally used in trace quantities and specialists say the dose that killed mr litvinenko was so large it most likely came directly from a producer messrs lugovoi and the other former officer dmitri kovtun have said they played no role in the poisoning and long ago severed their ties with russian security services the tangled case is full of characters with changing loyalties and agendas including mr litvinenko himself his friends believe that the plot to kill him was hatched years ago and that the fsb was using former agents to execute the plan former agent a former fsb agent and sometime litvinenko ally mikhail trepashkin contends the agency tried as recently as to punish mr litvinenko and that he was recruited for the job mr trepashkin confined to a prison in the ural mountains smuggled a letter to that effect to a moscow newspaper earlier this year mr trepashkin was the alleged target of one plot detailed in the videotape and appeared alongside mr litvinenko at his infamous news conference mr putin has stayed close to the fsb since becoming russian president frequently returning to praise its work at official gatherings amid a string of bloody terror attacks and other security failures mr putin has doggedly shielded the fsb from criticism and strengthened it with new powers and a massive increase in funding mr litvinenko started at the fsb near the bottom as an officer guarding convoys of gold and diamonds after the breakup of the soviet union he was assigned to an economic crime unit where he once wrote many officers moonlighted for businesses and ran extortion rackets to supplement their incomes in he was assigned to a case that symbolized the breakdown of order in post soviet russia a massive car bomb in downtown moscow demolished the mercedes of mr berezovsky decapitating his driver and nearly killing mr berezovsky mr litvinenko never solved the murder but he did strike up a friendship with mr berezovsky a former mathematician mr berezovsky was the archetypal "oligarch " a tycoon who combined political contacts with a vast business empire to amass unparalleled influence and businesses from oil to airlines to television the nerve center of his empire was a renovated th century mansion in moscow that he turned into a social club for russias business and political elite when moscow police investigating the contract murder of a prominent tv executive showed up at the mansion to search for evidence in they were stopped by mr litvinenko who identified himself as an fsb officer "he said that if anyone entered he would shoot " said yuri skuratov who later investigated the tv executives murder as russias top prosecutor police "were never able to make a proper search " he said the murder remains unsolved mr berezovsky denies any involvement in the tv executives killing and says that mr litvinenko probably saved his life by preventing moscow police from framing him for the murder he says that he offered to pay mr litvinenko for his help but that mr litvinenko refused mr litvinenkos security service colleagues say they began to regard him with suspicion mr gusak his immediate boss said in an interview that agents began to call mr litvinenko "skvoznyak" russian for "draft" or "breeze" because he was leaking fsb secrets to mr berezovsky then came the april videotape the men told the interviewer that they had been promoted in to a special unit charged with fighting "banditry" whose existence was a secret even within the ranks of the fsb but the officers soon clashed with their commanders who they said were sending them on illegal missions mr gusak said that he received word that there was an order to have him killed so they made the videotape to protect themselves mr gusak the heavy set senior officer of the group was quieter than the rest as he stared into his ashtray and smoked during most of the tape mr litvinenko and another junior officer andrei ponkin were more talkative seated on a couch and some chairs around a small table the officers complained they were used as errand boys for bosses and ordered to terrorize the agencys enemies one of their first assignments they said was to beat up or kill mr trepashkin who had spoken to a moscow newspaper then about fsb abuses as they refused to carry out orders their bosses had come to distrust them they said the tensions deepened after the squad was told to abduct the brother of a prominent chechen businessman in moscow and secure a &# million ransom to pay for the release of two fsb officers kidnapped in chechnya advice of a sniper the officers said they prepared for the job they sought the advice of a sniper and found a dacha on moscows outskirts where they could stash the prisoner but then they discovered their target was guarded by moscow police mr gusak said "naturally the question arose whether to kill some of our brother officers " said mr gusak on the tape that he added "would not be very pretty " the officers repeatedly postponed the kidnapping to focus on lower profile cases but just before the new year their boss called them into his office and berated them mr litvinenko said on the tape that one of the commanders alexander kamyshnikov demanded to know whether he would follow an order to kill mr berezovsky when mr litvinenko hesitated he said mr kamyshnikov walked up to him and shouted at him nose to nose "you have to kill berezovsky " mr kamyshnikov could not be reached for comment mr gusak said on the tape that he was asked the same question but took it as a test of loyalty not an order and says now that there was never any serious plan to kill mr berezovsky but he says mr litvinenko told the tycoon that a plot existed in order to curry favor with him mr berezovsky went to the fsb director to demand an investigation unsatisfied with the results he later arranged for the agents to report the incident to a senior kremlin official triggering an official probe by summer fsb director nikolai kovalyov was sacked its not clear whether the firing had anything to do with pressure from mr berezovsky little known functionary replacing the director was mr putin who was then a little known functionary from the kremlin administration mr berezovsky says in an interview that he had a good relationship with mr putin whom he knew from his days as a bureaucrat in st petersburg hoping to spur a housecleaning at the fsb mr berezovsky says he then arranged a personal meeting between mr litvinenko and mr putin the meeting lasted about minutes mr litvinenko told friends in a book mr litvinenko later wrote he described how he brought mr putin a diagram explaining how parts of the fsb were being controlled by criminals he also gave mr putin a list of officers he considered to be honest mr putin thanked him and said he would consider the information mr litvinenko wrote they never met again mr litvinenkos friends said a kremlin spokesman said he couldnt confirm or deny that account seeing no action mr berezovsky decided to go public with his attacks on the fsb in november he published an open letter in a moscow newspaper urging mr putin to investigate the alleged fsb plot to kill him later that month mr litvinenko and several colleagues followed up with a news conference mr litvinenko led the event and said the fsb was running private hit squads and extortion rackets he urged the fsb to purge top managers who were "giving illegal orders to commit acts of terrorism killings hostage takings and extortion " mr trepashkin appeared at the news conference with them as a victim of fsb abuse mr litvinenko appeared bare faced at the news conference his colleagues tried to conceal their identities some wore sunglasses and one wore a ski mask mr gusak who was outside moscow didnt participate but in the next few days after the press conference the television station under mr berezovskys control began broadcasting excerpts of the videotape in which officers without masks or sunglasses discussed the sordid details of their secret unit in detail mr gusak said he never gave permission to air the videotape sergei dorenko the journalist who aired it said he decided to make it public because the fsbs inner workings came out at the press conference anyway gradually the identity of all the officers at the news conference and on the tape leaked out mr putin dismissed the allegations as a public relations stunt and threatened to sue for libel an investigation concluded there was no plot to assassinate mr berezovsky although some of mr litvinenkos bosses might have joked that they would like to see him die "the whole story of the press conference shows the inner sickness of our system " mr putin told a russian reporter later saying the agents seemed to be trying to ingratiate themselves with mr berezovsky he never sued mr litvinenko was fired from the fsb in the next months so were his colleagues who appeared at the news conference some recanted their statements and said that mr berezovsky had paid or pressured them to make their accusations they blamed mr litvinenko for dragging them into a fight they wanted no part of also fired from the fsb was mr gusak he was charged with extortion kidnapping and using excessive force on suspect who later died most of the charges were dismissed and he received a suspended sentence after one month in prison mr litvinenko was also arrested in for alleged abuses that he committed years earlier the charges were dropped but mr litvinenko was re arrested on different charges then released again mr litvinenko went to work for mr berezovsky full time as a security consultant mr berezovsky initially supported mr putins rise to the presidency in but soon clashed with the new president facing an embezzlement investigation mr berezovsky fled to london in november of that year vowing to fight to remove mr putin mr litvinenko followed him and applied for political asylum in he was convicted in absentia of abuse of office in moscow he remained on mr berezovskys payroll and lived in a house owned by mr berezovsky in londons north end london campaign from london he helped mr berezovsky wage a campaign against mr putin through books and internet articles one former colleague from his fsb unit and his press conference viktor shebalin gave an interview to a moscow newspaper in in which he blamed mr litvinenko for manipulating his co workers to benefit mr berezovsky and "strike a huge blow against the special services " mr shebalin called on mr litvinenko to return to russia and give himself up "if you are innocent you have nothing to fear " he said "but know this traitors are not forgiven " mr trepashkin said he was recruited in for a plot against litvinenko by mr shebalin mr trepashkin wrote that mr shebalin had been offered "forgiveness" in return for his help but mr trepashkin said he refused to join and remained unrepentant mr shebalin could not be reached for comment the next year mr trepashkin was arrested for weapons possession and later convicted of revealing state secrets in a case that human rights groups say was politically motivated british detectives who came to russia earlier this year to investigate mr litvinenkos murder were not allowed to speak with him in london mr litvinenko told friends that he received death threats but believed his british citizenship would protect him said vladimir bukovsky a soviet era dissident who befriended him he continued to meet with former security service colleagues mr bukovsky said last year mr berezovsky began cutting back mr litvinenkos monthly allowance after the two agreed he would find work as a private detective mr berezovsky says mr litvinenko told friends he was compiling reports for western clients who wanted to know about business groups in russia his new business brought him in touch with mr lugovoi a former kremlin security officer who also worked for mr berezovsky in the s in russia mr lugovoi prospered under mr putin as head of a beer and soft drink business and a firm that provided bodyguards to prominent businessmen and politicians mayfair hotel on a business trip to london in october mr lugovoi introduced mr litvinenko to mr kovtun mr lugovoi said they discussed business at a second meeting nov at the mayfair millennium hotel in london after which mr litvinenko fell ill for three weeks doctors were unsure what kind of ailment had struck him but a few hours before he died scientists from a united kingdom atomic laboratory detected in his urine the polonium afterward police found traces of the polonium in the hotel where mr litvinenko had met mr lugovoi and mr kovtun they also found polonium traces in mr lugovois hotel room and in an apartment that mr kovtun visited in hamburg germany on his way to london from moscow it was unclear yesterday why british authorities charged only mr lugovoi in russia state run media have suggested that mr berezovsky arranged the poisoning to discredit the kremlin or that mr litvinenko killed himself mr gusak today a defense lawyer in moscow says security services had nothing to do with mr litvinenkos death but that he did deserve to die for revealing state secrets mr putin said he does not believe reports that mr berezovsky arranged the scandal "i do not really believe in conspiracy theories and quite frankly i am not very worried about it " he said in a meeting with journalists earlier this year "the stability of russian statehood today allows us to look down at this from above "
