the long fall of liberty st a building damaged during proves difficult to demolish building a story skyscraper is a challenge dismantling one can be an ordeal and when its a building damaged in the sept attacks littered with human remains contaminated with noxious dusts and wedged into a densely populated area things get particularly complicated thats the situation in new york at liberty st a hulking black tower that suffered a story gash from falling debris in the sept attacks it was originally slated for demolition in early after delays due to insurance fights environmental regulators and walkouts by contractors the deconstruction finally began in earnest a few months ago the top floors started to disappear as a crane lowered steel beams to the ground shielded by a black shroud workers in protective suits began decontaminating the inside scrubbing every surface by hand then early thursday came yet another setback a worker high in the tower cut a foot length of pipe which caromed off the protective scaffolding and fell stories it crashed through the roof of the fire station across the street that lost six men on sept the pipe missed two firefighters who were treated for dust exposure to their eyes in the wake of the accident the city buildings department issued a stop work order and is investigating the demolition plan the deconstruction has been suspended though the abatement of hazardous material continues as does the search for human remains the falling pipe was just the latest mishap in a long campaign by a dozen government agencies to erase the stubborn survivor of the sept attacks even as construction of the new world trade center hits its stride across the street at ground zero liberty st also known at the deutsche bank building for a former owner continues to confound "it will be more expensive to take it down than to put it up " says charles brickbauer one of the original architects of the building in liberty cost &# million to construct according to press reports at the time in the state spent &# million to acquire the building as of february it had allocated &# million for the demolition and in february ponied up another &# million though that cost is subject to further negotiations with contractors and insurers of the amount allocated the state has spent &# million to date and much of the work remains a spokesman says the overall cost will be more than &# million getting rid of liberty st is essential for the larger world trade center rebuilding an underground facility to screen delivery trucks before they enter the main site a precaution against another terrorist attack is planned for that space as is a new tower which j p morgan chase &amp co is considering occupying the complex construction gymnastics of the more than &# billion ground zero project require that work on the screening facility begin before three other towers and a train station can proceed its not clear when deconstruction will resume though officials say the goal of finishing by years end is not yet in danger given the location and the emotions a timed implosion wasnt an option a wrecking ball would have been too messy and not sufficient to demolish the steel skeleton the presence of a variety of noxious chemicals and over bone fragments from sept victims means the demolition must proceed carefully and slowly "this is the most regulated job in the city of new york and the most time consuming " says avi schick chairman of the lower manhattan development corp the agency that owns the building and is in charge of its demise various levels of government are involved from the u s environmental protection agency to the city department of health and mental hygiene the current demolition plan took several years to refine its a two step process first workers in protective suits and respirators decontaminate every inch of the million square foot interior "they are scraping by hand all the surfaces of a story office building " says mr schick workers seal each decontaminated floor and use fans to control the air flow and prevent leakage they put dirty materials in two sets of thick plastic bags and send them out in sealed containers to be hauled away to certified landfills by trucks that run until p m each night a dozen air monitoring machines in the area check the air around the building and the neighborhood in case any of the dust gets loose the state is paying trc cos an environmental testing company close to &# million a year for the service which posts results on a public web site "we will take any cost to make sure its done right " says mr schick once regulators certify that a floor has been decontaminated the city buildings department issues a demolition permit floor by floor a normal building demolition would have a single permit for the whole structure workers cover the upper floors in plywood sheathing to prevent materials from falling overboard they then score the beams and columns with welding torches small construction vehicles pull the metal pieces into the center of the building a crane lowers those pieces to vehicles on the ground investigators are still trying to determine how the pipe slipped through the protective sheathing meantime wary passersby have their own theories "the construction company screwed up big time to have a hunk of something fall out of that building " says dave stanke a writer and stay at home dad who lives in the shadow of the hulking black tower "i take my four kids by there this morning i thought should i go this way " bovis lend lease a contractor on the project referred calls to the state errol cockfield spokesman for the state agency overseeing the demolition says "safety is our first priority when it comes to this project " one bankers trust plaza as it was then known was completed in it opened a year after the twin towers and was connected to them by an elevated walkway deutsche bank took it over in when it bought bankers trust which had owned the building when the south tower fell on sept debris showered liberty st a diesel generator in the basement caught fire but was extinguished all but two of the buildings occupants escaped one died when the twin towers collapsed the other francisco bourdier a security guard was last seen evacuating occupants at liberty st when the twin towers collapsed human remains landed on the roof and inside the building despite the damage the building stood its ground the gash in its facade weakened it only enough to matter in a strong hurricane engineers designed a patch to shore it up just in case the tower was covered in a black shroud to prevent debris from falling locals called it "the widow " fighting over the building began quickly deutsche bank said the tower was too contaminated to occupy its insurers axa sa and allianz se disagreed feeling it could be scrubbed and sold meantime redevelopment officials determined that removing the building would simplify the larger rebuilding plan after months of negotiations the lmdc the state owner of the building agreed to use &# million in federal aid to purchase the site and begin demolition deutsche bank got &# million from the government and another &# million from the insurers the insurers agreed to handle certain cost overruns in february then gov george e pataki said the building would be gone within a year and half but a state survey found more contaminants than expected including dangerous levels of asbestos dioxin and lead locals lobbied loudly for a careful demolition contractors came and left in september and again in february workers discovered human remains on the roof the demolition was delayed as the search for remains took precedent work restarted in the fall of but then workers stopped showing up as the contractors bovis lend lease and john galt corp demanded more money from the state saying the job was harder than they anticipated to speed things along gov eliot spitzers administration struck a deal to pay the contractors more up front and negotiate or litigate over costs later mr brickbauer the architect says he never much cared for the building which he calls a "clunky stump " the developer fisher bros of new york and the tenant bankers trust "didnt leave much room for our creativity " says mr brickbauer calls to fisher bros werent returned "it makes you feel a little funny " mr brickbauer says to see a structure he designed come down "but i dont feel bad about it i never took anybody to see the building "
