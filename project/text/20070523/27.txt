colleges give tharps old works a try new york in the typically wry narration twyla tharp composed for a video called "twyla tharp scrapbook " which surveyed the first years of her career as a dancemaker the scrappy sounding choreographer commented on the brainy side of her early work noting the urge to think through and write down the frequently complex plans she and her initially all female dancers devised for choreography she identified what she called the "zenith in our note phase " this was reached during her teaching residency at oberlin college there in january with help from a computer ms tharp and her six dancers worked on some intricate movement studies all duly written down before being structured into a dance presentation the result was shown once in a campus field house in the manner of an athletic event and again in a theater the performances which came and went and were seen no more involved oberlins students and were led by ms tharp alongside her six devoted dancers elsewhere in her "scrapbook " the choreographer lovingly described her tireless female collaborators as seeing themselves "righteously and rigorously as a bunch of broads doing gods work " though she doesnt literally say so in her narration "repertory schmepertory" succinctly describes ms tharps lack of interest in keeping her works around beyond their initial runs or at least it did for a good while in her evolving career ms tharp who disbanded her official company in to work thereafter on a project to project basis was nowhere in evidence herself when the joyce theater recently presented a one off college showcase that offered an all tharp program of dances from the s but a few of the "broads" and for good measure a dude or two who worked so faithfully with her in the past did have a hand in the happy event barnard college hunter college the juilliard school marymount manhattan college and sarah lawrence college all came together to present the individual tharp works that figured in their recent spring concerts the programming an atypical entry on the joyces spring calendar came about when ginger montell associate director of twyla tharp productions noted the strong college concentration of tharp dances in and around new york city this year four works made up the program put on by the joyce "the fugue" was danced by both sarah lawrence and marymount in differently focused presentations originally conceived by ms tharp as a taut trio performed in silence on a stage amplified to resonate with the dancers footwork "the fugue" was shown by sarah lawrence as a "lecture &amp demonstration " this way of presenting it dates from the s when ms tharp and company took it on tour here it was led by former tharp dancer jennifer way who worked with the sarah lawrence students during the year when she was assisted by her husband tom rawe one of the earliest male members of ms tharps company the audience sitting through the workshop like format in the joyce was given somewhat more lecture than demonstration though ms way confidently put the well rehearsed students through the tricky timing and variously altered emphases involved in the dances concentrated movement "phrases " her spiel wasnt especially easy to follow by the time three hardworking marymount women followed with a full performance of the dance viewing fatigue had set in and while i strongly prefer seeing women dance this work so well suited to the female physique i found a lack of full "fugue" impact in the fact that they wore the shirts and slacks later designed by santo loquasto for tharp company men the original costumes variously shaped black tops and cut off pants paired with heeled boots by kermit love remain more striking and more theatrical especially where percussive footwork is concerned the four hunter students bright rendering of excerpts from s jaunty "country dances" staged by stacy caddell smartly contrasted with the sameness of the back to back "fugue" segments the colorful country style music showed how ms tharp used rhythmic accompaniment to enhance her theatrical dance effects barnard colleges complete presentation of s "eight jelly rolls" staged full of crucial detail by katie glasner opened the bill with a bang and a slide and a shuffle and a pratfall or two this eight part suite represents ms tharps earliest turn toward music namely that of jelly roll morton and the red hot peppers while few subsequent dancers least of all those drawn from a pool of full time college students can be expected to hit all the playful virtuoso and personal notes that mark this loose and often loopy presentation of jazz tinged dapper dancing these barnard women managed handsomely special mention should go to long haired elena williams who took on the sly sphinxlike moods of rose marie wrights original dancing as well as to a smooth tamara clarke and a witty renuka hines who respectively danced the roles that sara rudner and ms tharp herself once made so memorable both of these last named students not only dug into the subtle body language they were given but also lit up from inside the spiritual dimensions of these jazz trouper personalities "deuce coupe" to beach boys music arranged by david horowitz reconstructed by william whitener was presented as the programs suitably bright capstone by the juilliard students the most nearly professional of all these college dancers sadly none of the works pure ballet based choreography splendidly danced by the school during its spring program in march when it gave the work in full was included in this truncated version there are a number reasons why college dance departments find ms tharps works so neat a fit for their students the choreographys cerebral side is certainly one the devotion of former tharp dancers to their past work and toward passing it on is another "deuce coupe" can be seen as a reason unto itself in its fertile meshing of ballet and modern dance ms tharp was often thought to be ahead of her time and this college concentration on a sampler of her nearly year old works more than fortifies that assessment mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
