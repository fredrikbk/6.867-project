fbi alters tactics in fight against terrorists for nearly months federal agents watched and listened as a half dozen young men in new jersey allegedly used a pizza delivery route to map out a plan for mass murder at a local army base when the conspirators moved to buy guns earlier this month the fbi swooped in the fort dix case which at first blush looked like another roundup of amateurish misfits in fact points to an important shift in the way the federal bureau of investigation is tackling domestic terrorism prior to sept investigators working domestic terrorism and organized crime cases routinely used informants and wiretaps sometimes for years before making an arrest the fbi says that long term investigations marked by patience and the willingness to let plots go forward prevented about attacks between and including attempted bombings robberies and prison breaks by domestic and foreign extremists but after sept fbi agents were instructed to jump on suspects at the first whiff of trouble investigations were short and arrests took place sometimes before suspects had turned talk into action former attorney general john ashcroft was convinced that a rapid dragnet was needed to defeat the new breed of muslim terrorists "even though this may hinder a criminal investigation " he said in october "prevention of terrorist attacks even at the expense of a prosecution must be our priority " in recent months the fbi has again become more methodical taking time to build dossiers on suspects and their supporters in the belief that only long term investigations can reveal the full extent of terrorist networks in the u s in the fort dix case federal agents first learned of the alleged plot when some of the suspects went to a circuit city store and asked a clerk to transfer a training video onto a dvd it featured the group screaming jihadi slogans the clerk called police who brought in the fbi soon after immigration and customs enforcement agents discovered that three of the suspects brothers dritan duka years old shain duka and eljvir duka were ethnic albanians from the former yugoslavia who appeared to have been smuggled into the u s from mexico as children in joseph billy jr the assistant director of the fbis counterterrorism division says that a few years ago the training video and the brothers illegal status would have been enough to prompt an arrest but with the plot in its early stages the fbi decided to wait and infiltrate the group in case there was more to the bungling plotters than met the eye the investigation relied heavily on two paid informants who recorded meetings and telephone conversations in which the suspects talked of killing "in the name of allah " informants are often the weakest links and biggest problems in running long term terrorist investigations says steve mccraw who until was assistant director of the fbis inspection division where he oversaw evaluation of fbi operations he adds that theyre nonetheless "indispensable " fbi director robert mueller at a recent news conference said the bureau and the justice department decided to make the arrests when the suspects looked set to obtain weapons from a source the fbi didnt control in the end there was no al qaeda link the men appear to have been self selecting and self radicalized the bureaus return to a pre approach reflects the influence of americas foreign intelligence partners european nations have long complained that sources of intelligence about islamist terrorist networks inside the u s were lost when suspects were rolled up after perfunctory investigations there were other impetuses for the change the fast takedowns in the years after provoked an outcry from civil rights groups who saw high profile terrorism cases degenerate into a tangle of minor felonies the alleged dirty bomber jose padilla for example is now on trial in miami but isnt facing charges relating to a bomb plot "lots of old school guys didnt like shutting things down prematurely because once shut down there was no way back in " says mr mccraw the former agent "the problem though was that after everyone was second guessing you " he adds mr billy who has been the running the fbis counterterrorism division for two years calls the longer investigations an "evolution " "the fbis position today is that we dont know where all the connections are in order to be able to do that theres a need to find out as much intelligence as we can as long as we can " still some in the bureau believe the potential cost of playing the waiting game is too high "there is still a strong feeling among the ranks that it is better to be safe than sorry " says one agent
