biofuels are our future but we need much more than just corn lawmakers are not backing away from grain based ethanol quietly or otherwise "ethanols bitter taste " by kimberley a strassel potomac watch may rather they recognize what many in the u s ethanol industry have been saying for years grain based ethanol production will only take us so far where that magic number lies is up for debate but smart people put the number at around billion gallons or of our nations gasoline demand the future as president bush and members of congress have realized is in building upon the foundation grain based ethanol has lain the future is in developing new feedstocks that will turn americas vast supplies of renewable cellulosic material such as wood chips and switchgrass into low carbon renewable fuel lawmakers should be supported in this effort not mocked and yes it is true that a few companies that have grown accustomed to cheap corn are complaining about the new marketplace reality the truth is corn has been undervalued for too long and the days of &# for a bushel of corn are likely history for too long americas corn farmers were seeing prices driven by the government not the market the fact that thats now changed is a good thing and while some in agriculture will have to adapt there will be more than enough corn in this country to satisfy the demand for feed fuel and fiber moreover consumers will benefit significantly as biofuels drive down the price of gasoline the critical need to diversify our nations energy supply will require an adjustment within our nations energy markets a new paradigm is developing in which agriculture and energy will forever be linked ultimately it is in the best interest of this country the alternative is the unsustainable status quo bob dinneen president renewable fuels association washington ms strassel neglected to include the animal feed product available from corn ethanol production corn based ethanol production provides millions of tons of high protein distillers grain feed lot owners find that this grain with the oil removed a biodiesel co product produces a low fat high protein rich quality feed most ethanol plants are owned by american farmers they know what they are doing and they deserve our support for cutting the flow of oil dollars out of the u s frank jamerson ph d naples fla we appreciate ms strassels candid look at the complexities of the corn ethanol craze she correctly calls out u s ranchers as supporters of ending subsidies and axing import tariffs on ethanol but we must point out that this is by no means "a first" for u s ranchers for decades u s cattle ranchers have supported free markets and free trade u s ranchers accept no domestic supports or export subsidies rather breaking down trade barriers and opening up markets is one of our top priorities the national cattlemens beef association fought hard for passage of major free trade agreements such as cafta chile and nafta so we could access these markets just as these countries have been able to access ours we strongly support the russian and vietnam wto accessions and have long believed in trade benefits obtained via the multilateral wto negotiating process in fact our strong pro trade orientation is well recognized in washington we are well aware that the future ability to grow our business depends on the ability to market our products to the of the worlds population living outside the united states ncba supports a market based approach to renewable energy production which would help level the playing field for cattle producers and other feed grain users we want free fair markets and believe the goal of u s agricultural trade policy should be to make our product as competitive as possible in the global market john queen north carolina cattle producer and ncba president waynesville n c
