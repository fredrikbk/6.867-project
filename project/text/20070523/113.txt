russia on trial with the british demand that andrei lugovoi be extradited to face charges for the murder of alexander litvinenko the first steps have been taken toward justice more is at stake in this case however than the fate of one man the brazen murder of litvinenko is a test of international societys willingness to defend its most fundamental principles until now russian authorities have reacted to allegations that the federal security service fsb was behind the murder of litvinenko with outraged innocence the reaction was similar to the soviet reaction after the murder of bulgarian dissident georgy markov in london in it was also reminiscent of the way spokesmen denied russian involvement in the murder of former chechen president zelimkhan yandarbiev in qatar in unaware that russian agents had been captured on videotape mining yandarbievs car denials and stonewalling are now no longer enough the russian constitution bars the extradition of russian citizens but russia signed the council of europe extradition convention in and the russian federation signed a memo of understanding with the british crown prosecution service in november covering legal cooperation including extradition if russia will not extradite mr lugovoi it should be pressed to try him at home in a manner that meets international standards relations between russia and the west are growing more troubled russia should be a firm ally concerned to balance chinese strength guard against islamic terrorism and prevent the emergence of nuclear powers on its borders instead russia has emerged as a danger in its own right intent on increasing its influence in the world by dominating its immediate neighbors in a manner that is antithetical to western values the key to the situation is corruption russian officials run the biggest companies controlling according to some estimate financial flows from assets that account for of the capitalization of the russian stock market persons and institutions challenging this oligarchys hold on power have been steadily eliminated to distract attention from this situation russian leaders insist on russias "right" to dominate the nations that emerged from the soviet union and to a degree the warsaw pact and to pursue its "great power" interests in a manner that pays little heed to the security needs of the west russia reacted with hysteria to the removal of the soviet war memorial in tallinn although the bodies of soviet world war ii soldiers still lie unburied in russia years after the end of the war russia backs secession for abkhazia and south ossetia but not for chechnya and is concerned about u s anti missile systems in poland and the czech republic but not the nuclear development of north korea and iran the domination of post soviet russia by a corrupt bureaucracy dates back to boris yeltsins illegal dissolution of the russian parliament in in a struggle over the spoils of privatization yeltsin however was beholden to the west and needed western aid under vladimir putin however oil prices increased from &# a barrel in to as much as &# the west now is obliged to contend with irrational russian policies regarding to u s plans for a defensive anti missile system in eastern europe as well as regarding iran north korea georgia ukraine and terrorist groups such as hezbollah and hamas in every case what is involved is not national interest but protecting the ruling russian oligarchys monopoly of money and power under these circumstances the murder of alexander litvinenko a british subject killed on british soil is most likely another instance of russias confidence that it can act with impunity in the months since litvinenkos death russian spokesmen have spared no effort in vilifying him and ridiculing the wests interest in his fate sergei ivanov a deputy prime minister and a leading candidate to succeed mr putin said litvinenko had a "low intellect" and was inclined to provocation "for us litvinenko was a nobody " in a film about him on the ntv television network "litvinenko a very british murder " he was accused of stealing money from his first wifes purse before leaving her in an interview in the russian newspaper izvestiya andrei lugovoy answered a question about requests for him to go to london for questioning by saying "why should i drop everything and rush off to england " russians both officials and ordinary citizens were actually certain that the litvinenko case would disappear as have so many cases of persons murdered for political opposition within russia itself for this reason above all the west needs to be resolute the pursuit of justice in this case is a vital way to limit the russian tendency to live once again in a world of illusions a bad habit left over from the delirium of the soviet union that promises nothing good in a world that needs decent values above all else mr satter is affiliated with the hoover institution the hudson institute and johns hopkins his latest book is "darkness at dawn the rise of the russian criminal state" yale
