the new ben hurs chariot racing stages a comeback from brazil to jordan teams are saddling up a cowboys close call sao simao brazil on a drowsy may day in the country tractors and combines were lumbering down dirt roads when suddenly a cloud of dust rose up on the horizon birds scattered rumbling across the green landscape came seven racing chariots each pulled by four horses riding in the chariot decorated with an engraving of alexander the great was luiz augusto alves de oliveira a year old sugar cane farmer who has an epic plan returning chariot racing to its ancient glory in this may day race at the foot hippodrome he built on his ranch in central brazil mr de oliveira hung back in the middle of the pack of chariots for most of the event but with two laps to go he let go the reins speeded up the horses to about miles an hour and won easily "you have to have patience and a sense of timing to be a charioteer " mr de oliveira said later mingling with spectators he had invited for beer and barbecue mr de oliveira is part of a highly committed global community of horse and history buffs who believe that chariot racing is a sport whose time has come again after a hiatus of a millennium or so in the middle east france and england as well as in brazil these modern charioteers are enduring bone jarring bumps to revive the contests that thrilled the ancients and more recently launched a whole genre of hollywood sword and sandal movies one of the men behind the international buggy boomlet swedish born stellan lind became obsessed with chariots after watching the famous racing scene in "ben hur " the movie starring charlton heston "chariot racing was the formula one of the antiquities " says mr lind who for years was a pharmaceuticals executive mr lind saw his chance to resurrect racing several years ago when he stumbled onto a roman hippodrome in jerash jordan that was being restored by archaeologists he got financial backing from the jordan tourism board to hold re enactments of races and gladiator fights there to help him design chariots that were functional as well as historically faithful mr lind tracked down a former "ben hur" prop man who was keeping several of the chariots used in the film in his barn in rome in mr lind and his company the roman army and chariot experience or race started entertaining tourists in jerash with roman exhibitions last september in paris director robert hossein staged five performances of a &# million ben hur re enactment at the stade de france featuring hundreds of extras appearing as charioteers gladiators and pirates it drew close to spectators chariot racings mass appeal was no mystery to the ancient greeks who made the sport a mainstay of the early olympic games in rome fans often spent the night before a race camping out at the circus maximus the seat stadium in order to get a good seat archaeological records reveal that gaius appuleius diocles a famous charioteer of the second century rode his chariot to first place finishes in starts and won million sesterces in prize money but the ferocity of racing fans eventually hastened the sports demise says robert garland classics professor at colgate university in hamilton n y in a contingent of hippodrome fans in constantinople launched a demonstration against the heavy handed emperor justinian i things rapidly got out of hand rioters burned down half the city and the emperors troops succeeded in quelling the unrest only after slaughtering about people increasingly fearful of the mob leaders began scaling down chariot races eventually the contests withered away in modern times hollywood has helped keep chariots rolling in the popular imagination a stuntman and scores of horses died filming the chariot race in the original silent version of "ben hur " released in in the version of the film which won oscars a nearly disastrous mishap in which a stuntman got flipped out of the chariot was incorporated into the film more recently "gladiator " the russell crowe epic featured a memorably gory fight between gladiators and chariots bearing female archers gerard naprous the head of a stunt riding team in the united kingdom that works in films and exhibitions says that crowds are more enthusiastic than ever for chariot racing "to tell you the truth i dont like it " mr naprous says "its too dangerous " the brazilian mr de oliveiras career as a charioteer began about years ago while he was recovering from a motorcycle accident and had nothing to do but watch the charlton heston "ben hur" over and over when he finally got back on his feet mr de oliveira set about working with field hands and friends to build and race aluminum chariots neighbors such as heloisa consoni were apprehensive at first about the goings on at mr de oliveiras ranch "we werent sure if he meant to bring in lions and gladiators too " mrs consoni says but now she is a fan "how can you not love that speed " she says mr de oliveira says that neither the horses nor the costumed riders have been seriously injured in years of training and exhibitions but the charioteers who dont bother to wear protective helmets have had some close calls once during a training exercise ayrton da silva a former rodeo cowboy says his chariot rolled over the top of a horse that had fallen and become unhitched from its buggy he nearly lost control of the vehicle mr de oliveira holds races every few weeks during the fall and winter but the remoteness of his ranch has limited the number of spectators to at most or so so hes finalizing a deal to lease land for a new track in the nearby town of cravinhos currently leisure options in cravinhos are so limited that the local museums acquisition of some stuffed antarctic penguins was front page news mr de oliveira believes he can clean up by charging the towns residents admission to his races
