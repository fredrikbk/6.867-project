the afternoon report goodlings word online edition washington has been waiting to hear from monica goodling the former justice department official who asserted her fifth amendment rights after being called to speak to congress about the firing of eight federal prosecutors today she at last told her tale testifying under a grant of immunity the former justice department liaison to the white house denied that she had played a significant role in the firing decisions and said that deputy attorney general paul mcnulty was to blame for misleading lawmakers about the rationale for the attorneys dismissals his explanation offered in capitol hill testimony in early february was "incomplete or inaccurate in a number of respects " ms goodling testified in front of a packed committee room adding that she believed that "the deputy was not fully candid " ms goodling said that she and others in the department fully briefed mr mcnulty who is resigning from his post later this year before the hearing she said kyle sampson who resigned as chief of staff for attorney general alberto gonzales this year as the scandal began bubbling to full froth had compiled the list of prosecutors who were to be let go ms goodling also said that she never spoke with white house adviser karl rove or white house counsel harriet miers about which attorneys should be on the chopping block ms goodling did acknowledge that she had considered the political loyalties of applicants seeking to work as career prosecutors which is a violation of federal law and expressed "regret" for those "mistakes " the hearing marked the first time that ms goodling years old has spoken publicly about the dismissals which congressional democrats believe were improperly motivated by politics the bush administration counters that the attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president and can be dismissed for any reason the justice department has said that the prosecutors were cut loose because of poor performance ms goodling worked to distance herself from the dismissals at the hearing telling lawmakers that she believed that the departments public criticism of the attorneys seemed to be a bridge too far "i dont know if this is a route that i would have decided to go down if it were up to me " she said but republican lawmakers today said there was little evidence that the firings were untoward "the accusations dont seem to have legs " said texas rep lamar smith in a hearing this month mr gonzales told the house judiciary panel that in his view the time had come to move on from the scandal and appeared to be more composed than he was during a testy exchange with senate lawmakers during a hearing in april at that appearance prominent republican senators said the time had come for the embattled attorney general to give up his post but at the house hearing no new members added their voices to that chorus however the attorney general took another sizable blow last week after respected former deputy attorney general james comey told the senate about his confrontation with mr gonzales then working for the white house over the legality of the presidents domestic surveillance program that account led nebraska republican sen chuck hagel to say that mr gonzales had "lost the moral authority to lead" and call for his resignation the senate is planning a vote of no confidence in mr gonzales at some point in the coming weeks in a highly unusual move but president bush is sticking by his friend and dismissed the planned senate confidence vote as "pure political theater "
