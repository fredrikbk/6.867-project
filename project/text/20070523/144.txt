violent standoff risks splintering fragile lebanon fighting adds pressure on central government a weapons plea to u s beirut lebanon the violent showdown raging between the lebanese military and sunni muslim extremists has escalated into a major test of the governments ability to control the country and avert a wider conflict that could further destabilize the middle east the lebanese government faces an excruciating dilemma in the northern city of tripoli the scene of the fighting its troops have been unable to defeat the militants who are well armed and holed up in a palestinian refugee camp off limits to the lebanese military but the government risks being perceived as weak if it seeks to negotiate a cease fire with the fighters who have openly challenged the states authority and killed dozens of lebanese soldiers in the past three days that may leave the government torn between two politically risky options raid the refugee camps or let the fighting drag on since the assassination two years ago of lebanese businessman and politician rafik hariri lebanon a tiny country of four million split between shiite and sunni muslims christians and druse has been central to the bush administrations attempts to establish democratic governments in the middle east the lebanese government meanwhile has been struggling to keep the country afloat and to preserve a fragile peace left in place last august by a cease fire that ended the five week war between israel and hezbollah militants united nations troops remain in southern lebanon to provide a buffer between israel and hezbollah yesterday the showdown in tripoli wore on leaving at least a score of civilians dead and dozens of others wounded since it began and heightening tensions elsewhere in the country in the past three days two car bombs have exploded near upscale shopping centers in christian east and sunni west beirut causing widespread panic the incidents have helped to conjure fears of iraq style sectarian violence in palestinian refugee camps in southern lebanon residents protested the governments shelling of the nahr el bared camp in tripoli by burning tires and calling for an end to the violence in the small cramped enclave of the mar elias camp in beirut palestinian shopkeepers stood outside their shacks in the narrow winding roads muttering their anger at the lebanese army "its all the fault of the lebanese army they are killing our people our blood they are destroying their homes " said abu ibrahim a year old grocer in the camp palestinians have lived for decades in the camps which the lebanese government has treated as outside the jurisdiction of its military and security services lebanons palestinian population of about has long been a delicate and sometimes destabilizing factor in the countrys politics palestinian residents arent offered citizenship or given many of the basic rights of other foreigners living in lebanon they cant work travel outside the country or own property they live in increasingly crowded and hostile conditions in a dozen walled camps around the country militants have gained a foothold in many of the camps where weapons have also become plentiful there is a consensus among government factions that these weapons should be seized if they are carried outside the camps and restricted within them but little progress has been made in disarming the camps invading them would violate an agreement among arab countries that prohibits the host country from entering such camps which are also located in syria and jordan even beyond those prohibitions a raid would risk heavy military and civilian casualties and could quickly turn arab public opinion against the government "its a very precarious and extremely delicate situation for the government if they make one mistake the country could disintegrate " says rami khouri director of the issam fares institute for public policy and international affairs at american university of beirut last night after militants called a unilateral cease fire to allow humanitarian aid inside the tripoli camp thousands of palestinian families piled into the back of open trucks and cars with blown out windows and fled the area news footage showed women clutching their children and youngsters helping the elderly while waving white flags ambulances evacuated the wounded and carried out the bodies of the dead earlier in the day a u n relief convoy was hit as it tried to enter the camp during the early hours of the cease fire even before the showdown in tripoli lebanons openly pro western government was struggling the government swept to power after the assassination of mr hariri a former prime minister sparked protests that led to the end of lebanons long military occupation by syria which has been implicated in his death by a u n investigation the government has insisted on pushing forward with an investigation of the killing syrian president bashar assad views the probe which has already led to the jailing of pro syrian lebanese security officials as aimed at weakening his regime syria has denied any involvement in mr hariris death or the violence in tripoli but lebanese officials accuse syria of attempting to destabilize lebanon through its intelligence services and sunni militant groups in the palestinian camps the lebanese government is also in the grips of a political crisis that started last fall when shiite cabinet members resigned many of them are allied with the shiite group hezbollah whose militant branch did battle with israel last summer lebanons constitution explicitly calls for the government to be representative of all sects so the absence of shiites hampers the government in quelling the violence in tripoli so far hezbollah hasnt criticized the lebanese armys actions nor has it publicly supported the government it is also caught in a quandary it fears the growth of fundamentalist sunni movements in lebanon may lead to iraq style attacks against lebanese shiites but its leadership also worries that acceding to disarming the palestinians could call into question its own status as a well armed state within a state in lebanon for now lebanese public opinion remains strongly on the side of the government but the goodwill may not last if the conflict in tripoli drags on many lebanese expect the military to crack down hard on fatah islam the sunni extremist group involved in the fighting and already blame the government for not taking action before the crisis erupted the group an offshoot of a pro syrian palestinian faction is believed to be made up of several hundred fighters of various arab nationalities it has been able to overpower lebanese troops in close quarters fighting the lebanese government had known of fatah islams activities said misbah ahdab a member of parliament who represents tripoli he said that in parliamentary meetings many members of the government didnt consider the group a serious threat dismissing concerns about it as western inspired hype "now the situation is exploding and we are left pondering what to do " he said "the threat is the iraqization of lebanon " mr ahdab said the army has used of its total ammunition so far "we need our international friends to help us " he added lebanese prime minister fuad sinioras government this week asked the u s to provide an emergency shipment of military supplies to aid its fight against fatah islam no specific sum was requested said a senior lebanese official in washington but rather a list of specific munitions and military hardware the trouble in tripoli began saturday night when members of the militant group robbed a bank near the city of &# and a bag of blank checks the next day when lebanese forces attempted to arrest the robbers militants took positions in neighboring apartment blocks and ambushed the army killing more than soldiers the army struck back shelling the camp and engaging in the fiercest firefight since the lebanese civil war in the s the fighters have since retreated from city blocks into havens in nahr el bared jay solomon contributed to this article
