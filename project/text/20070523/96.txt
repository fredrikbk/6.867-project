plentyoffish owner has the perfect bait for a huge success the headquarters of what may be on a per capita basis the busiest most profitable site on the entire world wide web is on the th floor of a brand new vancouver building with panoramic views of the nearby canadian rockies it happens to be the apartment of year old markus frind the owner and sole employee of plentyoffish com a free online dating site and a model for the next generation of web entrepreneurship lots of people run web sites by themselves but its likely that no other solo venture runs at the scale of plentyoffish for the week ended april it was the th busiest web site in the u s according to the hitwise tracking service that means it has more traffic than some of the nets best known destinations such as apple com busy web sites like these usually require scores of people technicians certainly to keep the servers running but also programmers marketers and the rest mr frind says people often dont believe him when he says plentyoffish is all his i needed to see for myself so i spent an afternoon touring the companys roomy offices which most people would call a spare bedroom unless there is a team of programmers hidden down the hall or off in bangalore things are exactly as mr frind says they are mr frind was born in a small rural town in northern british columbia he headed to vancouver in the late s went to trade school in computers and rotated through several dot com jobs before starting plentyoffish in to keep himself busy the site was done without much of a plan though mr frind was intent on finding out how far he could get keeping it entirely free of charge most other dating sites charge anywhere between &# and &# a month for membership the site became popular in canada and later in the u s mr frind says he doesnt know exactly why there are now million active members hitwise says its one of the five busiest dating sites nielsen netratings says that by some measures such as the time its members spend on the site it ranks second after eharmony how does he do it in large part by keeping things simple the graphical design ranges from rudimentary to nonexistent no wonder since mr frind did it himself the site also wont win any j d power awards for customer support if you write in with a problem the odds are long about hearing back from either mr frind or his girlfriend annie kanciar who helps now and then answering emails the site runs on microsoft software on a half dozen machines at a hosting facility a few miles away from his bedroom though mr frind can keep tabs on everything going on when i was visiting last week he showed me the sites monitoring program people were at plentyoffish at that moment with web pages a second being sent out when you have that kind of traffic you can make money three ways via googles small text ads with bigger banner ads and through "affiliate marketing " where other sites pay you for sending them customers mr frind does all three and does very well a few months back he posted on his blog a picture of a check from google for nearly &# million for a two month period google confirmed the check was for real mr frind says the site brings in between &# million and &# million a year lest even more competitors get onto his success he declines to be more specific that puts him ahead of some of the webs best last year each google employee generated an average &# million in sales plentyoffish is the success that it is because of several converging web trends servers and server software have become simple and reliable enough that they can run on their own without a lot of babysitting whats more a remarkably sophisticated economic infrastructure now exists that allows busy web sites to make lots of money certainly enough for one person to live very well mr frinds consumption so far doesnt appear to be conspicuous his major indulgence is travel mr frind as one person can afford to give it away the big dating sites cant make enough just on google ads to do the same thing but the smaller sites can one small site hotornot com is dropping its monthly fees fashioning itself after plentyoffish an ascent of free sites could shake up the online dating scene which is already struggling with flattening growth in the u s nate elliott who follows online dating for jupiter research doubts the big web sites have anything to worry about from for free competitors mr frind disagrees he said his own traffic in canada has fallen lately as facebook the free social networking site has become more popular up north many companies would respond to that sort of competitive pressure by hiring someone say a strategic planner mr frind says he has no plans to do so he has nothing against employees he says and he insists he isnt a control freak instead he just enjoys the freedom to work on whatever part of the site interests him on a given day without having to fret about who else might be involved "no one else has ever done something like this before " he says "its like my own personal toy " email me at lee gomes wsj com
