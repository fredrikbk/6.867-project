avandia concerns reopen a wider debate the assertion that glaxosmithkline plcs widely used diabetes drug avandia is tied to a risk of heart attacks will reopen debate over a potentially valuable but problem plagued type of drugs avandia and the competing diabetes medication actos made by japans takeda pharmaceutical co are known as ppar drugs they work by affecting receptors in a cells nucleus that can affect a broad range of human genes ppar represents the name of the receptors which are called peroxisome proliferator activated receptors the upshot can be valuable treatment benefits for serious conditions such as diabetes but also an enormous range of sometimes unpredictable side effects that have sidelined many treatments before they reached the market among the companies still working on possible new ppar drugs are glaxo astrazeneca plc and closely held metabolex inc which has partnered with johnson &amp johnson "it is a challenging class of drugs " said robert meyer who heads the food and drug administration office that oversees diabetes medications "these are drugs with many effects and many targets" in the body on monday the new england journal of medicine released an analysis by cleveland clinic cardiologist steven nissen linking avandia to a potential risk of heart attacks glaxo has said it disagrees with the finding which it says is contradicted by data from sources the company considers stronger but analysts warned yesterday that concerns about safety could cut avandias sales in half the ppar drugs can target three different receptors in the cell nucleus avandia and actos which affect the ppar gamma receptor can bring down blood sugar and are used to treat diabetes a sister class called ppar alpha medicines which includes older drugs such as gemfibrozil and fenofibrate tends to boost hdl or "good " cholesterol and reduce triglycerides or fats in the blood a third type ppar delta drugs are seen as a prospective treatment for obesity the jackpot would be medications that combine more than one of these mechanisms the drugs also may hold potential in other areas glaxo is studying avandia for alzheimers disease bruce spiegelman a professor of cell biology at harvard medical school plans to examine a ppar gamma medication for cancer after "extremely good" data in animals "you have the potential to affect a lot of things and that can be good and that can be bad " he says of the ppar drugs but the drugs have a troubled history cancer in animals led to the termination of at least five drug programs merck &amp co killed mk which it was developing with kyorin pharmaceutical co after a rare form of cancer showed up in mice astrazeneca last year dropped the diabetes drug galida because of limited efficacy and after patients showed elevated levels of creatinine which can be a precursor to kidney problems according to an fda presentation at least two ppar drugs were killed because of a serious muscle condition pargluva from bristol myers squibb co and merck was turned back by the fda in over worries about cardiovascular problems some ppar drug side effects have surfaced after the drugs won fda approval rezulin from warner lambert co was withdrawn in after it was linked to liver failures this year takeda and glaxo informed doctors that actos and avandia were tied to a higher rate of bone fractures in women there is debate over why and whether avandia might increase heart attack risk yesterday republican sen charles grassley of iowa said there was a divide within the fda over how to place a warning about heart failure a different side effect in the avandia label an fda spokeswoman said the agencys position was "based on the data at hand and the input of our scientists" and it took the "most responsible steps possible to inform the public of what we know" and next steps drug companies say there may be ways to avoid some of the safety concerns that have derailed past efforts david b karpf chief medical officer of metabolex said that in tests of its mbx the company hasnt seen evidence of the swelling and weight gain tied to other ppar gamma drugs the metabolex drug is designed to affect a different set of genes and has a more gentle impact on them he said a glaxo spokeswoman said the british company is studying new ppar drugs in early stage development she said it was difficult to say whether such drugs are especially cursed with side effects "are there side effects in the ppar class yes compared to the conditions that diabetes can lead to blindness kidney failure and amputation we think the risk benefit profile of avandia is a very positive one " last year dropped the diabetes drug galida because of limited efficacy and after patients showed elevated levels of creatinine which can be a precursor to kidney problems according to an fda presentation at least two ppar drugs were killed because of a serious muscle condition pargluva from bristol myers squibb co

withdrawn in after it was linked to liver failures this year takeda and glaxo informed doctors that actos and avandia were tied to a higher rate of bone fractures in women so far it isnt clear why avandia might increase the risk of heart attacks if it does earlier studies had actually showed the drug might have a positive effect on some markers linked to heart problems underscoring the uncertainty european regulators strengthened warnings about avandias potential heart risk in the fall based on findings from a glaxo analysis the fda said it is still weighing contradictory evidence and hasnt put that analysis in the u s label drug companies say there may be ways to avoid some of the safety concerns that have derailed past efforts david b karpf chief medical officer of metabolex
