every business day sign up for the e mail here henry paulsons opening emphasis on american impatience in high level economic talks with china may have played well among some members of congress but theres little evidence the treasury secretarys chinese counterparts feel change is needed any faster than is good for china in his opening address to the periodically convened u s china strategic economic dialogue with vice premier wu yi and a host of other chinese delegates in the audience mr paulson generally avoided direct mention of the currency copyright piracy and other trade disputes dividing the trans pacific partners but as part of what he called the "open honest economic relationship" mandated by the sed he noted "there is a growing skepticism in each country about the others intentions unfortunately in america this is manifesting itself as anti china sentiment as china becomes a symbol of the real and imagined downside of global competition " and he reminded his guests who certainly know it as well as he does that while americans have many virtues "we are also impatient even the notion of a dialogue may seem too passive for americas action oriented ethic " the point of the talks he insisted is to produce action and not just words but despite threats of trade retaliation from capitol hill its not clear what kind of economic sticks the u s has available for pressuring beijing the u s is far and away the worlds most influential economy but chinas is rising fast and its importance for americans can be seen through its roles as both a major supplier of goods for an increasingly service oriented american economy and purchaser of u s government debt chinas economic influence has been growing in africa and the worlds petroleum producing regions it has long been viewed as an increasingly important buyer for european industry and the emerging investment role for its gargantuan foreign reserves suggests it will secure an unprecedented position in global finance the u s chinese equation isnt zero sum but american fortunes may be weakening at the same time beijings are getting better there are worries in asia the middle east and elsewhere that the u s has become an economic underachiever and the "weakest link in the global economy " as businessweek reports the international monetary fund went so far as to warn in its most recent world economic outlook that one of the biggest uncertainties is "whether the global economy will be able to decouple from the u s were the latter to slow down more sharply " and this in part explains why such a close american ally as kuwait feels the need to unhook its currency from the u s dollar as the persian gulf emirate announced sunday that link has been dragging down kuwaiti purchasing power as the dollar sank against the euro and other currencies and the move to sever that dinar dollar relationship is one other gulf countries are thought to be looking at as well most persian gulf oil producers long allied with a protective u s are moving closer to china and its neighbors a trend exemplified earlier this month by the east meets mideast conference in riyadh co hosted by saudi arabia and japan the actions of russian iranian and central asian players in the petroleum business have also raised questions about the dollar chinese leaders know they must reckon with congress and the delegation now in washington brought with it promises to buy "well over" &# billion in american goods as the wall street journal reports before it left beijing the central bank authorities there announced a three part package of economic policy changes that include slightly wider latitude for the yuan to trade against the dollar but that was deemed more symbolic than concrete among observers in washington who feel the currency situation still favors chinese exporters over americans and the more important monetary policy changes tighter reserve requirements for banks and higher interest rates address domestic concerns about an overheating economy the timing might have been less to do with the washington trip than with an emphasis on getting policy change out of the way well before next falls communist party conference on the political side washington remains in need of beijings support on iran north korea where this years nuclear program accord seems to have stalled and even lebanon the u s these days isnt in much of a position to tell china what to do new deals and strategies for u s on iraq the bush administration and democratic negotiators in congress are near to agreeing on a compromise over how to fund the war in iraq "president bush will accept as much as &# billion more in spending than he initially requested including a significant boost for domestic programs " as the wall street journal reports "in turn democrats will drop for now their insistence on a timeline for u s troop withdrawals and focus instead on setting political benchmarks for the iraqi government " the decision to back off the timeline requirement "was a wrenching reversal for leading democrats who saw their election triumph in november as a call to force an end to the war " the new york times notes "it was the first time since taking power in congress that the democrats had publicly agreed to allow a vote on war financing without a timetable for troop withdrawal " separately u s commanders and diplomats in iraq are near to finishing what half a dozen people with knowledge of the work describe as "a far reaching campaign plan for a new u s strategy laying out military and political goals and endorsing the selective removal of hardened sectarian actors from iraqs security forces and government " the washington post reports "the overarching aim of the plan which sets goals for the end of this year and the end of is more political than military to negotiate settlements between warring factions in iraq from the national level down to the local level in essence it is as much about the political deals needed to defuse a civil war as about the military operations aimed at quelling a complex insurgency said officials with knowledge of the plan " and five years after the u s led an invasion without u n backing the guardian reports that the white house is working on a plan to "internationalize" the war "including an expanded role for the united nations as a way of reducing overall u s responsibility for iraqs future and limiting domestic political fallout from the war as the election season approaches " ex rove aide may invoke fifth
