afterthought most media buyers couldnt see past the ratings among adults age to the networks target audience the cws season average trailed its closest broadcast competitor nbc by according to nielsen media research madison avenue is paying attention now the cw say a half dozen media buyers emerged from last weeks blitz of "upfront" sales presentations with a surprising measure of good buzz advertisers praised its slate of new shows and innovative ways to incorporate marketing messages "all of its new series look good " says brian hughes an audience analysis expert at interpublic groups magna global among the new series winning early kudos "gossip girl " the story of privileged new york city teens as seen through the eyes of a tell all blogger whom nobody can identify and "reaper " a comedic drama about a slacker who learns that his parents sold his soul to the devil when he was born because the cw is starting in such a hole when it comes to delivering viewers the network needs to work harder to attract marketers last season it created "content wraps " a new kind of ad in which commercial breaks feature mini shows built around products for september the cw is offering five second commercials designed to be purchased in clusters the network calls them "cwickies " the network has also gained the attention of media buyers for a new pop culture focused magazine series

is now stocking bill morningstar the cws executive vice president of network sales talks below about moving into his sophomore season why the network opted to schedule a show with no commercials and the web components that will accompany "gossip girl " the wall street journal what concerns did you hear from marketers about your first season mr morningstar the first year of the network was about
