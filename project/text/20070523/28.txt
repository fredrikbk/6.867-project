buying long why market optimists say this bull has legs they see decade of gain fed by global growth skeptics cite big doubts vernon smith a nobel laureate economist is so bullish on stocks that hes put money in small drug companies investments he "wouldnt have touched in the late s " he says louise yamada a longtime wall street market analyst sees the dow jones industrial average climbing to as part of a bull market that she compares with the post world war ii boom fritz meyer who develops investment strategy for aim investments a &# billion money management group in houston sees stock gains stretching as far as the eye can see a decadelong bull market is supposed to be a once in a generation rarity there was one in the s another in the s and a third in the s historically most bull markets have run their course in three or four years that means recent stock market highs notwithstanding the current one should be on its last legs but just seven years after the great bull market of the s thudded to a halt a small group of seasoned investors including some with no vested interest in selling stock believe the u s market is in the midst of another long period of gains this group of extreme optimists believes that global economic strength will keep shares rising for much longer than has been common in previous eras not only china and india but also japan western europe latin america and other parts of asia are feeding on one another such sentiments give traditionalist investors the shivers because they can signal that excess is percolating back into the market many cite yale economist irving fisher who shortly before the crash famously said "stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau " "whenever there is a market surge people invent new era stories to justify it " says robert shiller the yale economics professor who wrote "irrational exuberance " a book about the s stock bubble prof shiller and other skeptics worry that the headlong profit growth and rock bottom interest rates that have supported stocks are overdue to revert to average historical levels or worse and that bullish investors are wrong to extrapolate them far into the future the dollars sharp decline down against the euro since early october when the current bull market began could also have a damping effect if it continues to decline and erode shareholders gains investors could shift more heavily away from u s shares toward foreign stocks the bull cadre credits the federal reserves interest rate policy with sustaining the market advance by engineering an economic "soft landing" slowing growth to a manageable pace while staving off recession when stocks began to slide in may of last year and again in february experienced investors were surprised by the speed of their recovery as the combination of low world wide interest rates tame inflation and strong profits offset the stock weakness this adds up to a special time in market history says ms yamada the former head of technical research at citigroups brokerage arm who now runs louise yamada technical research advisors comparing the markets behavior with historical patterns the number of advancers and decliners for example or the duration and magnitude of gains she says that in april the market looked like it was primed to fall heavily instead it bounced back before it fell as much as which she attributes to the breadth of global economic strength "that is why i say it really is different this time " she says the growing market optimism helps explain the sustained rally that has driven stocks higher since last summer the standard &amp poors stock index closed at yesterday up since last june and almost back to the closing record of of march it has surged since bottoming in october having fallen from its peak the dow industrials less exposed to technology stocks than the s&amp p suffered less in the bear market and returned to record territory last october the blue chips closed at yesterday just off fridays record of the th record close in less than eight months but the nasdaq composite index which is dominated by technology stocks and lost the most of any major index in the bear market would have to nearly double to return to its old record it finished yesterday at a six year closing high but far from its march record close of the current market looks different from the last big run say those in the bull camp it has been led by laggards of the s including energy and commodity companies the s&amp p s approach to record territory this week has essentially been a round trip with big stocks retracing the ground lost since the old bull market ended stock prices have risen less rapidly than corporate profits meaning that the price of the overall market actually has fallen since when expressed in terms of corporate earnings leaving the market valued just a little above its historic average optimists also point out that the s&amp p is currently trading at about times its constituent companies earnings over the past months not much above the post war average p e ratio of and far below the high s the peak during the tech stock bubble prof smith knows a stock bubble when he sees one and he says he doesnt see one now the george mason university professors work on how individuals behave in simulated markets helped spawn a vast branch of economics for which he shared the nobel economics prize some of his experiments demonstrate how investors inflate market bubbles how the bubbles pop and how people behave afterward he has found that once investors inflate a bubble and endure a crash they are unlikely to repeat the mistake until memories fade in a lab setting almost any group of subjects including businessmen studying in an executive m b a program and professional stock traders will create a bubble if given adequate cash prof smith found in one experiment where participants could win small amounts of cash by trading successfully a participant called him over to complain that the market was running amok "he said what is this buying panic " prof smith recalls even so the investor returned to the fray "he waited a while then he started buying " prof smiths experiments show that participants typically inflate a large bubble cause a crash and then inflate a much smaller bubble followed by a much smaller decline after that they trade cautiously that helps explain the once a generation element of these extra long bull markets "once people get experienced it is very hard to reignite a bubble with those same people youve got to bring in novices and mix them in " prof smith says the professor who spent years at the university of arizona and still makes his home in tucson is something of an academic iconoclast when professors said economics was too complex to be tested in laboratory experiments he developed ways to do just that at years old he wears cowboy boots western clothing and hopi jewelry back in prof smith warned associates that the market was headed for trouble while he keeps most of his retirement savings in mutual funds he does some side investing and he says he avoided highflying technology stocks "like a disease " today things look different to him "there is reason to believe that this communications and technology revolution really has begun to impact firms and very broadly " he says activities that were once done within companies he says are being done more cheaply elsewhere in the world thanks to cheap communications prof smith does worry that stocks could pull back as productivity gains have slowed and investors have begun betting on federal reserve interest rate cuts "people are focusing too much on public policy and not enough on the fact that the economy has slowed " he says but he says he doesnt see this leading to the end of the bull run as in the late s or to a style crash confident in a long running bull market prof smith has invested in several small to medium size drug and biotechnology companies including palomar medical technologies inc ariad pharmaceuticals inc isis pharmaceuticals inc and sepracor inc he tries to buy stocks that he thinks are cheaply priced compared with their growth prospects and considers stocks such as these "much more reasonably priced today" than in the s prof smith says hes no better than the next guy in predicting the markets short term direction and he invests in speculative stocks only with money he can afford to lose unlike the s when bulls thought the u s market would post huge gains long into the future many of todays long term bulls expect modest gains driven by global growth ms yamada compares the global expansion now with the period during and after world war ii when the u s expanded industrial capacity to fight the war and then built roads bridges and factories in the peacetime victory boom "youve got a global build out today that corresponds to our domestic build out from to " says ms yamada citing industrial expansion in europe russia and the developing world as well as chinas preparation for the summer olympics the strong global economy has kept the u s economy out of recession she says and kept profits at u s companies stronger than they would normally have been even as interest rates have remained low if the analogy to the late s holds "we would have more than years still to run " ms yamada says nonetheless she and others see the possibility of sharp declines including even brief bear markets as occurred during the extended bullish periods from to and to catastrophic events a terrorist act or unforeseen economic breakdown in the developing world could knock stocks down so far however economic and political jolts in the past four years havent seriously disturbed u s markets since the u s invaded iraq neither the dow industrials nor the s&amp p have fallen as much as mr meyer the market strategist at aim investments in houston expects that a synchronized economic expansion world wide will send stocks higher "indefinitely until something comes along to knock it out of equilibrium " barring terrorist attacks or an economic implosion in a place like china or india he thinks annual gains will be in the range and could easily last beyond the end of the decade he sees the s and s as a comparable period "we had benign inflation and steady growth " he says and stocks rose strongly like many bulls mr meyer believes that the growth of the service economy which currently represents more than two thirds of u s business activity has flattened out business cycles making recessions rare and mild to richard sylla a professor of economics and financial history at new york university this strand of analysis borders on wishful thinking he points out that profit growth and interest rates are at exceptional levels and p e ratios are still above historical averages "a lot of these things revert to the mean " he says "there is a possibility that earnings will actually go down " pulling stocks down with them the current stock boom after all was built from the worst bear market for the dow industrials since the s and the worst for the s&amp p since the depression during that bear market investors fled stocks for gold other commodities florida condos and treasury bonds the dow industrials fell and the s&amp p plunged the nasdaq composite fell foreign markets have soared even more than those of the u s since then with tokyo up since the s&amp p bottomed on oct india up and shanghai up it is the global strength and the fact that the u s is no longer the only strong engine of world growth that has made many investors so hopeful and made the doubters worry about excess
