the evening wrap broken border bill online edition bipartisanship has been in rather short supply on capitol hill but an immigration reform package now has lawmakers on both sides of the aisle joining together in a chorus of complaint sensing peril as the senate continued debate on what is meant to be a compromise measure the white house issued a statement saying that the proposal "offers a much needed solution for our nations broken immigration system" and would deliver a process for those who arrive on american soil seeking to improve their fortunes that is "secure productive orderly and fair " president bush has frequently cited immigration as a priority for his administration but he had found few takers for what he has called his "comprehensive" approach to overhauling border policies especially among his fellow republicans when democrats captured control of congress last fall mr bush spotted an opening to press his immigration agenda and last week a breakthrough finally arrived but before the measures bipartisan group of supporters could finish patting themselves on the back colleagues from both sides of the aisle were already carping democrats worried a temporary worker program would ultimately create a permanent underclass and republicans said they didnt like the idea of allowing so many of the illegal immigrants who are already in the country to stick around the bills supporters strapped in for what promised to be a bruising debate on the measure this week some democrats failed yesterday in an effort to throw out the guest worker program which would permit up to workers a year to stay in the country for two or three years at a stretch to do construction landscaping and meatpacking jobs employers say they have a hard time finding americans to do but the senate voted this afternoon to cap the program at workers a year over the strong objections of the bush administration sen jeff bingaman the new mexico democrat who had pushed the change said before the vote that the bill in its original form anticipated "letting way too many people into this country" in an untested program republicans also offered up a slew of possible changes sen charles grassley wants to make it possible for visas to be revoked without a court review arguing that potential terrorists might be allowed to linger in the country if his suggestion wasnt adopted sen lindsey graham was expected to propose that those who cross the border illegally be given mandatory jail time presidential candidates from both parties piled on sen barack obama the democratic hopeful criticized a point system for evaluating future immigrants that he deemed "a radical experiment in social engineering" and vowed to try to flush it out of the legislation former new york city mayor rudy giuliani said the bill is a failure because it doesnt track everyone who crosses the border "if you make that the objective of your law you will clear up a lot of the confusion that presently exists both in our present immigration law and in what congress is trying to do right now which kind of goes in different directions without any central focus " he said former massachusetts gov mitt romney has also made his opposition abundantly clear "for those who are already here illegally let them apply at some point for permanent residency or citizenship but give them no advantage give them no special pathway " he told supporters at a fundraiser today sen john mccain one of the backers of the compromise bill defended it by saying it is necessary to combat terrorism greenspan comments

said that iran is enriching uranium in violation of demands from the united nations security council the report also said iran has stonewalled iaea efforts to investigate the program and thus the

unexplored aspects of the program the report could trigger further sanctions against iran as the latest security council deadline for compliance is tomorrow the white house said that the report was a

glaxosmithkline chief executive jean pierre garnier said that he thinks there has been an overreaction to new safety concerns about diabetes drug avandia and doesnt think the matter creates an insurmountable issue for the company the companys stock declined sharply after a prominent cardiologist published a paper earlier this week linking avandia to possible heart attack risks "i think its an overreaction to a publication which was actually quite sensibly written " dr garnier said at the london based companys annual meeting today "i think some people misunderstood what he was saying " he added referring to the papers author steven nissen of the cleveland clinic dr garnier said dr nissens analysis is only one piece in a body of research that overall shows that avandia is no riskier
