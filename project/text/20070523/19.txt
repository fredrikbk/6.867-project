british air sees iberia on horizon takeover would end string of stumbles boost consolidation in europe by joining a consortium led by u s private equity firm tpg to bid for spanish carrier iberia british airways plc is hoping to succeed where it has stumbled several times before over the past years british air has invested in or considered taking over at least six foreign carriers but because of long standing regulatory and cultural hurdles to cross border airline mergers the united kingdoms largest airline never got very far a takeover of iberia lineas aereas de espana sa may never get off the ground and a formal bid could take several months but a deal would mark a slow yet significant step forward in european airline consolidation after air frances purchase of klm royal dutch airlines and deutsche lufthansa ags buyout of swiss international air lines in british air said it joined tpg capital the buyout arm of tpg formerly texas pacific group and spanish investment groups vista capital de expansion inversiones ibersuizas sa and quercus equity "to investigate a possible consortium offer for iberia " the consortium will request to see iberias books and consider whatever benefits might come from a deal including the two airlines acting together british air is a crucial part of the potential bid because it owns of iberia and holds the right of first refusal to a further tpg made a preliminary billion euros &# billion offer for iberia at the end of march and then brought in the spanish partners any buyout would need a majority of iberias ownership and voting shares to remain in spanish hands because airlines are allowed to fly around most of the world based on treaties that depend on nationality if iberia werent majority owned by spaniards it could lose landing rights in latin america for example with their spanish foray british air executives will draw from experience investing in foreign carriers but many of these experiments have been less than fruitful underscoring the difficulties of cross border airline deals in the s when the european union allowed any eu carrier to operate from any airport in the bloc british air built regional carriers in france and germany hoping to draw traffic from those markets through london however british air later exited from both unprofitable operations in british air bid to acquire a stake in lot polish airlines from the polish government but lost out to swissair parent sairgroup which went bankrupt in british air in explored a merger with klm rekindling talks held a decade earlier in both cases regulatory complexities frightened british air investors british air also had false starts in the u s market in it invested &# million for nearly of us airways group inc hoping to deepen its ties in the american market british air sold its stake four years later for &# million and instead allied with amr corp s american airlines the worlds biggest carrier by traffic the alliance with american which involves no equity investments has been dogged by restrictions because regulators in both the u s and europe have argued that the carriers together unfairly dominate traffic between important u s cities and londons heathrow airport being part of a takeover for iberia would give british air access to the large market between europe and latin america the u s is the u k carriers primary foreign market british air and iberia have a joint venture for flights between britain and spain which is a huge tourist market with iberia british air would control major hub airports in london and madrid on the western edge of europe strategically linking north and south america to europe africa and the middle east by integrating their networks more closely the pair could grab traffic from rivals particularly among business travelers who must transfer at some point in their journey managers at air france klm sa say they have seen a big revenue boost from linking their hubs in paris and amsterdam moreover the regulatory hurdles that british air has faced over the years are diminishing the u s and the eu have both deregulated their internal markets and are starting to liberalize traffic between them however finding synergies between carriers in different countries can be tough because the opportunities to economize are limited by the physical requirements of staffing and operating multiple hubs air france klms cost savings have been smaller than its revenue gains so far managers have said british air also is grappling with internal issues even though british air chief executive willie walsh has said the airline wouldnt launch an independent bid for iberia and would devote only management resources to the deal this minimal commitment could burden british air mr walsh has pushed to slash management ranks in his months running the airline a british air spokesman said the carrier chose to work with tpg because the private equity group has extensive experience with airlines so british air wouldnt have to provide all the industry know how tpgs airline investments have included continental airlines inc in the u s and irelands ryanair holdings plc still british air is bracing for probable disruption from a planned move to a giant new terminal building at its hub at heathrow in march it also faces the prospect of new competition at heathrow beginning in april after the u s eu deregulation agreement comes into effect very few carriers may now fly between heathrow and the u s jason singer steve mcgrath and marietta cauchi contributed to this article
