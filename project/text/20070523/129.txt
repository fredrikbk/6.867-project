the china solar hotbed investors flock to ipos in the u s squint at the high valuations chinese solar power companies are descending on u s stock markets offering investors a new way into one of the fastest growing corners of the renewable energy industry but things arent all sunny the latest frenzy over chinese solar stocks was in evidence last week when nanjing based china sunergy co made its debut on the nasdaq stock market rising in its first day of trading on thursday its shares were up cents or to &# yesterday giving the company a market value of about &# million some investors are hoping for a repeat performance when two other chinese companies that make solar energy equipment ldk solar co and yingli green energy holding co list on the new york stock exchange in the next few weeks and a chinese company already on nyse trina solar has just filed for a secondary offering ldk is slated to list june and its initial public offering could raise as much as &# million which would make it the largest ipo by a mainland chinese company in the u s since the ipo boomlet reflects a growing interest in clean technology stocks and demand from investors for more plays on chinas economy the solar industry is being fueled by new government policies in the u s china and dozens of other countries wanting to boost alternative energy use chinese companies are now rising to the fore threatening rivals in the u s europe and japan and illustrating how chinas manufacturing advantages extend to the emerging clean technology industry "solar is a commodity and the only thing that matters is cost per watt " says jesse pichel a clean technology analyst at piper jaffray &amp co "this industry will ultimately be based in china for all the same reasons that cellphones and computers are made there " chinese solar stocks began to heat up in late when suntech power holdings co one of the worlds largest producers of photovoltaic cells listed on the big board the &# million ipo was the largest by a chinese company in the u s that year and the shares doubled in price in the first month before retreating in p m composite trading yesterday suntechs stock offered originally at &# was up cents to &# suntech which has a market value of about &# billion currently trades at about times projected per share earnings for according to cibc world markets since suntechs listing four other chinese solar companies have sold shares in the u s and several have racked up considerable gains all that activity raises concerns about a possible solar bubble "the excitement to some extent is warranted but some of the valuations are getting out of hand says jeff osbourne director of equity research at cibc on april he downgraded two new chinese stocks ja solar holdings co and solarfun power holdings co to "hold" from "buy" after their stocks passed his price targets analysts say many investors viewed suntechs initial success as a bellwether for the overall chinese solar industry but some newcomers mightnt be as well positioned to deal with current industry dynamics "the market doesnt yet separate winners and losers " piper jaffrays mr pichel says there are risks for investors piracy problems in china mean u s and european companies may be reluctant to outsource production of cutting edge solar technologies to chinese suppliers in addition tough competition could prompt chinese manufacturers to sacrifice margin in the quest for market share moreover solar power isnt a panacea for the worlds energy woes while the price has been dropping for decades solar is still significantly more expensive than power purchased from an electrical grid in most parts of the world and the industry relies heavily on government subsidies and right now the entire solar industry is battling a shortage of polysilicon a material used to convert sunlight into energy and that could weigh on some shares because silicon wafers account for about of the price of a solar panel the price companies pay for the material over the next several years will have a big impact on margins companies like suntech which have long term silicon supply contracts could pay lower rates than competitors that have to buy it on the spot market according to some analysts that is one factor brightening prospects for ldk the company contains costs by using recycled polysilicon which is relatively inexpensive to buy ldk makes silicon wafers a key ingredient in solar cells which in turn are used in solar panels ldk is expected to sell million ordinary shares about of the company at between &#

made some analysts cautious about the secondary offering by trina solar another integrated player the company released first quarter earnings monday which showed that operating margins fell to from in
