fcc tv havent we seen this tv sitcom before its the one in which politicians try to clean up the airwaves in the name of protecting children late last month the federal communications commission issued a report advocating more government regulation of tv programming the agency said "exposure to violent programming can be harmful to children" and that the v chip screening device now required in all u s made televisions is "not effective " the report urges congress to give the fcc more power to define and restrict objectionable content the agency also suggests congress might consider legislation compelling cable companies to sell programming on an "a la carte " or per channel basis rather than in packages senator jay rockefeller a west virginia democrat promptly thanked the fcc for its "meaningful guidance" and promised to introduce a bill incorporating some of the recommendations in the next few weeks the fcc says its authority to regulate tv violence derives from the supreme courts pacifica decision thats the george carlin "seven dirty words" ruling that upheld the agencys right to regulate broadcasts because there was no way to block what was coming into homes or car radios but that ruling says nothing about regulating cable and subsequent attempts to censor internet and video game content have been rejected by the courts on grounds that less restrictive alternatives are available unlike three decades ago content screening devices abound in todays media marketplace some of u s households subscribe to cable or satellite tv and both services provide conscientious parents with multiple filtering tools cable set top boxes allow homes to block unwanted programs by channel rating and title on the satellite side directv offers a "locks &amp limits" feature and the dish network has "adult guard " even if as the report found most households dont take advantage of the v chip that hardly translates into a public cry for in loco parentis federal intervention after all of households have no children under in residence and those that do often opt to monitor personally what their children watch rather than rely on technology the fccs inclusion of a la carte recommendations is especially troubling and not merely because it would constitute an unwarranted attempt by the government to dictate a private sector business model another problem is that a la carte pricing bears little relationship to the issue of violent television programming a la carte regulation is a pet issue of fcc chairman kevin martin and it helps such social conservative groups as the parents television council raise money but violence is a program by program matter not a network by network matter under an a la carte system a family with small children might choose to receive the history and discovery channels but what happens when the former airs violent war scenes or the latter shows sharks and lions feeding the report cites studies showing that parents in the u s are deeply concerned about violence on tv that may be true but its difficult to square with another of the reports findings which is that nearly of children have a tv in their bedroom either mom and dad arent as concerned about the issue as policy makers and special interest groups would like or they have things in better perspective see related letter "letters to the editor the cartel that gives us tv filth and gore" wsj may
