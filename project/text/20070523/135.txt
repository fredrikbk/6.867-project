violent standoff risks splintering fragile lebanon fighting adds pressure on central government a weapons plea to u s beirut lebanon the violent showdown raging between the lebanese military and sunni muslim extremists has escalated into a major test of the governments ability to control the country and prevent a wider conflict that could plunge it into civil war the lebanese government faces an excruciating dilemma in the northern city of tripoli the scene of the fighting lebanese troops have been unable to defeat the militants who are well armed and hiding in palestinian refugee camps which are off limits to the lebanese military but the government risks being perceived as weak if it seeks to negotiate a cease fire with the fighters who have openly challenged the states authority and killed dozens of lebanese soldiers in the past three days that may leave the government with two politically dangerous options raid the refugee camps or let the fighting drag on since the assassination two years ago of lebanese businessman and politician rafik hariri lebanon has been central to the bush administrations attempts to establish democratic governments in the middle east the assassination ended the countrys long military occupation by syria which has been implicated in mr hariris death by a united nations investigation it also swept an openly pro western government into power that has insisted on pushing forward with an investigation of the hariri killing syrian president bashar assad has viewed the investigation which has already led to the jailing of pro syrian lebanese security officials as aimed at weakening his regime syria has denied any involvement in mr hariris death or the violence in tripoli but lebanese officials accuse the syrians of attempting to destabilize lebanon through their intelligence services and the sunni militant groups in the palestinian camps yesterday the confrontation between sunni extremists and the government continued leaving at least a score of civilians dead and dozens of others wounded since it began and spawning other signs of trouble in the past three days two car bombs have exploded near upscale shopping centers in christian east and sunni west beirut causing widespread panic in other palestinians refugee camps in southern lebanon residents protested the shelling of the tripoli camp by burning tires and calling for an end to the violence in the small cramped enclave of the mar elias camp in beirut palestinian shopkeepers stood outside their shacks in the narrow winding roads muttering their anger at the lebanese army "its all the fault of the lebanese army they are killing our people our blood they are destroying their homes " said abu ibrahim a year old grocer in the camp palestinians have lived for decades in the camps which the lebanese government has treated as outside the jurisdiction of its military and security services lebanons palestinian population numbering about has long been a delicate and sometimes destabilizing factor in the countrys politics and security palestinian residents arent offered citizenship or given many of the basic rights of other foreigners living in lebanon they cant work travel outside the country or own property they live in increasingly crowded and hostile conditions in a dozen walled camps around lebanon militants have gained a foothold in many of the camps where weapons have also become plentiful there is a consensus among government factions that these weapons should be seized if they are carried outside the camps and restricted within them but little progress has been made in disarming the camps invading them would violate an agreement between arab countries that prohibits incursions by the host country into the camps which are also located in syria and jordan even beyond those prohibitions entering the camp would risk heavy military and civilian casualties and could quickly turn arab public opinion against the government "its a very precarious and extremely delicate situation for the government if they make one mistake the country could disintegrate " says rami khouri director of the issam fares institute for public policy and international affairs at american university of beirut last night after militants called for a truce to allow humanitarian aid inside the tripoli camp thousands of palestinian families piled into the back of open trucks and cars with blown out windows and fled the camp television news footage showed women clutching their children and youth assisting the elderly while waving white flags ambulances evacuated the wounded and carried out the corpses of the dead earlier in the day a u n relief convoy was hit as it tried to enter the camp during the early hours of the cease fire even before the showdown in tripoli the lebanese government had been struggling with a political crisis that started last fall when shiites cabinet members resigned in protest many of the resigning cabinet are allied with the shiite group hezbollah which also has a militant branch that fought the israelis in last summers war the countrys constitution explicitly calls for the government to be representative of all sects so the absence of shiites further hampers the government in resolving the current battle crisis so far hezbollah hasnt criticized the lebanese armys actions nor has it publicly supported the government the group issued a statement yesterday warning that the army has entered a confrontation that serves the agenda of others alluding to reports that sunni political groups may have had a hand in financing sunni extremists to counterbalance hezbollahs power hezbollah is also caught in a quandary it fears the growth of fundamentalists sunni movements in lebanon may lead to iraq style attacks against lebanese shiites but its leadership also worries that acceding to disarming the palestinians could call into question its own status as a well armed state within a state in lebanon "its true that palestinian camps are a ticking bomb " said retired brig gen amin hotait "but we should still not go after them because it will tear our country to pieces " for now lebanese public opinion remains strongly on the side of the government and against the militants it is fighting in tripoli but the goodwill may not last if the fighting drags on many lebanese expect the military to crack down hard and already blame the government for not taking action before the crisis erupted the lebanese government has been aware of the activities of fatah islam the sunni extremist group said misbah ahdab a member of parliament who represents tripoli the group is a split off of a pro syrian palestinian faction the group believed to be made up of several hundred fighters of various arab nationalities has been able to overpower the lebanese military forces in close quarters fighting mr ahdab said that in parliament meetings many members of the government didnt take the threat posed by fatah islam seriously dismissing it as western inspired hype "now the situation is exploding and we are left pondering what to do " says mr ahdab "the threat is the iraqization of lebanon " mr ahdab said the army has spent of its total ammunition so far "we need our international friends to help us " he said facing depletion of its supplies and equipment lebanese prime minister fuad sinioras government this week asked the u s to provide an emergency shipment of military supplies to aid its fight against fatah islam no specific sum was requested said a senior lebanese official in washington but rather a list of specific munitions and military hardware trouble began on saturday night when members of the militant group robbed a bank near tripoli of &# and a bag of blank checks the next day when lebanese forces attempted to arrest the robbers militants took positions in neighboring apartment blocks and ambushed the army killing more than soldiers the army struck back shelling the camp and engaging in the fiercest firefight since the lebanese civil war in the s the fighters have now retreated from city blocks into safe havens in the nahr el bared palestinian camp jay solomon contributed to this article
