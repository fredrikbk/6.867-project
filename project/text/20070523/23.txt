business wall streets capital crisis moves to back burner six months ago treasury secretary henry paulson went to new york and delivered a battle cry for defending wall streets global competitiveness last week that cry faded to a faint whine mr paulsons speech to the economic club of new york in november cited the sharp drop in initial public offerings of shares on new york stock exchanges as a sign that u s capital markets were in trouble he fingered excessive litigation "complex and confusing" regulation and an accounting system more focused on "rules" than "principles" as the culprits u s capital markets face "significant challenges " he said and he vowed "to accomplish as much as possible over the next two years " subsequently three blue ribbon committees have offered solutions to wall streets competitiveness problem one of them organized by harvard professor hal scott was informally if not entirely accurately dubbed the "paulson committee " because of the strong backing the treasury secretary gave it when launched the treasury followed up in march with an all star conference that included superinvestor warren buffett former treasury chief robert rubin and general electric ceo jeffrey immelt then last week came the dull denouement the treasury announced it was creating yet another study committee as if the previous three hadnt been enough and it named former securities and exchange commission chairman arthur levitt as co chairman along with former sec chief accountant don nicolaisen mr levitt has told anyone who asked that hand wringing about wall streets competitiveness is as he delicately puts it "absolute garbage " there may be some machiavellian strategy here im missing mr levitts new committee has a narrow mandate to strengthen the accounting industrys financial soundness perhaps mr paulson sees this as a harmless way to bring the outspoken mr levitt onto the team and to soften his criticisms if so its not clear the ploy is working at an event sponsored by the council on foreign relations in new york last week which was held after mr levitt agreed to head the new committee but before the committee was publicly announced the former sec chief feistily attacked most of the major recommendations of the so called paulson committee "the ipo issue is a nonissue " he declared treasury undersecretary robert steel who is shepherding the treasury effort says the levitt committee is just one part of a larger plan to address the competitiveness problem he correctly cites recent sec efforts to ease some of the burdens of the sarbanes oxley corporate accountability law and to allow u s businesses to adopt international financial standards as significant changes and he promises more to come moreover mr steel says winning over critics is essential in a washington where both parties share power "we want to get as much done as we can " he says "but we also want durable accomplishments which require consensus building " but with the election rapidly devouring all available bandwidth in washington the latest action or inaction suggests the capital markets competitiveness crisis is now moving to a back burner mr paulsons early comments created expectations that have proven difficult to meet particularly at a time when partisanship is high and the presidents approval ratings are low of course it was never that much of a crisis to begin with wall street moguls made much of the statistic that only one of the largest ipos in occurred in the u s but that oft cited statistic provided a pretty narrow and misleading window on wall streets overall health moreover it was distorted by the fact that some of the largest ipos were former state owned enterprises in china and russia that listed elsewhere for nationalist reasons and that might have had a hard time meeting u s listing standards anyway last week mr steel himself cited a compelling set of numbers showing that the u s financial markets remain "second to none " forty five percent of global mutual fund assets are in the u s compared with in europe and in asia of the &# trillion in global hedge fund assets &# trillion reside in the u s eighty percent of outstanding foreign exchange derivatives last year were in the u s dollar the number of futures contracts traded on exchanges in the u s last year was times as many as traded in europe and five times as many as traded in asia and then theres the statistic mr steel didnt cite the size of this years wall street bonuses including at goldman sachs where both messrs paulson and steel worked mr paulsons successor there lloyd blankfein and his two deputies each received more than &# million in compensation for the year that alone should make it clear wall street isnt yet detroit alan murray welcomes reader questions and will respond at wsj com talkingbusiness
