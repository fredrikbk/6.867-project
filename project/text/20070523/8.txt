ahead of the tape focus on target misses mark on consumers investors might take todays results from big retailer target corp as a sign that consumers are out of their funk but they would risk missing the mark last month was tough all around at the malls warm weather in march gave way to the coldest april in years which left springtime offerings languishing on store shelves moreover an early easter pulled sales of marshmallow peeps into march still sales were so weak that investors have been wondering whether something more was going on the dow jones industrial averages biggest one day loss in the past month came two weeks ago when most retailers reported april sales investors might take some comfort from target which reports results today it has already said it expects may sales at stores open a year or more to be to ahead of their year earlier level same store sales fell in april analysts also expect target to report quarterly earnings per share rose excluding one time items other retailers are probably seeing sales rebound too in may but it would be a bad bet to conflate their fortunes with targets the company is operating in a retailing sweet spot right now wal mart stores low end consumers tend to get hit hard by rising gasoline prices target is better positioned because it has been unusually adept at identifying trends and picking merchandise while its prices are low nobody is ever embarrassed that they shop there when high gasoline prices drive away some of its low income customers other customers will come in from higher price stores if consumers are in trouble it will be other retailers not target that feel it first momentum gauge offers perspective on s&amp p as the s&amp p stock index flirts with a record investors need to take stock of its momentum one way to do that is to track how far the big cap index is trading above its average closing during the previous trading days or about nine months the relationship between the index today and its longer run average is one back of the envelope method for weighing the markets short term momentum against its longer term trend "whenever you have an index make a new high the next question you have to ask is where does this fit within the markets overall pattern " says phil roth chief technical strategist at new york trading firm miller tabak in a rising market the index is above its moving average but its unusually high now the s&amp p is roughly above its day moving average of thats the widest spread since early when the index traded about above the day average just before it entered a six month long downturn according to mr roth the further the index gets above its long term average the more likely it is that a downturn is coming because stocks tend over time to revert to their average prices that doesnt mean the index cant stretch further the s&amp p traded as high as above the day moving average in february more than three years before the bull market ended in march scott patterson send comments to justin lahart wsj com or scott patterson wsj com
