how obscure law school places grads at top firms law students starting summer jobs at the new york office of a prominent national law firm come largely from the usual places harvard yale columbia new york university and some local schools then theres keith marlowe of the university of detroit mercy school of law last fall mr marlowe applied for summer work at u s firms and got no offers but the calgary alberta native had an ace in the hole private interviews arranged by his law school with some of the countrys biggest firms including paul hastings janofsky &amp walker llp which offered the year old a job paying about &# a week in the stratified world of law educational pedigree largely dictates where students will get a look firms want to signal to clients and colleagues that they only hire the best as firms have grown and competition for junior lawyers has intensified some firms have dipped below the ivies and their equivalents nonetheless a student from a school like detroit mercy firmly in the cellar of u s news &amp world reports rankings of accredited law schools hasnt stood a chance at the fancy firms but thanks to some masterful marketing by detroit mercys dean mark c gordon top students at the school are now gaining entree to the big leagues in the last two years a half dozen students have been hired for summer or full time jobs at firms like mayer brown rowe and maw llp firms such as skadden arps slate meagher &amp flom llp and fried frank harris shriver &amp jacobson llp now include detroit mercy in their select on campus interview circuit a first time dean and harvard law grad mr gordon got his school on the radar of the top tier firms by enlisting a stable of big time private practice lawyers to join an advisory board thats now some members strong his pitch help detroit mercy improve its third year curriculum by creating a required set of courses that simulate real life practice attorneys quickly suited up for the cause when they arrived in detroit for twice a year meetings starting in mr gordon made sure they not only helped remake the schools coursework but also inspected his top second year students during private interviews as well as others who were trotted out to give presentations on everything from trial advocacy to interpreting statutes after last months meeting about first year students handpicked by professors were allowed to mingle with the board the idea of focusing the curriculum on practice resonated with the lawyers in fact many have long complained that law school devotes too much attention to theory and leaves students unprepared to practice even as the market demands that firms pay new hires high salaries from day one many students are also no fans of the third year of school feeling its a repeat of the same kind of work analyzing cases that they did in the first two years students "arrive and they dont know where they fit in how to draft an escrow a merger agreement " says jonathan j lerner a corporate partner at skadden arps who is on the detroit mercy board while some schools like columbia law school have coursework oriented to law firm practice its generally not required stanford law school offers a few elective "deals" type courses but the school is emphasizing new joint j d masters degrees in which a law student for example would also study bioengineering transaction simulation classes are an "inefficient way to learn content" says stanford law school dean larry kramer who recommends students take no more than one or two of them from mr gordons vantage point if the practical coursework and advisory board help his students get a top job its fine with him "its one thing to come out of harvard yale stanford and be going to some of these firms and its another to come out of a school that doesnt have that pedigree " says allan b moore a partner at covington &amp burling who recently joined the detroit mercy board "mark is taking the ivory tower out of it " founded in and located in a three story building across from general motors headquarters detroit mercy has an entering class of students and is sponsored by two roman catholic groups the society of jesus and the sisters of mercy of the americas most graduates go into private practice primarily in the greater detroit area the year old mr gordon raised in white plains n y never expected to be a dean after graduating from harvard law school in he worked at new york law firm hughes hubbard &amp reed llp and later at the department of housing and urban development before teaching public affairs for six years at columbia university in late on a flight to maine to visit his grandmother mr gordon started talking with the director of a public policy institute at the university of southern maine who was seated next to him by the end of the flight she had encouraged him to apply to be dean of the universitys public policy school he didnt get the job but the idea intrigued him he applied to a handful of public policy and law schools that had openings and in he got a callback from detroit mercy the idea of going to work at a low ranked school "was a positive factor " he says "its the schools that are not as well known that are most open to change " mr gordon and his wife a structural engineer bought a red brick colonial style home two blocks past the detroit city line in grosse pointe and moved there with their two young sons in the new dean wanted to "integrate the realities of law practice in the classroom" and developed the idea further with faculty he also called more than alumni and practicing detroit lawyers to ask their opinions about what the school should be doing through in house lawyers at auto maker daimlerchrysler and auto parts company delphi mr gordon contacted partners at prominent national firms most of whom had never heard of the school and reached out to a handful of harvard law school classmates to set up his board after receiving an unexpected call from mr gordon last year thomas e kruger a partner at paul hastings agreed to meet the dean for breakfast near his law office in midtown manhattan convinced he would say "no" to whatever mr gordon was asking for instead a half hour meeting turned into an hour and a half and the partner signed on to the advisory board mr kruger is now in charge of providing documents from actual cases redacted for use in the new curriculum known as the law firm program which lets students handle a complex case or transaction as if they were part of a large law firm each course focuses on a different department in a typical corporate firm such as real estate intellectual property white collar crime or antitrust law after a pilot program this past semester all third year students will be required to take at least two courses in the program prior to joining the board mr kruger had personally recruited only at harvard his alma mater now he has added detroit mercy as a second stop having nine top national firms conduct on campus interviews at detroit mercy is a coup for the school and a critical step toward building an institutional pipeline into the firms so far detroit mercys successes havent raised its stock in the u s news rankings which weigh such factors as percentage of graduates employed after graduation scores on the law school admission test and the bar exam passage rate the michigan bar exam passage rate for detroit mercy students was below the state average for the summer exam but last summer it rose to the average for the state "we were in the fourth tier before i was hired and thats where weve remained " mr gordon says he adds that hes more concerned about the students education and job prospects placing students at high paying jobs in the top firms can do more than add prestige to a school like detroit mercy later in life successful graduates may be able to afford to give back says ken hemler a year old detroit mercy law student from warren mich who got a job starting in the fall at shearman &amp sterling llp in new york "i plan on being on the hall of fame donors list if they have one "
