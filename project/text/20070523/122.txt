the daily fix to celebrate win over detroit disneyland is going to ottawa online edition after nhl seasons teemu selanne is finally going to his first stanley cup final mr selanne and his anaheim ducks held off a furious detroit red wings rally to win last night and clinch the western conference championship in six games mr selanne traded away from anaheim just before the clubs surprising appearance in the finals "feared that he would never play for the stanley cup that the opportunity to have his name etched on the distinctive trophy would be a regret he would brood about someday through the long winters of his native finland " helene elliott writes in the los angeles times the finnish veteran and his teammates were better not lucky ms elliott adds "they proved they can win on the road taking two of three games at joe louis arena they also proved they have the grit to match their talent taking the smallest of openings against the top seeded red wings and turning them into big achievements " detroit news columnist bob wojnowski checks in with the view from the losers side "this probably has a familiar feel to the wings and their fans that horrible notion of opportunity lost but this was different the wings went home after other playoff failures wondering if they had what it took to win it all this team heads home knowing it had a chance to win the stanley cup a good chance and left it withering " anaheim will face ottawa in the finals but dont look for canadians to rally behind the senators as they did for the edmonton oilers last year james mirtle writes on his hockey blog he explains that toronto maple leafs fans loathe the sens "this year that hardcore element has entered the witness protection program hunkering down with their various prayer books and voodoo dolls and hoping like hell that what looks like might happen doesnt come to fruition" namely an ottawa victory mr mirtle writes "the ratings certainly bear that out so no there will be no parades down yonge street should ottawa win the stanley cup not even by the small senators backing contingent in this city itd be suicide " in a follow up post today mr mirtle explains why the leagues crummy u s television deal will delay the start of the finals until monday meaning ottawa will have eight full days off and the season could end in balmy june "which as we weve all come to learn is the best possible month to play for hockeys ultimate prize " two years ago liverpool trailed at halftime of its champions league final against heavily favored ac milan and one of its players feared an eventual five or six goal loss instead liverpool scored three times in the second half to force extra time and won the match on penalty kicks to secure its fifth and least likely european club championship in most sports leagues teams that suffer devastating defeats have a chance to avenge them the next season but in the champions league dozens of teams from across the continent play each season making a finals berth a most elusive prize and a finals rematch a near impossibility yet this afternoon milan will have its chance to avenge that loss in istanbul in facing liverpool again in the final with seven of their starters from that fateful day still on the active roster "time does not heal the hurt of a player who thought he had the battle won and in the eyes of the public blew it as never before " rob hughes writes in the international herald tribune both sides feature defenders who joined their current clubs as children jamie carragher isnt liverpools best player but hes a local hero simon barnes writes in the times of london "it is a fact in football that only fans are loyal players change clubs managers change clubs even chairmen change clubs but when they find that rare thing a loyal player he is cherished as no ephemeral superstar ever can be carragher joined liverpool as a youth in and he has been a liverpool player since he is and at the peak of his powers moving from a slightly rackety past to become the most solid of citizens " milans paolo maldini has been with his organization for years since he was and has won four of milans six champions league titles the guardians richard williams ends his paean to mr maldini with this comment from his subject about his son "christian isnt yet so hes only playing the game for fun i wont push him but if it turns out that he wants to be a professional footballer i can only hope that he has the same kind of life that ive had " despite the presence of mr maldini "the very embodiment of la bella figura " in the words of mr williams there is cause for the neutral observer to root against milan frank dunne writes in the independent he reviews milans role in the sorry italian match fixing scandal and why the club escaped punishment in champions league rob hughes meanwhile does fix double duty in explaining why all observers neutral and otherwise should root against penalty kicks deciding this match as they did the final he was appalled to see them needed to settle sevillas defeat of espanyol in an otherwise exciting uefa cup final the nit to the champions leagues ncaa on saturday "bereft of any just way of ending a noble stalemate we contrive an ending that makes heroes and fall guys to set before the spectators and the millions of television viewers " mr hughes writes at least tied soccer games arent decided by randomly bouncing ping pong balls after that system failed to grant a top three pick in the nba draft to any of the leagues three worst teams si coms marty burns argues that the system needs tweaking "to give hope to fans in suffering cities that their teams fortunes can turn around in a relatively short period of time " hope was in short supply in memphis and boston where the two worst franchises both failed to land a top two pick and a shot at greg oden or kevin durant "the celtics continue to suffer the wrath of powerful unseen forces determined to make their lives miserable " bob ryan writes in the boston globe sportslines gary parrish reports from a memphis draft lottery party that turned into "the type of place where people were openly discussing suicide yes it was that bad women cried men cursed " the oden durant winners appear to be pacific northwest rivals and recently successful franchises portland and seattle who nabbed the nos and picks respectively oregonian columnist john canzano reflects on "all the suffering and carnage in the recent franchise past and in turn all the deserving fans who finally got a wonderful moment to call their own " and jerry brewer writes in the seattle times "its impossible not to dream right now the most important offseason in sonics history just received some desperately desired luck " tim duncan the first pick in the draft has helped the san antonio spurs win three titles and may be on his way to a fourth with the spurs up in their series against the jazz after last nights victory "the nba lottery can mean everything and it can mean nothing " buck harvey writes in the san antonio express news "the nba lottery can bring you duncan and a decade of sellouts or in the spurs case mostly sellouts and it can bring you kwame brown or worse " far below oden durant territory and beneath his four florida teammates in the draft pool resides lee humphrey who made precisely of three point shots in each of the gators two championship seasons mr humphrey doesnt even place in espn coms top player list orlando sentinel writer dave curtis profiles the lone gators starter who will earn his degree this spring and who stood apart from his teammates in several ways yet established championship chemistry with them tip of the fix cap to readers garey g ris and ben saydah found a good column from the world of
