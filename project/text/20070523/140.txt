vision therapies draw backers venture capitalists are bankrolling drug makers taking aim at a blinding disease that is incurable today nearly two million u s citizens suffer vision loss because of age related macular degeneration or amd according to the national eye institute and millions more are believed to be at risk for developing the condition which is the leading cause of blindness in people older than years of age the disease takes two forms dry and wet though treatments exist for the aggressive wet version there isnt a drug for the slow moving dry variety which accounts for of all cases venture firms seek to profit from findings into what causes the dry type in march aisling capital led a &# million financing for one such company sirion therapeutics inc while masa life science ventures lp and individuals put &# million into another potentia pharmaceuticals inc with baby boomers entering their s venture investors say an effective dry amd drug would be a blockbuster they are encouraged by the venture capital payoff from eyetech pharmaceuticals inc which has a drug for the wet form in which leaky blood vessels invade the back of the eye eyetechs macugen which inhibits vessel formation earned u s approval in and propelled the company to an initial public offering that year eyetechs valuation increased from &# million following its final venture capital round in to &# million after its initial public offering according to ventureone a research unit of dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal osi pharmaceuticals inc in acquired eyetech which had raised venture backing from alta partners and sv life sciences advisers llp among others osi paid about &# million in cash plus million shares for eyetech recreating that success on the dry side could be difficult with wet amd it is clear that stopping leaky vessels from forming slows the disease despite recent advances there isnt a consensus on the best way to attack the dry form that means investors must choose from several unproven strategies some venture capitalists say the size of the opportunity justifies the risk now that there are treatment options for the wet form "the next logical progression is to think about dry amd " says lutz giebel managing partner at sv life sciences all patients start with the dry form in which light sensitive cells in the macula the portion of the retina used for sharp straight ahead vision die over many years about of patients also develop the complication in which leaky blood vessels spill blood and fluid into the retina which can destroy vision in a matter of months although advanced amd seldom causes total blindness most patients keep their peripheral vision it makes tasks like reading and recognizing faces difficult or impossible for years little was known about what initiates the dry version or how it causes cells to die as a result no drugs are approved in the u s for the dry form though national eye institute studies show that high dose oral vitamin and zinc supplements may slow progression from intermediate to advanced dry amd in some patients evidence has emerged that a faulty immune system response is at work scientists have found that variations in genes for complement proteins which work in concert with antibodies to fight infection influence risk two start ups potentia of louisville ky and optherion inc of new haven conn have sprung up to develop treatments based on these findings potentias drug in an early clinical trial is designed to quell the complement activation system that leads to inflammation and tissue damage potentia is raising &# million to finance a middle stage trial next year says chief executive cedric francois in middle trials a drug is provided to actual patients to test for safety and efficacy if the middle trial is successful it is followed by a late stage trial or a large study to confirm the middle stage results if the late trial is successful companies can file for fda approval for the drug optherion a start up co founded by biotech entrepreneur david scheer is putting together a &# million first round of funding to develop diagnostics and drugs based on the role of complement proteins but it isnt disclosing details others hope to quiet the immune response through other means david weber chief executive of macusight inc a union city calif company that has raised about &# million since says a drug used to prevent organ transplant rejection rapamycin may keep dry amd from progressing the company has secured intellectual property covering the use of this drug in the eye macusight with &# million in financing in its latest round in august is considering clinical studies to see if the drug can stop dry amd patients from developing the wet version it may launch a separate study to determine if it can prevent dry amd from transforming into an advanced form called geographic atrophy this severe stage of dry amd is linked to vision loss and thinning and discoloration of the macula othera pharmaceuticals inc is betting that overactivity of a particular protein nuclear factor kappa b is largely to blame the exton pa company has raised &# million and is raising &# million more in financing expected to close by the end of june says philip heifetz vice president financing and business development othera is poised to begin a person middle stage study for a drug targeting the overexertion of this molecule in geographic atrophy patients according to mr heifetz the drug reduces inflammation and harmful oxidative stress caused by oxygen free radicals he says a challenge for all companies is getting the drug into the back of the eye wet amd therapies like eyetechs macugen and a newer product genentech inc s lucentis are injected into the eye every few weeks while that is inconvenient and invasive patients tolerate it because they are swiftly losing their sight through an agreement with osi pfizer inc has rights to market macugen outside the u s meanwhile novartis ag has partnered with genentech to gain the right to market lucentis outside the u s experts say dry amd patients wouldnt put up with frequent shots which pose a small but serious risk for infection macusights drug is administered underneath the clear membrane covering the white of the eye but doesnt penetrate the eyes interior reducing risk of infection according to mr weber who says a single administration may suffice for six months to months otheras compound is given through an eye drop although most drugs taken through eye drops would be washed away before they reach the retina mr heifetz says preclinical research shows otheras drug to be an exception because it would be patient friendly even those with early amd will want to use the drug he added it might also be possible to treat advanced dry amd with an oral therapy sirion is enrolling participants in middle stage studies for a systemic geographic atrophy treatment the drug fenretinide reduces levels of a toxic vitamin a byproduct called ae thought to cause cell death in geographic atrophy says barry butler chief executive of the tampa bay fla company one enticing aspect of this market for investors is that retinal specialists prescribe and administer treatments since only about of them operate in the u s a small company could sell its drug without help from a corporate partner that is what sirion plans to do "we are a marketing organization there are no plans to out license " mr butler says a product under development by neurotech pharmaceuticals inc might improve vision regardless of what caused the disease the lincoln r i company which raised &# million last year has an implantable device that releases the protein ciliary neurotrophic factor which helps protect macula cells and may even rescue those that are dying says chief executive ted danse middle studies in late stage dry amd are under way
