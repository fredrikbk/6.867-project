politics &amp economics u s presses for results from china talks paulson warns action is needed on currency trade washington with congress breathing fire over beijings trade and currency practices treasury secretary henry paulson warned china that this weeks top level economic talks must produce concrete results if trans pacific tensions are to ease just as the chinese opened the last round of talks in beijing in december by lecturing americans about how little they understand china mr paulson took the podium yesterday to explain that americans are an "impatient" people who demand quick changes in chinese economic policies that they consider unfair "even the notion of a dialogue may seem too passive for americas action oriented ethic " he told the large chinese delegation "it is up to us over these two days and in the work that follows to show that words are precursors to action " mr paulson and his chinese counterpart vice premier wu yi designed the talks called the strategic economic dialogue as a way to build long term understanding across a range of contentious issues from copyright piracy and environmental protection to commercial air routes and u s controls over exports of advanced technology but mr paulson has come under increasing congressional and public pressure to secure significant and quick concessions from the chinese nonetheless expectations for this weeks talks were low and midway through the first day the u s dispatched commerce secretary carlos gutierrez to lower them even further "i wouldnt want to be judged by specific outcomes or specific details " he told reporters u s officials did predict an agreement to reduce barriers to american sales of clean coal technology to china but the u s side has been frustrated in its efforts to negotiate a full liberalization of air travel between the two countries chinese airlines are apparently worried they would lose out in head to head competition with american carriers "china has instead proposed to incrementally expand carrier rights and to begin negotiations by a date certain on a timetable resulting in full liberalization " according to a progress report prepared by the office of u s trade representative susan schwab as of last night the two sides were still at odds over whether china would allow american firms to hold larger stakes in chinese banks and securities firms a pet issue of mr paulson a former goldman sachs chief executive according to a treasury official mr paulson invited ms wu to his washington home monday night and spent two hours urging her to give ground on financial services liberalization with no immediate results "while there have been useful exchanges of views on the specific u s proposals there have as yet been no agreements to take any concrete steps " the ustr report said congress encouraged by u s manufacturers and unions is increasingly incensed about beijings practice of keeping the yuan artificially weak against the dollar a policy the lawmakers say costs americans factory jobs several bills aimed at punishing china are pending on capitol hill and congress appears intent on taking legislative action this year the yuan has strengthened about since the chinese began allowing it to move in july both the bush administration and congress have demanded faster appreciation but the chinese have shown little inclination to accelerate the yuans rise "our policy disagreements are not about the direction of change but about the pace of change " mr paulson said in her own opening remarks yesterday morning before the doors to the chamber were closed and the private discussions began in earnest ms wu argued that bilateral tensions should be addressed "calmly " "against the ever deepening economic globalization today confrontation does no good at all for problem solving and pressure and posturing can only make the situation more complex " she said "we should not easily blame the other side for our own domestic problems " said ms wu she was accompanied by other ministers and other top level officials along with scores of aides in what is thought to be the largest such chinese delegation to visit the u s the delegation is scheduled to meet with lawmakers on capitol hill later in the week where both sides are expected to vent their frustrations the chinese did come bearing gifts however on the sidelines of the opening session chinese vice commerce minister ma xiuhong told reporters that a delegation of chinese businesspeople on a tour of the u s had signed deals with american firms to buy "well over" &# billion of goods and that the final sum of contracts signed would be finalized in coming days still mr paulson warned ms wu of "growing skepticism" in the u s that beijing has good intentions when it comes to trade and currency policies "unfortunately in america this is manifesting itself as anti china sentiment as china becomes a symbol of the real and imagined downside of global competition " he said the u s delegation included cabinet members and other senior officials as well as federal reserve chairman ben bernanke
