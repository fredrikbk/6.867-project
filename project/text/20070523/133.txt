advertising company with a highflying stock but some practices that are coming into a regulatory spotlight companies that corral customer "leads" for clients through the use of aggressive tactics are being scrutinized by the federal trade commission the agency charged with enforcing truth in advertising laws the ftc wont comment but several people with knowledge of the situation say the agency is investigating following complaints from consumers and has been in contact with lead generation companies email marketers and advertisers if the ftc forces a change a business that represents a third of valueclicks revenue and has been a source of financial strength recently could be squeezed according to jordan rohan an analyst at rbc capital markets late last month he predicted government scrutiny of the so called incentivized lead generation industry and recommended valueclick investors sell their shares at the same time valueclicks shares have been pushed up by an m&amp a frenzy in its industry big internet companies are snapping up online advertising businesses in a wave of takeovers including microsoft corp s deal last week to buy aquantive inc for &# billion the prospects of further deals has caused the price of valueclick stock to rocket even after it confirmed friday that it is the subject of an ftc probe "specifically the ftc is investigating certain valueclick web sites which promise consumers a free gift of substantial value and the manner in which the company drives traffic to such web sites in particular through e mail " the company said in a regulatory filing valueclick said that prior to receiving the may letter it wasnt aware of any pending or planned ftc investigation related to the companys lead generation activities "the company continues to believe that it is compliant with all current state and federal regulations pertaining to its lead generation activities and intends to fully cooperate with the ftc in connection with this inquiry "

media inc valueclick which has technology for showing online ads and offers services to both advertisers and web publishers has been considered a potential takeover target the ftc appears to be concerned primarily with disclosures that promoters provide on web sites and in emails to consumers "if you make a representation that something is free but a person has to spend hundreds of dollars" to get it and that requirement hasnt been disclosed adequately "thats standard or basic advertising law that that claim may be deceptive " said lois greisman associate director of the ftcs division of marketing practices valueclick has said its disclosures comply with all federal and state guidelines and industry best practices representatives who responded to complaints to the better business bureau have argued consumers were told upfront that they had to respond to a certain number of offers and in some cases refer a friend who also responds to offers to collect their free prizes which can run the gamut from diamond encrusted pink cellphones to trips to las vegas gary almond vice president of the los angeles better business bureau contends that terms of consumer promotion centers offers arent properly disclosed "this is not free its conditional and the conditions arent fully disclosed " he says "i think its misleading " consumers who were wooed by valueclick promotions through emails and online ads were required to visit multiple web pages where they chose among sets of offers and steadily wracked up bills in the final step mr perrault said his only alternative to joining vonage and the wine club was to apply for a car loan suggesting a car purchase was necessary he said he was also asked to fill out multiple surveys that asked for detailed information about his interests income and family "these tactics prey on users who are confused or naive or just a little too trusting " says ben edelman a lawyer and expert on the online advertising business last year
