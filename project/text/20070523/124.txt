the hammer reinvents itself as the brassy kid on the block los angeles the armand hammer museum of art and cultural center which opened at the bottom of dr hammers oil company headquarters at wilshire and westwood late in was never quite a sows ear and "the hammer " into which it has been transformed over the past seven years isnt yet a silk purse but the metamorphosis achieved under the high energy direction of ann philbin formerly director of the drawing center in new york has been astonishing when i reviewed the old hammer here in april i dismissed most of dr hammers collection single works of varying quality by big name painters from titian to rouault along with a lot of victorian junk and thousands of daumier lithographs he had bought wholesale "perversely " i wrote "i thought the works most worth returning to this cold uninviting place to see again were two spectacularly decadent gustave moreaus thomas eakins brown study of a seated italian cardinal alfred stevens kissable portrait of sarah bernhardt and dr pozzi at home john singer sargents compelling painting of one of sarahs lovers a tall devilishly handsome chap in a scarlet dressing gown " in a deal signed off on earlier this year the new hammer broke almost all its ties to the late dr hammer he never practiced medicine but liked the title and his family foundation this freed the hammer from its obligation to show at least works from his collection at all times the number was reduced to which allowed the museum to focus on the best and opened up a whole wing the old hammer works currently on display still include my five favorites as well as a good rubens a fine rembrandt a respectable van gogh and two gauguins and a room full of daumiers but although still worth a visit dr hammers collection is no longer what his eponymous museum is all about in an act of radical self redefinition the hammer has re created itself as one of the most interesting and active havens for cutting edge contemporary art much of it from southern california not only in this city but also in the west comparable to new yorks p s in long island city moca chicago ica boston and the walker art center in minneapolis although often incomprehensible to the general public even the general art loving public good contemporary art especially when it has been created by lesser known artists is usually the least expensive art of any distinction to buy and the easiest to borrow ms philbin notes that &# her current acquisitions budget "goes a lot further when youre buying contemporary works on paper than when youre competing for a big name modern painting " after all los angeles already had a museum of contemporary art downtown which officially opened in but the collections and exhibitions of moca contain works by many of the multimillion dollar art world names since like those at moma in new york and its counterpart in san francisco it does show and purchase the work of young and lesser known artists recent acquisitions from los angeles artists are currently on display but without the single minded anti blockbuster fervor of the brassy new kid on the block the reconstituted hammer museum has been able to distinguish itself in a metropolitan area with five much larger much richer art museums in several other ways first the hammer foundation and occidental petroleum joint masters of the museum asked ucla to take it over in that brought the museum not only five peaceful productive years under henry hopkins a highly respected figure in california art museum circles who began introducing contemporary art but also the universitys work grunwald graphic arts collection containing prints by durer and rembrandt through those of sister corita and john baldessari ucla just three blocks up westwood boulevard also moved its public art lecture program to the museum after the flashy new pink seated state of the art seat billy wilder theatre opened downstairs last december the ucla film program and archive moved in as well in the meantime ann philbin and her colleagues tried to mix and mingle their old treasures with their latest discoveries and to fill the theater and other museum spaces with everything from poetry readings and political debates to high priced celebrity galas in the courtyard and free late night dj parties for students young artists and their friends most angelenos refuse to go anywhere except by car but they began driving in greater numbers plus this year up from a few years ago to the hammers underground garage how good is the new art at the hammer since the museum has mounted about shows of its own including some exhibitions of historic prints drawn from the grunwald collection and borrowed a few important shows from other museums the latter have included a work selection in from the impressive "societe anonyme" collection at yale a group founded in to spread the gospel of modern art in america and "vija celmins drawings" from the centre pompidou in paris a collection of meticulous hypnotizing pencil drawings of things like ocean waves moon surfaces star clusters and spiderwebs that just closed last month the most important of the museums own creations was the rediscovery in of lee bontecou an independent minded still active sculptor now who mysteriously disappeared from the new york art scene years ago this show a joint enterprise with moca chicago ended up at new yorks museum of modern art but almost as important and visually more jarring was a exhibition called simply "thing " which showed the works of young los angeles "sculptors" i e three dimensional object makers and made extravagantly clear the many directions serious contemporary art has taken since the holy years of minimalist abstraction that show in fact demonstrated where the new hammers heart lies and what it does best this relatively small oddly located museum has now mounted three major shows of recent los angeles artists the third and best a must see exhibition called "edens edge " which runs until sept was the first major hammer show to be curated by gary garrels now the deputy director and chief curator who moved here in from the museum of modern art in new york "i loved the chance to do smaller more experimental projects that were impossible to do at moma " he explains "and annie is amazingly seductive she talked me into coming on a malibu beach over a glass of wine " two recent exhibitions have showcased acquisitions by the museum during the past two years the artists represented include a few well known older names but most of them are in their s or s and provide a challenging sample of the newest new things meanwhile the museum continues to spotlight "emerging" young in "hammer project" solo exhibitions of which there have been so far when ann philbin arrived in she brought with her james elaine a drawing center colleague to search out new talent the best of his new solo discoveries are included in subsequent group shows and then if theyre judged good enough added to the permanent collection one of the most appealing aspects of the hammer projects is the opportunity it gives three artists a year to repaint completely the walls stairs and ceiling of the new foot high glass fronted lobby every few months a new artist gets to paint over the last giving urban archaeologists of the future many layers to uncover and drivers by on wilshire boulevard the lobby is lit up at night something new to gawk at will you like everything you see of course not thats what "cutting edge" art museums are all about the quality of the video art can be especially unpredictable but the best of the new stuff can be genuinely eye opening and mind blowing you dont think the same way after youve seen it and when you get tired of it you can always stroll along the balcony corridor to relax with dr hammers corots and daumiers mr littlejohn writes about west coast cultural events for the journal
