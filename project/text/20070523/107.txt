politics &amp economics u s researchers expect risky hurricane season the federal government predicted another dangerous hurricane season while defending itself against internal criticism that it isnt spending enough to improve forecasting that has been frequently wrong in the past the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said its researchers anticipate as many as hurricanes during this years storm season which officially runs from june to nov three to five of those hurricanes are expected to be major storms with winds of at least miles per hour but the agencys chief has had to defend the noaa from unusually harsh claims by the new head of the national hurricane center bill proenza in recent weeks that not enough is being done to collect important meteorological data "thats one reason why we love him " joked conrad c lautenbacher jr the noaas administrator at a press conference mr proenza who took the federal governments top hurricane forecasting job in january complained earlier this month that the noaa was devoting too much time and money to the agencys th anniversary celebration in contrast a satellite that provides much of the forecasting and tracking data related to storms is operating on an ailing backup transmitter a new satellite hasnt been designed or funded mr proenza said while the noaa is launching eight weather buoys off puerto rico this year to help improve the monitoring of warm waters that can make hurricanes stronger some forecasters have said that additional buoys and faster computers are needed "theres still more that we dont know about the atmosphere than we do " said dennis feltgen a spokesman for the national hurricane center yesterdays hurricane season forecast included a fact sheet defending the noaas &# million hurricane research budget and mr lautenbacher said the &# million allocated to the agencys anniversary would help increase emergency preparedness through public service projects the noaa is reviewing the schedule for replacing the weather satellite he added the agency said it will boost spending for "hurricane hunter" reconnaissance flights if the storm season is active the current budget calls for &# million in such flights down from a record year for hurricanes for the approaching season to tropical storms are predicted meaning storms with winds of at least mph such storms are named and tracked as potential hurricanes last year only nine named storms formed in the atlantic ocean with two being major hurricanes the debate continues over whether human induced global warming has any effect on the intensity of storms but these forecasts dont address that question seasonal hurricane forecasts have been widely unreliable recently with federal researchers predicting last year that twice as many major hurricanes would occur than actually did other forecasters fared even more poorly the main culprit was an unanticipated el nino system that warmed the tropical pacific ocean and suppressed hurricane formation in the atlantic a dizzying range of variables factor into hurricane development including ocean surface temperature and atmospheric wind shear federal forecasters said their outlook of an active storm season partly reflects a potential la nina weather system that could contribute to more storm activity in the atlantic other hurricane experts also have predicted a busier hurricane season than a year ago researchers at north carolina state university in raleigh who issued one of the most accurate forecasts last year expect eight or nine hurricanes with heavy storm activity along the gulf coast possibly including areas still struggling to recover from hurricane katrina the n c state researchers rely on a rigid statistical model weighing current water temperature wind patterns salinity and other factors against past weather patterns for each variable "you must trust your model " said lead researcher lian xie "the model wont lie to you "
