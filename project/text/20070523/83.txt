many cities face wi fi woes associated press across the u s many cities are finding their wi fi projects costing more and drawing less interest than expected leading to worries that a number of them will fail resulting in millions of dollars in wasted tax dollars or grants more than &# million was spent in the u s last year and industry web site muniwireless projects &# million will be spent in without revenues they had counted on to offset that spending elected officials might have to break promises or find money in already tight budgets to subsidize the systems for the low income families and city workers for whom access to the services was intended cities might end up running the systems if companies abandon networks they had built the worries come as big cities such as philadelphia and portland ore complete pilots and expand their much hyped networks "they are the monorails of this decade the wrong technology totally overpromised and completely undelivered " said anthony townsend research director at the institute for the future a think tank municipal wi fi projects use the same technology behind wireless access in coffee shops airports and home networks hundreds or thousands of antennas are installed atop street lamps and other fixtures laptops and other devices have wi fi cards that relay data to the internet through those antennas using open unregulated broadcast frequencies in theory one could check email and surf the web from anywhere served by a municipal network about u s cities or regions have citywide or partial systems and a similar number plan them according to esme vos founder of muniwireless rhode island has proposed a statewide network while one in california would span dozens of silicon valley municipalities san francisco los angeles chicago and atlanta also want one because systems are just coming online its premature to say how many or which ones will fail under current operating plans but the early signs are troubling "i will be surprised if the majority of these are successful and they do not prove to be drains on taxpayers money " said michael balhoff former telecom equity analyst with legg mason inc "the government is getting into hotly contested services " most communities paid for their projects elsewhere private companies agreed to absorb costs for the chance to sell services or ads the vendors remain confident despite technical and other problems chuck haas metrofi inc s chief executive said wi fi networks are far cheaper to build than cable and dsl which is broadband over phone lines demand could grow once more cell phones can make wi fi calls and as city workers improve productivity by reading electric meters remotely for instance mr balhoff however believes the successful projects are most likely to be in remote places that traditional service providers skip and fewer and fewer of those areas exist cities he said should focus on incentives to draw providers just a few years ago these municipal wireless projects seemed foolproof politicians got to tout internet access for city workers and poorer households many programs include giveaways for lower income families some cities bear no upfront costs when a company pays for construction in exchange for rights to use fixtures like lamp poles vendors such as earthlink inc saw a chance to offset declines in dial up subscriptions metrofi offering free service got to join the burgeoning market for online advertising google inc also is jumping in for the ads partnering with earthlink in san francisco although the citys board of supervisors is resisting their joint proposal as projects get deployed both sides are seeing chinks in their plans many cities and vendors underestimated the number of wireless antennas needed mobilepro corp s kite networks wound up tripling the access points in tempe ariz adding roughly &# million or more than doubling the costs "the industry is really in its infancy and what works on paper doesnt work that same way once you get into the real world " said jerry sullivan kites chief executive networks like st cloud fla and portland meanwhile shared difficulties penetrating building walls requiring indoor users to buy signal boosters for as much as &# and when it works service can be slower than cable and dsl "theres an antenna literally at the curb of my house but when ive tried to log on it cuts in and out " said landon dirgo who runs a computer repair shop in lompoc a central california town of one recent sunny afternoon in portland few could be found surfing the internet from the citys downtown parks vendors insist they have been upfront with customers about limitations but metrofi said managing expectations can be challenging earthlink said it has customers in four markets new orleans milpitas and anaheim calif and philadelphia paying &# or less a month metrofi said it had free users in portland in april averaging hours online the city says about use the network on any given day although both companies say their numbers are good given that their networks arent fully built yet they also are realigning expectations metrofi will insist that future contracts commit cities to spend a specific amount for public safety and other municipal applications earthlink which recently suspended new bids while it focuses on existing projects said it would likely seek minimums too
