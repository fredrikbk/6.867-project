financial planning for the not yet rich industry targets more services at long ignored demographic of people in their s and s were behind the eight ball financial planners are beginning to pay closer attention to people in their s and s a group that has long received the brushoff from the financial services industry because of its lack of wealth many people in this age group launching careers and starting families are looking for a wide range of financial advice among other things they need help investing in their first k plans saving for a house understanding insurance needs and managing debt and budgets and lately theyre finding a financial industry increasingly willing to help though the bulk of the industrys efforts remain focused on the baby boomers and retirees with the fattest wallets planning firms and some brokerage houses are beginning to provide services aimed squarely at a younger demographic these clients are younger than the relatively established middle age set traditionally targeted by the firms but a growing number of planners recognize the possibilities of taking on clients who they suspect will work or inherit their way into larger wealth in coming years marta and jake kagan shes and a marketing manager hes and a physician still in residency knew they needed help when they began a hunt last year for their first house the boston couple has student loans to pay off two children to provide for and live in a place "where we cant buy a starter home for under &# " says ms kagan "we feel like were behind the eight ball relative to where our parents were " four months ago they hired stacy francis a year old new york planner largely because "i want someone closer to my age closer to our realities " ms kagan says ms francis a fee only planner provided the kagans a year by year plan "its a conservative clear view that looks at our future more broadly so that we can see how to get from point a to point b weve decided to wait before we look for a house " for the most part people like the kagans are largely underserved by the financial industry research by the financial planning association an umbrella group for planners shows that just of the industrys client base is under the age of though that same research also indicates that people approaching are the most eager for financial advice jennifer cray a planner in menlo park calif says demand from younger clients is so great that she now turns away potential business because shes already loaded with people in this age group ms francis has begun hosting seminars for younger clients who now account for half of her business and in dallas kalita blessing a planner with quest capital management says a quarter of her business is now young people because "so many parents are gifting financial plans to their kids " those parents recognize that their offspring often have large debts from school loans likely wont have pensions to rely on and could face a sharply altered social security system at retirement tom and donna dietrick a mount lebanon pa couple went looking for a planner last year to help wade through the abundance of investment and savings options that boomers never had when they were younger everything from online savings accounts to roth iras and college savings plans mr dietrick a year old worker at us airways group inc says he and his wife "got to a point where we said weve got to find someone who can help us prioritize because there are so many options and philosophies on whats best to do " the dietricks hired pittsburgh planner bob nusbaum with whom they spent five or six hours over several sessions mr nusbaum rearranged their portfolio and helped them begin looking toward retirement their life insurance needs and their kids education "we dont have an enormous amount to invest and we just want to know its doing its best " mr dietrick says the planner "even looked at our budget and told us were not spending enough on leisure " the best time for young people to consider hiring a financial professional "is when you land your first real job " says barbara roper director of investor protection for the consumer federation of america "at that point you have a variety of financial issues to consider such as your k plan and your benefits " and a financial plan will set you on an appropriate course she says for savers with modest assets ms roper says a fee only planner is generally the best match these planners only sell their time at a cost of between &# and roughly &# an hour depending on where theyre based geographically because they dont pitch products tied to a particular company "it minimizes the potential conflicts " she says to find local planners consumers should ask friends family and colleagues if they can recommend someone they trust several web sites including the national association of personal financial advisors napfa org the financial planning association fpanet org and the garrett planning network garrettplanningnetwork com which emphasizes planners who charge by the hour offer locator services to help find planners in your area planners with a cfp designation for certified financial planner have passed a comprehensive exam that typically requires multiple years of study jennifer billock a year old san francisco grad school student says she and her husband jim have worked with several different professionals from big brokerage firms to various financial planners and "all we ever got were computerized asset allocations that cost &# to &# " she says "we dont have much money so it seemed irrelevant " the couple then went looking for a financial pro "who is objective and would do more than just portfolio planning " ms billock says after a three month search they found ms cray in menlo park a fee only planner who charges &# an hour or a retainer of between &# and &# a month for unlimited access "she went through all this insurance stuff i never thought of and helped with our cash flow analysis when we were setting up a plan for our daughter she told us the firms expert was just finishing new research and to wait a bit for the analysis so shes not giving us canned answers " some young people want a hand on their money tim leidig a year old applications analyst in york pa says he seeks advice from mr nusbaum the pittsburgh planner on everything from where to invest his k plan to whether he should pay off his student loans quickly or use that money for other financial needs but then mr leidig tracks down specific investment options and makes his own decisions "i feel like im getting totally independent advice " mr leidig says "and i remain in charge of my assets " some savers want not just planning but money management services as well that adds extra charges either through commissions or an annual fee based on a percentage of the assets under management usually up to or if youre a buy and hold type of investor paying commissions for money management services can make the most sense because these can work out to be less than continually paying an annual management fee when your portfolio doesnt change
