tata may bid for fords luxury brands indian firms purchase of jaguar land rover would widen reach indias tata group already owns former british stalwarts tetley tea and steel company corus group plc now its looking at snapping up a couple more renowned brands jaguar and land rover a quantum leap in class for a group whose main vehicle business has been making inexpensive cars and trucks for indians after months of speculation that tata motors ltd was considering a bid for the two units of ford motor co ratan tata chairman of tata group and its vehicle manufacturing arm confirmed his interest in jaguar and land rover in an interview friday with cnn ibn should tata motors top competing bids that are expected from u s based private equity concerns the luxury brands would give tata access to the know how and the networks it would need to expand its presence abroad as well as to upgrade the vehicles it offers in its booming home market the acquisition which could cost more than &# billion also would fit the tata groups plans to become one of indias first global brands and diversify its businesses overseas "it is a part of their larger agenda of going global to acquire more technology" and new markets says jigar shah director at k r choksey shares &amp securities in mumbai "in each of the groups businesses they have tried to delink themselves from india because india has its own political and economic risks " it is unlikely that tata motors will be able to sell many jaguars or land rovers in india but mr shah says it could use the companies technology and production facilities to improve its own cars and trucks tata motors also would seek to use jaguars and land rovers international distribution networks to promote its own cars abroad he says the steel to software tata group is one of indias largest and most respected conglomerates its companies employ about people and have annual sales of more than &# billion the group has been leading a wave of indian overseas investment as local companies have used the wealth generated in indias strong domestic economy to make acquisitions around the world in february tata groups steel arm tata steel ltd won a bidding war to buy britains corus group for about &# billion the group bought eight oclock coffee co of the u s last year for &# million and south koreas daewoo commercial vehicle co in for &# million its first big international acquisition was tata teas acquisition of tetley group of the united kingdom in a tata motors bid for jaguar and land rover could put it in competition with private equity firms that have expressed interest including j p morgan chase &amp co s one equity partners llc led by former ford chief executive jacques nasser and ripplewood holdings inc which is being advised by former ford executive nick scheele ford has told potential buyers that it would provide some of the financing itself according to people involved in the process as uncertainty in the credit markets has made leveraged buyouts more difficult with jaguar and land rover burdened by unfavorable exchange rates a relatively high cost base in the u k and potentially expensive new environmental regulations some analysts are skeptical of fords ability to command a hefty price for them merrill lynch &amp co estimated earlier this year that the combined sale of the jaguar and land rover brands would raise &# billion to &# billion ford acquired the jaguar passenger car unit for &# billion in and the land rover sport utility vehicle unit for &# billion in along with fords swedish unit volvo car corp jaguar and land rover belong to fords premier automotive group while ford doesnt break out the individual results of its european luxury brands it has acknowledged that jaguar has been unprofitable for most of the nearly years it has owned a stake in the unit during the late s and early s ford had hoped to use its premier automotive group to cash in on a boom in luxury car sales the strategy has been complicated by poor sales at jaguar which has continued to flounder despite restructuring efforts and the addition of a small sedan called the x type that was intended to lure younger customers the design ford chose for the x type struck many customers as bland "ford mismanaged jaguar for years but of late it has done the right thing and has started to refocus jaguar on its core business " says david bailey a business professor at the u k s university of birmingham "even if ford stayed in charge there would be some big questions whether to ax the x type and whether to keep open three plants in the u k " ford is aiming to sell jaguar and land rover as a package the two brands increasingly operate as one business sharing a factory in the liverpool area where jaguar has produced the x type sedan and which land rover began using last fall to produce suvs one question hanging over tatas potential bid is how it would deal with the business culture differences that often crop up when an auto maker invests in another the auto industry has a long history of troubled cross cultural deals including general motors corp s alliance with italys fiat spa bmw ags disastrous acquisition of britains rover in the s and daimlers attempt to run chrysler tata group has shown that it is willing to pay top dollar for the assets it wants it had to raise its bid for corus repeatedly by a total of more than to beat a competing bid from brazilian steel company cia siderurgica nacional it isnt clear whether the recent global credit squeeze prompted by worries over the u s subprime mortgage market would significantly hamper tata motors ability or that of potential rival bidders to fund a purchase during a dinner with news media at ford headquarters last week ford chief executive alan mulally acknowledged that the tightening in the credit markets "absolutely is an issue" in the companys efforts to sell jaguar and land rover but he added that the issue isnt slowing the sale which he said could take place later this year or in early indian analysts dont expect that a funding issue alone would derail a bid by tata group but investors could punish tata motors shares if they are worried that the company was taking on too much debt "money wont be a problem but the concern is that group overextending itself" at a time when the indian and global economies are showing signs of a slowdown mr shah says john d stoll in detroit contributed to this article
