the economy the outlook why fears of a u s slowdown arent weakening oil prices oil prices are supposed to be vulnerable to anything that threatens world economic growth and thus demand for petroleum thats especially true when prices are high as they are now at more than &# a barrel nothing has worried oil sheiks more in recent years than the specter of a u s housing market collapse drilling a hole in their pocketbooks so with the u s subprime mortgage market in a meltdown and u s credit markets in turmoil are fat oil profits about to end will some moderation finally come to the oil market where price swings this year have been extremely volatile experts say a sharp and sustained fall in oil prices would be unlikely unless financial and economic malaise infected asia and the middle east reducing their fast rising demand that doesnt appear to be in the cards "you need a serious recession in the u s not just an economic slowdown" for those regions to be affected says roger diwan an analyst at washington based oil industry consulting firm pfc energy oil prices will only weaken "when you see that chinas demand is not growing at barrels a day and the middle easts demand isnt growing by " barrels a day he says supply and demand data compiled by the paris based international energy agency the joint energy policy arm of the worlds most industrialized countries suggest that wont happen demand in the most industrialized nations in north america europe and the pacific has changed little since but global demand is expected to show a huge increase this year of nearly four million barrels a day to million barrels a day with china and the middle east accounting for more than half the rise indeed oil markets so far have responded little to the subprime mortgage implosion because the fundamentals of global petroleum supply and demand arent clearly signaling a major change the prospect of geopolitical upset and refinery outages due to hurricane season in the gulf of mexico for example continue to threaten barely adequate supplies of critical fuels like gasoline and diesel key suppliers including venezuela and iraq continue to face problems pumping oil meantime the growth of conventional oil production is slipping outside the organization of petroleum exporting countries where members still have vast untapped reserves biofuels natural gas liquids and production from oil sands are on the rise but not fast enough to threaten opecs grip at the beginning of this month crude oil prices in new york hit another intraday record on the new york mercantile exchange &# a barrel more than triple the average price for and nearly double the peak friday crude oil for october delivery settled on the nymex at &# a barrel up &# volatility this year also has been high the price on nymex has reached as low as &# a barrel suggesting that even this modest retreat from recent highs may not last industry analysts say such volatility has became the norm opecs inability to adequately manage price swings makes predictions even harder movement into and out of storage tends to take place outside of opec weakening its grip on markets "for them high global stocks undermine their control of the market " says antoine halff an analyst at fimat usa a unit of frances societe generale while that explains the cartels intense focus on supplying just enough oil in time to meet demand it also may add to uncertainty and price volatility the worlds main source for additional supply is the middle east but thats some days away by tanker from the u s the largest energy consumer too distant to react quickly with fresh supply to damp price surges "opec wants to control inventory like the u s federal reserve controls liquidity " says larry goldstein director of the energy policy research foundation an industry funded nonprofit research organization "they are more likely to respond to high inventories by cutting supply than to low inventories " mr goldstein reckons opec may have learned a lesson in it found out high prices caused by low inventories were absorbed by a fast growing global economy but he says opec is wrong if it believes high prices dont affect economic growth previous oil price explosions in and were the result of supply disruptions these price jumps occurred when the global economy was also weak economic slowdowns followed the idea grew that oil price jumps cause recessions since then economists have concluded that while high oil prices do sap economic growth the effect isnt noticeable in a fast growing economy and oil profits have added to growth in some regions but a full blown credit crisis could shrink u s growth by enough to reduce global demand over time if that happens "oil prices could fall in the short term by to &# a barrel " says philip verleger jr an aspen colo economist and that would dry up much needed investment to expand energy production opecs ministers who meet in vienna on sept face a dilemma "if they want to keep oil prices between &# a barrel and &# a barrel they need to cut production now " mr verleger says and force a drawdown of inventories ahead of a possible u s slump into recession yet no one can be sure of a recession just yet and an opec move to slash output rather than raise it as some expect would go down poorly with consumers and governments trying to cope with other economic threats
