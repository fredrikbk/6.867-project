if iraq falls in contrast to president bushs dark comparison between iraq and the bloody aftermath of the vietnam war last week there is another comforting version of the vietnam analogy thats gained currency among policy makers and pundits it goes something like this after that last helicopter took off from the u s embassy in saigon years ago the nasty strategic consequences then predicted did not in fact materialize the "dominoes" did not fall the russians and chinese did not take over and america remained no in southeast asia and in the world but alas cut and run from iraq will not have the same serendipitous aftermath because iraq is not at all like vietnam unlike iraq vietnam was a peripheral arena of the cold war strategic resources like oil were not at stake and neither were bases ok moscow obtained access to da nang and cam ranh bay for a while in the global hierarchy of power vietnam was a pawn not a pillar and the decisive battle lines at the time were drawn in europe not in southeast asia the middle east by contrast was always the "elephant path of history " as israels fabled defense minister moshe dayan put it legions of conquerors have marched up and down the levant and from alexanders macedonia all the way to india other prominent visitors were julius caesar napoleon and the german wehrmacht this is not just ancient history today the greater middle east is a cauldron even macbeths witches would be terrified to touch the worlds worst political and religious pathologies combine with oil and gas terrorism and nuclear ambitions in short unlike yesterdays vietnam the greater middle east including turkey is the central strategic arena of the st century as europe was in the th this is where three continents europe asia and africa are joined so lets take a moment to think about what would happen once that last blackhawk took off from baghdad international here is a short list iran advances to no completing its nuclear arms program undeterred and unhindered americas cowed sunni allies saudi arabia jordan the oil rich "gulfies" are drawn into the khomeinist orbit you might ask wouldnt they converge in a mighty anti tehran alliance instead think again the local players have never managed to establish a regional balance of power it was always outsiders first britain then the u s who chastened the malfeasants and blocked anti western intruders like nazi germany and soviet russia with the u s gone from iraq emboldened jihadi forces shift to afghanistan and turn it again into a bastion of terror international syria reclaims lebanon which it has always labeled as a part of "great syria " hezbollah and hamas both funded and equipped by tehran resume their war against israel russia extruded from the middle east by adroit kissingerian diplomacy in the s rebuilds its anti western alliances in iraq the war escalates unleashing even more torrents of refugees and provoking outside intervention if not partition now lets look beyond the region the europeans will be the first to revise their romantic notions of multipolarity or world governance by committee for worse than an overbearing in your face america is a weakened and demoralized one shall vladimir putins russia acquire a controlling stake this ruthlessly revisionist power wants revenge for its post gorbachev humiliation not responsibility china with its fabulous riches the middle kingdom is still happily counting its currency surpluses as it pretties up its act for the olympics but watch its next play if the u s quits the highest stakes game in iraq the message from beijing might well read "move over america the western pacific as you call it is our lake " europe it is wealthy populous and well ordered but strategic players those member states of the e u are not they cannot pacify the middle east stop the iranian bomb or keep mr putin from wielding gas pipelines as tools of "persuasion " when the europeans did wade into the fray as in the balkan wars of the s they let the u s air force go first now to the upside the u s may have spent piles of chips foolishly but it is still the richest player at the global gaming table in the bush years the u s may have squandered tons of political capital but then the rest of the world is not exactly making up for the shortfall nor has the u s become a "dispensable nation " that is the most remarkable truth in these trying times its enemies from al qaeda to iran and its rivals from russia to china can disrupt and defy but they cannot build and lead for all the damage to washingtons reputation nothing of great import can be achieved without let alone against the u s can moscow and beijing bring peace to palestine or mend a global financial system battered by the subprime crisis where are the central banks of russia and china the bush presidency will soon be on the way out but america is not this truth has recently begun to sink in among the major democratic contenders listen to hillary clinton who would leave "residual forces" to fight terrorism or to barack obama who would stay in iraq with an as yet unspecified force even the most leftish of them all john edwards would keep troops around to stop genocide in iraq or to prevent violence from spilling over into the neighborhood and no wonder for it might be one of them who will have to deal with the bitter aftermath if the u s slinks out of iraq these realists have it right withdrawal cannot serve americas interests on the day after tomorrow friends and foes will ask if this superpower doesnt care about the worlds central and most dangerous stage what will it care about americas allies will look for insurance elsewhere and the others will muse if the police wont stay in this most critical of neighborhoods why not break a few windows or just take over the u s as "gulliver unbound" may have stumbled during its "unipolar" moment but as giant with feet of clay it will do worse and so will the rest of the world
