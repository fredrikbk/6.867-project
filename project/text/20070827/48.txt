home depot hit as credit crunch squeezes deals the global credit crunch has begun to put a squeeze on the buyout boom with banks and private equity firms forcing home depot inc to sell its struggling wholesale supply unit for much less than what had been agreed to just two months ago home depots board yesterday agreed to sell home depot supply for &# billion to bain capital carlyle group and clayton dubilier &amp rice about less than the price hammered out in june when the buyout boom was at its peak in addition home depot itself will hold about of the units equity people familiar with the matter said and guarantee some of the debt issued by the banks to finance the acquisition thats significant because if the banks cant sell the debt in bond markets and it sits on their balance sheet they have to mark down its value which some can ill afford to do the revised deal followed a marathon negotiating session over the past several days that included a whos who of wall street including j p morgan chase &amp co chief executive james dimon and lehman brothers holdings inc ceo richard fuld it illustrates just how swiftly the broader credit crisis is putting the brakes on the merger machine on wall street which has seen a record number of takeovers just weeks ago the buyout boom was a hugely profitable collaboration between private equity firms and the wall street bankers who financed them now amid the credit crunch some private equity firms and their bankers are at loggerheads as each camp tries to protect its bottom line turning previously close allies against each other a collapse of the home depot deal would likely have spooked debt markets by casting more doubt on a series of higher profile transactions such as the pending buyouts of texas utility txu corp wireless operator alltel corp and payment processor first data corp the eleventh hour agreement signals that in the months ahead corporate sellers may have to accept lower prices and private equity firms lower investment returns wall street banks meanwhile could end up either sitting on a mountain of loans and junk bonds or selling the debt at sharply reduced prices there are an estimated &# billion in buyout deals working their way through the banking system wall street committed to lend money for these deals as part of its plan to be in the "moving business " of packaging loans and equity stakes in the companies and selling them to investors spreading out the risk of those transactions with credit markets largely shut to big transactions the banks have found themselves back in the old fashioned "storage business " forced to keep the debt on their balance sheets and mark down its value in the process the nations banks might have to absorb tens of billions of dollars of write downs such a toll would add to the pain of the far larger losses they are already toting up from the downturn in real estate and the meltdown in the market for mortgage securities that set the stage for the nasty squabble over hd supply the banks argument if the buyout firms could get a reduction in the price they were paying for the business home depot previously agreed to cut the price tag for the unit by about &# billion to around &# billion the banks should be able to change the terms of their financing for it and other deals the buyout firms objected saying a deal was a deal "this is what we pay them for " said one top buyout executive "this is what underwriting is " caught in the middle are the companies that have agreed to be sold to buyout firms atlanta based home depot for instance is suffering in part because of the downturn in the housing market and had planned to use the proceeds of the hd supply sale to partially fund a &# billion stock buyback plan the &# billion price tag will allow the retailer to go ahead with its buyback a person familiar with the matter said but it means that home depot will have sold the unit for little more than what it had spent to acquire the more than wholesale contracting supply companies that make up the supply unit the drama over the revised terms kicked into high gear late last week with most of wall street on vacation j p morgans mr dimon huddled with senior banker james b lee thursday night dining on pizza and wine as they weighed their options mr lee had canceled a planned holiday on block island r i steve black co head of j p morgans investment bank was also part of the discussions the j p morgan team also regularly consulted with mr fuld late last week home depots chief executive frank blake flew between atlanta and new york to handle the negotiations along with carol tome the companys chief financial officer on friday enough progress had been made that one high level banker said the sides had "moved the ball yards down the field " but things remained so touch and go over most of the weekend that home depot was preparing for the deal to fall apart said one person briefed on the companys plans this person said the company was readying an announcement to cut its buyback almost in half relations had began souring a few days earlier after the private equity firms and home depot first renegotiated the buyout price as suggested by home depot lawyer martin lipton of new york law firm wachtell lipton rosen &amp katz the two sides wouldnt need to change their bank agreements because the terms werent any worse for the banks that was unacceptable to both lehmans mr fuld and j p morgans mr dimon as well as gregory margolies an executive at merrill lynch &amp co the third big lender involved in the deal from the banks point of view market conditions had deteriorated so badly that they had grounds to recut their financing deal with their clients among the features of the original hd supply deal were many of the innovations private equity firms have introduced in recent years in their pursuit of maximum flexibility those innovations denied the lenders many of the protections traditionally written into loan agreements for example there were almost no performance requirements set for hd supply if it chose not to use its cash to pay interest the lenders would have no choice but to accept more debt instead of money unfortunately for the banks investors have been on a buyers strike recently and have refused to buy debt that gives them few rights the banks argued that if the target company was so weak that the buyers needed all that flexibility and refused to put in any terms and conditions they shouldnt be buying the company in the first place the lenders initially asked the private equity firms to guarantee the debt involved in the deal which the private equity firms say they refused to do taking one of the strongest lines was mr dimon said one person involved in the negotiations "jamie is not going to get pushed around " there was plenty of reason for mr dimon to take such a stance a recent report from citigroups banking analyst estimated that j p morgan was holding &# billion of leveraged buyout financing some of which may wind up on the banks balance sheet if it cant syndicate the deals "if we get stuck with loans we wont like it but well be ok " mr dimon said during a conference call with analysts and investors last month the banks had been on uncertain legal ground in pushing for changes in their commitments according to lawyers who were involved in the deal and many who werent rushing to establish market share in the buyout business they largely dropped many standard financing conditions in deals struck for private equity clients in the past few years for instance few recent deals have carried an arcane provision known as the "market out" that previously had allowed banks to pull out of commitment if the general financing market deteriorated even conditions for declaring an "out" for a specific target companys performance had been tightly drawn for the banks in contrast to the strengthened flexibility of private equity firms when it comes to the ability to renegotiate or walk away yesterday though the banks and private equity firms came to an understanding acknowledging that a busted deal would be "terrible" for everyone according to a person familiar with the matter that was especially true for the three lead banks who viewed it as setting a bad precedent for the crush of buyouts still in the market the revised deal reduces the amount of debt the banks provided to about &# billion as part of the deal the private equity firms agreed to accept higher interest rates on portions of the debt which offset some of the firms other concessions the buyout firms will write checks for almost &# billion the banks in turn will try to raise the &# billion in debt from investors so they dont have to provide the entire sum themselves most in the market still expect the bulk of the remaining private equity deals to be completed they point to hd supply and the controversy around it as unusual for two reasons it is one of the few deals in which the value of the equity as well as the debt involved in the deal was underwater given the original &# billion price tag and is unlikely to be resold at anything near the current price anytime in the next few years still investors are warily trying to determine if other buyout deals might fall victim to similar problems they have been scrutinizing real estate intensive deals such as the pending buyout of hilton hotels corp and harrahs entertainment inc as well as radio broadcaster clear channel communications inc whose sector has been hurt in recent weeks and they are already toting up losses that the banks will have to put on their books in the &# billion deal for first data for instance some investors are figuring that the debt issued in connection with the deal is already worth to less than envisioned that could mean seven banks sharing paper losses of more than &# billion the last minute accord on the home depots unit with a reduction in the amount of debt offers a potential road map for other deals that would avoid drastic write downs ann zimmerman and susanne craig contributed to this article
