the blue dog moment a high stakes budget showdown is shaping up this fall between president bush and congressional democrats the debate will also be a moment of truth for the so called "blue dog" democrats the self described fiscal conservatives in the house democratic caucus the bone of contention is the &# billion in domestic spending that democrats passed in their budget resolution above what mr bush requested in his own budget the democratic spending plan would increase non defense expenditures by next year more than double the inflation rate the white house is threatening vetoes if democrats pass spending bills above mr bushs limit which could possibly lead to a government shutdown republicans have already lined up the necessary house votes to sustain any spending veto the blue dog web site boasts that its mission is to "refocus congress on balancing the budget and ridding taxpayers of the burden of debt " if a balanced budget is what they want the best fiscal option would be to enact what is called a "continuing resolution" budget that would fund all programs at last years level plus or along with rising tax revenues this could cut the budget deficit roughly in half next year to well under &# billion but republicans cant do that on their own they need the votes of these moderate democrats heres the rub so far this year the blue dogs have been almost all bark when it comes to fiscal restraint and debt reduction thirty of the have voted for every one of the non defense spending bills their committee chairman have sent them speaker nancy pelosi is enforcing party discipline and as a result of the blue dogs voted "no" on each of the amendments that republicans proposed to cut the costs of these bills the freshman democrats who represent conservative districts such as heath shuler n c baron hill ind zack space ohio nick lampson texas have been a particular disappointment back home these same blue dogs trumpet their "independent streak " voting records from recent years confirm that the blue dogs are less than consistent spending hawks the national taxpayers union did some checking and found that the blue dogs had an average fiscal score of out of earning them a grade of d as a group it also found that last year the blue dogs sponsored &# of new spending for every dollar of budget reductions for a net spending increase per member of more than &# billion the blue dogs are consistent on one fiscal issue stopping tax cuts as a group they opposed the bush tax cuts and the extension of those tax cuts and a super majority vote requirement to raise taxes all in the name of easing the debt burden on future generations but those concerns evaporated when all but nine in the blue dog coalition voted to expand the schip health care program to include many middle class families at a cost of &# billion over the period so in the weeks ahead we will see whether the blue dog democrats work to reduce the &# billion spending bonus their party leadership is seeking they were elected on a platform of fiscal responsibility and we are about to find out if they meant it see related letter "letters to the editor when blue dogs growl big spenders get nervous" wsj sept
