isnt a household name yet hundreds of bloggers from all over the world laud the company and its services "i just found the coolest site for search engine marketing " reads a post on a blog called neptune baby "apogee uses proven techniques to provide measurable results for your web site how cool " how did this happen the employee company pays bloggers most of whom it knows nothing about to write about apogee a practice known as pay per post or sponsored reviews apogee executives knew they could never pour as much money into buying search keywords as big companies could thats how some companies get noticed on the web by offering search engine companies the highest bid on keywords related to their business apogee decided to explore other newer tactics hitching a ride on the growing popularity of online communities blogs and social networks to get people talking about its web site for as little as &# per post apogees name and descriptions of its business appear on blogs across the web raising the austin texas companys chances of coming up in a keyword search since frequent mentions can boost a sites position in a search engines "natural " or unpaid rankings when sponsored reviews first came on the scene a few years ago they seemed like a good idea to the executives of apogee a division of leads customers growth llc austin but the appearance of impropriety troubled them in their early days blogger advertiser matchmakers didnt require bloggers to disclose payments so readers may not have known when they were reading a paid post "nudge nudge wink wink they would write about you " says william leake apogees co founder and chief executive "it felt a little unseemly " but apogee remained interested not only for itself but to test it as a possible tool for its clients so it monitored the practices development last fall payperpost inc one of the better known blogger advertiser matchmakers began requiring its roster of paid bloggers to disclose that they write paid posts a practice that was catching on in this market thats when apogee jumped in as an advertiser in january it agreed to pay bloggers a month around &# each plus a fee to payperpost of around &# per blogger to write a review about apogees blog which the company uses to drive business to its services after seeing its web traffic grow apogee has ramped up the service these days it pays for about postings a month and the company says traffic is three times higher than it was a year ago while some advertisers choose to work directly with bloggers apogee has payperpost tell its blogger community about a posting opportunity bloggers take the assignments on a first come first served basis until apogee gets the desired number of postings some bloggers are more upfront than others about their compensation most say before the review that a post is a sponsored review a few simply include the word "payperpost" without explanation others put a general message on their blog that lets readers know they accept compensation for reviews a format set up by orlando fla based payperpost offers a button for placement on blogs that says "i disclose " clicking on the button reveals the bloggers disclosure policy brian combs apogees vice president of services and a co founder says he would like all bloggers to be upfront in their disclosure but "you have to be realistic with newer vehicles there are going to be question marks " mr combs says he wouldnt be surprised by a shift to greater disclosure soon moves to require disclosure have helped clear some tarnish from paid reviews says patricia fusco lead search strategist at search consulting firm netconcepts llc madison wis still she says paid posts do tend to "skew opinions toward being false positive " advertisers typically can require that a review or post be positive apogee declines this option some bloggers say the need to preserve their credibility may be the best defense against superficial reviews "fluff posts or posts that are purely promotional dont do anyone any good " says ben cook a blogger in belleville ill who says he has not written about apogee "blog readers will see right through it and lose respect for both the blogger and the advertiser " mr cook says he posted about a dozen critical paid reviews in the past year and only one advertiser complained another issue is that some paid posters put little effort into their reviews dozens of posts seem cloned echoing the background notes that apogee provides still its frequency of references among other things that determine search engine rankings not whether a review is good or bad "a certain percentage is going to be junky " says mr leake but he says thats to be expected with a new publicity medium recently payperpost added a feature in which advertisers can rate each post from to apogee refuses posters with an average below by not requiring positive reviews apogee also hopes to get useful feedback "many people told us there were things wrong with our blog " mr combs says like layouts or writing "its wonderful feedback if youre willing to go back and correct things " messrs combs and leake regularly sift through lists of past paid posters and bar some from being used again they say these decisions are based not on whether a review is positive but on the ability of the blogger to bring expertise to the subject and the amount of traffic on the bloggers own site more than half of the traffic on apogees web site now comes from blogs compared with about before the paid posts campaign began the number of site visitors who complete online inquiry forms is now in the low hundreds each month the company says up four to fivefold the campaign costs in the "low thousands" per month mr combs says a small chunk of the &# monthly marketing budget apogee posted about &# million in revenue last year paying for reviews is like word of mouth marketing says mr leake "im inviting people to a discussion " these days about half of apogees clients use sponsored reviews too apogee explains to the clients that theyll have limited control over what the bloggers say about them says mr combs "you have to face some pride swallowing "
