no more exceptions to corporate taxes your editorial "schumers tax gambit" aug attempts its own maneuvers that the facts simply dont support you assert the difference between active and passive income is in the eye of the senate beholder in fact its in the letter of the law the legislation ive sponsored with sen max baucus reiterates congressional intent that investment advisory and asset management firms that go public be treated as corporations just like other active businesses that decide to go public congress passed a law in saying partnerships that go public will be treated as corporations while also allowing for certain types of active businesses like oil and gas pipelines to keep their partnership status congress did not include investment advisory and asset management businesses in that exception today private equity and hedge fund management firms that have gone public say their income qualifies for another exception the passive type income exception these are not actually private equity and hedge funds they are firms that manage those funds these firms view themselves as engaged in the active investment advisory and asset management business not as investment companies and the sec agrees with them so to critics who claim our legislation unfairly targets these firms the question is what other types of active businesses have tried to claim an exception intended for passive income our bill doesnt single out these companies theyve singled out themselves finally i agree with those who say our corporate tax rate is too high but thats a different debate and well never get there if we stand by and watch a significant part of our economy escape the corporate tax system while still accessing public markets sen chuck grassley washington
