pension managers rethink their love of hedge funds many public pension funds in recent years have become eager to invest in hedge funds now some are getting cold feet pension fund managers from louisiana to ohio are saying they may slow their push into these funds after the recent losses suffered at big hedge funds including ones run by goldman sachs group inc and aqr capital management have reinforced some of the risks indeed one critic suggests that pensions would be foolish to keep pursuing hedge funds "its like planning a vacation to an exotic land and finding out that theres an outbreak of bubonic plague " says frederick rowe chairman of the texas pension review board which provides oversight of texas public pension funds its a significant reversal in thinking less than a year ago more than of public pension funds said they were planning "significant increases" to their existing hedge fund investments according to the consulting firm greenwich associates at least

says it can invest up to of its &# billion in assets in hedge funds and that it has already hired a consultant to find some funds "but recent events have given us some more things to think about " says jim winfree executive director "we are going extremely slowly " it may be too early to see any pension funds redeeming their hedge fund holdings and some of the hardest hit hedge funds have already shown signs of rebounding but pension managers say the erratic moves in recent weeks are reason enough to worry most pension fund boards any pullback by pension funds would be a blow to many hedge funds which are increasingly relying on these funds as a way to raise large amounts of capital for their part pension plans which were among the investors burned by the bear market of took note that many hedge funds provided some protection back then as a result in the past few years many have started shifting into hedge funds and other alternative investments as a way to shield against a similar downturn in the future yet kevin lynch a managing director at the consulting firm rogerscasey in darien conn says he noticed a palpable difference recently when discussing hedge funds with pension fund managers "theyre all kind of spooked " he says allan bentkowski investment manager for the &# million tucson supplemental retirement system said representatives from j p morgan chase &amp co visited their arizona offices last year to discuss the merits of hedge funds but after recent volatility "the board has no inclination at this point " at the teachers retirement system of louisiana phil griffiths the deputy chief investment officer says he invested &# million in a hedge fund last year and has the ability to move another &# million of his &# billion in assets into hedge funds but before he invests in any more hedge funds he is waiting until at least the end of next month to see how some of the funds performed and whether they were hit with redemptions "if the funds didnt fare well wed see that as a negative " mr griffith says "those results will probably prompt us to go one way or the other " other pension funds say plans to begin investing in hedge funds could be delayed

around the world but it has paused before formally committing that money "we are checking in with our global macro managers far more frequently than normal " says william estabrook executive director at the &# billion fund this doesnt mean all pension funds have turned more cautious many say they are long term investors and that despite some losses hedge fund investments over time will lift

said the pension fund could raise its hedge fund investments to &# billion from &# billion the san diego county employees retirement association which has separate hedge fund investments lost &# million when amaranth advisors collapsed in though the fund still returned for the year ended in june the san diego fund also held positions in funds from aqr and d e shaw &amp co that hit rocky patches in recent weeks still "we are looking at adding hedge fund managers " says brian white the chief executive officer "this reinforces the rule that diversification is good " dan gallagher chief investment officer at the los angeles city employees retirement system suggests the hedge fund losses have only made him more skeptical "im not a major hedge fund proponent " he says "and the perception among some of our trustees is that hedge funds are very volatile and that there is risk there "
