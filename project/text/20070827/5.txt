boss talk turning shopping trips into treasure hunts surprises bargains keep sinegals costco humming but should he boost prices costco wholesale corp s eclectic product mix and customer friendly policies have created fiercely loyal shoppers but some on wall street think costco should focus more on profit and have been pressuring chief executive jim sinegal to squeeze customers a little harder in mr sinegal joined investor jeffrey brotman now costcos chairman to launch the company as a warehouse club its the largest u s retailer of its type amassing an anticipated &# billion in sales this year from its clubs world wide along the way mr sinegal has proved himself to be a master merchandiser honing costcos retail model with a success that outstrips competitors including its chief rival wal mart stores inc s sams club costco based in issaquah wash charges its patrons annual membership fees of &# to &# for access to warehouses loaded with bulk goods priced at no more than above its wholesale costs for pizzazz costco uses the "treasure hunt" approach peppering its stores with unexpected limited availability items ranging from designer jeans to &# diamond rings that keep shoppers coming back investors for the most part have endorsed costcos strategy the retailers stock trades at times its projected per share earnings for the next four quarters far ahead of most other retailers but some have begun to worry costco could slip if it doesnt show more profit growth mr sinegal who is years old works at two folding tables in his office and his wardrobe includes items from his stores mr sinegal recently sat down for an interview with the wall street journal to discuss topics ranging from competitive pricing to a business link with martha stewart excerpts follow wsj you are constantly balancing the needs of customers employees and shareholders some on wall street complain that shareholders seem to come third in that equation do they mr sinegal thats not the case we want to obey the law take care of our customers take care of our people and respect our suppliers and we think if we do those four things pretty much in that order that were going to reward shareholders by the way we sell for a pretty rich multiple were not getting penalized by wall street wsj giving customers a great deal can sometimes mean taking a hit on profits is it worth it mr sinegal there are all sorts of opportunities where you can try to sneak in a little more margin here and a little more profitability there but thats not what were about when you start suggesting that its not important to save the customer money on this because theyll never know the difference you start to fool yourself the customer trusts us you dont want to give up on that type of reputation wsj youve revoked at least one popular policy unlimited returns of big electronics why did you decide to initiate a day time limit on returns of flat panel tvs earlier this year mr sinegal we were spending an enormous amount of dollars by taking these things back and selling them to a salvage company for to cents on the dollar most of the reason for the tvs coming back were that customers couldnt understand what to do with them we said "were going to help you get this thing hooked up were going to give you two years of warranty were going to make sure even if we have to send somebody out to your house that it works " we think we came up with a great solution wsj why has the treasure hunt technique worked so well for you in attracting customers mr sinegal we try to create an attitude that if you see it you ought to buy it because chances are it aint going to be there next time youre going to come in and find that maybe we have some lucky jeans that were selling you come in the next time and we dont have those jeans but we have some coach handbags thats the treasure hunt aspect we constantly buy that stuff and intentionally run out of it from time to time wsj what was one of the most successful treasure hunt items at costco mr sinegal we wound up finding a place where we could get several million pairs of calvin klein jeans and we bought them at a great price every department store was selling them for &# we easily could have said "well were selling every pair that we get why not sell these for &# " but we didnt we sold them for &# because we made such a great buy wsj can you recall one of your bigger treasure hunt disappointments mr sinegal one year we bought an ibm computer that we were going to sell for i think &# we bought thousands of them and it bombed we had to lower the price several times yeah were not infallible wsj costco offers a wide range of products under its in house kirkland brand now youre considering a line of frozen foods by martha stewart why martha mr sinegal we think that martha stewart is a very creative person who has the ability to help us develop some real gourmet type of products with her name on it and perhaps the kirkland signature name combined that would have some real credibility well see how the customers react to it well probably introduce our first product right before christmas wsj costco offers better wages and benefits than most of its rivals why is that mr sinegal we think that you get what you pay for if you hire good people pay them good wages and provide good jobs and careers good things will happen in your business we think thats proven true in our case we are the low cost provider of merchandise and yet we pay the highest wages wouldnt that suggest that were getting better productivity wsj costco plans to open about new stores in the u s this year pushing your total past your wal mart rival sams club plans to open or are you concerned about overreaching mr sinegal theres lot of markets that we can go to if we perform well and if those new units get off the ground well feel pretty confident about continuing to grow at that pace and maybe even stepping it up a little bit beyond that wsj municipal laws banning development of large format retail stores have gained momentum this decade especially in california where costco has quite a few stores will that limit you mr sinegal it doesnt apply to us in many instances but we dont think that legislating in that fashion to limit competition is a good idea generally speaking its difficult to ban something like our business when we pay the wages and we provide the types of jobs that we do were a desirable business in the community wsj how does the recent concern over tainted goods from china affect costcos sourcing of merchandise mr sinegal that type of tainted product doesnt just come from one country it can come from any number of countries including our own country its going to make us better buyers in terms of looking at every single thing that we buy and testing things much more carefully wsj youve already expanded to several countries abroad such as japan and mexico where next china india mr sinegal we would have to have been living on mars not to recognize that those are two up and coming markets india at the moment has laws that restrict our ability to do business there we think probably that will change eventually chinas got lots of possibilities as well but we dont think theres any big rush to go to china were going to take our time and make sure we know what were doing wsj youve led costco in one capacity or another since its inception who will succeed you mr sinegal we havent established a specific line of succession because in our view that generally doesnt work everybody then starts lobbying and looking sideways we have a great management team and that will never be an issue in this company
