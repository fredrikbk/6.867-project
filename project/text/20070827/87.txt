the credit markets and gave bank of america a foothold in the nations biggest mortgage lender it even brought a swift &# million paper profit as countrywides shares rallied on the news in so doing mr lewis known among bankers for craving respect after a humble childhood finally penetrated a realm that had been denied to him and to his charlotte n c bank despite its size with the high profile deal the year old ceo has emerged as an undisputed peer to the leaders atop the new york banking dynasties citigroup inc and j p morgan chase &amp co in mr lewiss six years as chairman and ceo bank of america has morphed from a buccaneering but provincial bank into one of the very top financial institutions in the u s mr lewis makes no apology for needing to prove something after growing up in army towns and working his way through georgia state university "you had to be a dreamer to think we could do what weve done i had no ivy league background no blue blood parents yet this company allowed me to compete " he said earlier this year he elaborated on his personal drive in an interview yesterday "i know that i have had a chip on my shoulder and collectively the management team has had a chip on their shoulder " he says "maybe i wouldnt call it that anymore but theres still an intensity to move forward and to put distance between us and second place " the son of a soldier and a night shift nurse mr lewis was born in walnut grove miss a place so small he says that you had to go to another town "just to be born " his father moved the family to germany then to the army town of columbus ga before leaving his wife and two children when mr lewis was an adolescent mr lewis made his way through georgia state with jobs at a shoe store an insurance company and as an airline reservation agent graduating in finance he went to work for the only full time employer he has had taking a job as a credit analyst for an obscure lender called north carolina national bank he rose quickly moving every few years as the ambitious bank sought ways to expand in the face of legal barriers to doing business in other states when it found a way to pick up a string of branches in florida each with its own processing system ncnbs swashbuckling chief hugh mccoll jr called in mr lewis in and told him to bring order to the operation "i said when can you go " mr mccoll recalls "he said when you stop talking to me he reported for duty within hours bought a house and told his wife in that order we had a man who knew what had to be done " in florida mr lewis extracted fat margins by consolidating back office operations and through moves like assigning a single account number to each customer for all accounts and branches soon mr mccoll put him to work consolidating the remnants of a large but stumbling texas bank firstrepublic that ncnb acquired with regulators blessings later mr lewis developed a uniform set of procedures that his employer called the model bank a common system enabling a customer in atlanta to walk into a miami branch and access all account data colleagues and friends say he seemed driven by a sometimes manic need to defy his difficult childhood and a belief that bankers from more elite backgrounds viewed him and the north carolina bank with condescension mr lewis "grew up poor and didnt like it " mr mccoll says mr lewis was less charismatic than his gregarious mentor he was seen as a technocrat who lacked warmth in dealing with subordinates say many people who worked with mr lewis "its got to be a little frustrating because of his personality compared to hughs " says pete kight chief executive of checkfree corp which runs bank of americas online check processing "hugh got lots of coverage of all the deals he did but ken has a consummate vision for the bank " mr mccoll began grooming mr lewis as a successor naming him head of the growing banks consumer division and then chief operating officer he became chairman and ceo in april when mr mccoll retired at the mandatory age of the bank mr lewis inherited renamed bank of america after it bought san francisco based bankamerica corp in was the product of an year run of acquisitions by mr mccoll despite its broad network of branches and customers the bank remained far short of citigroup and j p morgan in assets and global reach and reflecting the spate of takeovers it was a tangled mess of back office systems and vestiges of old corporate cultures spotty service and computer foul ups drove some customers away analysts began referring to it as the "beached whale " mr lewis began a ruthless streamlining he cut jobs the first two years he outsourced back office jobs to india closed call centers and reduced the commercial loan business in far flung markets he got out of the subprime lending business citing risk and volatility he also launched a personal overhaul taking lessons in public speaking getting glasses that softened his angular features and practicing a smile not his default expression in just as bank of america was doing a big advertising campaign with the slogan of "higher standards " emphasizing goals for service and integrity it faced shareholder lawsuits related to two corporate scandals the suits accused the bank of helping enron corp inflate earnings and of not performing due diligence on worldcom inc s debt offerings the same year as mr lewis was on a golfing vacation at pebble beach in carmel calif he learned that new yorks attorney general was about to accuse bank of americas asset management unit of a scheme to allow illegal short term or after hours trading in mutual fund shares mr lewis returned to charlotte and called an emergency meeting in his th floor office "we need to get our heads up and get in an action mode " he said according to people present mr lewis dismantled and rebuilt the asset management division forcing out hot shot outsiders hed just wooed bank of america later reached a &# million settlement over the mutual fund accusations the bank also agreed to pay &# million to settle the worldcom shareholder suit and &# million to settle the enron one the crisis posed by the scandals became an opportunity for mr lewis to push forward in reshaping the bank around his vision that vision was to build a nationwide financial services supermarket something other major u s banks had aspired to over two decades but none had quite achieved mr lewis wanted the branch network to reach every major growing market in the u s he wanted ubiquitous atms and the sleekest technology such as free online bill paying mr lewis avoided acquisitions for more than two years of his tenure but in october he agreed to spend &# billion to buy fleetboston financial corp gaining a big beachhead in the northeast he used the fleet network renamed bank of america to invade manhattan in a big way taking the battle to the home turf of j p morgan chase and citigroup with a blitz of branch openings marketing initiatives and a new tower under construction near times square mr lewis set tough performance standards borrowing a concept from retailing he began measuring "same store sales" in all branches open for a certain length of time then a new metric for banks he stepped up an unorthodox plan to implement the six sigma methodology that manufacturers use to minimize errors over his tenure bank of americas annual revenue has more than doubled to more than &# billion its assets have more than doubled to &# trillion and profits have more than tripled to &# billion last year the bank has branches which is two thirds more than its closest retail bank rival wachovia corp and far more than citigroup and chase bank of americas market value has tripled during mr lewiss tenure and now only narrowly trails that of citigroup the largest u s bank by that measure mr lewis has kept his knife sharp in the executive suite continually rotating senior leadership forcing out even former stars after difficulty fitting in or poor results for more than a quarter four of the five top executives at fleet who accepted positions with bank of america left within six months including fleet president eugene mcquade who was unhappy with his limited duties mr mcquade couldnt be reached for comment mr lewis has had four chief financial officers in six years alvaro g de molina who was cfo for months said in an interview he wanted to dispel the idea that mr lewis was difficult to work for "hes not a guy that you get really close to personally but hes a great boss " mr de molina said "he was responsive if you called him you didnt even go to the bathroom because you knew hed call you right back " with all its deals bank of america is now hamstrung by a federal law that bars any bank from making acquisitions that would give it more than of all u s deposits mr lewiss strategy was to stay under but manage away less profitable customers meanwhile he could use the banks large scale to bludgeon competitors such as by using free online stock trades as a loss leader to lure in customers to other bank services to avoid the cap mr lewis sought access to markets outside the u s or in specific lines of business where the bank was small thus he agreed to buy credit card processor mbna corp in june paying &# billion he also became more open to buying partial stakes in big companies rather than taking complete control as the bank had insisted on in the past he acquired a foothold in the nascent chinese credit card market last november he agreed to buy u s trust the private banking arm of charles schwab corp blanketing the u s s biggest markets the bank now can leverage its size in unique ways for instance it avoids competing to offer the best interest rates on certificates of deposits or bank accounts mr lewis bets that convenient branches and atms and gimmicks such as credit cards embossed with national football league logos will attract customers even to lower paying products and bank of america pushes for more fees more than half of its revenue came from fees such as overdraft charges investment banking and wealth management advice bank of america has just boosted the charge for noncustomers to use its atms to &# the highest among major banks this month when countrywide was paralyzed by a lack of access to new credit mr lewis saw an opportunity to grab a piece of the largest u s home lender doing so would let him push further into one of his targeted lines of business and also would cement his profile and that of bank of america in a critical moment for the national economy "it did weigh on him heavily " said j steele alphin chief administrative officer and long mr lewiss closest confidant "he has a responsibility and he had to take on some of that " after a team had spent several days studying countrywides books and negotiating terms mr lewis flew from his aspen colo vacation home to meet with countrywide chairman and ceo angelo mozilo in calabasas calif on aug the two longtime acquaintances signed the deal with bank of america paying &# billion for preferred shares of countrywide that yield dividends and are convertible into a stake in the lender the sale won quick approval from regulators and the companies boards and helped calm the credit markets although countrywides stock jumped how well the deal ultimately will work out for bank of america is unknown amid uncertainties in the mortgage and housing markets bank of america and countrywide announced their agreement just hours after another move that helped ease the broad liquidity crisis bank of america j p morgan citigroup and wachovia following federal reserve encouragement to borrow at its newly reduced discount rate announced they would each borrow &# million from the fed "this is a time that i dont relish in the turmoil of the capital markets because were not immune " mr lewis said yesterday "but it does vindicate the idea that size and scale do matter i see these times as a vindication of our model "
