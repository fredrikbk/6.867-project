cashing out venezuelans chase dollars amid worries over economy some see ways to profit from chavezs controls a poker chip maneuver caracas venezuela like many people they know in caracas these days alfred and norma munoz are bracing for what they believe is inevitable a currency crash brought about by president hugo chavezs policies the middle class couple plan to borrow as much as they can from a local bank and buy an apartment outside the country if venezuelas bolivar plunges against the dollar they figure the loan will be cheap to pay off in dollar terms and the overseas apartment will hold its dollar value "plus it gives you somewhere to flee if things really get bad " says mr munoz who runs a small business at the moment with oil at near record prices venezuelas economy is booming the fourth largest oil exporter to the u s has averaged annual growth since the fastest in latin america three month waits to buy new cars are standard at caracas dealerships amid a boom in consumer financing unemployment has fallen to single digit rates for the first time in more than a decade but there are signs of trouble oil production is falling as the state oil company loses top managers and invests less inflation is running at according to the venezuelan government though many private economists say the rate is more like given the increasing role of a black market in hard to obtain goods partly as a result the bolivar officially fixed at per dollar has lost more than half its value on the black market many locals fear that official devaluation and runaway inflation is inevitable the global credit squeeze caused by mortgage problems in the u s may give venezuelans new reasons to worry thats because oil prices could fall if as some economists fear a world slowdown in lending leads to a broad economic slump declining oil prices would deprive mr chavez of income for his vast social programs and accelerate pressure on the bolivar in decades past currency declines and hyperinflation have reared up across latin america destabilizing governments and spreading misery among ordinary people indeed mr chavezs own rise to power was helped by a financial collapse and soaring inflation under the mid s government of rafael caldera which prompted exasperated voters to back mr chavez in a election if such problems emerge again in venezuela they could erode mr chavezs popularity at home as well as curtail his influence in the region by forcing him to cut back on foreign aid while the bolivar is weakening many other oil nations are watching their currencies get stronger the explanation for the discrepancy lies at least in part in mr chavezs economic policies his attempt to manage the economy for the benefit of the poor has produced unforeseen problems which he has treated with unorthodox solutions that in turn have created new problems with each policy turn people like the munozes have become more convinced things will spin out of control since mr chavez has more than doubled government spending on free medical care higher salaries gasoline subsidies and other services that created more demand for goods and services which fueled inflation in response mr chavez expanded price controls which now cover meat sugar eggs milk and other products that led to food shortages as producers balked at selling their goods at the mandated prices the shortages produced a black market where prices have soared this mixture of food shortages black markets and rising inflation is deja vu for the venezuelans who have lived through three financial meltdowns since the s in the most recent a collapse of a big bank helped bring on a currency crash and inflation that topped in to protect themselves from a repeat venezuelans are trying to get their hands on dollars further weakening the bolivar "we all know what is coming we just dont know when " says david macedo who drives a delivery truck that supplies small grocery stores when he has a few bolivars saved he says he often goes to the caracas airport to buy dollars from arriving tourists he pays far more than the official rate of bolivars per dollar but less than the black market rate now about wealthier venezuelans have discovered they can use credit cards to exploit the difference between official and black market currency rates some have flown to the nearby island of aruba and bought &# worth of gambling chips the maximum overseas credit purchase allowed by the venezuelan government according to a person who arranges the trips they cash in the chips for dollars then back at home buy enough bolivars on the black market to pay off the credit card debt this person says they pocket the rest around &# at current rates more than enough to pay for the trip once locals start expecting a crisis it becomes harder for the government to avoid one such a phenomenon was recently seen in argentina in argentines who lost confidence in their governments ability to avoid debt default began withdrawing their bank deposits en masse ultimately speeding the economic collapse and currency crash they feared in venezuela mr chavez came to power promising to use the countrys oil wealth to benefit the poor his economic problems started after a coup attempt and an oil workers strike the ensuing economic turmoil prompted many venezuelans to take money out of the country which threatened to bring down the banking system mr chavez stopped the capital flight by banning overseas money transfers and dollar purchases when oil prices rose mr chavez sharply increased spending which helped him win crucial votes in and but the capital controls trapped new spending inside venezuela more than quadrupling the amount of bolivars in circulation the bloated money supply undermined the bolivar and fueled inflation the chavez government realizes the dangers and vows to tamp down inflation before it gets out of control in july it required banks to pay customers higher interest on deposits in hopes of making the bolivar more attractive and encouraging savings but the new rate is only about half the inflation rate finance minister rodrigo cabezas says the government will moderate spending for the first time in years and will keep the official exchange rate unchanged at least through "we have no plans for devaluation " he says few economists who follow venezuela are forecasting deep financial trouble soon at least while oil prices remain high but the longer term prognosis is far from clear mark weisbrot co director of the center for economic and policy research a washington think tank who is generally supportive of mr chavez says the government has time to boost economic growth by investing in industries outside the oil sector other economists are more skeptical they contend that the government isnt making enough long term investments such as building factories and that it remains far too dependent on oil revenue "we dont know when a crash will happen " says alberto ramos a senior latin america economist at goldman sachs "but chavez is driving down the wrong side of the road " many venezuelans are preparing for the worst mr chavezs control of the legislature courts and military means its unlikely the government will alter its current economic course in mid august mr chavez proposed constitutional reforms that would end the autonomy of the countrys central bank and eliminate presidential term limits a move critics say is his bid to become president for life at the extreme concerns about the future have prompted thousands of better off venezuelans to leave the country in recent years for miami and such oil centers as houston and alberta canada next year mr chavez plans to relaunch the bolivar minus three zeros and with a new name the "strong bolivar " for months the government insisted that the currency "reconversion" would solve many of the countrys ills such as inflation the plan was widely disparaged and in july a senior chavez official acknowledged that it "will have no primary effect on the inflation phenomenon " while inflation always hurts the poor by eating into their purchasing power some of mr chavezs policies to curtail it are helping bankers securities brokers and other wealthy venezuelans a chavez plan to bolster venezuelas currency by selling dollar denominated government bonds has largely backfired the government figured that asking venezuelans to buy the bonds with bolivars would take the currency out of circulation boosting its value shrewd buyers realized they could get the dollar bonds from the government at the official exchange rate then resell them on the official caracas exchange where the bonds trade at prices much closer to the currencys higher black market rate the government tried to give small investors first dibs on the bonds by saying that orders by private individuals for less than &# would be filled first brokerage firms paid maids doormen and laborers about &# each to sign over their rights to the bonds says pedro torres a middleman who is paid by brokerages to find working class venezuelans willing to turn over their rights to the bonds he says he signed up for the last bond sale earlier this year savvy venezuelans have also used the dollar bonds to speculate against the bolivar purchasing bonds with loans from local banks they sold enough at black market rates to pay off the loans pocketing the difference by exploiting the gap between the central banks rate and the market rate investors have in effect taken free dollars at the expense of venezuelan reserves the downward pressure on the currency doesnt end there because the chavez administrations bank regulations have kept loans cheap venezuelans have an incentive to borrow not only to buy bonds but other goods as well they take out loans to buy big ticket items such as dishwashers or expensive watches that will keep their value these loans too pump new cash into circulation counteracting the governments anti inflationary goal "chavez is the first president to publicize organize and incite a run on his own currency " said alejandro grisanti an economist who opposes mr chavez he estimates that at least two thirds of the governments last dollar bond issue was bought on credit including the ones he bought for himself venezuelas finance ministry declined a request for comment at a crowded fiat dealership in caracass posh las mercedes neighborhood would be buyers add their names to three month waiting lists they are so eager to purchase they dont care what model or color they get as long as they get it soon says sales manager beatriz machado some used fiats sell for more than new ones because they are available on the spot she says "they dont want a car they want a place to put their money " says ms machado who wears a red blouse and earrings to show her support for mr chavez whom she credits with helping the poor she too has doubts about the economy and says she spends her bolivars quickly using a bolivar loan she bought an apartment and a car recently she says she loaded up on imported champagne and whiskey the biggest losers may be the poor many of whom are mr chavezs supporters antonio buitrago a year old cab driver credits mr chavez with helping his son to walk again last year after the young man was badly injured in a car crash the government paid for medical treatment including a rehabilitation trip to cuba "i trust chavez is going to take care of me " mr buitrago says but mr buitrago says his life is getting more difficult these days he is among what a local pollster estimates are the of venezuelans whove had trouble finding milk and chicken this year he cant afford black market prices for scarce goods so he stands in long lines at markets that sell subsidized foods he deposits his savings in a bank where its being eaten away by inflation saying buying dollars on the black market would be unpatriotic at a recent "expo credito" in caracas lines curled around the conference hall upper middle class caracas residents waited alongside men in army and fire rescue uniforms to sign up for credit cards the conference slogan "credit for everything " denis naranjo an engineer said hes considering his options he wants to take out a loan but isnt sure whether to buy real estate or cars what he really needs he says is a bank account in the u s "in venezuela things are always changing " he explains "you need to have a plan and you need to be flexible " raul gallegos contributed to this article
