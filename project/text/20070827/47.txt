firms get creative to work around visa bottlenecks janet reardon wants to hire a senior engineer for her companys los angeles office but first she has to send him to canada thats because the engineer an indian now working in kuwait is among tens of thousands of educated foreigners offered jobs in the u s this year but unable to get visas ms reardon a human resource manager at corrpro cos inc has asked the corrosion prevention firms canadian unit to take on the engineer until the company can reapply for a visa next year but no one is particularly happy about that the engineer with years experience would rather move to southern california corrpros canadian managers are reluctant to hire an employee they might lose in months and ms reardon cant be sure that next year will bring the coveted visa but she persists because corrosion specialists are rare "its like hitting the jackpot " she says "corrosion is not the sexiest industry " as opponents worry about foreigners undercutting well paid american workers and debate continues over reshaping u s immigration laws companies like corrpro are quietly taking matters into their own hands with elaborate workarounds to retain foreign job applicants who cant get visas since the u s has limited the number of so called h bs three year visas for skilled workers with college degrees to per year an additional visas are available for applicants with advanced degrees from u s schools the quota was originally set in the early s and was boosted temporarily to meet soaring demand particularly for technology workers earlier this decade when jobs dried up after the tech bust pressure faded to keep higher caps now companies are claiming they need more workers again but disagreement on how to fix the broader immigration system including what to do with undocumented workers is bogging down change in it took about months to reach the cap last year it took just under two months this year the cap was reached the first day applications were accepted in april that forced the government for the first time to hold a lottery to allocate all of the visas which take effect oct about half of the applicants missed out including the indian engineer ms reardon wants to hire and one of corrpros three other h b applicants the visa squeeze leaves companies scrambling for ways to retain valuable job candidates including using other types of visas and temporary overseas assignments google inc which filed more than h b applications this year says it will send new hires who didnt get visas to overseas offices until it can try again next year many of the intel corp job candidates who failed to get h bs will stay in school and try for the visa next year while intel holds open the jobs one will work abroad for a year then plans to come to the u s on a different visa some companies say they are moving jobs overseas in response to the restrictions chip maker analog devices inc says it will hire more engineers in countries like canada and india next year boosting the share of its engineers overseas to from national semiconductor corp which has design centers in india china and taiwan says some job candidates from those countries who didnt get h bs are being offered positions at home microsoft corp which was the third biggest user of h b visas issued in the fiscal year ended sept plans to open a new development center next month in richmond british columbia miles from its redmond wash headquarters largely in response to the u s visa rules many of the initial employees failed to get h b visas this year a microsoft spokesman says "addressing this issue has been the no priority for this office " says jack krumhold who runs microsofts government affairs office in washington d c critics of h b visas say employers use them to replace well paid u s workers with cheaper foreigners ron hira an assistant professor of public policy at the rochester institute of technology says big information technology outsourcing firms such as infosys technologies ltd and wipro ltd of india gobble up a disproportionate number of them applying for thousands of visas to hire low level technical workers for their u s offices the practice contributes to the visa shortage and displaces americans mr hira says mr hira an electrical engineer by training urges better policing of rules requiring h b workers be paid market wages and an added condition that companies be required to first look for u s workers infosys and wipro referred questions on their h b practices to industry associations jeff lande senior vice president at the information technology association of america says the companies already follow h b rules that mandate that companies pay prevailing wages he adds that this years h b application figures show there wouldnt be enough visas to satisfy demand even without the indian firms employers who use h bs say they arent trying to save money they say they incur significant expenses to obtain foreign workers with much needed skills intel and microsoft say they budget several thousand dollars in legal fees for each foreign hire to cover an h b visa and a permanent residency permit the expense soars when companies have to park people like corrpros indian engineer in other countries while navigating visa issues leslie dahan an immigration lawyer at littler mendelson pc says one client spends &# for each employee it sends on an offshore assignment ms dahan says one client this year shifted a korean hire to its u k branch another asked an indian to work from the netherlands at intel which hired littler mendelson to handle its employees visa applications ms dahan started warning managers in march that h bs would be tight this year she urged them to file applications the first day they would be accepted april intel filed more than applications that day but of those prospects lost out in the lottery ms dahan then counseled intels hiring managers on their options for unsuccessful visa candidates crafting "decision trees" to help managers navigate tricky immigration rules the next round of visas wont take effect until october so managers had to find alternatives to cover roughly months prospective employees leaving u s colleges for example could legally work in the u s for a year if that employee gets the h b in that would still likely leave them a gap of a few months before the visas take effect in october of that year ms dahan says during those months the employees could return to school to legally stay in the u s take a leave of absence and leave the country or work abroad other prospective hires were urged to delay graduation until the fall so they could work in the u s until october at least people took that route others enrolled in an advanced degree program sometimes their second in order to stay in school until the company could reapply for an h b next year says ms dahan where those alternatives werent practical intel managers considered sending candidates abroad says margie jones intels u s immigration manager managers had to weigh whether intel had an appropriate overseas office whether the job could be done remotely and whether the business division could afford the expense in some cases managers rescinded job offers ms jones says ms dahan points out that the alternative strategies have a big flaw they assume intels foreign job candidates will be more successful in getting h bs next year
