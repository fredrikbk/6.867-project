mirror mirror on the wall what is the fairest tax of all in response to bruce bartletts op ed "fairtax flawed tax " aug let me say that the fairtax is only flawed if you keep the government the same size or make it bigger than it is now the purpose of the fairtax is to get the government out of areas it has no business being in places it was only able to move into by collecting income taxes and incurring a large amount of debt the flaw in this article is that it insists on a double standard what would the income tax rate be if the government did not treat social security taxes as regular tax revenue what would it be if the government wasnt allowed to carry a lot of long term debt truthfully under any new system the government should reduce spending i also disagree that any provision is needed to make the fairtax less regressive like their government most americans need to reduce spending a big sales tax would be a good incentive for americans to save more because it would penalize them for shopping states with sales taxes collect not only their own but local sales taxes as well i do not see any complaints about their inability to do so the only reason states have added income taxes is that residents wont accept an increase in sales taxes so instead they have ended up with both the national sales tax should be set at and the government can just suffer until it is back to where it should have been in the first place and if more than a few bureaucrats at treasury are forced to go earn a living in the private sector all the better simon jackson katy texas mr bartlett notes that the fairtax would also apply to home sales pushing real estate prices up well i for one would rather pay extra for my home than pay property taxes each year that give the government the ability to seize my home if i fall on hard financial times with the fairtax once my home was paid for it would truly be mine and i would not have to rent it from the government a consumption tax is obviously the only real fair tax whereas an income tax punishes the values that americans hold dear namely hard work and enterprise isnt it disturbing that in order to replace the income tax with a consumption tax the government would need to impose a sales tax to collect the same amount of revenue it is collecting now since the fairtax is designed to be "revenue neutral " this means if mr bartletts numbers are correct that the government is taking a very large portion of our income now no wonder it is becoming harder and harder to succeed in the land of the free michael rushton baker ore the fairtax is an idea new to most voters and i find mr bartlett much too willing to dismiss the concept with his very complicated for me reasoning i found a clearer explanation on the heritage foundations web site however the subject will need much more research on the part of the american public before accepting or dismissing it so quickly i urge people not to be lazy in the pursuit of knowledge regarding this idea sharon m robinson fountain hills ariz mr bartletts analysis may be perfectly accurate but it fails to note several important benefits of the fairtax that would argue for its passage the fairtax would allow us to see exactly how much money the government raises it would eliminate the underground economy it would give the individual more control over how much tax he or she pays than is possible in the current system finally under the fairtax spending and tax increases would be easier to control if congress had to vote to increase a general sales tax rate i understand mr bartletts fears i just see benefits too maybe its time to be bold robert french valencia calif heres a really radical idea the progressive income tax we already have may well be the fairest tax available short of simply eliminating all taxes after all as study after study year after year has shown the truly wealthy pay the largest percentage of the total taxes collected i live in income tax free tennessee where subsistence earners pay almost sales tax on essential items and the wealthy sock away savings tax free fair must be the legislature wont consider creating an income tax or could that be because only wealthy people can afford lobbyists tim sousley columbia tenn
