growth in payrolls slowed and initial claims for unemployment compensation rose with the exception of workers with specialized skills who are in short supply there isnt much evidence that the softness in temp employment reflects a new widespread eagerness to hire workers on a permanent basis among workers "people are scared right at the moment " said bill trimmer years old a former information technology worker in pittsburgh who has had nearly temp assignments over the past three years but has found fewer opportunities recently "if people arent looking for help if theyre just trying to retrench and retrench and retrench it doesnt pay my bills " businesses generally are believed to dismiss temps before cutting their permanent workers while temporary staffing firms sense more caution from clients they note the shift isnt severe "its sluggish were not hearing from people that the slowdown is going to be so acute that it could be a precursor to a recession " said richard wahlquist

the firms vice president of operations midwests business typically spikes around this time of year requiring more temps as customers prepare for the holiday season mr holland said but that hasnt happened so far "our business has somewhat leveled out " he said "usually its going crazy right now " the weakness in demand for temps lately has been most pronounced for lower skilled office workers and for workers at factories and construction sites that has been offset in part by strong demand for professional services such as accountants and computer specialists professional workers accounted for almost &# billion of the temp sectors &# billion in revenues last year according to staffing industry analysts inc a research firm in los altos calif "the economy is taking its toll on all these segments a little bit but the professional side is doing quite a bit better " said jon osborne the companys research director the temp downturn is particularly acute in the midwest and south areas with heavy industrial activity despite the recent strength of manufacturing the industrial temp business the first to suffer could be the first to rebound "thats the function of a lot of industrial temporary labor to absorb the shock of temporary change " mr osborne said larger companies seem to be cutting expenses more than in previous expansions and many have improved productivity enough to reduce labor needs said carl camden chief executive of kelly services because the temp and overall job markets havent tracked closely in recent months the weakness in temp hiring could be a false indicator "nobody has ever seen this type of a pause in temp employment growth " mr camden said "this is just an unusual array of numbers in general when youve had a long flat period its followed either by a sharp increase or a sharp decrease " some analysts are raising questions about the ability of the bureau of labor statistics to track employment in rapidly changing sectors such as residential construction "traditionally temp employment has been a very good indicator of broad payroll trends " said economist ray stone of stone &amp mccarthy research associates "this time it may be that the lags are very long or it may be that theres something wrong the payroll numbers " mr trimmer the pittsburgh temp was doing database work at a small tech company from last fall until may
