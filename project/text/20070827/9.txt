bond insurers see ill winds batter shares selloff appears hasty as biggest firms face limited subprime risk when a hurricane slams into florida investors dump shares of companies that insure homes when a storm of defaults engulfs the bond market investors naturally sell the companies that insure bonds in both cases the selloffs are often overdone as the bond market mess grew this summer investors dropped shares of the largest insurers ambac financial group inc took the biggest hit falling from the beginning of the year mbia inc fell and assured guaranty ltd slid "the selloffs from the stock are unprecedented in their speed " said heather hunt an analyst at citi while the share prices have since rallied from their lows they remain down for the year and their valuations are right near their historic lows bond insurance companies guarantee debt securities for a premium they agree that if a bond defaults they will assume the principal and payments throughout the life of the bond saving the bond issuer from shouldering the debt they tend to be choosy about the level of risk they will insure but with the recent subprime fallout investors are afraid that guarantors havent been discerning enough these companies are used to investors hitting the panic button after the sept terror attacks and hurricane katrina in the market also dropped bond insurance shares anticipating that the guarantors would post huge losses none did but it didnt calm the markets jitters right away "their stocks tend to be volatile in times where there is an event that people cant get their arms around they assume its only the beginning of similar events " said dick smith an analyst at standard &amp poors ratings services investors may have been too hasty in dumping shares this time too some analysts say these companies had minimal exposure to subprime residential mortgages according to a report by tamara kravec an analyst at banc of america securities and because they typically apply tougher underwriting standards and hold higher grade portfolios than the rest of the market they should fare better than the overall market in terms of losses that isnt to say shares of these companies will follow a smooth slope upward bond insurers will most likely have to shoulder losses for some mortgage securities and things may look bad at different periods but ultimately their payments which will be spread out over a long period will be manageable "the business model of the bond insurance companies is that they worry about the actual payments theyre going to make going forward as opposed to mark to market hits " said matt sauer a portfolio manager at ariel capital management llc the largest investor in assured guaranty "its a potential that theyre going to sustain some losses but theyre going to weather this " wall streets biggest concern in the subprime meltdown is those mortgages written in and when lending standards were most lax mbia one of the largest insurers stopped underwriting subprime mortgages in unless they were rated triple a meaning they would be least likely to default the company holds &# billion in direct subprime residential mortgage backed securities equal to about of its total portfolio "in general we are pretty comfortable with our subprime exposure " said chuck chaplin mbias chief financial officer assured guaranty officials

double a in and triple b plus the following year sean leonard ambacs chief financial officer said the company was "comfortable" with its exposure considering that "virtually all the transactions in those portfolios" had investment grade ratings in a "worst case" scenario by banc of americas ms kravec these insurers would have losses of less than of their claims paying resources that scenario assumes that the companies portfolios arent diversified and that the collateralized debt obligations they insured would be wiped out all at once which is very unlikely for mbia that would mean a loss of of book value for assured guaranty it would be of book and for ambac of book but in the far more likely base case scenario mbias losses would be negligible assured guarantys would be of book and ambacs of book these numbers are far better than the worst case scenario because guarantors arent required to post collateral for mark to market losses so even if a bond they have insured defaults they pay only the principal and payments over the life of the bond while these companies stocks have recovered a bit from their plunge a few weeks ago they are still cheap compared with their
