energy a special report not enough environmentalists say companies could be doing a lot more to cut back their use of energy businesses may be making some progress in implementing energy efficiency measures but most have a long way to go environmental advocates say many companies have not even undertaken the most simple energy saving steps such as installing more efficient fluorescent lighting and optimizing their air conditioning systems these groups say "companies are leaving a lot of opportunities on the table " says mark brownstein the managing director of business projects for the climate and air program at environmental defense a new york based environmental group adds david hamilton global warming and energy director for the sierra club the san francisco based environmental group "businesses are kind of like the rest of the country in that they have traditionally underestimated what energy costs are " industrial and commercial businesses can use a variety of tools to cut their energy usage such as injecting highly insulating foam into wall cavities and using appliances that meet the u s department of energys energy star efficiency standard the energy star designation is given to a wide range of appliances used in commercial settings including computers copier and fax machines printers water coolers fans heating air conditioning and lighting systems one of the basic and overlooked measures companies can take to reduce their energy use is to replace older incandescent or fluorescent bulbs with newer fluorescent tubes that use less energy to produce more light says bill prindle the deputy director of the american council for an energy efficient economy a washington d c lobbying group newer bulbs cut energy demand by about paying for themselves within months mr prindle says "weve routinely seen building owners realize to in operating cost savings from relatively low cost noninvasive measures " he says companies should also evaluate whether they can use less lighting than they use currently says david goldstein the director of the energy program for the national resources defense council the washington d c based environmental advocacy group "businesses need to look at things like how many lights are on at a m and why " mr goldstein says "companies often have inefficient lighting systems whether its having lights in the wrong places or failing to shut off lights when theyre not doing anything " businesses also do not do enough to optimize their heating air conditioning and ventilation systems says environmental defenses mr brownstein because these systems are operating even when they are not needed more careful monitoring and adjustment of hvac controls can result in significant energy savings he says companies that are serious about cutting their energy use should hire an expert to perform an energy audit suggests the alliance to save energy a washington based lobbying group an electrical and gas use audit for example generally available through a companys local utility will show current use and indicate what steps can be taken to achieve reductions "audits are very effective in determining what the most cost effective measures are for a particular company " says kateri callahan president of the alliance to save energy larger industrial energy customers can benefit by hiring in house energy efficiency experts or outside consultants mr goldstein says such experts can help companies to realign their manufacturing or business processes to generate the highest level of energy savings "very often in an industrial plant youll find that if you look at the operation as whole you can find different ways of setting up the process where you get substantial energy savings in some cases up to " mr goldstein says "most managers are so caught up in the day to day operations that they dont have time to think about energy efficiency " ms buurma is a staff reporter for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j she can be reached at christine buurma dowjones com
