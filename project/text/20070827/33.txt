energy a special report crude conversation tesoros ceo talks about the refining industrys future and his companys place in it under chief executive bruce smith tesoro corp has transformed itself from a relatively small oil and gas producer into one of the biggest independent refiners in the u s the company has multiplied its earnings by more than times over the past years in recent quarters profit has been better than ever as a shortage of gasoline supply has pushed refining margins or the difference between the price refiners pay for oil and the prices their fuels fetch to unprecedented levels but high gasoline prices also have generated outrage from consumers and congress which is pushing to curb gasoline consumption and after almost a yearlong lull oil prices recently hit record highs squeezing refining margins still the year old mr smith is betting on the strength of the refining sector in the long term he believes producers will keep finding and producing oil and that american drivers will continue to fill their tanks with gasoline for decades to come while some refiners are selling assets and returning cash to their shareholders tesoro is expanding its operations the company recently completed the &# billion purchase of a refinery in los angeles and more than retail stations from royal dutch shell plc tesoro also is adding stations purchased from usa petroleum corp earlier this year mr smith talked with the wall street journal about tesoros transformation and the future of the refining industry here are edited excerpts the wall street journal why did you decide to transform tesoro from an oil company into a refiner mr smith we didnt have the skills to go out and be competitive in the exploration and production business it had been the strength of the company but we were going to have to rebuild it i just didnt see how we could do it we had one refinery that was in alaska that was very successful this was before refining became as popular as today but this was a niche refinery in a market serving a purpose and we saw an opportunity to take that one refinery and potentially build the company around it wsj refining is now a better business and refineries are selling for a lot of money why are you buying when prices are high mr smith our view is that the demand for petroleum products is going to continue to increase just as it has over time thats partially population growth around the world partially economic prosperity partially things that you dont think about such as people living in san francisco farther and farther out so that theyre commuting greater distances and standing in traffic for longer periods of time and there isnt significant expansion today in refining capacity if you translate that into the longer term you have to believe that the difference between the price of crude and what petroleum products as a whole will trade for will continue to be at least at these levels and probably larger so that makes buying a refinery today which you still can buy at a discount to actually building a new one a pretty good proposition wsj are you worried that new refining capacity in the middle east and asia will increase world supply and lower refining margins mr smith most of the refineries that we would buy would have been paid for before that supply hits the world markets does it concern us it does but if those refineries dont get built the price of refined products will probably be so high that it will start to curb demand if you look at the demand growth we actually need some refineries to be built weve taken that into account and it still looks to be a healthy business certainly for longer than five to seven years and it could be to years wsj why have you chosen not to use your brand in your recently acquired retail stations mr smith shell has a great brand very widely recognized they have a loyal customer base if i took down all those shell signs and put up a tesoro sign it would be a new brand in the marketplace and many people might drive across the street to buy chevron because its a recognized brand it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to rebrand a station and youre liable to lose the trade that was associated with the product the same thing is true with usa petroleum our approach is more brand neutral lets just get product to the customer and not be so sensitive about whether our name appears on every street corner wsj refining margins have been at unprecedented highs due to limited gasoline supply and relatively cheap oil now oil is rising again what can you do if oil prices stay at current levels mr smith were no different than any other refiner in the sense of whether youve got a million barrels or barrels of capacity ours is barrels right now and conceptually were buying every single day barrels we have very little flexibility around what the initial price of our products is going to be because were buying in the world market thats one of the disadvantages of our business if crude continues to go up youre going to have higher and higher prices hopefully we dont have &# a barrel crude because at a certain point that will set a new level for gasoline prices and that will eventually curtail demand wsj consumers are very unhappy about high gasoline prices what do you have to say to them mr smith i understand consumers being unhappy about it people have had to make changes in their lifestyle and nobody likes that in the past the industry hasnt done as good a job of trying to explain what is happening in gasoline prices weve done our share with employees weve taken our message out to some of the very sensitive markets to try to make sure our employees understand why gasoline prices are where they are in large part so that they dont feel bad about working for the company weve done that with media theres this feeling that were somehow artificially raising prices but you cant manipulate the market the consumer moves the market the consumer has the power to either buy the product or not to if he doesnt buy it the product accumulates youve got more supply and prices come down were on the right road to try and educate people on what they can do letting them know more in advance of what could change price structure but we dont control it we buy crude oil we manufacture it and we put it back in the marketplace and in the middle we make a plus return its not egregious its not a secret wsj why were gasoline prices so high earlier this summer even if the price of crude oil was down mr smith recently we had so many of the refineries down for maintenance last year there were changes that were happening in fuel standards and people put off maintenance programs until this year supply was down demand was up and the margin above crude was higher when i bought the crude oil i may have paid &# a barrel and im not going to process that crude for days i have no idea what the price of crude actually is going to be on the day that i process the product and put that particular crude in the form of products into the marketplace thats why youre buying crude no matter what the price is and you sell product no matter what the price of the crude was when you bought it we dont control the price of crude we dont control the supply and demand wsj how big is the threat that hostility toward refiners will be transformed into laws that limit your business mr smith in the past the government has made regulations that probably exacerbated the problem but it is realizing that in some ways it has become its own worst enemy every time they ratchet it up a notch they constrain more supply for instance today one of the reasons that refineries arent going to get built is because theres so much talk that in years were going to have all alternative fuels whos going to build a big refinery if you cant get a payout by continually perpetuating a myth that were going to have an enormous supply of alternative fuels you dont solve the immediate problem because nobodys going to invest that type of money wsj what will american drivers be using as fuel years from now mr smith if you look at the larger picture adjustments will be necessary youre going to have a little bit of hybrids a little bit of conservation youre going to have a little bit more ethanol all of that is needed to be able to continue to have a balance if you have growing demand but i dont think the world will be a lot different relative to the consumption of our products in years its going to take a long time to find the technology and to figure out how to distribute it we have an infrastructure here in the united states that distributes petroleum products to duplicate that on a large scale will take more time ms campoy is a staff reporter in
