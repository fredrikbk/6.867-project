talking trash tokyo residents feud over junk controversial new rules add to the confusion banana peels at the door tokyo its one of the most heated topics in tokyo what kind of trash can be burned yoshino iwase was sure styrofoam trays the kind meats come packaged in could be thrown out with burnable garbage but her neighbors "kept bringing my trash bags back and leaving them on my front doorstep with a note" saying styrofoam isnt burnable says the year old human resources executive "it smelled pretty bad " ms iwase says she was relieved when she eventually moved apartments technically ms iwases neighbors were right tokyos rigid trash rules used to consider styrofoam trays along with things like rubber rain boots plastic and the tin foil wrappers from candy bars too harmful or difficult to burn but in a controversial overhaul beginning this fall the city is changing the rules to widely expand the number of items that can be burned in the citys giant incinerators at a time when recycling has moved to the forefront of environmental debates in the u s tokyos measures may sound like a contradiction already japan burns about of its garbage compared with in the u s and has two thirds of the worlds waste incinerators but land scarce tokyo faces a dire situation its running out of places to put its trash decades of fervent consuming have left tokyo with one remaining landfill and its filling up fast recycling isnt enough at current rates tokyo will run out of space to put garbage in years government officials say after that some sanitation workers say the only place to dump trash will be in the citys limited number of public parks a horrifying thought for many "were trying to get to the point where almost everything is either recycled or burned " says junichirou kondou a city sanitation manager who holds a page reference book on japans nationwide policies on garbage the new trash rules could prolong the life of the landfill by at least years he says after a six year investigation city engineers concluded most of tokyos giant incinerators could handle burning additional types of garbage without damaging the facilities or releasing harmful fumes whats more they said burning plastic actually raises the overall temperature and helps burn other trash faster but tokyos tactics have enraged environmentalists who say burning trash is an antiquated and dangerous way to dispose of garbage toshikazu fujioka a representative of the citizens against chemical pollution in japan a nonpartisan group says that while the japanese have made incinerators safer the citys decision to burn plastic rubber and other materials will cause facilities to release even more harmful dioxins and carbon emissions into the air plus it leaves piles of toxic ash that must be disposed of "yes weve got to decrease the use of landfills in tokyo but we should do it with a comprehensive recycling program and by getting the public to reduce the amount of trash it produces " mr fujioka says city officials insist incinerators dont emit harmful fumes and that engineers are constantly monitoring the facilities to make sure they continue to be safe toxic ash they say is stored in airtight compartments and is not hazardous to the public many of tokyos wards are going on a public relations blitz handing out fliers in japanese english chinese and korean assuring residents that incinerators are safe the shibuya ward in western tokyo is offering school field trips called "getting to know your incinerator" that publicize safety measures workers take the building is kept so clean visitors must take off their shoes and wear plastic booties so they do not bring in outside dirt still mari sekizawa isnt looking forward to the new rules the year old advertising executive already has three trash bins recyclables combustibles noncombustibles in her kitchen "i was just getting used to it " says ms sekizawa the new rules she says are "so annoying " under these rules rain boots can be tossed out with the burnables but only if theyre under centimeters or about inches a separate rule categorizes trash over centimeters as oversized garbage to be collected separately and sold at a public auction leather loafers and belts can soon be burned but metal buckles must be detached and tossed with nonburnables whats more each of tokyos wards has a different set of rules so while plastic detergent bottles must be taken out with burnable trash in shinagawa ward a few miles away in shibuya they must be emptied cleaned and recycled tokyo has done its part to catch cheaters in the city forbade opaque plastic bags and made residents use clear plastic bags in part to make it easier for trash collectors to see if separation rules are being followed but that led to a spike in the population of black jungle crows which feed on garbage they spot in the clear plastic bags so in the city handed out bright blue nets for residents to guard their trash in the plastic bags there are no fines to punish offenders thats because tokyo can rely on neighbors ire to keep everyone in check sanitation workers can refuse to collect garbage that is improperly separated or taken out on the wrong day or left in the wrong place this adds to the shame of the culprit since neighbors will see that the bag wasnt collected that day according to ryouichi sawachi a year old maintenance man in charge of trash at a tokyo apartment complex a messy communal area sends a message that residents dont obey the rules which can lead to crime and property devaluation "a persons morality is really tested when it comes to disposal of trash " mr sawachi says punishment takes various forms when year old apparel maker asami sakurai moved to tokyo from yokohama in she didnt know which days to take out her burnable and nonburnable trash so a neighbor showed her laying a bag full of banana peels toilet paper rolls and soggy rice cakes out neatly on ms sakurais front doorstep hideo hotoda head of sanitation in the shibuya ward says he will follow the current rules until the new ones kick in in october but he cringes every time he tosses out plastic tofu containers and detergent bottles with nonburnables that will fill up precious landfill space when he actually knows these items can be burned "im very conflicted " mr hotoda sighs "i guess its a case of knowing too much "
