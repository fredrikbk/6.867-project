romneycare at the most recent republican presidential debate on august mitt romney said on health care "we have to have our citizens insured and were not going to do that by tax exemptions because the people that dont have insurance arent paying taxes what you have to do is what we did in massachusetts " well maybe not in florida on friday the former bay state governor laid out in detail his plan for overhauling the health care system its main emphasis was on federalism allowing the states to work out their own approaches to do so theyd get some crucial free market assistance from a romney administration including efforts to deregulate the private insurance markets and even reform the tax code so this is a step forward for mr romney on health policy largely because it doesnt take massachusetts as its model though he still regards that states "universal" health insurance program as one of his signal achievements as governor his new proposal drops the most coercive elements such as the individual mandate and the "pay or play" sanctions on businesses perhaps this intellectual progress is due to the influence of new romney advisers glenn hubbard and john cogan both respected health care economists in his new plan mr romney would address the core problem distortions introduced by the tax code businesses are allowed to deduct the cost of providing health insurance to their employees but individuals cant do the same this bias creates third party payer problems for the insured and raises prices for everyone else the romney plan would allow those who purchase policies on the individual market to fully deduct all premiums deductibles and copays thus restoring the tax parity of health dollars it would also offer incentives for health savings accounts which set aside pre tax dollars for medical expenses and it would include medical malpractice reform with teeth specialized health courts and caps on punitive and non economic damages also constructive is mr romneys proposal to turn todays open ended medicaid entitlement into federal block grants to the states and do likewise for federal uncompensated care funds that would give states maximum flexibility to tailor health plans to their own needs mr romney hopes the states will create plans to cover the lower to middle income uninsured and ideally to help them buy their own private policies this pool of federal money would also be leverage to persuade states to make insurance more affordable in practice that means doing away with the costly mandates and regulations that many states have imposed its a good idea but we question the willingness of states to actually do so given that the government health trend has been toward increased centralization and intervention in the marketplace that was one of the greatest limitations of governor romneys plan massachusetts did not deregulate before requiring individuals to acquire insurance rather than forcing people to buy plans approved by their state a better idea would be to allow insurers to sell plans across state lines this would retain the federalist approach but individuals could choose which state regulations to buy into creating a "regulatory marketplace " we suspect thered be an insurance exodus from massachusetts which for instance requires plans to cover chiropractic services and in vitro fertilization one key difference with rudy giuliani who has also proposed similar changes to the tax code is that the former new york mayor would allow for interstate insurance and mr romney would not mr romney says that the logistical difficulties would become a "camels nose" for national insurance regulations maybe so but that is always a risk with federalism a far worse camels nose is the "universal" plan mr romney championed in massachusetts as democratic presidential candidate john edwards put it "if universal health care was good enough for massachusetts why isnt it good enough for the rest of the country " its not an unfair question mr romneys bay state legacy is now praised by liberals as a prototype for national policy thats done a great deal to set back the kind of tax reform that he now espouses the issue for gop primary voters to consider is why he went in such a different direction in boston granted a mere governor couldnt restructure the federal tax code and he was dealing with a far left legislature yet his willingness to compromise in massachusetts on core matters of principle and then trumpet those statist policies as a "free market" solution raises questions about how far and easily hed bend to a democratic congress mr romneys conversion to free market health care thinking is nonetheless welcome assuming he believes it
