energy a special report producers going deep big oil companies see the gulf of mexico as expensive and one of the last places available to them as geopolitical turmoil makes big oils portfolio more risky the gulf of mexico is fast becoming the energy worlds savings bonds while its unlikely to match expanding production in west africa or the middle east the area is immune to sudden shocks that come from working under unpredictable governments that control most reserves world wide companies are snapping up drilling rights in the gulf on a scale not seen since the late s when heavy bidding was fueled by the first hard evidence of deep waters oil drilling potential and a lower tax rate the hope of discovering the next half billion barrel oil field is still a big lure but for the international oil companies that rule the gulf the new oil rush has as much to do with the lack of options elsewhere as the size of undiscovered reserves the deep water gulf is one of the last places where independent oil companies can get first crack at untapped oil relatively free of competition from national oil companies backed by increasingly aggressive host governments and that sort of security is enough to trump skyrocketing development costs bureaucratic hurdles and mounting evidence that the gulfs oil will prove far more difficult to extract than expected "there is a persistent belief that big oil can increase supplies anytime " conocophillips chief executive jim mulva said in a july speech before the u s chamber of commerce "but most of the worlds oil is controlled by exporting nations so there is a great deal of international competition for opportunities to develop" whats left houston based conoco which owns a large amount of territory in the gulf but performs very little exploration or production work plans to increase its holdings in the area over the next couple of years when swaths of territory in the gulf that sold in the record leasing of the late s come up for sale again companies have years to drill in a parcel before the rights go back up for sale but with demand for rigs outstripping supply not all promising prospects have been explored "it is likely that many high quality leases will expire without being tested " says a may report by the u s minerals management service the agency that regulates production in federal waters and sells oil exploration rights to companies the agency plans to hold two new auctions later this year providing an opportunity for more companies to jump in if oil companies production forecasts pan out the gulfs production should increase by million barrels by according to government estimates thats the first domestic increase in production in years but its smaller than a projected million barrel increase over the same period in angola or million barrels in nigeria two other regions where offshore production is expanding but to meet those forecasts oil companies are going to have to travel down a long expensive path the last decade of exploration was made possible by breakthroughs in seismic imaging in the late s a technique used to create an underground map that can highlight likely oil and gas reserves seismic technology had been around for decades but a thick layer of salt beneath the gulf floor had made accurate imaging impossible improving seismic techniques and billions spent on drilling have yielded dozens of discoveries but the salt still gets in the way companies often dont know exactly what theyll find under the salt until after theyve built a multibillion dollar platform and start producing others have faced issues with equipment for instance chevron corp the largest acreage holder in the deep water gulf recently delayed first production at its tahiti field miles south of new orleans from mid after discovering problems with shackles used to keep the floating platform in place the oil company hasnt given a new start date for tahiti even without equipment failures some companies have had a bumpy ride anadarko petroleum corp had big plans for its k field when it started production in but it struggled to reach half of its barrel a day target amid problems maintaining well pressure then in february the houston based company doubled its estimate of the size of ks reservoir to between two billion and four billion barrels but theres a catch while the field is proving larger than expected extracting that oil will require a complicated and expensive series of chemical injections which can make it easier to flush petroleum out of a difficult reservoir the deep water gulf has given the energy industry few if any unqualified hits this decade in contrast to other new exploration areas where early expectations are often exceeded says mike rodgers a partner with consulting firm pfc energy in washington d c but with oil at around &# a barrel even an underperforming field can still be counted as a success if it was commissioned when prices were expected to top out at &# bp plc and chevron both quote prices between &# and &# a barrel as enough to justify developing their most expensive projects in the gulf and deep water producers havent changed their outlook even as the cost of finding and developing an oil field in the gulf quadrupled between and according to a study by the u s minerals management service most companies say the regions stability and the low royalties demanded by the u s government far outweigh any production problems "there are relatively few places in the world we can still hunt for those size prizes " says paul siegele chevrons vice president for gulf of mexico deep water exploration and production "its accessible to western companies and has relatively good fiscal terms compared to some other places in the world " the u s takes of revenue generated in the deep water gulf of mexico compared with angolas and nigerias of offshore production according to a may report by the u s government accountability office the gulf also is considered free of political risk a general strike in nigeria in may for instance threatened producers ability to load oil onto tankers for export "just like a stock portfolio oil companies have to keep a mixed blend " says bob fryklund vice president of industry relations at energy consultancy ihs inc in houston "some guys prefer a bond type approach the u s government is pretty stable so overall the gulf has been a fairly risk free place from that standpoint " but the u s isnt immune from some of the forces making it difficult for oil companies to operate abroad the u s raised royalties on new deep water leases to in january from the first increase in at least years congress also has been pushing to abolish "royalty relief " a waiver of taxes on some gulf production granted when oil prices were low the waiver has applied to leases sold in and even as prices have topped &# a barrel the house included a new fee on future production on the leases in its energy bill but the senate which must approve the charge rejected a similar tax measure this year one thing the u s government isnt budging on is opening up more of the eastern gulf of mexico to exploration in july a bill to allow seismic testing of closed off areas of the eastern gulf was shot down in the senate "we need more access " says john hofmeister president of royal dutch shell plcs u s operations "were only allowed access to of the outer continental shelf we dont know whats out there until the chance to explore " unable to go east companies are pushing farther south in the coming lease sales from the minerals management service acreage miles southwest of new orleans will be at the center of a fierce bidding war predicts matthew jurecky a houston based analyst at scottish energy consulting firm wood mackenzie mr jurecky said in a report last month that deep water bids will top &# billion in two sales this year "with low political risk and vast infrastructure " he wrote "the rising prices in the gulf of mexico are substantiated " mr baskin is a staff reporter for dow jones newswires in houston he can be reached at brian baskin dowjones com jessica resnick
