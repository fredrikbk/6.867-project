power plant in china a plan to turn rice into carbon credits biotech firm pushes using less fertilizer ban on altered seeds yinchuan china agriculture contributes more to total global greenhouse gas emissions than the entire world transportation sector according to a united nations sponsored panel to eric rey that sounds like the makings of a business plan on a recent day mr rey pulled on a pair of rubber boots and waded into a muddy rice paddy the place where he hopes to battle global warming and earn a fortune for his budding biotech company mr rey president and chief executive of arcadia biosciences of davis calif has ventured to this remote corner of northern china a patchwork of flower fields and emerald rice paddies punctuated by ornamented mosques to sell farmers a genetically engineered rice seed he says the seed still in development will cut their need for nitrogen fertilizer which is among their biggest costs and a huge source of greenhouse gases he then aims to sell the resulting carbon credits on a growing global exchange "heres an opportunity for farmers to make more money for us to be more profitable and for the environment to benefit " said mr rey a lanky year old beaming as he brushed his hand across the tips of the rice grains "its a triple win " entrepreneurs around the globe are racing to feed a &# billion market for carbon credits which offer companies a way to comply with emissions reduction requirements without actually cutting their own output of greenhouse gases the market arose in the wake of the kyoto protocol in which most industrial countries except the u s agreed to a collective reduction in their greenhouse gas emissions by in a typical transaction an industrial company that is having trouble reducing emissions can buy credits from another company that has figured out a cost efficient way to cut its own carbon output beyond what is required many early carbon credit projects focused on curbing emissions at industrial facilities including reducing methane emissions at landfills but entrepreneurs like mr rey see huge potential in tapping into agriculture the no producer of global warming gas agriculture contributes about of global greenhouse gas emissions according to the u n sponsored intergovernmental panel on climate change that is smaller than emissions from energy use forestry and industry but larger than transportation by focusing on rice in china mr rey may be tapping into a treasure trove much of the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture come from nitrogen fertilizer china is the biggest user of fertilizer and the worlds largest rice producer but his quest to turn chinese rice into carbon credits faces big hurdles his company needs to do field tests in china to prove that its genetically modified seeds can thrive there chinas intellectual property laws are weak and its farmers are set in their ways leaving biotech firms stumped over how to make money from its vast agriculture sector monsanto co a pioneer in the chinese market has retreated in frustration most daunting he must persuade the chinese government to allow companies to sell staple food crops like rice that have been bioengineered though genetically modified seeds are common in the u s european and asian countries have been more cautious about their use mr rey a biotech veteran who enjoys adventures such as flying aerobatic planes or tracking baboons in tanzania isnt deterred by the odds "a set of rules is something that somebody made up in their mind " he says he spent years at calgene developer of the "flavr savr" tomato the first genetically modified whole food approved by the food and drug administration calgene was acquired by monsanto in and that year mr rey set up his own consulting firm one day in he got a call from john sperling a billionaire who made a fortune creating university of phoenix an online college mr sperling an investor in biotech projects including cloning and human longevity was seeking help on a project in eritrea trying to raise plants that could grow in salt water to aid poor farmers the project wasnt successful but the two found a common interest in using biotechnology to solve hunger and help farmers "the grand design is someday to create plants that are salt tolerant nitrogen efficient and drought resistant " says mr sperling "that is the nirvana of agricultural engineering " in mr rey with funding from mr sperling formed arcadia today the companys staff of scouts research institutions for new technologies hoping to develop and eventually license them so far it has nine technologies in the pipeline including salt tolerant plants safflower oil enhanced with omega fatty acids and tomatoes with a longer shelf life the company expects to commercialize its first product in the year arcadia was formed its researchers came across work at the university of alberta in the field of nitrogen use efficiency the canadian researchers had been trying to create a plant that could thrive in salty soils instead they stumbled upon a plant that thrived without fertilizer after a lab director forgot to fertilize one of the trial seeds arcadia licensed the technology in for an undisclosed amount to date mr rey says arcadia has invested "tens of millions of dollars" into the nitrogen technology to develop genetically modified seeds or plants than can grow with half the amount of fertilizer normally required the amount hasnt exceeded &# million he says but "the ongoing investment rate is pretty aggressive " in mr reys company signed an agreement giving monsanto rights to develop and commercialize the nitrogen efficient technology for canola terms werent disclosed others are also trying to develop such seeds "essentially all of the biotech companies have some program involving nitrogen use " says fred below professor of crop physiology at the university of illinois he says developing countries will be beneficiaries of this technology because they have a hard time affording fertilizer mr rey first came across the idea that rice was a big contributor to air pollution in china in a conversation with researchers from the international fertilizer industry association in january a few weeks later he was reading an article about carbon credits at power plants as he worked out on an elliptical trainer at a gym near his garden surrounded home in berkeley if power plants could generate carbon credits he thought why couldnt rice fields he began doing more research on sources of greenhouse gas emissions he learned that the biggest source of agriculture related greenhouse gases is nitrogen fertilizer thats because only about half the fertilizer applied to fields is typically consumed by the plants the rest seeps into the ground becoming a primary contributor to water pollution or is emitted into the air as nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas nearly times as potent as carbon dioxide in october mr rey met with agricultural researchers visiting the u s from ningxia a tiny mountainous province in china near mongolia the researchers explained that china the worlds biggest user of fertilizer had a huge problem with runoff that was leaving lakes and rivers devoid of life rising fertilizer prices are hurting poor farmers in ningxia the land is harsh and water is limited to help crops grow farmers dump heaps of fertilizer on the land making the province one of chinas biggest per acre fertilizer users the researchers invited mr rey to visit ningxia to see if his nitrogen fertilizer technology could help mr rey was intrigued but was confronted with a problem other biotechnology companies face how to make money in china chinese farmers tend to save seed from harvest to replant the following year others save seeds and repackage them illegally to sell on the black market both practices deny biotech companies their main source of revenue a fresh supply of seeds that must be bought or licensed each year biotech firms also struggle to keep track of chinas myriad farms the average size of a chinese farm is less than one acre compared with acres in the u s that problem is familiar to veterans like monsanto which became one of the first foreign companies to introduce a genetically modified cotton seed in china in the late s the company has since scaled back investments there and refrained from introducing its latest seed technology in part because of "the inability to effectively control the spread of the technology illegally " according to brett begemann executive vice president for mr rey the threads of a solution began to come together with what he calls the "carbon wrinkle " rather than charging farmers a premium for genetically modified seeds the traditional business model farmers would pay for the price of regular seed plus about half of the carbon credits generated by their reduced fertilizer use that would give farmers an incentive not to cheat the more of his rice seed they plant the less fertilizer they use and the more carbon credits everyone gets to cash in in january mr rey arrived in ningxia a place he says he never could have located on a map a year ago to meet with local officials decreasing fertilizer use is a potential "big savings for farmers and the regional economy " says liu rong guang president of the government run ningxia academy of agriculture and forestry sciences but one of the first questions locals had was how poor farmers would pay for genetically modified seeds mr rey explained the carbon wrinkle idea and interest increased he says it helped he says that ningxia is already home to other carbon credit projects mostly generated by large wind farms his idea is still at least five years away from being fully implemented in part because the carbon credit methodology needs to be accepted by a u n body to help make the case to the u n mr rey recently journeyed about miles outside yinchuan to join chinese researchers from the ningxia academy in an experimental rice paddy growing conventional rice he plunged in with the researchers to tend to a series of yellow metal boxes equipped with plastic tubes the boxes were trapping nitrous oxide being emitted from the fields syringes sucked out the air into malleable metal bags the measurements will show how much nitrous oxide is emitted from conventional rice using different amounts of fertilizer that information will be the basis for research submitted to the u n seeking approval for the carbon credit methodology so far china has allowed the commercialization of genetically modified versions of cotton and some minor food crops including tomatoes and sweet peppers commercializing bioengineered seeds for major food crops such as corn soybeans and rice remains forbidden some government agencies in china still harbor reservations about the safety of such crops says jikun huang director of the chinese academy of sciences but he thinks that will eventually change as chinas population grows "china considers biotechnology as a major importance to promoting agricultural productivity in the future " he says by some estimates china is expected to soon surpass the u s as the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gases mr rey thinks that by the time his technology is ready in a few years china will have warmed up to the idea of using biotechnology to benefit the environment "its a no brainer " he says
