junk bond issuance starting to revive investors still push for hard bargains amid high supply ever since the pipeline for junk bonds clogged up in late june investors have watched nervously as the number of uncompleted deals grew ever larger now with several junk or "high yield " bond deals getting done and others dissolving some of the pressure is finally beginning to ease albeit slowly in late august bank of america estimated the forward calendar at &# billion in bonds and &# billion in leveraged loans for a total of &# billion of debt that underwriters were anxious to sell to investors now that figure appears to be significantly lower as some loan deals are sold and others disappear as intended leveraged buyouts fall apart the high yield bond pipeline has probably been whittled down to somewhere close to &# billion according to david barcus head of the high yield syndicate desk at bnp paribas that is down from a high that he estimated to be about &# billion meanwhile the size of the pending leveraged loan deals recently slipped to &# billion according to standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data that figure excludes a loan transaction that had been planned for slm corp s leveraged buyout and that now appears at risk the u s bond market was closed for columbus day trading resumes today since the federal reserve cut its benchmark interest rate two weeks ago banks and investors have begun chipping away at the pile of unsold debt underwriting banks have recently placed portions of large loans that had been looming for months including loans for first data corp and allison transmission in particular strong demand for first datas loan the first significant chunk of new issuance that had been expected this fall set a positive tone for coming offerings underwriters for txu corp s loans are expected to follow first datas lead and market only a small part of the massive &# billion debt package this week at the same time some leveraged buyouts such as kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co s planned acquisition of harman international industries inc were simply scuttled that trend could continue according to a recent research report by bank of america "notable precedents for renegotiating or letting deals fall away suggest the forward calendar could shrink from the supply side " bofa said in a recent report investors emboldened by additional negotiating leverage they acquired during the summers risk repricing continue to drive hard bargains in the presence of so much supply "we cant be inundated with oversupply " said sandy rufenacht a fund manager at aquila three peaks high income fund "but theres actually pretty good demand for yield right now as long as you price it right and have the right covenants " but as long as the pace of new issuance continues to lag investors who need to put their money to work risk seeing the pendulum swing back in favor of issuers after the market saw just &# billion in new junk bonds from the end of june to mid september the combination of investors incoming cash from coupon payments and very little new issue volumes has created a deficit of supply relative to demand according to a report issued late last month by j p morgan chase j p morgan places the supply deficit at &# billion up from &# billion only three months ago and estimates that the overall expected supply overhang is still near its peak the next deal that could test the new pipeline is a planned bond issue by first data estimated at as much as &# billion that had been slated to follow the placement of the companys loan several market participants have expressed skepticism in recent weeks that a first data bond offering will get done in current conditions at least at anywhere close to &# billion in size martin fridson wrote in the sept issue of leverage world that a continued bifurcation of the bond market with new deals for well regarded companies chugging along as usual while a trickier set of dynamics will govern the lbo financings that were agreed to before credit markets tightened still "if the economy holds up and no big deal stumbles badly banks can eventually clear out the old inventory " mr fridson wrote china bank to launch forward rate contracts the peoples bank of china will introduce trading of forward rate agreements nov a new sign that beijing wants to overhaul its
