adviser turnover roils investors how to protect yourself as a wave of financial planners prepares to retire a change in the fiduciary relationship when jerry roberts got news that his longtime financial planner was retiring and selling his practice to a larger company "it was very unnerving " "i very carefully chose my original planner " a sole practitioner in the robertses hometown of indianapolis "i was cognizant of his investment philosophy his range of capabilities and his past experience i didnt know anything about the new firm coming on " says mr roberts a year old retired bank officer like the robertses a growing number of people who have spent years building a relationship with a trusted financial adviser are having to start over again with someone new planners are getting older the average age is and nearly a third are over and they are retiring at an accelerating pace often without a specific succession plan in place that in turn is helping to fuel a wave of consolidation in the industry as big financial advisory firms and banks including wachovia corp pennsylvanias susquehanna bancshares inc and alabamas compass bancshares inc seek to control a larger share of americans retirement assets investors can feel left in the lurch when a planning firm theyve known for years is suddenly gone or swallowed up inside a larger shop a retiring planner often will provide clients with referrals to other professionals or an acquiring firm will assign your account to one of their planners sometimes its necessary to go hunting for a new planner on your own its essential to carefully assess the candidates will they be a good fit in terms of investment style and service levels is the fee structure different from what youre used to and will they be looking out for your financial welfare or just trying to sell you more products "this is a relationship business and you have to have a comfort level with people who handle your money " says john verret a year old former advertising executive in sharon mass who learned last month that his planners firm was being bought by a larger company when rob and marilyn edwardss planner of five years retired recently he provided the providence r i couple with a list of four potential replacements not content with a phone call the edwardses arranged a meeting with one of the candidates angela thomson in a nearby town "we wanted to know if wed be able to really work with her " says mr edwards a year old attorney "are we on the same page in terms of investment philosophy we wanted to establish whether there was a level of trust " he asked her questions about her relationship with clients her work history and even her own family mr edwards found that ms thomsons approach to investing is largely similar to that of his former planner though with one key difference ms thomson favors actively managed mutual funds including a global real estate fund the previous planner largely stuck to index funds and etfs mr edwards says he isnt troubled by what he calls "a bit more aggressive approach " because "i think shes making a reasoned judgment " still he says hell be monitoring his nest eggs performance quarterly to make sure the investments are working out the technical parts of switching from one planner to another are mostly relatively easy transferring your assets generally can happen quickly with a few documents with some products though particularly annuities that might not be titled in your name the process can be more complex two facets of a planning relationship are most crucial to investors fees and fiduciary responsibility if youve typically paid an annual fee of say of the assets under management that isnt likely to change but you still want to question this since some planning firms charge an annual fee some charge by the hour and some charge by the services rendered the biggest change could be in the fiduciary relationship planners who are also registered investment advisers those who are registered with the securities and exchange commission have a fiduciary obligation to clients a legal bind that means a planner must always put a clients needs first planners who work for brokerage firms including those run by banks that are acquiring planning shops typically impose suitability standards that while supported by case law arent a legal standard suitability standards essentially boil down to the fact that a broker is supposed to recommend suitable investments but doesnt necessarily have to put a clients needs first as such you need to ask how your account at the new firm will be structured since some financial firms operate under both standards some banks may roll a planning firm into a brokerage unit where suitability rules are in force others into a wealth management subsidiary subject to fiduciary obligations in essence if your account at the new firm is structured as a brokerage account suitability standards apply if your account is structured as an advisory account then fiduciary rules apply if youre accustomed to a fiduciary relationship and if your account ends up subject to suitability rules "then the essence of the relationship changes " says mike glor principal at gw &amp wade a wellesley mass financial planning firm that was recently purchased by focus financial partners llc of new york one of the largest independent advisory companies in some cases planners arent retiring yet theyre just merging into a bigger company as a way to address future succession planning needs indeed half of the financial planning industry is built on sole practitioners who have no one in house to whom they can turn over the reins at retirement research from charles schwab &amp co has found that only of planners have a succession plan in place another concern is location if you live in kansas city do you want a planner based in miami or boston or seattle or somewhere closer to home with the internet and email location isnt as big a deal as it once was though some people may still want their planner nearby mr roberts the indianapolis investor says "geography initially was an issue " since the firm that acquired his planners practice was in chicago three hours away but the new planner mark soehn a principal at financial solutions advisory group inc came to visit with two of his colleagues and addressed the concerns the robertses had after being with the new firm for two years now mr roberts says he sees a benefit of the acquisition "the new firm has access to tools and capabilities my original adviser didnt if i want a more tailored approach to how my account is reported to me they do it " many planning firms deal only with clients who have multiple millions of dollars to manage others cater almost exclusively to the mass affluent those with &# to &# million or so you want to be affiliated with planners whose strength matches your needs the biggest problem tends to come when firms that focus on the mass affluent step up and buy a planning shop focused on the wealthy in that case the acquiring firm may not have the resources experiences or skills to manage your needs on the other hand mass affluent clients who move to a firm that routinely manages money for the wealthy could receive a reduced level of personalized service compared with what theyre used to investors also should check if their new adviser has a disciplinary history which could range from incomplete paperwork to outright theft registered investment advisers are obligated to provide clients with a so called form adv that details any disciplinary actions but you can independently check out an adviser or a broker on your own advisers who manage more than &# million generally must be registered with the securities and exchange commission and you can find those filings online at sec gov under the "check out brokers &amp advisers" link planners managing less than that amount generally dont have to register with the sec but must still be registered with their states securities department which should be able to tell you about any infractions information on brokers meanwhile is available at finra org under the finra brokercheck link if ultimately you dont mesh with a new planner then ask your former planner for another suggestion or start the hunt for a new adviser yourself resources for that are available at the web sites for the financial planning association fpanet org and the national association of personal financial advisors napfa org getting sound advice if your financial adviser retires youll likely need to find someone else you can trust heres what to consider will a prospective planner be a good fit with your investment style and service requirements is the fee structure different from what youre used to will the planner put your welfare first or instead try to sell you more products
