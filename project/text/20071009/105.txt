tortured arguments on current course u s warfighting doctrine will be as tame as a church social over the weekend condi rice announced that iraq convoys protected by military contractors will also have state department minders onboard vehicles equipped with video cameras now comes the latest flap over "torture" techniques during terrorist interrogations well on their way to becoming little more than a friendly chat post abu ghraib opponents of terrorist interrogations got the bush administration to repudiate a justice department memo said to be overbroad now critics are up in arms over newly leaked memos that responded to that earlier criticism by attempting to be more specific given the anti antiterror mood in congress the cia wanted to know with precision what it can and cannot do with al qaeda captives lest its officials find themselves without defense in front of some congressional committee so according to newspaper reports the justice departments office of legal counsel responded by detailing that slapping hypothermia sleep deprivation and so called stress positions are allowed are these torture if so then we really are at the point where al qaeda agents will be treated like common felons whats really at issue here is whether u s officials are going to have even the most basic tools to interrogate americas enemies newspaper accounts of the memos say "waterboarding " or simulated drowning is also allowed in the memos which reflects the cias view that this is especially effective in breaking hard cases rapidly reportedly this technique was used against al qaeda masterminds khalid sheikh mohammed and abu zebaydah waterboarding by the way is also part of interrogation resistance training for some americans to prepare them to face the enemy if captured if congress wants to outlaw this technique it can do so but it then has an obligation to say what is allowed as it stands now the scolds in congress and the beltway press have decided to impose their view that no pressure tactics are ever necessary or justified but if congress and the press are going to take over the design of the war on terror how can they justify walking away from any responsibility to make clear what is permissible the notion that the u s goes around unnecessarily "torturing" people without any rationale whatsoever is so absurd that it is almost never stated explicitly but it is equally awkward for the administrations critics to admit that the "coercive" methods listed in these memos to induce cooperation from al qaeda operatives may actually work former cia director george tenet has said explicitly that they do work and have saved american lives but rather than face these hard issues directly the scolds fall back on generalities about our "values " if congress doesnt want to wade into the difficult business of approving this pressure technique while forbidding that one or making clear which methods can and cant be used in combination then it should understand that the course it is on now will help al qaeda operatives resist interrogation congress wants the olc memos made public but the reason to keep them secret is so enemy combatants cant use them as a resistance manual if they know whats coming they can psychologically prepare for it we know al qaeda training often involves its own forms of resistance training and publicly describing the rules offers our enemies a road map for resistance perhaps the worst canard is the assumption that the administration went looking for some yes man to issue the olc memos the premise of this narrative is that issuing these memos would somehow help the career of acting olc head steve bradbury this is preposterous the amply documented way to get ahead in todays washington is to loudly object to some bush policy and then advertise your disagreement in congressional testimony or in a tell all book former deputy attorney general james comey has made himself the toast of the town that way meanwhile mr bradburys predecessor at olc jack goldsmith is now at harvard basking in applause for attacking his former administration colleagues in a book mr bradbury no doubt knew he was dooming his chances of senate confirmation any time soon its just possible he signed the memos because he thought they were the right thing to do under the law and as policy the critics of bush policy want to have it both ways they want to smear administration officials with the generalization of "torture" while washing their hands of any responsibility to say what kind of interrogation if any they favor if a democrat wins the white house in she may discover that no one in her government will dare sign a memo allowing any kind of aggressive interrogation beyond "have a nice day " see related letters "letters to the editor cant make war and nice simultaneously" wsj oct
