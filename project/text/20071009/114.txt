where big fish caught trout oakdale n y assume you are a wage slave in new york city as respite you favor the joys of fishing streams for large trout you have a couple of choices travel miles to the banks of the madison river in montana or thereabouts plan b early on a weekday morning load your car with a flyrod stream waders and a box of flies drive some miles out of new york city on the old southern state parkway into long island turn in at connetquot state park in oakdale walk to your reserved "beat" on the connetquot river fat with rainbows brookies and browns oh and theres a bonus you will have arrived at the living heart of the politics and history of the empire state is this too much weight for one little trout stream to bear we shall see let us first establish the bona fides of why we are trout fishing on long island starting with the indian word "connetquot " spelled in an earlier time connattquut and now pronounced ka net qwot almost rhymes with kumquat the connetquot for hundreds of years and now is one of the finest trout streams in the u s fly fisherman magazine seeking the best public fisheries for trophy rainbows listed streams in idaho montana oregon "and the connetquot river on long island " another fishing source has called the connetquot "the only blue ribbon trout water on the planet surrounded by dense suburban development " fortunately this is either not well known or disbelieved by many eastern trout fishermen who would rather pack in to montana or utah the connetquot is an eastern trout stream that is not "pressured " as happens when the salmon are running out of lake ontario into the niagara river and men have been known to get into fistfights and shootouts over four feet of riverbank the connetquot is operated under the english beat system its fishable length is about miles after reserving in advance and paying &# each fisherman receives a single beat or "site" of the along the stream first come first choice of about yards the brook trout average about inches the connetquot is fished on barbless hooks and only with artificial flies or streamers anglers may keep two trout from the river more important it has its own well run fish hatchery to stock the stream dating back to the s those among you who both fish and think about politics must be saying "wait a minute youre saying this is a state park a new york state park hear ye the history of an ancient trout stream in the secatogue indians deeded land on the south shore of long island to william nicoll described in the histories as a "gentleman from the city of new york " in a tavern keeper arrived named eliphalet snedecor there were few easy names on long island back then they tongue tie visitors to this day who rented land from mr nicoll fishermen and bird shooters started showing up on long islands south shore to stay at snedecors tavern the fishermen and shooters happened to be called vanderbilt havemeyer cutting wilmerding lorillard hollings and the like these were the men who shaped the commercial that is republican history of new york during its first great period of economic growth before democrats seized the state business or pleasure these gents enjoyed the blood sports one brisk november in a mr delmonico namesake of the famed new york city restaurant was found face down and dead at the foot of a deer blind his death attributed to the excitement of the hunt in a group of these fellows bought the land expanded snedecors original tavern into a clubhouse and dubbed the shooting fields and their lovely stream the southside sportsmens club in the s a writer from forest and stream described the clubs rare waters "one of the finest trout streams on long island is the one whose lower half is owned by the southside sportsmens club the upper part is wonderfully pure fed by bottom springs and flowing over a continuous bed of whitest gravel it seems surprising " he wrote "to find it stocked with trout that may be numbered by the hundred thousand " here the men of southside fished shot ate drank and legend has it did other things women fished and shot pheasant but not ducks the southside sportsmens club proceeded along this path for about years finding new members to replace the old boys who went off to settle up with the final accountant or taking on their descendants as new members then in the late s the club encountered robert moses already slathering the state with concrete and highways and public parks moses a democrat told the club men hed have the state confiscate their river and land for a public park if they didnt give them up a simplification to be sure but this is the way you hear it in taverns on the south shore even now moses however wasnt dealing with fools and the gents of the southside sportsmens club extracted concessions from the famous land bully after a year transitional period the acres became a state preserve with the trout stream intact the southside sportsmens clubs last land manager gil bergen was then in hes still there as the state preserves manager running the hatchery and supervising the rivers beat system and the clubhouse the southside clubhouse is the most imposing building in connetquot park in the southside club added three floors to snedecors original tavern bedrooms a rod room a dining room for men and one for ladies today much of it houses the parks administrative and teaching offices but the large billiards room bedrooms and truly grand kitchen remain evoking an age that shall never return gil bergen is attempting to restore them to their original magnificence in this he has help from the friends of the connetquot with the creation of the friends in we arrive at perhaps one of the few moments of relative equanimity in new yorks politics and history consider over its time the connetquots perfect setting for the restful taking of trout passed from long islands settlers through the hands of new york citys first great commercial and financial giants into the urban planning schemes of robert moses and finally like much else in new york became a ward of the state someone wise determined that state stewardship alone would not keep the connetquot preserve as it had been for more than three centuries richard remmer the president of friends of connetquot attributes the "friends" idea to former new york state parks commissioner bernadette castro while the upkeep of the parks land isnt extravagantly expensive fixing buildings or upgrading the hatchery and such pressures the state parks budget so typically the friends raise money and invest time to produce say the engineering drawings and plans for a project that might cost &# getting this out of the way makes it easier for the state to simply execute the construction if the trout hatchery that makes the connetquot what it is needs lumber to replace rotten wood the friends do that currently theyre trying to restore to working order the rivers grist mill which dates to the gerry charitable trust a long island foundation has pledged &# if the friends can match that by oct a similar long island group friends of montauk downs is making it possible for the state to restore a legendary public golf course to the design by robert trent jones sr the heart of the park of course remains this trout stream so oddly placed and preserved on long island by god nature and men in february the hatcherys fingerlings were diagnosed with a fish virus called infectious pancreatic necrosis ipn those fish were destroyed as have been the fish in the stream from the hatchery and part way upstream felt soles on fishing boots a demon for transferring viruses have been banned the mature fish not affected by ipn are fishable and fighting the connetquot itself will live on past ipn as it did the indians vanderbilt and moses and as one sometimes hears when anglers finish a day hooking some of the biggest brookies this side of the madison river please dont let news of this place get around mr henninger is deputy editorial page editor of the wall street journal and writes the wonder land column connetquot "legatees" are the descendants of the original and later members of the southside sportsmens club gil bergen as part of his effort to restore the clubhouse to its status as a classic trout and shooting lodge is seeking the return of the furnishings that were auctioned off when the state took over in he has a detailed inventory of the more than items that were auctioned away paintings prints furniture lamps andirons my favorite is a nathaniel currier print titled "the momentous question is my face good for a drink " mr bergen invites any legatee wishing to return items to the clubs rooms to contact the friends at or gil bergen at the park d h
