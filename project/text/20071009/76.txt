politics &amp economics bushs taxing legacy republican hopefuls grapple with budget policy president bush has made some things easy on the economic front for republicans looking to succeed him his tenure has seen solid economic growth and he will leave behind a set of big tax cuts that candidates can easily pledge to continue but mr bush also has tied the hands of his would be successors on both taxes and spending as will be clear today when the republican presidential candidates gather in dearborn mich for a wall street journal cnbc msnbc debate on economic issues the sheer size and cost of the bush tax cuts has made it difficult for any of the candidates to place his own stamp on the topic by proposing significant new tax reductions most of the tax cutting oxygen in the party is consumed by calling for simply extending the bush tax cuts past their scheduled expiration in the most intriguing exceptions are a proposal by former massachusetts gov mitt romney to cut capital gains taxes further and the suggestions by former arkansas gov mike huckabee and former tennessee sen fred thompson that they might scrap the income tax system in favor of a consumption tax at the same time the bush administrations failure to overhaul the tax system has left the republican field with another huge fiscal headache the mushrooming effect of the alternative minimum tax which amounts to a backdoor tax increase on millions of middle class taxpayers that curbs or eliminates the benefits of the bush tax cut eliminating the amt would cost an estimated &# trillion over years doing nothing would allow the number of those affected to rise from three million to million next year the amt has allowed republicans to keep budget deficits and projected deficits under better control even as they extol the virtues of bush tax cuts that makes the amt an uncomfortable problem that presidential contenders have largely sidestepped one exception is arizona sen john mccain who has said he would repeal the amt though he is less clear about how he would make up the lost revenue former new york mayor rudolph giuliani takes a more nuanced approach calling for indexing the tax for inflation to prevent it from creeping up to hit a growing number of americans on the spending side of the federal ledger the difficulty mr bush and republican congressional leaders have had in controlling spending will compel the candidates to engage in a little bashing of their own party and to propose politically uncomfortable steps to turn around the partys spending rhetoric on spending as on the overall race to succeed mr bush the war in iraq hangs heavily over the debate the leading republican candidates all support the main thrust of the war in iraq which means they must support the wars costs including nearly &# billion the pentagon is seeking to support the fights in iraq and afghanistan in the next year that has brought attention to rising federal spending overall which is especially uncomfortable for candidates who also must address the looming high costs of baby boomer retirement the upshot is that republicans long seen as the party of fiscal conservatism were seen in a recent wall street journal nbc news poll as less qualified than democrats to cut the federal deficit all that has elevated the primacy of spending control on the partys agenda "in the early s the imperative of restoring growth to our economy was so great that it really did override every other consideration " says former republican rep vin weber who was elected in congress in the reagan landslide and now advises mr romneys campaign "gov romney as someone who did come out of the business community probably has a greater concern on the spending side than maybe some of us supply siders did years ago " mr giuliani sen mccain and mr thompson have emphasized spending restraint though that debate hasnt produced notable specifics about trimming the role of government typical is mr giulianis assertion that he could cut the federal work force through attrition and technology improvement such maneuvering skirts a broader and more uncomfortable reality for republicans in the generation since ronald reagan took power the message of lower taxes and reduced government involvement in the economy has been a powerful one for the party and its candidates this year though a combination of forces including white collar fears about loss of health and pension benefits and the recent wave of foreclosures among consumers who acquired subprime mortgages has led to broader voter concerns about the markets rougher edges candidates are adjusting with some muted calls for a bit more government intervention such as mr romneys declaration in a recent cnbc interview that mortgage lenders failure to make the risks of subprime mortgages more clear to consumers was "probably washingtons fault" for failing to enact more consumer protections still candidates tend to consider promises to cut taxes the best way to score points with the republican faithful mr romney has made his bid to go beyond the bush tax cuts by offering a plan to cut capital gains and dividends taxes to zero for households earning less than &# annually that would cost an estimated &# billion a year one of mr bushs missteps meanwhile has altered the dynamics of the social security debate by failing to convince the republican congress to even schedule a vote in on its plan to partially privatize the social security system the bush administration exposed the political perils of longstanding embrace of personal accounts financed with payroll tax revenue so far no leading republican has emphasized the issue mr mccain "has always supported personal accounts as a supplement to social security benefits but not as a substitute for making the hard choices to bring the traditional program into alignment " says his economic adviser douglas holtz eakin like mr mccain mr thompson doesnt rule out tax increases as well as benefit cuts as part of that menu of hard choices
