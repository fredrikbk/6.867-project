business technology ceo of eds sees it change data needs security are the new priorities ronald rittenmeyer has a broad perspective on how the business technology landscape is changing that is because as the new chief executive of outsourcing giant electronic data systems corp mr rittenmeyer deals with hundreds of corporate customers and their technology needs eds employees typically spend a lot of time on site with clients installing computers managing networks and performing other tech functions so the year old ceo of the plano texas company often rubs elbows with information technology managers one of the biggest changes mr rittenmeyer says he is seeing is the exploding growth of data requirements for most corporations which are being bombarded with video audio and other intensive computer applications that take up a lot of bandwidth in addition he says companies tech security needs are rising as they increasingly need to protect floods of data like the companies it services eds itself has had to respond to such changes by building more robust data networks and streamlining its operations part of the companys impetus for making those changes was to aid in its recovery from the brink of financial disaster in a turnaround that mr rittenmeyer helped lead as chief operating officer before he rose to ceo sept in a recent interview in san francisco mr rittenmeyer discussed the changes he sees in business technology wsj with so many clients in the fortune what are some of the business technology trends youre seeing mr rittenmeyer on the one side we see a real push forward on virtualization and on automation virtualization software that lets servers simultaneously run multiple operating systems increasing utilization is really how do you efficiently manage all of your asset bases automation making more company operations automatically controlled by computer such as monitoring for power outages is clearly more one of efficiency and effectiveness of the workforce we see a tremendous demand for that type of business the second one is what i consider to be the blending of consumer technology into the business place youve got the collaborative stuff like facebook and myspace youve got online gaming and youve got the whole virtual world and youve got the video side of that like youtube flowing in thats putting a tremendous amount of demand on corporate networks wsj are desktops passe now with companies switching them out and replacing them with laptops mr rittenmeyer theres a real market still for desktops and pcs but much of the business world is moving away from the fixed units into more laptops because of mobile computing as people work from home and hot spots a wireless internet access point laptops have become a much more useful tool at the same time it depends on what the functionality is because if youre just talking about email these devices have become the source for email so you need less and less of even a laptop so laptops are moving to phone link devices or pdas personal digital assistants and desktops are moving more to laptops part of the issue that creates is security because as handhelds become more of a device and laptops become more of something that you lug around every day the issue of theft and security is pretty significant wsj what about the thin client computers that are tethered to servers with little independent function whats happening there mr rittenmeyer the thin client is great to be used in an area where you dont need powerful pcs so if youre a reservation agent and youre just tapping into a server and filling out a form you really just need a device to do that you really dont need a powerful laptop to do that but the thin client isnt a replacement for a laptop wsj how about wi fi a wireless technology thats spread like wildfire in homes and small businesses mr rittenmeyer same thing in the corporate world we have wireless all over our building wi fi is a great opportunity for you to jump onto something and be able to use your computer much more than you do today having said that i think there will always be a demand for a hard line were a secure network on wi fi but there are many situations whether theyre government or banking where they like the security that a hard line gives you my analogy would be cellphone versus hard wire phones everybody said youll never have a phone in your house again because you have a cellphone there are people who have that but the majority of the people in the world still have wire lines wsj what are some technologies that dont seem to be working for the corporate marketplace is there anything being thrown out or that people arent as keen on three years ago mr rittenmeyer i dont know that id say theres stuff that is being thrown out i think people are beginning to realize that much of their legacy systems arent fast enough for them to compete in the marketplace like they used to legacy systems when they were built were built to do certain functionality in todays world much of that functionality has been blended with something else and your demands are higher and my demands as a consumer are higher my demands as a business are higher to my suppliers i think youve got to move faster as companies move on to not lose their history wsj whats an example of what youre talking about mr rittenmeyer take a reservation system in the old days you used to call up and try to reserve something in todays world you need to call up to reserve it change it modify it move dates times and be able to look at locations across a broader scan if you think of airlines they need to know where planes are if theyve been delayed how that affects the next flight all of those systems theres no system that any longer can operate independently
