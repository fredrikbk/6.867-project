ahead of the tape are investors back to playing small ball the new york yankees in the late s used to win championships by playing "small ball" getting on base with singles and walks and wearing down rival pitchers when the team started relying on sluggers the championships went away small over big has also worked for investors the russell index of small stocks had outperformed the s&amp p which tracks wall streets largest companies for eight years in a row through that streak is in jeopardy now the russell is up year to date while the s&amp p is ahead by the dow jones industrial average of megacap stocks is up one reason large stocks are better positioned to benefit from strong growth overseas and a weak dollar which makes it cheaper to export small stocks because they tend to have a smaller global footprint are more exposed to the domestic economy which looks weak right now small stocks are making a comeback due in part to the federal reserves interest rate cut and a better than expected september employment report which points to a healthier economy last week the russell jumped compared with a gain of by the dow and a gain by the s&amp p but small stocks arent out of the woods housing shows every sign of getting worse and job growth is still anemic payrolls in september were higher than a year ago the weakest growth in more than three years investors in small caps are also banking on an earnings surge that may not materialize operating earnings for companies in the s&amp p index which tracks companies valued at &# billion or less are forecast to gain in the fourth quarter from the previous year much more than the growth predicted for larger companies thats highly optimistic considering earnings for the index are expected to decline in the third quarter after dropping in the second get ready to read between the feds lines investors are evenly divided over whether federal reserve officials will cut interest rates again later this month or stand pat after septembers cut by the end of the week well all have a better idea of how fed officials have been thinking minutes from the feds september meeting when it cut its target federal funds rate by a half percentage point to are due out today there also will be minutes from an emergency august conference call that led to other actions to stem the credit crisis the world looks better now money is flowing more easily through the credit markets and the september employment report which included upward revisions to august payroll figures made the jobs situation look much less scary if the minutes show the fed was dwelling on markets and the august jobs report investors might infer officials are more at ease now there also will be eight fed governors and regional fed presidents speaking this week including chairman ben bernanke on friday in the end investors will have to decide whether they prefer an economy that is so weak the fed feels compelled to cut rates again or an economy thats strong enough to make officials feel comfortable standing pat justin lahart email scott patterson wsj com or justin lahart wsj com
