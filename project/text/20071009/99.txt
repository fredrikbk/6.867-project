the game why streets ceos escaped big losses with their jobs for the rank and file on wall street the message is clear mess up and lose your job but its a different equation for the average street ceo the top men theyre all men who run the countrys big financial houses have talked away a collective &# billion in losses the difference they get paid to balance the risk of doing business versus the risk of passing on a deal they made bets and on the whole the good bets outweighed the bad even in the tumult of the last quarter this is what makes the street ceo job different not only from the jobs of those who work for them but from the top posts in other sectors big losses are largely tolerated as investors stomach the inherent volatility of the street game without that risk firms risk becoming irrelevant atrophying away in safety at financial services firms ceos have to create an environment where risk is tolerated "the ceo is more like a politician worried about maintaining the goodwill of the professionals hes managing " says john coates a harvard law professor who is author of a study of ceo longevity average tenure five years "investors understand the ceo is not

with this purchase but its obvious in hindsight that it was bought at the top " says a merrill spokeswoman she noted that the deal has helped the bank have better control over mortgage quality and "that control is still important to our diversification strategy " a similar overstretching was going on at citigroup which threw itself at the leveraged buyout market with full force underwriting some &# billion of loans on private equity deals this came while bankers and private equity chiefs were openly predicting the end of the buyout orgy this spring citigroup chief charles prince pay &#
