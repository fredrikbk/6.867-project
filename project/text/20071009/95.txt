the boss and his gang live and on cd bruce springsteen and the e street band fall tour tonight and tomorrow the band will perform in east rutherford n j for other dates and venues go to www brucespringsteen net hartford conn theres no mistaking the work of the e street band in "magic" sony bruce springsteens new album with his longtime collaborators all their signature touches are evident drummer max weinbergs lock step backbeat little fillers by clarence clemons on sax the whirling organ chiming glockenspiel and ringing guitars in some cases added like icing on a cupcake for the bands fans what makes mr springsteen incomparable among his peers say tom petty john mellencamp bob seger jon bon jovi and other post dylan pre dave matthews rockers is his songwriting his narrative flow use of place and sense of pathos all of which can be less effective when the e street band is predictably brawny on "magic " their high energy multiguitar wall of sound neither mars the material nor brings much to it other than the bosss unbridled delight in being surrounded by his favored employees considering mr springsteen with members of the e street band at his back all but revived american rock some years ago hes earned the right to play with whom he chooses and you can do much worse than having bassist garry tallent and guitarist nils lofgren in your group when the composition is a straightforward mid tempo rocker or must achieve a pounding crescendo the e street band is a golden choice as it was at times here on oct the official opening night of his tour with the band mr springsteen did three rehearsals in new jersey in front of audiences and the day "magic" was released some of us may clamor for the bruce springsteen of non e street albums "nebraska " "tunnel of love " "the ghost of tom joad" and "devils &amp dust" where song rather than performance is the focus but wed be stubborn to the brink of stupid if we failed to recognize the profound connection between the leader and his group when theyre on stage the e street band frames mr springsteens outsize personality its as if theyre holding a net under his high wire act rigidly earnest even when mugging for the crowd their efforts seem to suit his populist anthems and they can play on this night steve van zandt matched mr springsteen on solo guitar and his riff on a bluesy reworking of "reason to believe" allowed mr springsteen to roam the stage while playing harmonica when mr springsteen urged mr clemons and violinist soozie tyrell to trade solos on "darlington county " they did so effortlessly for much of the evening mr springsteen and the group positioned "magic" as a link to earlier albums "living in the future " a new tune thats a close cousin to "tenth avenue freeze out" from "born to run " was preceded in the set by two songs from that landmark recording the opening number "radio nowhere " the first single from the new release flowed into "the ties that bind" from s "the river" the e street band album along with s "darkness at the edge of town " that "magic" most calls to mind the latest e street band material blossomed on stage "long walk home" and "last to die" from the new disc and "lonesome day" and the title track from s "the rising " mr springsteen and his wife patti scialfa offered a biting version of "town called heartbreak " a song from her "play it as it lays" album issued last month by sony but the band didnt stint on its early catalog the oldest song in the set "thundercrack" which as mr springsteen reminded the audience was recorded before mr weinberg and keyboard player roy bittan joined the band in was a loose limbed delight though you couldnt tell by the reaction of mr springsteens devotees in the sold out mostly middle aged crowd not all was flawless the subtlety of "devils arcade " the new albums affecting finale that tells of a soldier yearning for home was lost in a sledgehammer like rendering at times the sound swallowed the solos though mr lofgrens efforts on slide guitar pierced the din some arrangements featured five voices and five guitars but the textures they might have provided failed to materialize in the maelstrom and mr springsteen now a weathered year old with a keith richards like shock of hair seemed to have a cold you can chalk up some of the problems to opening night fine tuning what wont change is the relentless blast of the e street band which doesnt swing much crushes nuance abhors space and wont challenge the material once the song is under way "magic" adds to mr springsteens legacy through the quality of his writing and the band does what he wants it to there may be few evenings in rock as exhilarating as a performance by bruce springsteen and the e street band but hes done more with less "i want pounding drums " he sings in "radio nowhere " "i just want to feel some rhythm " thats what we get when the e street band commands a stage and the audience here wouldnt have had it any other way mr fusilli is the journals rock and pop music critic
