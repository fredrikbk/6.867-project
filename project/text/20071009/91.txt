studies hint at transfusion risk two teams of researchers may have found one reason why patients who receive blood transfusions sometimes fare worse than those who dont blood stored in blood banks may lose a naturally occurring chemical that improves blood flow a finding that is spurring research to determine if restoring the chemical could solve the problem concerns that transfusions may be harmful to some patients have been around at least since when a study published in the new england journal of medicine found that patients treated with an aggressive transfusion regimen did at least as well as those who were treated with a more conservative regimen for younger patients and those who were less acutely ill more aggressive use of transfusions increased the risk of death since then doctors have become more conservative in their use of transfusions which are commonly given to trauma patients and those undergoing surgery among others meanwhile scientists have struggled to determine why transfusions might sometimes be harmful two new studies stop short of providing a definitive answer but they suggest a role for a molecule called nitric oxide which can improve blood flow by causing blood vessels to widen researchers looked at nitric oxide and hemoglobin the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen in one of the studies they found that in the first few hours after blood was taken from the body the percentage of hemoglobin carrying nitric oxide fell more than that could reduce the effectiveness of transfused blood said jonathan stamler a duke university physician who was an author of a companion study "if youre a red blood cell and your job is to deliver oxygen to tissues you have to be able to open a blood vessel or forget it " he said in the companion study funded by the national institutes of health dr stamler and his colleagues reinfused stored blood with nitric oxide just before giving transfusions to dogs they found that the recharged blood increased the blood flow to the heart compared with blood not reinfused with nitric oxide while the studies suggest an interesting hypothesis it is too early to say whether reinfusing blood with nitric oxide will improve outcomes in patients said jeffrey carson a transfusion expert at robert wood johnson medical school in new jersey "its a theory it is not even close to being proven " dr carson said "trying to prove this is going to be really hard " the studies will be published online this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences dr stamler has worked as a consultant for a company called n pharma inc which is developing therapeutic uses for nitric oxide the study not conducted by dr stamler was funded by nitrox llc which has since been renamed n and included authors who were employees of the company dr stamler said he and his colleagues plan to test the technique in people and could begin enrolling patients next year
