gordon browns mistake london on saturday british prime minister gordon brown made the most fateful decision of his short premiership not to call an autumn election it is a decision that has transformed the political landscape here leaving one big loser and two big winners up until last week mr brown was riding high in the opinion polls to most observers surprise voters appreciated the stylistic contrasts with his predecessor tony blair the apparent negatives of mr browns dour public persona were transmuted to positive attributes of fixity of purpose and steadiness of hand meanwhile conservative leader david cameron had seen his strategy of positioning himself as britains agent of change being made obsolete by the new labour prime minister who seemed to embody a complete rejection of mr blairs style of governing all that has now changed a british prime minister has wide discretion when to call an election the operative principle for the incumbent is to call an election when hes most likely to win with opinion polls through the summer and early autumn showing a strengthening labour lead mr brown decided to keep open the option of a snap election at some point in the first half of september mr brown had gone past the point of no return when he could close down the option at minimal political cost mr brown entered no with the reputation of a master political strategist few human beings have thought as long and hard about british politics the failing was not one of intellect rather it lay elsewhere as the author of "courage eight portraits" published in june mr brown should know whats missing what voters have seen is a politician who forced his predecessor out of office yet lacked the courage to stand before them and ask for a mandate in his own right too much did he fear the risk of ending up as one of britains shortest lived prime ministers in doing so he has thrown away his best opportunity to win an election if mr brown cant win now he cant win next year indeed the prime minister has also ruled out a poll in this year was his one chance to present himself as the candidate of change it is hard to see how mr brown can refuel his premiership to the end of this parliament in his political equity with voters of being trustworthy and steady is now carrion for the conservatives to feed from the loss of his personal standing is all the more damaging because of the barrenness of his political program its heavy reliance on public spending and his abandonment of mr blairs modest attempts to improve public sector efficiency this means he has little new or attractive to offer voters the impression of cowardice will be hard to change the prime ministers poor judgment will damage his authority over the labour party for mr brown never again will it be glad confident morning while mr brown lost his nerve mr cameron kept his it was the tory leader who displayed steadiness under intense pressure at his party conference last week passing his character test with poise and grace voters will credit him for it after a difficult summer mr cameron faced the prospect of an early election which most thought he would lose his speech to party supporters was not remarkable for what he said it was remarkable for the way he delivered it a minute speech barely referring to his handwritten notes as the old adage says what doesnt destroy you makes you stronger every week when parliament is sitting messrs brown and cameron face each other across the floor of the house of commons both men now know that in their biggest trial of strength one flinched and the other did not the conservative party is strengthened too nothing unites a party like success following a period some had likened to a maoist cultural revolution the party has found that addressing the concerns of ordinary voters on crime immigration and taxation can be smart politics to voters increasingly suffering from tax fatigue the conservatives pledge to lift everyone except for millionaires out of the inheritance tax struck a chord beyond families directly affected by it the experience of recent weeks is likely to lead mr cameron to adopt a platform of moderate pragmatic mainstream conservative policies packaged and communicated in a contemporary way some of the policy positions still have rough edges the tory pledge to raise green taxes the burden of which would fall most heavily on poorer families is not an obvious vote winner every tax cut conservatives have pledged so far was offset by an equivalent tax increase it is not a big step from that position to say that every tax increase will be offset by a tax cut redistributing tax pain is one thing pledging not to increase it is an argument conservatives can make but mr brown given his record cannot and the second winner since he left no tony blair has been airbrushed out of british politics it is as if he were the ariel of british politics for years the spirit who was behind everything that happened on his island it is inconceivable that as prime minister mr blair would have found himself in the position his successor is in today sometimes politicians have to trust their instincts and step into the void without knowing what the outcome might be mr blair would have understood the risks with playing the snap election option and recognized the point at which he had to commit or close it down once past that point he would have seen it through its a rare quality in a politician it is essential for a successful political leader and so labour now begins its political equivalent of napoleons long retreat from moscow to the prospect of defeat in two or three years time mr cameron once promoted himself as mr blairs real political heir mr brown who distanced himself from his labour colleague now looks like he may be only an appendix to the blair years that is one measure of mr blairs political accomplishments mr darwall is author of "a better way to help the low paid" center for policy studies
