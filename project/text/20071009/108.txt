the middle seat some flight status alerts arent so alert we test services that promise to provide air travel updates when hours late is early northwest airlines flight from newark n j to detroit on sept arrived at a m the next day four hours late but northwests "flight status notification" service offered on its web site painted a different picture it sent one notice showing the flight arriving minutes early at p m in these days of long delays flight tracking and flight status alerts have become important tools for travelers flight tracking services such as flightexplorer com and flytecomm com tell you where the flight is often placing it on a map and sometimes overlaying weather radar and what time it should arrive flight status alerts offered by most airlines and services like flightstats com fire off emails or text messages to phones or blackberrys so you know if a gate or a time has changed savvy travelers use them for early warning of problems so they dont miss gate changes or can be first on the phone to rebook if necessary and friends and family of travelers rely on the updates to know when to pick up people at airports or whether theyll arrive in time for meetings or dinners youd think big airplanes with scores of people on board would be easy to track but it turns out theres great variation in the many different services the middle seat tested different flight trackers and flight alert services comparing airline offerings with other internet sites some big shortcomings became clear several services had difficulty figuring out what happened to flights that were held at gates for long delays or departed a gate and then sat waiting as long as several hours for takeoff a growing problem these days airline flight alert services vary in utility too some offered only limited updates and quit tracking a flight once it left the gate because it had "departed " even if it sat for hours waiting to take off a southwest airlines co flight left chicago midway minutes late but southwests departure alerts never notified people of the delay alerts sent for the flights arrival at omaha did pick up the delay but not until an hour before landing continental airlines inc was the only carrier we tested that actually sent alerts when planes took off other airlines said they believe gate departure and arrival is the pertinent information customers want since there are so many variables in between but its the uncertainty that causes people to want more information the most useful source of more information was at flightstats com which collects data from airlines airports and the federal aviation administration and sends frequent updates a big advantage of flightstats status alerts is that the service sends messages when planes actually take off and when they actually land on some flights we received eight different updates from flightstats compared with only one or two from an airline flight trackers web sites that picture the location of a plane instead of sending you information also occasionally had a hard time finding flights take airtran airways flight on wednesday a p m newark atlanta trip that pushed back from the gate more than four hours late flightview com a fairly sophisticated flight tracking site from rlm software inc was less than helpful it listed the flights status as "call airline " the companys chief executive says it does that on significant delays flytecomm com knew something wasnt quite right it listed the flights current altitude as zero and its current speed as zero but still showed it arriving on time flightarrivals com correctly figured out that the plane had not yet departed but still showed its arrival at p m minutes early flightaware com and flightexplorer com couldnt find the flight flightaware com listed the previous days trip saying the flight had already landed and flightexplorer com said "flight not found " the problem according to the companies is that they rely on data from the faas computers and the feed they get doesnt start for a flight until it takes off flight trackers offered by ticket sellers expedia com travelocity com and orbitz com were no better at tracking the airtran flight none of the sites include airtran in their airline tracking offerings they do have air malta vietnam airlines and a host of others far smaller than airtran travelocity said the problem was a "bug" being worked on orbitz says it doesnt have data from several airlines including airtran flightstats com which offers both an alert service for phones and pagers and computer based real time tracking knew that the airtran flight had left the gate in newark but wasnt yet in the air and it offered an accurate estimated arrival time the flight was more than three hours late but flightstats a unit of conducive technology corp wasnt infallible in our testing it missed some gate changes on an american airlines flight another option a new service that launched last week flights lets you call that toll free number for flight updates based on the flightstats data northwest says it does offer more information to its frequent fliers if they sign up for alerts that service delivers updates as needed but the "flight status notification" offered under "travel tools" on its web site sends only one status update northwest says of its alerts go out through the frequent flier notification setup which has four million registered users our test used the web site offering open to everyone the arrival alert northwest sent said flight would arrive in detroit minutes early at p m but the flight was held at the newark gate because of typical weather and congestion problems and ultimately pulled into detroit at a m edt al lenza northwests vice president for distribution and e commerce said the system was developed six years ago and is focused on frequent fliers who need to sign up only once to get updates on all of their flights "its a cost and priority issue "" he said "in a perfect world it would do more but we feel like what we have meets most of our customers needs " after being contacted for this article northwest now says it is considering upgrading its flight alert program to deliver multiple updates instead of just one
