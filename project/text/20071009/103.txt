to clarify sloppy signage airports hire wayfinders as early as officials at the miami international airport saw troubling signs in this case the kind of signs that are intended to guide travelers swiftly through the airport but had instead multiplied into a hodgepodge of confusing and often outdated information to clear things up the airport brought in a team from carter &amp burgess inc a consulting firm based in fort worth texas whose specialties include environmental graphic design also known as "wayfinding " on arriving at the airport carter &amp burgess wayfinder david roberts was struck by one particular sign near a parking garage meant to guide drivers to an airport exit it said "escape to the city " "we thought wow is it really that bad in here " mr roberts recalls from the viewpoint of a signage expert it was that bad "one concourse would have one language another would have four another three " he says two parking garages were labeled inscrutably "flamingo" and "dolphin " the garages have since been relabeled as north and south and are color coded the "escape to the city" sign now says "airport exit " as crowded airports launch expansion and renovation projects more travelers are getting lost just when time is of the essence signage is "a big big issue" for officials says andreas schimm a spokesman for trade group airports council international aggravated customers can mean lost business for airports and airlines chintu pandya a new yorker who travels more than miles a year blamed lack of signage at washingtons dulles international airport for causing him to miss a shuttle bus and thus a flight on a recent trip now if he flies to the washington area he chooses baltimore or reagan national without good signs he says "i dont have enough time to figure it out myself if i have short connections " good signage doesnt come cheap a new &# billion terminal can require a sign budget of about &# million including &# million in consulting fees miami international still implementing its overhaul expects to spend up to &# million even so sign consultants are in demand for their compensation these wayfinding specialists must navigate through a myriad of foreign cultures local building ordinances and delicate political issues consultants must also sort through a morass of often conflicting interests and opinions maintenance workers want signs that are easy to clean and dont require light bulbs which must be replaced airport executives want signs that are easy to see and guide passengers quickly to gates architects want signs that wont ruin their design aesthetic lawyers want signs that ward off potential liability hearing that people were getting injured on escalators while wearing rubber soled shoes like crocs and flip flops attorneys at hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport recommended signage to solve the problem "you can only imagine what a graphic pictogram of a flip flop might do " said jon yee the airports signage and graphics manager the problem has yet to be resolved with the rise of international travel language issues also have become critical should signs be multilingual which language gets top billing translations can be especially tricky because even within the same language idioms vary from country to country at hartsfield where delta air lines inc has been expanding into latin american markets officials last year began posting some signs in english and spanish but controversy erupted over the spanish translation for "gate " delta finally decided on "salida " spanish for "exit" but some spanish speakers complain the word should be "puerta " or "door " says mr yee joe labozan of carter &amp burgess prowls the worlds airports pondering questions such as why does one sign say "toilet" and another say "restroom" inconsistency is one of his signage peeves other common problems include too many signs that create confusing clutter and a lack of signs at "decision points" such as corridor crossings or the bottom of escalators where people pause to decide their next move us airways group inc recently called in mr labozan to diagnose problems in its terminals at philadelphias labyrinthine airport where passengers have such a hard time transferring that the airline has dedicated an employee to giving directions the sign doctor found bewildered passengers searching for gate c where they could catch a shuttle to concourse f at a crossing one sign pointed to "all c gates" another sign pointed in the opposite direction for c "why not just have a sign saying concourse f why say c why have another layer of information " he wondered signage can be just as irksome outside the airport where driving passengers can be faced with split decisions that lose them precious time if they get lost in philadelphia mr labozans colleague found a road sign pointing left for parking the problem if drivers turned left their cars would jump a curb jim holmes of gainesville ga was recently frustrated when he had to cross several lanes of traffic to exit in time for terminal e at dallas fort worth international airport "changing four lanes of traffic within yards is goofy " he said "theyre catering to tired ticked off travelers so it ought to be more intuitive than this " as more airlines share gates consultants are recommending electronic signs that can change messages and wayfinding specialists are considering the next wave of sign technology talking signs and video signs but the ultimate in finding your way eventually might be personalized mapquest like directions retrieved from your own electronic device says carter &amp burgesss mr roberts "punch c into your pda and youll get directions " he predicts see related letter "letters to the editor
