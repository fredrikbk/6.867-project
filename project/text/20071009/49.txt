global economy paulson turns attention to india as other efforts hit impasse treasury secretary henry paulson stymied in his efforts to broker a deal on social security or accelerate economic change in china is focusing his attentions on other parts of the world mr paulson is scheduled to travel to india later this month and to south africa next month to meet with fellow finance ministers he also may stop in a few other african nations and probably will do a little bird watching on the side say people familiar with his plans the trips to india and africa represent a shift for mr paulson until now his international agenda has been dominated by china with which he has cultivated close ties for more than a decade much of it during his tenure at investment bank goldman sachs group since taking the helm at treasury in july mr paulson has devoted much of his attention to establishing a dialogue with china aimed at coaxing it to change some of its economic policies among other things he is pushing china to allow its currency the yuan to trade more freely to open its doors to foreign financial services firms and to improve its environmental record but his efforts have been complicated by internal politics in both beijing and washington in the u s lawmakers are pushing for a more aggressive approach to china and have introduced legislation to punish the country if it doesnt allow the yuan to rise against the dollar critics allege that china keeps its currency artificially weak giving its products an unfair price advantage in world markets while china has allowed its currency to rise a bit it hasnt been enough to satisfy those critics or mr paulson u s concerns about the safety of chinese made goods such as food and toys following a series of scandals also are diverting attention from some of mr paulsons goals at the same time mr paulson is struggling to make headway on his domestic agenda his push to overhaul social security has been hampered by partisan politics on capitol hill democrats and the bush administration have yet to engage in serious talks on the matter mr paulsons other main domestic priority reducing the legal regulatory and tax burdens that he and corporate executives say are handicapping u s business is advancing but is unlikely to yield any concrete changes until after mr paulsons time in office is over partly as a result mr paulson is heading to india where he plans to push a more global initiative keeping borders open to foreign investment and helping emerging countries develop their financial markets his emphasis will be on opening up opportunities for u s companies to invest in the roads ports airports and other infrastructure india is building to support its rapid economic growth indias gross domestic product a broad measure of the value of goods and services it produces is growing at about annually investment in infrastructure is running at around of gdp or about &# billion a year and india has said it plans to boost that to about &# billion over the next five years according to arvind subramanian a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington "from paulsons point of view this is about trying to figure out how u s business can get a bigger piece of the action " mr subramanian says mr paulson is scheduled to take part in an oct conference in mumbai organized by the u s india ceo forum to "introduce u s firms to the large infrastructure investment opportunity in india " according to the conferences agenda lately many wall street firms have set up investment teams to

bushs chief economic adviser also are expected to attend according to the conference agenda treasury officials say that while china remains a major focus for mr paulson he has long been interested in india "one of the first things that secretary paulson did while in office was he went up to new york for a u s india ceo forum he recognized that we needed to start putting some real effort and work into india " said clay lowery assistant treasury secretary for international affairs earlier this year mr paulson went on a four day latin american tour that included brazil uruguay and chile during
