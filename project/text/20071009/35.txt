eyes on the road coupes make a comeback i was stopped at a light on woodward avenue in suburban detroit enjoying a beautiful fall evening recently in a borrowed silver nissan altima coupe glancing to my left i realized that the attractive something woman in the car next to me had rolled down her passenger window and was flashing me a smile as bright as the october sun "hey " she said freeze the frame i am a middle age guy with a wife a mortgage two kids and a cat i proudly declare allegiance to reality still she had my attention because in years of navigating public streets an encounter like this had never happened to me "dude " yelped my inner year old "we gotta get a car like this " car companies appear to be betting that a lot of people will want to experience moments like mine when it feels great to be in a sleek sporty car over the next four years forecasters at j d power &amp associates expect new or redesigned coupe models to hit the u s market including from luxury brands among the coupes are a two door version of general motors corp s cadillac cts and maybe coupes from italian brands alfa romeo of fiat spa and abarth an offshoot of fiat which currently dont compete in the u s market auto makers have had good reason to be wary of the coupe market despite the affection many car executives have for sporty cars since the mid s demand for coupes has waned significantly coinciding with the heart of the baby booms practical family hauling years as boomers slogged through their minivan and child seat phase interest in low slung two door midsize midprice cars cratered it didnt help that many of the offerings in the midprice coupe segment were fairly bland such as the outgoing honda accord coupe in u s auto makers built million two doors out of a total of million cars or according to wards automotive yearbook by wards data show the number of two doors built in the u s fell to vehicles out of million or through the end of september coupes accounted for of the total u s market down from the year before according to data from the power information network now however there are some signs of new life in the coupe segment at the low end sporty little cars such as toyota motor corp s scion tc and the honda civic coupe are attracting younger buyers at the high end luxury car makers are courting empty nesters and those wealthy enough to have a car for every purpose with sleek new models such as the audi a and so called "four door coupes" like daimler ags mercedes benz cls or porsche ags forthcoming porsche panamera more striking because they seemed to come out of nowhere are new designs from honda motor co and nissan motor co the accord coupe represents a significant departure from its bland predecessor honda designers created a distinctive profile for the coupe compared with the accord sedan and gave it a unique powertrain option a v with a six speed manual for more than a decade "sporty accord" was an oxymoron the new accord coupe restores some meaning to that phrase the altima coupe which i test drove last week is lighter and smaller in most dimensions than the accord coupe but it has more power in both its four and six cylinder versions consistent with its recent product strategy nissan emphasizes horsepower and sporty touches such as a push button start the altima coupes exterior profile with flaring rear fenders and narrow side glass hints at the aggressive lines of the nissan z or the infiniti g not that you would mistake the altima for one of those more expensive models but it works as a budget minded alternative the altima coupe asks you to overlook the fact that the trunk is surprisingly tiny the back seat is hard to access and rear legroom for anyone you squeeze back there is inches less than in the sedan but with coupes its really all about the driver given the demographics of an aging population looking for self indulgence car makers may be smart to put some effort into this segment
