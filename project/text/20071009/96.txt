the daily fix indians beat yanks to advance has joe torres reign ended online edition cleveland rocks all the little chicks with the crimson lips know it and now so do the new york yankees the indians beat the bronx bombers behind soft tossing paul byrd and now advance to the american league championship series to play the boston red sox the national league pennant will be contested by the colorado rockies and the arizona diamondbacks in the akron beacon journal sheldon ocker writes "so it all came down to the indians superior pitching c c sabathia fausto carmona and of course paul byrd you probably thought byrd was the weak link in the cast iron chain think again " those expecting the latest battle in the war that is yanks red sox will now acquaint themselves with a balanced tough indians team from graceful leadoff hitter grady sizemore to slugger travis "pronk" hafner the nickname stems from mr hafners being simultaneously a project and a donkey to the double play combination and copy editors bane of jhonny peralta and asdrubal cabrera on the mound theres the one two punch of messrs sabathia and carmona backed up by fearless relievers rafael perez and rafael betancourt "the cleveland indians didnt do much for east coast corridor baseball mania or the suits at tbs but they can take satisfaction in knowing theyve rescued a large segment of the american baseball viewing public from another dose of armageddon fatigue " writes jerry crasnick on espn com previewing indians red sox and adding "if thats only half a dream matchup from a marketing or tv executives point of view its because those folks typically dont reside in cleveland " as for the yankees in the bergen record bob klapisch chronicles their date with the hangman "everything in the ballpark felt slightly wrong as if the yankees had woken up in an alternate universe here it was first week of october and it was warm enough to moisten your collar inside the ballpark a slick unfamiliar voice oozed from the pa system like some open air infomercial where was bob sheppard where was chien ming wang the real one what happened to the yankees who won percent of their games in the second half " the fatal moment to mr klapisch its the double play hit into by derek jeter in the sixth inning with the yankees down but looking at runners on the corners and a chance to get back in the game "jeter stepped up against rafael perez and all you had to do was close your eyes and pretend it was the golden era of the torre era " mr klapisch writes "how many times have the yankees seen jeter rip an opposite field line drive pulling his hands in just enough to fight off an inside corner fastball its been his signature move for over a decade and as perezs fastball came hurtling toward the plate the bombers were hoping for just that another work of magic from their modern day reggie " the yankees started the season at and made the playoffs thanks to an extraordinary second half run but that likely wont be enough to save manager joe torres job yankee boss george steinbrenner said before game that "i dont think wed take him back" if the indians won was in attendance for last nights season finale and was said not to be pleased and the yankee skipper seemed resigned to his fate his postgame press conference was graceful and classy as ever but also elegiac "whatever the hell happens from here on out i will look back on these years with great pleasure " he said "the years just felt like they were minutes long to be honest with you " so wholl be the next skipper in the new york daily news bill madden bets on the st louis cardinals tony la russa noting that "steinbrenner knows he cant replace a manager with torres hall of fame pedigree with don mattingly a yankee icon in his own right but one who has never managed a game it wouldnt be fair to mattingly and it would be tough sell to hardcore yankees fans la russa on the other hand is someone steinbrenner knows well and someone who has a hall of fame managing cachet of his own " the fix is licking its chops at the mere idea of the carnivorous new york press corps given a steady diet of mr la russas unshakable faith in his own cleverness and the way he likes to rally his team against imagined media enemies this is a match made in a particularly sulfurous quarter of hell the other big question in the bronx what about alex rodriguez the mvp in waiting hr rbi can opt out of the final four years of his contract and stands to make far more than the &# million per annum he currently does in the new york daily news filip bondy starts off with some dopey swipes at the indians how does a team founded in the same year as the yankees except then they were the baltimore orioles have no pedigree but then gathers himself for a clear eyed look at what will be "a yankee offseason at full nutty tilt the lunacy begins with torres fate to be decided and then will come around quickly to a rods giant contract somewhere in there is the future of jorge posada who may matter even more than the other two in retrospect may turn out to be a relatively successful rebuilding season for the yankees who have finally blended some kids into their lineup and rotation yet in some ways this team appears further from a championship than it did two years ago its best players dont rise to any notable occasion since the yankees have been drifting downward they drift at a relatively high altitude in rarefied air but theyre still drifting " with the four championship series teams set the fix is once more looking for odesters to celebrate the two clubs that will play in the world series see details in the box up there to the left those who passed up postseason baseball for monday night football were rewarded by a game that wasnt exactly pretty but sure was exciting the dallas cowboys beat the buffalo bills despite six turnovers from tony romo as cowboys rookie kicker nick folk kicked a yard field goal with time expiring and thats not telling the whole story the final seconds featured a dallas touchdown failed two point conversion onside kick recovered a yard catch overturned on replay mr folk nailing the field goal the field goal being nullified because the bills had called time out and mr folk nailing the field goal again wow "now we know just how great tony romo is " writes tim cowlishaw in the dallas morning news "hes so good that he wins his five interception game troy aikman lost his five pick game to the giants steve pelluer lost his to the raiders danny white lost his to the giants eddie lebaron he lost a pair to the eagles and cardinals on the monday night football stage it was romo the nfc offensive player of the month for september and the man pretty much anointed as the next best thing after peyton manning and tom brady who panicked not the youthful buffalo bills defense and still dallas kept its unbeaten record " "after nearly years of this i thought i had seen it all " marvels jerry sullivan in the buffalo news "now i know better ive seen the bills lose on last minute drives on improbable field goals and disputed officials calls i was there for home run throwback for norwoods last second miss but this one i have to say this one tops them all ballgame heartbreak it seemed almost cruel after everything this team has endured this season from kevin everetts catastrophic injury to the eight other bills on the injured reserve list youd think the fates owed them one but hey this is buffalo " tip of the fix cap to reader karen okupniak found a good column
