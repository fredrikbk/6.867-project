energy oil giants leave more than oil behind in venezuela firms technology expertise may fall into hands of rivals when exxon mobil corp and conocophillips pulled out of projects in venezuela they left behind more than their rights to produce oil the oil giants also abandoned technology and know how that could fall into the hands of competitors eager to discover how to maximize production of heavy oil this viscous type of oil is more difficult and expensive to process and refine into fuels like gasoline than what the industry calls light crude but it has become increasingly valuable as rising oil prices make heavy oil more economically viable and heavy oil now figures prominently in the global race to secure new supplies the two western companies technical legacy in venezuela could offer competitors a chance to acquire expertise in drilling sophisticated wells upgrading crude oil quality and preventing costly accidents analysts say access to this knowledge could prove to be a boon for national oil companies which control the worlds largest deposits yet often depend on technology developed by the private sector western companies to access their oil exxon mobil and conocophillips decided to abandon their projects in venezuelas orinoco belt in june in the face of pressure from venezuelan president hugo chavez who demanded that all foreign oil companies in the region agree to less favorable contract terms exxon mobil which is seeking international arbitration and conocophillips which is in compensation talks with venezuela declined to comment on their technology or the amount they have invested in it the fate of any technology left behind is unclear though any company that draws from it could invite a legal challenge "venezuelas expropriation of particular assets from exxon mobil for example wouldnt extinguish exxons rights to the intellectual property expressed in those assets and someone who used intellectual property in violation of exxon mobils rights would ordinarily be expected to pay compensation " said james loftis london based chairman of the international dispute resolution practice at law firm vinson &amp elkins llc venezuelas state run oil company petroleos de venezuela sa or pdvsa has declined to comment on what it will do with the assets and technology left behind industry observers believe it will seek international partners both to share the expense and technical challenge of developing the orinocos heavy oil and to strengthen political ties with other nations as mr chavez continues to challenge the u s venezuelas oil output has been on the decline amid a lack of resources "it will be very easy for any firm that gets into a partnership with venezuela to benefit from the best practices both companies left in the orinoco belt " said manuel trevino a former pdvsa employee and president of nct corporacion petrolera latinoamericana a private company based in spain that offers consulting services to international companies in venezuela "what happens now is that venezuela will bring in new partners to work on those projects and will share with them all the experience and technology left " said bob fryklund vice president of industry relations at energy consulting firm ihs inc in houston and a former conocophillips manager venezuela is one of several resource rich nations that have strengthened their grip over oil and natural gas reserves as prices have skyrocketed in many places government moves are a backlash to accords reached in years past when oil prices were low and countries had to offer better terms to draw investment heavy oil which is sticky and has a syrup like consistency is harder to produce and process than lighter oil the worlds new crude flows are expected to be predominantly heavy and some of the biggest reserves are believed to be beneath venezuela pdvsa claims the orinoco belt has more than trillion barrels of oil of which billion barrels can be recovered with existing technology exxon mobil and conocophillips the first and third largest u s oil companies by market value had majority stakes in and operating control of three of the four energy ventures that pumped oil from reservoirs north of the orinoco river pdvsa took over operations of the four projects which include large heavy oil wells and sophisticated upgrading facilities "our studies signal that national oil companies from latin america and china india vietnam russia and iran as well as international oil companies may be interested in getting a partnership with pdvsa to operate in the orinoco " said francisco bello director of the americas for ihs and a year veteran of pdvsa "we think that pdvsa will favor partners based on geopolitical criteria " irans petropars ltd indias oil &amp natural gas corp russias oao lukoil china national petroleum corp and brazils petroleo brasileiro sa already have a presence in the orinoco belt venezuela has granted all of them the right to quantify and certify the oil reserves of seven of the blocks in which the orinoco belt is divided but these companies dont yet produce or refine oil petroleo brasileiro known as petrobras and lukoil downplayed the role of technology "we are not coming there as inexperienced learners " said a representative of lukoil the other companies couldnt be reached for comment most of the technology that exxon mobil and conocophillips used in the orinoco is available on the market if companies are willing to pay a high price but because pdvsa has operating control of the orinoco belt projects the company could share equipment infrastructure and information left behind analysts said one of the most valuable pieces of expensive technology used in the orinoco belt is conocophillipss delayed coking process which converts viscous oil into lighter crude the extensive use of the multilateral horizontal wells used world wide that were built by exxon mobil and conocophillips has also been important in making orinoco oil economically feasible alexander kolyandr contributed to this article
