the doctors office nurses reality enduring slights injuries while caring for patients online edition its just before dawn and the nurse quietly slips into the hospital room to check on the woman in the bed next to the window the iv pump is beeping because the fidgeting year old woman with a urinary tract infection and confusion has triggered the alarm again the nurses crisp uniform newly printed name tag and stethoscope free of smudges scrapes and dings mark her as a rookie shes about four months into her first nursing job after completing training at a community college but already she is confidently in her element i watch as she calms the agitated patient with a touch on the arm and a reassuring voice she checks the pump and follows tubing down to the site on the patients skin where the needle enters her arm a kink in the tubing tripped the alarm and the nurse straightens the line as she reaches up to restart the pump the glow from the sunrise illuminates a long discolored scar that runs from her right wrist to the middle of her forearm at a previous job in a nursing home a patient violently twisted her right hand and bent back two fingers rupturing tendons at the wrist the corrective surgery left her with a long thick scar and a painful course of rehabilitation despite the experience she went on to become a registered nurse she balanced school with weekend work as a nurses aide and family duties taking care of two kids shes a newly licensed nurse but she already knows that sometimes the most dangerous thing in the hospital isnt the potential for medication mistakes or medical errors its the patients that might be hard for the general public to believe but not for the nurses on a recent weekend shift at my local hospital one of my elderly patients with dementia pinched one of the nurses on the arm two weeks ago the half dollar sized bruise on her left arm is fading but not yet gone another one of our nurses recalled being punched in the ear as her most painful injury so far still another recalled being punched in the eye and having her glasses knocked off her face a nurse in our icu has a deformed index finger and nerve damage from a patients bite helping others heal comes with some occupational hazards to go with the long hours nights and weekends nurses get assaulted all the time at work they get assaulted in small and large ways at every hospital and nursing home in the country sometimes the problems come with other members of the staff including doctors im sorry to say the risks are part of the nursing job that doesnt get talked about much or even reported most nurses ive known seem to figure it comes with the territory its something that you cant always guard against many nurses and nursing assistants have had patients accidentally injure them one obstetrics nurse at our hospital was injured when a patient grabbed her around the neck while pushing in labor she needed medical treatment for a neck strain afterwards certified nurse assistants who do the bulk of patient lifting and moving get back injuries frequently they often work shorthanded because the pay is low the work is hard and their co workers dont show up patients unexpectedly drop on them or grab them and pull them off balance a study in the journal of emergency found that at a large florida hospital of nurses reported being verbally assaulted and reported being physically assaulted while at work in the past year read the abstract with hospitals focused on patient safety and patient satisfaction the nursing safety issue hasnt gotten as much attention nurses and doctors in the emergency department are the most likely to encounter workplace violence a study of michigan er doctors showed that were verbally threatened were physically assaulted and were stalked in the previous year read the abstract nobody has threatened or stalked me but a physician friend who helped me learn the ropes in residency was murdered in his home in rural western illinois in for physical safety our hospitals new emergency department is sealed off from both the waiting room and the rest of the hospital by doors that must be opened by a staff member for half a century before patients could walk in and out as they pleased weve had no major incidents but often its the elderly the chemically impaired or the psychiatrically unstable patients that lash out unexpectedly while being treated strict rules and liability associated with using restraints on combative patients have made nurses more vulnerable i doubt restraining more patients would cut down on injuries to the staff usually its the one you dont see coming that gets you due to his schedule and the volume of email he receives dr brewer may not be able to respond to all reader email he does participate in his forum where readers are urged to post his email address is thedoctorsoffice wsj com
