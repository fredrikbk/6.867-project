business technology talking tech is surfing the web eco friendly ride what could be "greener" than surfing the web you arent further changing the climate by clogging the road but instead sitting quietly in home and hearth but maybe it is more complicated than that mark thompson president and chief executive of fairchild semiconductor thinks so computer technology including the web has become a major power hog he says and we need to better understand what its true costs are not that anyone needs to lay off the keyboard at least not yet q some people say that information technology consumes of all our electricity is it really that much a the number we have is that is everything from internet server farms to what corporations run for it to the home desktop the figures i have seen for server farms are just staggering they are small towns in the way they use power they sit and run all the time they have none of the down time of a home which except for a few things like the refrigerator generally goes to sleep at night q so should people feel guilty when they are online the way a lot of people feel vaguely guilty when they use their car a i am not sure i dont think we know what the energy cost of the internet is since there are hidden costs that arent talked about very much but which i think are very ugly consider e commerce with regular commerce you drive down to your neighborhood stores to shop there are very efficient transportation methods for getting things to stores but with the internet there are fewer stores but lots of big hubs along with trucks that go out from those hubs and make lots of little runs a ups truck shows up in front of my house nearly every day for a book or a dvd probably a gallon of diesel was burned getting it to my house q does that mean we should use the web less a i am not a luddite i am a huge fan of the modern information technology structure but the more bits you demand from your house the more server farms you will cause to be built in terms of whether we should feel guilty usually one way of knowing that is knowing what the true cost of something is but we dont yet know the true cost of it yet but i am sure its not as clean as it looks q everyone knows the way appliances like refrigerators have gotten more efficient over the years havent computers a most of the computer efficiency standards so far have applied to desktop computers and involve sleep modes since the average home computer is off more than it is on the efficiency of its sleep mode is probably more important than that of its work mode but the opposite is true for servers since they are on all the time but current regulations dont address how efficient servers need to be when they are running you are allowed to be as inefficient as you want to be so the real push for server rooms will be to have bleeding edge efficiencies mandated for them q how much more efficient do you think we can make servers a today they run in the range of to efficiency and i am guessing that can be pushed up into the to efficiency i think we can cut waste in half wsj coms business tech blog is about the business of technology it is updated with posts throughout each business day at http blogs wsj com tech
