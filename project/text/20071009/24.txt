data privacy is key concern in online job applications q when completing online job applications im asked to provide my college graduation date and social security number does this give the hr department an opportunity to discriminate against me also if i dont answer the voluntary question about my ethnicity will my application be excluded a good questions with so many companies requiring job seekers to complete online employment applications many other candidates probably wonder the same things ill address the ethnicity question first federal law prohibits discriminating against job seekers because of race or gender so being asked to volunteer such information in a job application may seem odd however companies ask the question to collect data for the government that shows they are trying to interview and hire diverse candidates if a companys data collection system is designed correctly information about ethnicity goes into a database used to track sources of diversity and not to recruiters says mark mehler co founder of careerxroads a kendall park n j staffing strategy consulting firm since recruiters arent supposed to receive the information it shouldnt affect your interview chances he says "the recruiter doesnt see it so it cant be used to discriminate " on the other hand many recruiters can still detect race and gender from other information you may provide voluntarily for example the college you attended or organizations you have joined can be giveaways as for providing the year of your college graduation its fine to omit this information if you believe it might be used to screen you out for age reasons if you have the experience and skills the company is seeking youll still be contacted even if you dont answer that question says patrick dailey director of human resources for txu energy a unit of txu corp in dallas however if its a question you must answer to be able to submit the application dont assume the company is biased against older candidates mr dailey says instead view the question as a way for employers to find the best candidates not to eliminate them "recruiters use graduation dates more to determine the number of years of experience not necessarily age " says mr dailey "its to be discriminating not discriminatory " still mr mehler agrees that some older candidates should omit college graduation dates from online job applications he also suggests that they include only their last several jobs on the electronic form "just list the last years of your work experience " he advises your question about supplying a social security number concerns me most companies typically ask for the number so they can use it later to conduct background checks on serious contenders but requesting social security numbers at the application stage is premature and threatens your privacy says mr mehler i advise leaving the space blank if it isnt mandatory if you need to fill in the blank to submit the application make up a number mr mehler suggests let the company know in a cover note that you supplied a false social security number because of concerns about your privacy and that youll gladly provide the correct number later in the process since truthfulness is so critical in job applications i questioned mr mehlers advice on this he was about to conduct a seminar for company human resources and staffing professionals and i asked him to poll attendees on the issue he asked them if they objected to candidates supplying fictitious social security numbers on electronic job applications no one he polled had a problem with it mr mehler says while some people find jobs by applying for them electronically candidates are hired more often after talking with others and getting referrals its possible youd find a new position more quickly by meeting people who will refer you for openings than by completing online applications send career questions to perri capell at careersqa wsj com
