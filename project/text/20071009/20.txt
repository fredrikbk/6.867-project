college football a love story it never rains in tiger stadium by john ed bradley espn books pages &# at the top of his irs form under "occupation " john ed bradley probably says hes a writer but i suspect that late at night if you were to ask mr bradley about his identity he would say hes an ex louisiana state university football player though just as there is no such thing as an ex marine there may be no such thing as an ex lsu football player no doubt passion for the tigers is running high right now in baton rouge with lsu at no in the associated press college football rankings but as mr bradley makes clear in "it never rains in tiger stadium " that passion also runs deep mr bradley who in in his senior year was an all southeastern conference center for the lsu tigers has a story to tell and as a onetime washington post reporter he knows how to tell it "it never rains in tiger stadium" is not really a memoir not really a book about lsu or about football or about a man and his coach or a man and his teammates it is instead a love story a romance of the old fashioned kind pure enduring and defining defining how the author looks at the world and how the world sees him by page five we are off and running "i was a center for louisiana state university in the late s back when charles mcclendon was coach and i played with people who were so good to me that ive often wondered if i was somehow ruined by their goodness want to know what love feels like have a couple of teammates carry you off the field when youre so tired and beaten that youre no longer able to carry yourself want to witness firsthand an act of courage that brightens your opinion of your fellow man have a fullback step up out of nowhere and pick up the blitzing linebacker that you anchor of the line failed to block " mr bradley still remembers how his teammates voices sounded when crowded together before the opening kickoff they paused in prayer he also recalls how crowded together on the field they spit out curses and how crowded together into a charter jet on a long flight home after a loss they united in a deep eerie and abiding silence "heaven help me " he writes of his teammates "but i remember how they smelled on a saturday morning in the spring when we scrimmaged in tiger stadium and the beer theyd drunk at sorority parties the night before came whispering from their pores like sewer steam from the manhole covers on dalrymple drive " "it never rains at tiger stadium" springs from a memorable essay mr bradley wrote for sports illustrated in called "the best years of his life " in the essay he described how his visit with a dying "coach mac" mcclendon prompted a flood of memories about people and times he had tried to put behind him as he built a life as a writer with the book mr bradley more fully delves into that formative period of his life and he re establishes contact with long lost teammates one of whom is in prison "im sure ramseys victims have suffered too "" he writes "but i didnt play ball with them " mr bradley is a lucky man lucky to have played football at lsu and played it well but he may have been luckier still in the writing game the washington post took him on when scores of more experienced candidates surely were available a colorful letter he sent to executive editor ben bradlee found its way to an assistant managing editor who passed it on to the sports editor it was a leap of faith or perhaps they took on the ex jock as a curiosity mr bradleys account of his struggles as a young writer is a sub theme of this volume and in some ways as compelling as his account of his football career during those early days reporting for the post mr bradley was sent to do a feature story about the game the annual football confrontation between harvard and yale he labored mightily to capture the excitement of the crimson bulldogs clash but clearly he was struggling with more than how to depict an ancient ivy league football rivalry his girlfriend had an epiphany "youre still not over it are you " no he wasnt toward the books end mr bradley writes "there are things we never get over and for me football is one of them maybe the time will come when the memory fades and leaves me altogether and ill wonder at my silliness for having loved those days so much " maybe but were fortunate that he has recorded this account of one mans journey across the bridge from youthful passion to wiser but wistful adulthood mr shribman executive editor of the pittsburgh post gazette is the co author with jack degange of "dartmouth college football green fields of autumn "
