as tech heats up sages dust off bubble indicators goofy names index rises perks gauge glows red a th grader as founder san francisco the federal reserve monitors things like inventory levels and housing starts to gauge the economys direction in silicon valley old timers have some leading indicators of their own the goofy names index for example is back near its previous high consider orgoo inc which helps people organize all their web communications or zipidee inc a purveyor of "digital goods" such as cellphone ring tones "are these names of dogs or are they names of companies " asks kate mitchell a venture capitalist in foster city calif the rate of odd looking start ups too is on the rise one called startup schwag exists solely to deliver a monthly package of t shirts and other goodies bearing logos of other tech start ups rapper mc hammer known for s hits like "u cant touch this" and a bankruptcy filing is chief strategy officer of an online video start up called dancejam playspan inc a web gaming outfit that raised &# million boasted on its web site that it had been founded by a fifth grader then theres this familiar froth indicator some office landlords in silicon valley are again accepting stock in still private start ups in lieu of rent "it is absolutely deja vu " says david chao a venture capitalist in menlo park calif who reports seeing lots of bad business ideas from ever younger entrepreneurs "theres just as much junk now as there was in " he says that year of course was when dot com excess was nearing its glorious peak a profusion of product free businesses strange company names and profligate spending on things like in office massages start up stock effectively became legal tender for bills to landlords lawyers and workers the bubble started leaking fast in and soon left quite a mess even pessimistic prophets dont see todays silliness ending nearly as badly investments by venture capitalists while at levels not seen in nearly six years remain way below the peak so too does the tech heavy nasdaq composite index and todays start ups generally arent tapping the stock market for cash to fuel their ascent partly because technological change has brought down the cost of creating a new web company so the argument goes a deflating bubble wouldnt hurt as many people marc andreessen who helped make the historic dot com bubble possible by founding netscape communications in doesnt find the current period particularly frothy "my theory is that the next bubble will only come when everyone stops talking about bubbles all the time " he says indeed some start ups are trying to tone down the hype since its funding announcement playspan which runs an online marketplace for the virtual goods that game players need has minimized the role of its now sixth grade entrepreneur arjun mehta his mother "wants him to focus on school " says playspan spokeswoman mika kelly who adds that the child is "not involved in management " arjuns father karl mehta is the companys other founder and current ceo and companies with odd names typically argue they arent goofy at all orgoo says its name means "infinite organization" the "org" comes from organization and the "oo" looks a little like the symbol for infinity zipidees name comes from the upbeat "zip a dee doo dah" tune in the disney film "song of the south " founder henry wong thought the name sounded "memorable carefree and open feeling " just like the companys "open digi good marketplace " says spokeswoman jessie wong who is also mr wongs wife mr wong who is a venture capitalist as well as an entrepreneur says "i dont see the froth that a lot of people see " people like howard hartenbaum "it seems like were in a bubble " says mr hartenbaum a venture capitalist and hes betting on it his firm draper richards lp in san francisco has pulled back its new investing in internet companies over the past three or four months mr hartenbaums indicators he is being pitched by too many inexperienced management teams who havent worked together before and seem to think theyre entitled to start up riches and he finds entrepreneurs recycling ideas that flopped in the last tech boom such as web sites that offer group discounts for consumer purchases or pay people to surf the internet so they will look at ads free food is a bubble indicator that john v bautista watches a longtime silicon valley lawyer mr bautista cites the revival of work force perks like free eats and gym memberships he points to one of his own clients rockyou inc which invites its full time employees to order any food they want from costco during the week goodies like beef jerky and candy are continually arriving at the san mateo office of rockyou which makes software "widgets " programs that let people add things like slide shows to web pages rockyous chief executive lance tokuda doesnt see any bubble but admits the food policy "kind of reminds me of " mr bautista sees "a bunch of little bubbles " and says that "some of them are popping others are growing " the froth indicator that tech veterans cite most often is the befuddling business plan billmonk a company launched last year offers web tools to let friends keep track of debts to each other "you think about that and say give me a break " says peter falvey a co founder of tech investment bank revolution partners in boston mr falvey concedes the service might appeal to kids billmonk was bought earlier this year for an undisclosed sum by a mobile payments company obopay inc whose moniker might qualify for the goofy name index it derives from "obol " an ancient greek coin and the "obo" part also echoes the phrase "or best offer " other prognosticators cite the burgeoning internet conference scene the techcrunch web site expected attendees at a web conference in san francisco last month it stopped selling &# invitations when sign ups reached about among firms presenting there was zocdoc inc which lets people make appointments with doctors and dentists online the new york company has listings for only of the dentists in manhattan and no physicians but it has attracted interested investors says its ceo cyrus massoumi mc hammers video company was also at the techcrunch confab mr hammer born stanley burrell says he has been involved in the start up scene for years and hopes to link songs from his coming album to videos and other "premium content" on dancejam he doesnt see a bubble after the "shakeout period" of the dot com bust he says "great young minds" are developing new internet technologies at one point in the conference women in lab coats began working the crowd handing out test tubes filled with "power shots" of vodka and cranberry juice they were touting powerlabs an online "community" from a start up called powerset inc that is creating a new web search engine powerset says the women worked for a public relations firm theatrical ploys like "spokesmodels" are another troubling indicator says david hornik a venture capitalist "second and third time entrepreneurs and venture investors who lived the late s get nervous when they see these telltale signs of a bubble " he says
