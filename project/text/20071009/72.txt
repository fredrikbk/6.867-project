perchance to dream with freudian nuance today when the official sleep researchers have written off dreams as no more than meaningless froth generated through the random bombardment of cortex by the thoughtless brainstem it was very nice to read glenn h millers "masterpiece his interpretation of dreams freud brought the unconscious to the publics consciousness leisure &amp arts sept dreams indeed are wishes despite their apparent bizarreness and frightening affects unfortunately some of mr millers statements paint freud as a cruder person than the refined gentleman he was freud never described infantile sexuality in terms of four year old boys wishing to copulate with their mothers and murdering their fathers he did discover that efflorescence of sexuality reaches its zenith around the age of three to five but he described the sexuality as quite unorganized directed toward both the parents and toward siblings playmates and other caretakers and with vague ideas as to how to do it similarly the child during that age harbors all kinds of fleeting wishes for the parents who inhibit the exclusive possession of the other parent to disappear or come to harm however these wishes do not come to the childs mind as crude murdering of the father as one sees in violent movies but through the mechanism of projection and substitution as fears of wild animals monsters and naturally frightening phenomena such as tornados further freuds dream theory is not a reflection of the mental idiosyncrasy of a single white viennese male but from the beginning it was based upon analysis of dreams of his patients along with his own finally freud quoted poets and artists and not scientists because the scientists before him were clueless on how to study mental phenomena as a natural science even today the foremost scientists of psychiatry and sleep research stubbornly refuse to see dreams as no more than meaningless chaos something that no artist has any doubts about one dreams of cars girls and white christmas because what one cannot get during the day kindly nature lets one dream about it with greater success in the night surendra kelwala m d livonia mich
