the shrinking deficit we hate to be the bearers of good news but someones got to do it the congressional budget office has released its preliminary estimates for fiscal year that ended september and the federal budget deficit fell again this time by to &# billion theres more to applaud if you can stand it since deficit spending has tumbled by &# billion which is one of the most rapid three year declines in u s history the deficit as a share of the economy is down to or about half the average of the last years this improvement is especially remarkable given the &# to &# billion a year of post expenses for homeland security and the wars in iraq and afghanistan americans coughed up a record &# trillion in taxes to the irs in or more than in this means federal receipts have climbed by &# billion since the investment tax cuts the largest four year revenue increase in u s history income dividend and capital gains tax rates were all cut in but individual income tax receipts have soared by in four years with payments by the wealthy accounting for most of the windfall last years increase in individual income payments was or more than double the rate of growth in nominal gdp dont worry class warriors hannah montana and others among the "new rich" are paying their taxes overall federal revenue is now of gdp compared with the average of the past years the nearby table shows how far off cbo was as usual in its static revenue estimates that failed to anticipate the impact of taxes on incentives and growth the biggest surprise in fiscal was the slower growth in federal spending cbo reports that federal outlays crept up just last year after adjusting for timing in payments which was "well below the percent average over the previous five years " the decline was largely due to lower disaster related payments compared with hurricane katrinas aftermath the year before plus the budget deal last winter that kept domestic spending stable as congress changed hands this is a one year wonder congress is already gearing up to splurge again with its &# billion expansion in the childrens health program a &# billion five year farm bill &# billion in water projects and &# billion more in non defense discretionary spending combine this blowout with slowing revenue growth due to the housing recession and the deficit may not fall again in this is all the more reason for president bush to finally use his veto pen on spending bills the overriding lesson here is that the best antidote for deficits is faster growth not tax increases the budget deficit has declined more rapidly this decade in the wake of the bush tax cuts than it did in the s in the wake of the clinton tax increases cbo is still forecasting a balanced budget in but if congress gets its way on spending and taxes all of this progress will be short lived
