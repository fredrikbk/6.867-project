historical revisionism on immigration issue you might think that richard nadler president of americas majority foundation might check his facts before writing an opinion piece for the wall street journal but if "immigration losers" editorial page oct is any indication you would be wrong indicative of mr nadlers factual errors and intellectual sloppiness is his misidentification of the book i authored in he calls it "by any means" the book is actually titled "whatever it takes " benjamin franklin famously noted that "you cant judge a book by its cover " but mr nadler passes judgment on my book and its contents without seeing the cover reading the text or knowing the title he also engages in historical revision by omission he conveniently overlooks the most recent rejection of an open borders agenda the dramatic grassroots reaction to the so called senate "grand bargain" that stopped the misguided amnesty ambitions of the elites on the left and the right opting instead to selectively interpret the results of three republican congressional losses in the elections but any reputable analysis of the midterms must include recognition of the historical patterns that frequently accompany such elections political scientists and historians label it the "six year itch" the loss of legislative seats occupied by members of the chief executives party during the sixth year of a presidential administration combine that historical pattern with the dwindling popularity of president bush in and mitt romneys inverse sports analogy rings true "voters couldnt fire the coach so they fired some of the players " in arizonas fifth district my electoral defeat came not from my advocacy of "enforcement first " but from the voters frustration that our immigration laws were not being enforced my opponent successfully exploited that frustration paying lip service to enforcement in his television ads with the poll tested phrase "we must secure the border " in fact my opponent tried to run to my right on illegal immigration in another attack ad he made the inaccurate charge that i voted for amnesty he also claimed that he supported english as our official language though he voted against official english in the arizona state senate there was a sound political reason for my opponents english flip flop a popular ballot initiative for official english pre election polling indicated widespread support for the initiative and it passed overwhelmingly to two other propositions one restricting bail for illegals and another restricting illegals eligibility for public programs also passed with majorities in excess of what of the eight "hispanic" precincts from arizonas fifth district that mr nadler cites in his study all three ballot propositions won there as well again by large margins so much for his central assertion that "hispanic voters dont like get tough politics on border enforcement " why would the president of americas majority foundation" fail to mention these arizona majorities on three measures that get tough with illegals simple those results are inconvenient facts that dont comport with his narrative or his underlying theme j d hayworth member of congress scottsdale ariz see related letter "letters to the editor the anti deportationist backlash" wsj oct
