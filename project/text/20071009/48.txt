global economy china begins to fulfill its potential for big profits foreign firms are cashing in after years of anticipation as growth transforms nation beijing many foreign companies have long viewed china as a land of great potential but little immediate profit as recently as the late s most western marketers found this country more frustrating than fruitful a survey by consulting firm a t kearney found more than one third of multinationals were losing money in china and an additional were barely breaking even in when the american chamber of commerce in china polled its members on how long it took their local operations to post a profit many of them responded by writing humorous notes on their forms that situation has changed faster than many executives expected today china represents not only a fast growing source of revenue for many multinational companies but also a rising source of profit the change has given those companies and their shareholders a sometimes overlooked stake in the continuation of chinas rapid economic transformation although better known as a prodigious exporter china has become the worlds biggest market for cellphones with more than million wireless subscribers that makes it crucial to companies such as nokia corp and motorola inc it is second to the u s in number of internet users million a reason why sun microsystems inc expects its revenue in china to double within three years surpassing japan as suns biggest asian market china is the second biggest market after the u s for personal computers and cars it also accounts for a huge share of the global demand for commodities such as iron ore driving growth for mining interests such as rio tinto an analysis by san francisco based revere data of filings by companies trading on u s stock exchanges shows that reported that or more of their revenue came from china by last year the number had leapt to the true figure is all but certainly higher because many companies dont disclose revenue by country "everyone understood that china would be a big thing one day but nobody knew quite when that one day would come " said richard lavin chairman of the china operations of caterpillar inc a peoria ill maker of heavy construction equipment caterpillar which has been in china since said its sales really took off in the past five to eight years in that period overhauls brought by chinas entry into the world trade organization in have opened markets and trimmed red tape per capita income has tripled in the past decade helping increase consumer spending and a construction boom has boosted demand for commodities and heavy machinery caterpillar last year sold more than &# billion of goods in china roughly split between goods made locally and those exported from its u s home base while china sales account for of caterpillars &# billion in global revenue the company is looking for sales to triple by and provide one fifth of its additional global revenue during the period mr lavin said in caterpillar designated china one of its "critical success factors " the others are broad areas like distribution and quality "if we dont lead in china then our global leadership position is going to be challenged " mr lavin said caterpillar also has created a group of top executives called the china council to ensure that senior management acts quickly on new investments and other important decisions this year china for the first time will contribute more to global economic growth than any other country including the u s according to estimates by the international monetary fund with its economy expanding at a rate of more than this year china is on track to surpass germany as the worlds third largest national economy by dollar value although its annual output is still less than one quarter of the u s s at market exchange rates "people were not sure how fast this could happen " said sam su china division president of yum brands inc which gets nearly of its revenue from its pizza hut and kfc restaurants in china although yum brands of louisville ky has been in china for years longer than most western companies it is no longer exceptional in reaping significant revenue in china and that growing revenue is increasingly translating into profit in surveys by the u s china business council and the european union chamber of commerce more than of respondents said their china operations were profitable last year as a result china is becoming much more important to investors world wide even those who dont own shares in a single chinese company "china is too big to ignore so you always have to have a view of whats happening there " said brett gallagher deputy chief investment officer for julius baer investment management in new york the growth potential of the countrys domestic market also shows why so many people in business and government are concerned about the rising friction between china and its major trading partners the u s and european union over chinas currency policy and more recently the safety of chinas exports that potential is transforming the way companies do business pharmaceutical company astrazeneca plc whose predecessor company astra ab started off in china in with a manufacturing plant and a sales operation has expanded its clinical trials program here added research staff and opened a purchasing operation the china market last year generated &# million of the british companys revenue or less than of its global total of &# billion astrazeneca expects sales to increase this year and for china to be its third largest market within five years china "is an emerging market but its also a market of huge scale its a mixture of two worlds so it gets a very high level of management attention " said david smith astrazenecas london based executive vice president of operations yum brands also has changed how it runs its business to reflect chinas clout with the kfc and pizza hut restaurant chains having taken off in the current decade china is now by far yums most important growth market in the first half of this year the china division which includes small operations in taiwan and thailand accounted for of the companys profit growth over the same period last year in the most recent period yum would have reported an operating loss if not for the &# million in operating profit from china that is why yum gives mr su and his division a lot of autonomy to make investments which has in turn allowed them to open more restaurants more quickly "theres a lot of things we do a little different here than in the rest of the world " he said chinas importance also is reflected in pay mr su was yums second highest paid executive last year after the chief executive earning &# million in total compensation intel corp has made similar changes as chinas share of its total revenue rose to last year from in the first year it started reporting china sales separately this year it made china a separate business unit one of five globally that reports directly to headquarters in santa clara calif "china is the only country outside the u s with such an extensive and full operation" for intel said wee theng tan president of intel china "every part of intels business is represented here in china " corrections &amp amplifications yum brands inc would have posted a decline in operating profit for the second quarter ended june from a year earlier if not for the &# million in operating profit from the companys operations in china an oct article about chinas growing importance to multinational companies incorrectly said yum would have reported an operating loss without the chinese operations and failed to make clear the time frame of the scenario incorrectly referring to "the most recent period " wsj oct
