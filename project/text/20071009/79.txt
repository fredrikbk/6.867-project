recovered emails bedevil qualcomm in court chip maker qualcomm inc has long battled rivals in court near the end of one trial in january viji raveendran a senior company engineer made a surprise disclosure a search by her lawyers had turned up emails about a key issue that hadnt been shared with defendant broadcom corp the messages pulled from her laptop were just the tip of an iceberg size cache of evidence that contradicted arguments made by qualcomms lawyers more than pages of emails and documents that hadnt been shared with broadcom were uncovered after the trial triggering letters of apology by qualcomms lead trial attorney james batchelder and its general counsel louis lupin mr lupin later resigned following legal reverses that included a harsh ruling in the case by a federal judge qualcomm disputes the judges conclusions and hopes to reverse the ruling through a new trial or appeal "if we were interested in hiding documents we are very bad at it " argues bill sailer a qualcomm senior vice president and legal counsel now the reputations of lawyers also are on the line a federal magistrate has ordered qualcomms outside attorneys to appear at a hearing on friday to consider whether they should be sanctioned for their actions though they insist they did nothing wrong in the broadcom case "this is every trial lawyers nightmare " says francis h morrison iii a lawyer for axinn veltrop &amp harkrider llp who isnt involved in the case others are having bad dreams too failures in finding saving and sharing emails are bedeviling large and small litigants undermining their credibility with judges and affecting the outcome of high stakes trials new federal rules have reinforced companies obligations to produce electronic evidence which has exploded in volume as emails replace phone calls and other business communications morgan stanley for example has been involved in a number of cases in which it said it couldnt produce email evidence in one involving investor ronald perelman a jury in ordered the wall street firm to pay &# billion largely because of the firms handling of backup tapes containing electronic evidence an appeals court panel overturned the award in march morgan stanley has said its problems stemmed from honest mistakes such as computer glitches mr perelman is appealing the panels ruling high tech companies havent been immune to email troubles intel corp for example estimates that it will spend more than &# million on technology consultants and staff labor to recover emails it failed to protect from deletion in a high profile antitrust suit brought by rival advanced micro devices inc one of the thorniest issues is distinguishing between deliberate and accidental failures in discovery the pretrial process in which parties request evidence from each other the qualcomm case raises special challenges a jury in january rejected qualcomms charges that broadcom infringed its patents u s district judge rudi brewster who presides in qualcomms hometown of san diego later found that qualcomm and its lawyers had engaged in "an organized program of litigation misconduct " qualcomm disputes that but has insisted that communications with its lawyers remain private because they could affect other cases involving broadcom its former trial team complains that the restriction makes it hard to show what happened they filed lengthy declarations last week apologizing for what they say were honest mistakes and expressing chagrin at the judges ruling "words cannot convey how disappointing it was for me to read judge brewsters order " wrote mr batchelder the lead trial attorney who has appeared before the judge on behalf of qualcomm since qualcomm besides selling chips makes money by charging royalties for its cellphone patents broadcom a maker of communications chips trying to expand its role in cellphones has objected to qualcomms royalty rates the irvine calif company has joined other qualcomm opponents in filing an array of suits against the company qualcomm sued broadcom in october for allegedly infringing two patents on video compression technology the chairmen of both companies were among the witnesses in the trial that ran from jan to jan among other things broadcom alleged that qualcomm violated an obligation to disclose its patents to an industry committee setting standards on the technology such groups often avoid selecting patented technologies that can obligate users to pay royalties qualcomm insisted that it hadnt participated in the group called the jvt for joint video team before the group defined the standard in may but judge brewster after reviewing emails released after trial ruled aug that qualcomm had participated in the jvt as early as january he concluded that qualcomm hid its patents as part of a "carefully orchestrated plan " potentially "holding hostage" future users of the technology the judges opinion also says qualcomm was guilty of "stonewalling" in production of evidence before during and after the trial he ruled that qualcomm should lose rights to enforce the patents and ordered it to pay broadcom legal fees later estimated at &# million u s magistrate barbara major now reviewing what happened is expected to focus on the actions of day casebeer madrid &amp batchelder llp the cupertino calif firm that led the litigation for qualcomm and lawyers who also worked on the case for san francisco based heller ehrman llp another likely focus is ms raveendran the qualcomm engineer she testified in a july deposition that she had learned of the jvt group "somewhere in the time frame " through technical literature broadcom however had uncovered her name on a december email distribution list from a jvt committee that became an issue during the trial stanley young of heller ehrman insisted in a jan side conference with the judge that "theres no evidence that any email was actually sent to this list " several days later day casebeer partner lee patch asked ms raveendran during the last day of testimony whether she had read any emails from that committee or sent any to the mailing list she said no during cross examination however a broadcom attorney asked if she had received any messages from the group she disclosed that some had been found while preparing for her testimony they were handed to broadcom lawyers during a lunch break after the trial qualcomm lawyers disclosed that the emails had been discovered on ms raveendrans laptop jan judge brewster during a hearing questioned why the qualcomm lawyers didnt disclose the emails right away day casebeer lawyers argue in court papers that they initially concluded that they werent obliged to share them because of the way broadcoms evidence requests had been narrowed by qualcomm objections mr patch apologized in a declaration for not sharing the email discovery with mr young and others on the trial team he conceded his approach to ms raveendrans testimony about the emails could have been more explicit "however i had no intention to conceal the existence of them from the court the jury or broadcom " he said the trove of emails uncovered after the trial disclose that ms raveendran had been receiving reports since early about the jvt group in a declaration filed last week she says she misunderstood the deposition question thinking she was being asked when she first studied the standard the group developed she points out that the lawyers hadnt asked to search her computer for any emails that could have helped to refresh her memory "it was not my intent to conceal or diminish my own or qualcomms involvement with the jvt in the time frame " ms raveendran writes day casebeer complains that the attorney client privilege prevents it from responding to her statements or explaining why other emails werent found earlier but the firms declarations do cite a belated discovery that two groups at qualcomm were involved with jvt noting that only one teams emails were ever searched a broader explanation is that finding evidence in complex cases is difficult especially under the unusually tight time pressures of this case "the evidence shows the lawyers and the client did their best " says james wagstaffe a san francisco lawyer representing mr patch
