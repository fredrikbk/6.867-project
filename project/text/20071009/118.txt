zoellick fights for relevance of world bank washington in his first three months on the job world bank president robert zoellick made peace with bank staff who helped force out his predecessor paul wolfowitz now he says he is trying to figure out how to stop the bank from sliding into irrelevance even though that may mean taking on critics inside and outside the bank in a speech tomorrow mr zoellick plans to propose using free trade to try to spur economic growth and social cohesion in arab nations re energizing efforts to rebuild impoverished nations emerging from civil wars and boosting environmental programs and regional development in china india brazil and other fast growing "middle income" nations his mantra "inclusive and sustainable globalization " the approach he will map out is likely to run into criticism from some inside the bank who worry that free trade isnt a panacea for many countries and inflame external critics who argue that the bank should let fast growing countries like china finance their own development from reserves mr zoellick will deliver his speech a week before representatives of the banks shareholder countries descend on washington for their annual meeting where they will have to consider the banks long term strategy rapid growth in the developing world where the banks clients are means that even many poor countries have easy access to credit the bank since world war ii the worlds largest poverty fighting institution competes with what it estimates are as many as other agencies focusing on poverty and health care which are run by billionaires celebrities and individual nations if the bank loses ground to these groups it will be harder to get poor countries to take its advice and could make fund raising for its projects more difficult mr zoellick says the bank would like to become a kind of "general contractor" that puts together aid programs involving other donors but theres scant evidence that other agencies are looking for such help conservative economists argue that the bank no longer has a role to play in many places pointing to mr zoellicks goal of increasing ties to middle income nations allan meltzer an economist at carnegie mellon university says he already "has shown he wont make major reforms at the bank " mr meltzer was chairman of a congressional commission in that recommended overhauling the bank so it focused on giving grants not loans to the worlds poorest nations mr zoellick in an interview says continuing to do business with countries like china and india will give the bank influence over their policies so their growing economic might wont seem as threatening to the u s and europe "frankly we need more ways in the world for countries to work together on common problems not fewer " he says the left is bound to grow critical as well of mr zoellicks emphasis on free trade as a recipe for prosperity free trade skeptics including many world bank economists say some african countries rely on european subsidies for cheap food imports and need tariffs to fend off competition from china the banks past prodding of nations to lower barriers to trade and investment has made it a perennial target of antiglobalization demonstrators "the extent to which trade leads to more growth is a subject of controversy among economists " says nobel prize winner joseph stiglitz a former world bank chief economist who has become a hero of the antiglobalization movement "but there is little controversy that successful development requires far more than just trade liberalization " created in to rebuild war shattered europe the bank has morphed into an institution that lends money and dispenses advice to countries in latin america africa and asia for roads clinics and schools and helps bail out those nations when they run short of credit the bank backed by the worlds governments borrows at favorable rates in financial markets and then lends at slightly higher rates to developing nations over all it lends about &# billion a year to developing nations mr zoellicks appointment followed the short unhappy tenure of mr wolfowitz who earlier had been an architect of the iraq war promising to root out corruption after he was named president in mr wolfowitz halted projects in africa and asia that had been accused of graft his campaign sharply divided the staff when the staff leaked memos indicating that mr wolfowitz helped his girlfriend a bank staffer get a plum assignment elsewhere and a big raise pressure mounted although mr wolfowitz said he had acted properly he resigned "i hope nobody will draw the lesson that reform is too difficult and shouldnt be undertaken " says mr wolfowitz the year old mr zoellick took over in july and won the affection of the staff by turning himself into the un wolfowitz mr wolfowitz relied heavily on a few recruits from the two bush presidencies mr zoellick hasnt hired a single one mr wolfowitz froze out bank staff mr zoellick meets with the banks or so vice presidents every morning a harvard trained lawyer mr zoellick has also turned out to be a cannier politician than mr wolfowitz he has hammered out a few compromises inside the banks member board which is marked by deep fissures among rich countries deeply impoverished ones and those in the middle one early victory came in his campaign to win pledges of as much as &# billion from wealthy nations to fund the world banks international development association which aids the worlds poorest nations to spur giving by the u s europe and japan mr zoellick wanted to double the amount the bank itself contributed to ida to &# billion but middle income countries wanted the money to be used for projects in their nations instead and board members signed a petition opposing the larger ida contribution mr zoellick won them over by cutting another deal in which rich countries agreed to a cut in the banks interest rates on loans to middle income countries in exchange for their backing for the larger ida contribution tall thin and serious mr zoellick learned washington politics as a protege of james baker secretary of the treasury and secretary of state in the reagan and first bush administrations later he became u s trade negotiator in the george w bush administration he left the administration in for a vice chairmans job at goldman sachs group inc mr zoellick says hes a "quick draw" on his blackberry which stores the contact information for officials he has met over the years such contacts help him politically when former federal reserve chairman paul volcker released a report in september criticizing the banks faltering anticorruption efforts mr zoellick countered immediately by inviting u n secretary general ban ki moon for a joint press conference to announce a program to help poor countries recover money stolen by dictators in the longer term mr zoellick says he plans to focus more on the arab world and encourage the kinds of reformers he met when negotiating free trade pacts with oman bahrain and morocco and pushing for stronger trade ties among egypt israel and jordan he also wants to intensify the world banks efforts to help impoverished countries recover from civil wars mr zoellick says the bank has learned to quickly rev up basic services such as sanitation pickup and electricity generation rather than flooding a country with development aid too much money in government coffers invites corruption "i think a lot in probabilities " mr zoellick says "i have to increase the probability of success "
