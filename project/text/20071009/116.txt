u s opens the door to chinese pills approval of aids medicine for seen as first shot in generics fight with india linhai china when a small drug maker here got food and drug administration approval for an aids drug this past summer the chinese pharmaceutical industry quietly passed an important milestone as far as the agency can tell it is the first time a chinese company has won permission to export finished pills to the u s expect a lot more pharmaceutical makers here to get the green light over the next few years even as chinese products are drawing increased scrutiny the nations generic drug industry is gearing up for the export of finished medicines the industry is still small indias generics export powerhouse is times as big but china is already the worlds largest producer of raw materials for drugs and manufacturing those raw materials is a steppingstone to making the completed product that is what happened at ranbaxy laboratories ltd indias biggest indian pharmaceutical company by sales started out in making drug ingredients in a ranbaxy plant in toansa won fda approval to export raw ingredients to the u s ten years later ranbaxy launched the first of its own products the antibiotic cefaclor in the u s following fda approval now north america is the companys largest market contributing &# million in revenue to its &# billion total for last year zhejiang huahai pharmaceutical co the chinese drug maker that won fda approval this summer is "exactly an example of a chinese company today attacking the developed markets " says yusuf hamied chairman of cipla ltd one of indias top drug companies dr hamied calls the chinese "brilliant scientists and brilliant chemists" and warns that "india is no match for them if they pick up their english language and pick up a little on regulatory approvals which theyre doing very fast anyway " to export its fda approved medicine huahai must wait until may when a u s patent held by boehringer ingelheim gmbh for the aids drug nevirapine which the german company markets under the brand name viramune is set to expire huahai currently sells nevirapine to the chinese government for around &# for one bottle of milligram pills but the fda imprimatur will make it easier for huahai to get other approvals and attract american drug partners huahai now hopes to replicate its fda performance with other pharmaceutical products and to start exporting a finished dosage alzheimers drug to europe as early as next year it also hopes to bid through the clinton foundation to sell drugs to africa whether or not huahai meets its ambitious goals the nevirapine approval is likely to be the starting point of any timeline drawn years from now when chinas finished generics industry is likely a force to reckon with thanks to chinas low costs and abundant resources major markets already depend on the country for raw drug ingredients as well as for commodities like vitamin c for which chinese manufacturers provide more than of the supply used in the u s indeed chinas growing dominance in manufacturing is steadily increasing its power to set the prices of a wide variety of industrial and consumer products konda reddy a health care analyst in india for frost &amp sullivan a research and consulting firm says chinese prices for raw pharmaceutical materials are already to below those of indian rivals previously "the europeans were afraid of india " says jinsong du a health care analyst in hong kong with credit suisse now "its china the growth is so huge " huahai based in linhai on chinas eastern coast was founded by chen baohua in with an initial investment of around &# and employees mixing chemicals in a one room warehouse the year old mr chen now owns of the companys stock and manages huahais employees huahai used to focus on hypertension drugs but now makes a stable of generic medicines though still very small it saw sales nearly triple to million yuan &# million last year from million chinese yuan in the companys profit has more than doubled in that same period rising to million yuan the stock price has also soared in recent years for now huahai doesnt plan to follow indian generics titans actively challenging the patents of blockbuster drugs in the courts nor does it plan to try to develop drugs on its own "currently we dont we think have that kind of capability or technical knowledge of doing a patent challenge " says jessica yu huahais regional representative for north american and japanese sales other chinese companies are hoping to win a share of the generics market hisun pharmaceutical co established in is now one of chinas largest producers of apis and shanghai desano chemical pharmaceutical co exports materials for aids drugs to india thailand and brazil the current alarm over toxic drugs toiletries and toys from china could pose a marketing challenge to chinas would be generics export industry for the past year chinas own drug regulatory agency the state food and drug administration has been embroiled in a corruption investigation culminating in the execution of its former chief zheng xiaoyu in july for taking bribes to speed drug approvals the same month huahai won its fda approval in spring five people died after taking injections of a medicine made by qiqihar no pharmaceutical co to save money the company had used diethylene glycol the same chemical that the fda said recently might be in toothpaste produced in china still the approval for huahais aids drug granted even amid the outcry over the chinese exports suggests the mechanism is in place for the countrys pharmaceutical export industry to grow the raw materials so far have continued to flow and major companies stand by their chinese sourcing "our global head of operations comes here every year just to make sure that this relationship and this supply are reliable " says yin xudong astrazeneca plcs vice president of primary care for in china chinese drug companies are the main suppliers of the raw ingredients needed to make astrazenecas seroquel an blockbuster that is used to treat schizophrenia and other mental disorders according to mr yin in april the fda sent two officials to inspect huahais finished dosage factory xu pijie the year old plant manager remembers them asking hard questions and giving advice on how to improve the manufacturing processes "they had very detailed specifications about how to wash all the equipment " mr xu says "i was a little nervous " once nevirapine made by huahai is sold in the u s the fda will inspect the factory and drugs periodically "depending on a variety of factors including any known risk associated with the product manufacturing process or facility " an agency spokeswoman says china is struggling to stem a steady flow of counterfeit drugs fake viagra tablets for instance can be bought in airport lounges here the country does have relatively strict laws that at least on paper protect drug patents although enforcement can be spotty or even nonexistent "we will see counterfeits " says astrazenecas mr yin "but the chinese sfda will not issue a new drug license for a compound that we already have a patent for that will not happen " anna wilde mathews in washington contributed to this article
