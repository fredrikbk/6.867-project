dropping the bomb saved a lot of lives in japan bret stephens "waterboarding and hiroshima " editorial page nov got me thinking about the time i met paul tibbetts years ago i asked him if he regretted dropping the bomb on hiroshima he replied "i had a duty to perform ive never lost a single nights sleep over it " he also told me that after lecturing publicly about dropping the bomb he would be thanked by american soldiers who didnt have to conduct the invasion of japan with casualties estimated at more than one million dead and wounded surprisingly he was also thanked by japanese civilians who knew that their lives were spared by japans surrender as the emperor had ordered japans civilians to fight u s invaders to the death ive stood at ground zero in hiroshima and felt heartsick as i looked at the mementos of nuclear destruction housed in the museum there as horrible as the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki were the alternative would have been far worse for americans and for the japanese both germany and japan were rushing to develop their own atomic bombs if they had succeeded history as we know it would be quite different gen tibbets deserves thanks and respect for doing his job in a kill or be killed situation for america i am anti war but not anti military we need a strong military to protect us from those who wish us great harm and the world is full of them john white cheshire conn
