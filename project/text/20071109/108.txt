web scammer targets senior u s executives email hoax believed to dupe thousands mr stewarts pursuit myrtle beach s c for months a sophisticated hacker has been stealing the personal data of american corporate executives hot on the hackers trail is joe stewart the former bass guitarist turned cyber sleuth stumbled onto the case in february since then the year old mr stewart has spent weeks in his office in a nondescript building next to a half abandoned strip mall here virtually chasing the mysterious perpetrator across several continents mr stewart early on thought he had traced the scammer to china then realized it was a false lead only when the perpetrator stumbled did mr stewart get a break in the case mr stewart a top researcher for atlanta based internet security firm secureworks inc says most of the scammed executives declined requests to discuss their experience he says they include senior executives at fortune companies working in industries from airlines and banks to manufacturing and pharmaceuticals the number of those affected is likely in the thousands in may mr stewart who works closely with law enforcement says he found one cache of data stolen by the scam from more than executives news of the con which specifically targeted intended victims with personalized emails quickly swept through the nations internet security ranks this scammer "knew your name your title and your organization " says jose nazario a researcher in the ann arbor mich office of arbor networks inc an internet security company in the early days of the internet hackers broke into large computer systems just to prove they could later mischief makers created and blasted "virus" software world wide rapidly infecting millions of terminals within hours and slowing legitimate internet traffic over the years americans also became acquainted with the email scam such as a sender posing as a bank and asking for account information such scams often were loaded with grammatical and spelling errors and lacked details tailored to the recipient they were sent far and wide in hopes of hooking a few naive victims but in the past two years law enforcement officials and internet security experts say the global growth of broadband has fed a dramatic jump not only in the quantity but also the quality of cyber attacks messagelabs a new york based internet security firm says the number of hoax emails addressing recipients by their names and including their professional affiliation among other personal details has soared in recent months in mid september the company discovered more than such emails over a hour period and in late june more than over two hours last year it rarely saw more than one of these emails a day one factor behind the change is the explosion in popularity of social networking web sites like facebook and linkedin which give scammers access to information like a persons professional title and company affiliation mr stewart figures at least some of the targeted executives were found by the scammer searching for those with "c"s in their titles like ceos and cfos corporate web sites and news releases also provide helpful data for criminals whats more since many executives answer email directly they are directly accessible in ways their predecessors werent then theres the wide availability of illicit skills online criminals on the web used to have to design and program their own viruses and scams now such expertise can be purchased online for several hundred dollars armed with such tools scammers can target specific groups of people such as wealthy executives the emails are sophisticated enough to dupe even discriminating web users one morning in may such an email landed in the inbox of scott foernsler head of global sales at airweb inc an atlanta mobile messaging and marketing company it informed him that a better business bureau complaint had been filed against him and asked him to click an attached link to respond the email featured the better business bureaus familiar torch logo running across its top on a blue background it addressed mr foernsler by name and also provided the name of his firm as well as a case number the senders email address consumer complaints bbb org the email looked so professional that mr foernsler an executive with years of sales experience never suspected a thing "anything about our customers i want to take action on " he says he clicked on the link and was informed he would be contacted again mr foernsler then received another email informing him that the complaint had been resolved he gave the matter no further thought until early june when secureworks notified him that his computer was infected by clicking on the bogus complaint link he had downloaded software that was sending anything he then inputted online such as passwords credit card numbers usernames banking information and personal browsing to a web site controlled by a criminal mr foernsler has since changed all his passwords and usernames and had the software removed but like the other executives scammed he has no idea what information was stolen or what criminals may be doing with it one of a handful of web sleuths to proactively go after bad guys mr stewart is chasing this con artist largely on his own with internet service providers more focused on signing up subscribers and law enforcement only recently bulking up on resources policing the web relies heavily on a loosely coordinated community of obscure university researchers volunteers and security experts of varying backgrounds and expertise "its like the old west when there was very little law enforcement for a large territory " says mr stewart a dogged gumshoe mr stewart almost never got into computers he taught himself programming languages on his sixth grade teachers computer after school but abandoned the hobby several years later assuming there were few interesting careers in the field it was the late s before the existence of the commercial internet mr stewart turned his attention to radio broadcasting in college but dropped out when he ran out of money for tuition with a wife and two young boys to support mr stewart stocked shelves at a lowes home improvement store during the day and at night alternated between stacking shoes in a shoe store and mopping floors at a pizza hut restaurant in mr stewarts mother gave him her old computer he scrounged up enough money to get online and began programming again occasionally fixing computers for friends that led to a job as an analyst with an internet security firm in town which was eventually acquired by his current company secureworks mr stewart quickly gained notice for his willingness to post his findings online in order to make others aware of new threats and to share his various techniques many experts demur out of fear of retribution after russian hackers described by mr stewart attacked his personal web site secureworks decided to remove the company sign from the myrtle beach office the gray one story building is surrounded by a barbed wire fence with a security camera at the gate mr stewart first became aware of the better business bureau scam last february when a colleague forwarded him the email mr stewart was impressed with the emails professional appearance and its tactic of striking at the recipients desire to keep customers happy he gave chase mr stewart found the attack was hosted on a new domain name registered on a server located in china under the name li hu the registrar that sold the domain name did business only in chinese at one point the attack was collecting megabytes of data every day the attacks escalated by the beginning of june the virus was unleashing nearly fake emails a day on secureworks clients alone but mr stewart began to believe the scam did not originate from china the typical chinese scams involve extracting trade secrets from companies and governments whats more chinese computers are often enlisted in attacks by scammers trying conceal their location since a high number of chinese computers use pirated software security measures are low making them particularly vulnerable to enlistment in cyber armies controlled by others realizing the chinese connection was a decoy mr stewart began looking for clues in the cache of stolen data before mr stewart found it the scammer had moved the stolen data with increasing frequency mr stewart tracked it to web sites hosted on a server in dallas then philadelphia toronto and back to dallas in late june mr stewart discovered the perpetrator had made a costly mistake combing through the stolen cache of data he had found mr stewart noticed one infected computer had accessed a familiar web site address the same one used to host the scam mr stewart concluded the scammer had mistakenly infected his own computer now he had the scammers computer address a numerical address attached to every computer public sources available online show the internet service provider where every computer online in the world is registered law enforcement can use that information to identify and in some cases eventually arrest the suspect armed with his first real clues mr stewart was then able to obtain files from other web site hosting services associated with the address he began piecing together the persons identity tracing his online activity back several years he found connections between this scam and others that used the same web server and employed similar coding techniques leading to additional email addresses online aliases and web sites most likely used over the years by the same person those included a web site for what initially appeared to be a legitimate investment company called ronald west and another for a company called beitel electronics both turned out to be bogus names used as part of his criminal operation mr stewart found an older version of the beitel electronics site under the name trispective a google search of that name led to an array of postings dating back several years from a young romanian male those postings provided additional details the person is fluent in english born on july and often goes by the online alias "raynor " a reference to a character from the online game starcraft professional criminals on the web rarely leave clues but there is a point in their lives when they are just entering the field and still learning how to conceal themselves that formative period still traceable on the internet can provide tidbits of information critical to unlocking the persons identity using the variety of names he had collected he found one posting from late under the name trispective showing that the individual at the time owned and wanted to sell the domain name thegov org using an archival web tool mr stewart in mid june found an actual photo of "raynor" attached to the site at the time it shows a glowering young man standing in what appears to be a computer room with tiled walls and a bank of computer terminals behind him he has dark heavy eyebrows jet black bangs hanging over his face and a holstered gun strapped over his shoulder mr stewart forwarded his collected evidence to the federal bureau of investigation the agency in recent years has stationed agents in romania and more than other countries to follow up on such leads "we are in an electronic arms race " says shawn henry deputy assistant director of the fbis cyber crime division "every time our technology catches up with the latest malicious software the bad guys come up with another way to get in " he declined to comment on whether the agency is investigating raynor the person using that screen name did not respond to an email seeking comment the scam is still circulating one week last month secureworks detected such emails though it is likely being done by copycats the scam has also taken other forms including an email that purported to be from the internet revenue service informing recipients they are being investigated for tax fraud another version sent a phony invoice for services rendered raynors biggest advantage lack of awareness since most of its victims are too embarrassed to go public patrick boegel an executive with an advertising company in albany n y called media logic discovered the scam software on his computer after mr stewart contacted him mr boegel didnt believe it at first but eventually was able to determine that several things were compromised including log in information for email and other web sites including a photo gallery site initially willing to discuss his experience mr boegel later declined citing "company policy " mr boegel was lucky his data was found by mr stewart and he was told what was happening nobody except perhaps raynor knows how many executives were ensnared how much data stolen or the financial toll mr stewarts pursuit continues late last month mr stewart found the romanian had come up with a new idea sending infected emails purportedly from the equal employment opportunity commission telling recipients a harassment complaint was filed against them this week raynor was sending as many as such emails to secureworks clients each day
