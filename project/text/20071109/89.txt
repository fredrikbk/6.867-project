sign up for the e mail here potentially resolving one of the biggest litigation question marks in corporate america merck has dropped its insistence on fighting all vioxx lawsuits one at a time and is expected today to announce a &# billion settlement covering most of the related injuries the settlement reported by the wall street journal and new york times could help the company put behind it a health scandal that helped undermine the reputation and finances of the broader pharmaceutical industry and its regulators three years ago merck pulled vioxx off the market in amid reports the lucrative and widely prescribed painkiller was causing sometimes fatal heart disease and strokes and an avalanche of lawsuits followed the settlement would be one of the largest ever reached in civil litigation the times notes but mercks change of strategy is somewhat surprising considering the vioxx trial record so far wins and five losses the journal points out moreover merck had won four of the five cases considered to be bellwether suits for future trials still mercks vioxx related legal fees have been running at more than &# million a year the times says a new wave of trials was set to start in january and judges in louisiana new jersey and california where almost all the lawsuits are overseen have been pushing plaintiff lawyers and merck to reach a deal under the agreement the severity of plaintiffs injuries would determine how much they receive from the company and "based on the fact that the suits cover about sets of plaintiffs the average plaintiff will receive just over &# before legal fees and expenses which usually swallow between and of payments to plaintiffs " the times says those who dont accept the settlement can continue to sue and while deemed unlikely the agreement could still collapse it would become binding only when of the plaintiffs sign on parsing pakistani democracy promises yesterday pervez musharraf said that in spite of the state of emergency he imposed and a state of governance currently resembling martial law pakistan would hold elections no later than feb and that the president himself will soon give up his second job as chief of the military today benazir bhutto said that though she hasnt been served with house arrest papers like hundreds of other opposition leaders and democracy activists security forces tried to keep her from leaving home with coils of barbed wire and cement barricades when she tried to get through it all to attend a planned protest rally her car was blocked by armored vehicles while police reportedly rounded up some of her supporters the associated press says nearly a week after gen musharraf suspended pakistans constitution and amid broad international condemnation and cooling support but support nonetheless from the bush administration for its nominally terror fighting ally pakistani democracy remains in abeyance and it seems increasingly difficult to foresee how it can return under a leader opposed by both the secular and islamist factions of pakistani society "in interviews on the streets of islamabad the capital and in this nearby garrison city over the last three days rich and poor

militancy " what me worry it has been a season of volatility in the worlds financial arena but today we near the end of what the wall street journal describes as "two of the most tumultuous weeks in the history of wall streets executive suites" most of the tumult due to an inability to realistically judge risk as it happens headline writers were quick to judge yesterdays congressional testimony by federal reserve chairman ben bernanke as either grim or optimistic though as the journal points out mr bernankes bottom line merely echoed the feds statement last week "that it saw the risks of economic weakness and higher inflation as roughly balanced a signal it thought no more rate cuts would be needed " since then the journal adds the markets have fallen in start and stop fashion "on worries about the prospect of bigger mortgage related write offs by banks and other financial institutions " and businessweek sees the feds view of balanced inflation recession risks conflicting with what seem to be softening labor markets tighter lending conditions and stratospheric oil prices the journal also reports that investor demand "for all sorts of risky debt pockets of the credit markets that just weeks ago seemed on the road to recovery are weakening again " and it notes debt rating services like moodys standard &amp poors and fitch "look poised to downgrade hundreds of mortgage related investments worth tens of billions of dollars creating the potential for more market unrest " since well before the august credit crunch and market meltdown critics had slammed the raters for vastly underestimating the damage that defaulting high risk mortgages would trigger up through the chain of packaged and securitized debt now as the journal says theyre moving aggressively in the other direction schwarzenegger sues bush administration impatient with the nearly two year delay since california asked the environmental protection agency to waive federal regulations and green light

redesign passenger cars and suvs in time for the model year "we are now ready to implement the nations cleanest standards for vehicle emissions and we cannot do that of course until the federal government gives us a waiver " gov schwarzenegger said "our health and our environment are too important to delay any longer " in suing the administration california "had some powerful cheerleaders other industries including electric utilities that want to shift a coming climate change cleanup burden away from themselves " the wall street journal reports the suit "is the latest twist in a long running attempt by state officials to force auto makers to produce cars that emit lower levels of emissions that contribute to global warming mainly carbon dioxide " the journal adds it "was endorsed by other states mainly in the northeast and pacific northwest " toxic substances found near oil sands the huge oil sands project in alberta canada has been a major emerging source of petroleum in the
