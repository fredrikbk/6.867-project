california town relives gold rush firm sees green in shuttered mine but picturesque grass valley warily eyes return of industry nearly years ago miners struck gold in grass valley calif not far from where the california gold rush began a few years earlier booms and busts continued in mining towns nestled in the sierra nevada foothills until after world war ii when gold prices hit bottom one by one the mines closed leaving miles of shafts and tunnels and undiscovered gold now as technological advances and &# gold prices have mining companies scoping out potential sites across the west one mining company has its eye on grass valleys idaho maryland mine once the states second most productive underground gold mine that is forcing city leaders in the picturesque town of to wrestle with a tough question how much of its past should grass valley embrace in california mining companies are looking to restart other inactive mines including inyo countys briggs mine and imperial countys mesquite mine canadian outfits have proposed a new open pit copper mine in southern arizonas santa rita mountains and a new open pit gold mine at the headwaters of the boise river in idaho heavy industry remains a hard sell in the st century especially given californias strict environmental laws that require mining companies to return mine surfaces to a condition that can be adapted for alternate uses but the bid by the vancouver b c based emgold mining corp to reopen the idaho maryland mine faces unique challenges because it would be californias first fully operational industrial gold mine within a modern city the case is further complicated by the fact that grass valley isnt the same city it was when the mines closed years ago the population of nevada county has more than tripled since and that growth means that some of the miles of abandoned shafts sit underneath industrial parks offices and homes the local hospital and the four lane california highway overlook the mine located miles from downtown "its a huge challenge " says mayor mark johnson years old who runs a florist shop that his family has operated in town for years "you have an industry that is responsible for building this great community but more and more people have come to grass valley " excluding coal and other fuels california is the third largest mining state in the country mostly in sand gravel and other aggregate base materials but gold production fell by last year and the &# million in gold production was a sliver of the &# billion haul in total mineral production still grass valley is watched across the state as interest in mining rises says dave watkinson president and chief operating officer of emgold after the mines closed grass valley first turned to logging but as resource intensive industry died out grass valley cultivated an entrepreneurial high tech sector the grass valley group a film technology firm founded in has anchored the town as it became a "silicon valley" for broadcast and video technology meanwhile city leaders have attracted a steady stream of tourists by preserving the feel of a western boomtown complete with iron shutters on old brick buildings along main street that date to the s those visitors helped spawn a fledgling wine industry grass valleys postmining recovery has galvanized some residents who eye the return of heavy industry warily "its hard to imagine that tourists would want to come here with giant mining trucks rolling through town " says david brownstein president of the wolf creek community alliance a local group that opposes the project other residents worry the mine will erode the high quality of life and natural beauty that have attracted professionals and retirees "theres a gold mine here already and that is the beauty of this community " says ralph silberstein a software engineer the environmental scars of minings past also linger last year the state government began cleaning up toxic chemicals that were contaminating the soil and waterways at grass valleys empire mine with newmont mining corp one of the mines previous owners and two years ago the federal government started similar decontamination efforts at the lava cap mine designated a superfund site and located six miles east of grass valley "what happens when mining leaves us again and leaves us with another mountain of hazardous waste " asks mr brownstein along with increased traffic residents also worry that their private wells could be depleted when emgold begins dewatering million gallons from underground shafts water concerns are also the biggest legal hurdle facing emgold says john parrish californias state geologist "where do they put the water that comes out of the mine and if it isnt processed is it carrying unwanted minerals and chemicals " other critics have questioned the companys financial viability the company which trades on the toronto based tsx venture exchange recently completed &# million in equity financing but laid off six workers this summer in the s emgold then emperor gold corp won approval to mine in grass valley the firm failed to secure financing after gold prices sank in and its permit expired in emgold says it will address all of those concerns in the environmental impact report it expects to publish next summer when the city council holds public hearings because the project would be the first underground mining project for emgold a smaller mining company it will probably have to form a partnership with a larger mining company though the company says it has the expertise to go it alone from until the mine produced about million ounces of gold second only to grass valleys empire mine now a state park which produced million ounces of gold emgold estimates it can extract at least million ounces of gold at a rate of ounces annually though company officials have said they believe the mine has between three million and seven million ounces of gold mr watkinson touts the proposed project as an example of "smart growth" because unlike other projects under consideration across the west it promises to clean up an existing mine even as it extracts new ore "youre taking a site that was a historic industrial site where people can potentially walk and ride bikes to work " he says emgold maintains that modern technology will render the site "low impact " even as it allows miners to remove to tons of ore a day far more than the tons that a miner removed when the site closed and emgold has developed a technology that would convert waste into ceramic tiles the project has the support of most local businesses including the chamber of commerce which is enthusiastic about the new jobs and &# million in new payroll that mining could deliver business leaders say concerns about undermining the local economy by returning to mining are overblown precisely because grass valley has successfully diversified "everything isnt as rosy here in grass valley as some people would portray " says emgolds mr watkinson he points to an influx of retiring baby boomers that has driven up housing prices and the mayor acknowledges the towns struggle to provide jobs for younger workers "if theyre looking for a meaningful job theyre moving out of the area " says mayor johnson howard levine who has run a bed and breakfast in grass valley for years rejects concerns that the project would scare away tourists and says he supports it because he believes its a good fit with the community "we dont fall over when somebody says theyre going to create jobs " says mr levine who also chairs the grass valley downtown association which supports the project during a year stint on the towns planning commission in the s he and mr johnson lost an effort to halt development of the pine creek center a strip mall that carved itself into a hillside along highway mayor johnson says he hasnt made up his mind about whether hell support the project but hes "cautiously optimistic" it will succeed "either way they deserve their day in court " he says
