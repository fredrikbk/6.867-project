weekend journal taste get me rewrite los angeles the day before the writers guild of america the hollywood scriptwriters union my union called a strike against the studios networks and media conglomerates that employ its members i had a pitch meeting at a big broadcast network it didnt go well of course it really couldnt have gone well the strike threat was hanging over everything and nobody in the room was really paying attention to the pitch we were all half listening half fingering our blackberrys waiting for them to buzz with the latest news about the negotiations when the pitch wrapped up i walked out to my car pulling into the space next to mine was an old friend a guy ive known for almost years when we were both starting our careers in hollywood i went on to become a writer and producer of television comedy he went on to become a producer and creator of reality television so i was walking out of the network a dejected scriptwriter about to go on strike and he was walking in a successful reality producer about to pitch a new cheap to produce reality show out with the pricey scripted in with the el cheapo reality which is all you really need to know about the current state of the entertainment business and the nasty strike now unfolding between the writers guild of america wga and the association of motion picture and television producers writers are like farmers theyre almost always complaining about something and a lot of the bitterness of the current trouble comes from the vague inchoate fury most writers harbor in hollywood about where they are on the status tree low and how skinny their slice of the profit pie is less than four cents of the &# purchase price of a dvd goes to the writer in dvd and videocassette residual payments to wga members totaled about &# million and in when ceo tom freston was fired from viacom he received a severance package of &# million so obviously that makes us mad not only that but tv shows are available on itunes clips are watched on youtube networks and studios are distributing advertiser supported content all over the web the ordered stately revenue paths of just five years ago are becoming a chaotic maze its impossible if youre a writer not to know deep in your bones that youre about to get screwed that the studios are going to lie about internet advertising dollars that your work is going to get run and re run without compensation that the value ultimately of your creative product is about to go zooming down at the same time the studios and networks are crowing to wall street about record profits still theres something off putting about the self dramatics from some of the striking writers its true that most of the guild is unemployed the median income of guild members is according to wga statistics somewhere slightly north of &# but its impossible not to roll your eyes when you hear certain highly paid well lets say it insanely highly paid striking writers marching around with picket signs chanting "hey hey ho ho corporate greed has got to go " and when the los angeles times quoted an extremely well compensated writer and producer of one of televisions monster hits describing his somber conversation with his kids telling them that christmas is going to be different this year because you know daddy is fighting the good fight it was hard not to throw up just a little bit what the writers and the studios dont realize is that their squabble over dvd revenues and especially the money streams from new media streaming video and web based downloads is a family fight those are the worst most bitter kind unfortunately and they keep the parties from realizing that the real enemies are guitar hero and facebook where a lot of people spend the time they used to spend watching "the king of queens " the disagreement between the writers and the producers centers entirely on the value of the reuse of creative material and the battlefield is not new the recording industry has already been here fighting with napster and itunes trying to preserve a once lucrative business model it by the way lost but like the recording industry before them the studios and the writers keep trying to tweak an old system when what they should be doing is tossing it out and creating a fresh one drive through the elegant plush neighborhoods of los angeles and there are a lot of them or gaze at the sleek office buildings of century city beverly hills and santa monica and youll wonder how all of it gets paid for most movies dont make their money back most tv shows fail most scripts dont get bought or if they do get bought dont get made or if they do get made bomb hollywood is a business of splendid inefficiency fortunes are made in failure actors and writers get paid agents and lawyers get their cut all based on the riskiest of business models that somehow some way at some point someones going to make a hit movie or tv show that will shower the studio with money pay for all of the failed projects and start the process over again until now its worked but no longer with the accelerating amount of web based distribution comes an alarming amount of web based efficiency more targeted advertising pay per use the ability to quickly send and easily store digital content distribution in the entertainment business used to mean exactly that sending out tin cans of film reels to each theater mailing master tapes to each tv station sending a salesman to each market with a glossy brochure of entertainment product to sell last month i had lunch with a french friend of mine a tv producer based in paris he had already seen most of the new american tv shows this season on itunes no distribution necessary foreign residual payments used to be pretty lucrative maybe at &# a show theyll still be its impossible to know one thing is certain though whats happening right now between hollywood and the guild isnt a negotiation its a murder suicide pact today there are an awful lot of millionaires marching around in circles outside the studio gates there are an awful lot of millionaires for that matter running around in circles inside the studio gates its easy to giggle at the bottled water and prius vibe of the strike but if this thing isnt settled soon if the old system isnt replaced the ruthless lean machine of the web is going to strip away the gooey inefficiencies of our sweet business and suddenly tragically were all going to get paid in the worst most crushing way were going to get paid what were worth and then only in success and no one wants that mr long is a writer and producer in hollywood and a wga member for the past years
