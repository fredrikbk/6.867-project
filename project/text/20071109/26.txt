credit crunch planners accelerate work on siv rescue new credit woes add to pressure to finalize details of super fund worsening credit markets are pushing bankers to accelerate the creation of a rescue plan for a group of struggling investment funds bankers from citigroup inc bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co have been working for weeks to put together a super fund backed by as much as &# billion to prevent a fire sale of assets by the funds known as structured investment vehicles the sivs designed to issue short term debt and buy assets that generate higher returns have been losing investors since turmoil in the credit markets began this summer increasingly managers of some siv funds have given up on raising money via the short term debt markets they once relied on for funding said paul kerlogue senior credit officer at moodys investors service during a teleconference yesterday that raises the threat that sivs could sell off the assets they own further destabilizing financial markets before the rescue fund is in place the deepening troubles have dialed up the pressure on bankers to get the fund running as soon as possible "all it does is turn up the temperature " said one person familiar with the process "there was an extreme sense of urgency when we started and theres still an extreme sense of urgency " people familiar with the rescue plan maintain that it remains on track and a new detailed financing plan could be in place within a week a person familiar with the situation said there have been major refinements to make the plan attractive to banks and to investors who would buy ious issued by the super sized fund in addition to figuring out the funds structure among themselves the banks have been hashing out details with the rating agencies their blessing is particularly important because the funds ious will need to be rated the banks were planning to meet with the rating agencies yesterday or today if rating agencies give a nod to the plan a term sheet can be distributed to potential members of a banking syndicate later next week this person said those banks havent been formally contacted officials at the treasury department which played host to early discussions on the plan remain optimistic that the fund will be completed and arent worried about the amount of time it is taking a person familiar with the matter said while troubles in the credit markets continue this person said the treasury department always expected there would be problems created in the late s by citigroup sivs today number and hold about &# billion in assets since june the funds have sold tens of billions of dollars in assets the sivs own bank debt residential mortgage securities and debt pools known as collateralized debt obligations the recent problems emerged when investors quit buying the ious because of concerns the funds had exposure to subprime loans the plan for the rescue fund emerged in october and has been supported by the treasury department it has involved teams of bankers and lawyers trying to come up with a structure in weeks that typically can take a year to build meantime the sivs predicament has worsened as ratings downgrades have affected some of the highly rated securities they hold the downgrades have forced citigroup and other banks to announce billions of dollars in write downs the losses among banks raise questions as to whether their backing will be enough to sell the rescue plan to investors the bailout fund intends to buy siv assets using money raised in the market for asset backed commercial paper where banks and companies borrow for periods from one day to a month or so that could be a problem because investors are shying away from the market in the euro commercial paper market investors have grown worried even about bank affiliated funds called conduits because of concerns about the health of the banks in the u s the asset backed commercial paper market shrank by &# billion for the week ending nov according to federal reserve data some debt investors say the super funds commercial paper would be less attractive today than it would have been just a month ago as a result they would want to be paid even more compared with corporate commercial paper "i think the premium has gone up " says tom atteberry a fund manager and partner at first pacific advisors a money management firm in los angeles with &# billion in assets and &# billion in fixed income he believes a premium of at least one percentage point over comparable corporate paper would be necessary for his firm to consider ious issued by the fund another challenge facing the fund is whether it would be paying artificial prices for assets such as mortgage securities in which trading has all but disappeared in an appearance before the joint economic committee of congress yesterday federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said the plan could work but he cited the question of how the assets would be priced under one plan the super fund would take bids for siv assets from three brokers including one bank providing a financial backstop to the fund one concern is that brokers who didnt intend to buy the assets could seek to manipulate the prices citigroup is a backer of the rescue fund but it also is juggling multiple fronts citigroup operates seven sivs which are facing funding problems this week the bank announced a workout plan to handle its own losses on securities tied to subprime loans by putting some &# billion of the securities into a special unit deborah solomon craig karmin and
