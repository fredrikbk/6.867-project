the supply side solution i recently spoke with mart laar the former prime minister of estonia and the godfather of that nations flat tax the major opposition to his tax reform he explained was not the citizenry rather it came from the economists and the other wise men of government "i was told we cannot do a flat tax it is untested it will not work it will cause budget deficits " mr laar recalls however he believed it would work because of what hed read about it in milton friedmans classic "free to choose " and so in mr laar ignored the economic pundits and snapped into place a flat tax estonia has since experienced one of the most rapid growth spurts of any nation in the world theres a lesson here for our country revolutionary ideas in economics especially if they dont leverage the power of the state are often resisted by the intellectual elite ronald reagan discovered this in when he was ridiculed by the establishment for proposing cuts in marginal tax rates as a cure for the high inflation and economic malaise of the s gardner ackley a former chairman of the council of economic advisers famously told congress that it would be "a miracle" if the tax cuts worked to reduce inflation and increased growth but reduced inflation with an assist from fed chairman paul volcker and increased growth is what happened in the s here we are years later with million more jobs and a nearly &# trillion higher net worth yet the left intelligentsia is still obsessed with discrediting supply side economics in recent weeks the new york times the new yorker the new republic and many other liberal publications have devoted great space and attention to attacking the entire theory that lower tax rates can increase incentives for investment saving and work the original champions of these ideas men such as arthur laffer and george gilder are not just misguided they are according to the new republic "deranged " "crackpots " and even "possibly insane " james surowiecki complains in the new yorker that supply side tax prescriptions for the economy are the equivalent of "saying that the best way to treat sick people is to bleed them to let out the evil spirits " the quality of this discourse rarely rises above the level of trash talk nevertheless some arguments are repeated with such regularity that they need to be addressed one is that supply siders dishonestly claim that tax rate cuts increase tax revenues now we can argue forever whether tax revenues would have been higher or lower without the bush tax cuts but one stubborn fact remains tax receipts are up not down by &# billion in four years since the tax cuts its one thing for the supply side critics to have predicted four years ago that the bush tax cuts would increase the budget deficit but mr surowiecki tells us today that "myriad studies" find that the bush tax cuts "led to bigger budget deficits " bigger deficits after the second bush tax cut of the budget deficit tumbled to &# billion in fy from &# billion in fy supply side economics is also denounced as a flim flam whose sole purpose is to give jumbo sized tax handouts to corporations and high income earners since so many upper income and wealthy americans are democrats however its not clear why republicans would be so preoccupied with helping them in any case the share of taxes paid by the top and income earners has consistently risen from through even as tax rates declined today the highest income tax rate is half what it was in the s yet the share of taxes paid by the top of income earners is twice today what it was then regardless of what one believes about the distributional effects of the reagan and bush tax cuts theres no expunging the reality that the economic growth rate surged after each of these changes just as they did in the s after president kennedys tax rate cuts robert rubin and others reply that the economy boomed in the s too after bill clinton raised taxes but supply siders never argued that only tax cuts matter trade matters sound money matters regulations matter in the s monetary trade and spending policies were all leaning in a pro growth direction possibly offsetting the negative impact of the clinton tax rate hikes what the critics have no plausible answer for is this if the supply side tax rate reduction model is truly so abhorrent why are so many nations around the world latching on to it what explains the irish miracle why are germany france and the u k slashing their corporate tax rates why are there countries with flat taxes are their leaders deranged or been bamboozled by crackpots perhaps a better explanation is that they know intuitively what a new national bureau of economic research study has found nations with low tax rates on business have statistically significant higher rates of new business formation investment and income history is clearly not on the side of the antisupply side attack dogs and theyre losing the policy debate every day in political capitals around the world poland just announced it wants to implement a flat tax by but the american lefts obsession with the notion that tax rates dont matter tells us something important about the future they are preparing the ground for massive tax increases if and when they capture control of the presidency i asked rep paul ryan of wisconsin a leading economic policy maker in the gop how many of the democrats he works with buy into these screeds against supply side economics "are you kidding " he replied "every one of the democrats who sits in the front row of the ways and means committee does theyve already got charlie rangels tax increase baked into the cake " estonia anyone mr moore is senior economics writer for the wall street journal editorial board see related
