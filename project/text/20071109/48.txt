how a good subprime call came to hurt morgan stanley sometimes even good bets can go bad before the market for subprime mortgages cracked in february some smart wall street players including securities firm morgan stanley were correctly betting it would go south morgan stanley executives had just gained a window into that market from the acquisition in december of a subprime mortgage company and a bearish bet helped morgan stanley report a jump in profit to a record &# billion in its first quarter ended in february fast forward eight months even though the market for subprime mortgages which are loans extended to the riskiest borrowers continues to deteriorate the same bearish bet has now cost the firm &# billion or &# billion after tax wiping out most of any profits morgan stanley might have made for the fourth quarter that ends later this month what went wrong it turns out morgan stanleys hit has a lot in common with a much larger write down of &# billion incurred by rival merrill lynch &amp co both firms wound up with huge positions of super senior segments of collateralized debt obligations or cdos which are securities backed by pools of mortgages and other assets the firms held the super senior cdos considered relatively safe investments for different reasons merrills total cdo inventory of &# billion june was a byproduct of its league leading franchise underwriting cdos morgan stanleys &# billion at the start of this year helped hedge and finance its bearish subprime bet company officials said but one common element wall street analysts and morgan stanley officials said was the cdos paid a higher interest rate than the firms cost of financing that generated seductive profits for both firms until the bottom fell out in october after more modest declines in august and september in some respects the way morgan stanleys subprime bet went awry is similar to how some quantitative hedge fund bets soured over the summer the hedge funds expected low quality stocks to perform worse than "value" stocks in a downturn but instead it was the higher quality shares that got hit on a conference call with analysts late wednesday afternoon morgan stanleys chief financial officer colm kelleher said the firms proprietary traders began making the bearish bet against the subprime market in december the very month that morgan stanley acquired subprime lender saxon capital inc for &# million both the acquisition and the trading strategy were in line with morgan stanley chief executive john macks stated determination in the fall of to take more risk with the firms capital a goal that echoed that of former merrill lynch ceo stan oneal who left his position last month following his firms losses armed with saxon morgan stanley quickly climbed to the no ranking in subprime mortgage securities underwriting this year according to inside mortgage finance a trade publication in bethesda md that is up from no in and no in merrill which also acquired a subprime mortgage company rose to no this year from no in and no in the subprime mortgage underwriting drive left morgan stanley with &# billion in subprime loans and &# billion in subprime mortgage securities on its books as of august but that position was hedged by an offsetting bearish subprime bet totaling &# billion a morgan stanley official said the bearish subprime wager wasnt begun in december to hedge the subprime underwriting of saxon but he said it might have been constructed partly from saxon generated assets and he said it might have been informed by market data that morgan stanley was getting from saxons activities the bearish subprime bet which took the form of derivatives called swaps required morgan stanley to pay interest on those contracts the same official said to offset the bearish subprime bet and help generate interest income to pay the cost of the swaps he said the firm amassed the cdo position that produced most of the losses announced tuesday the biggest piece of the &# billion in pretax paper losses the firms data indicated came from a write down of the cdo position from &# billion aug to &# billion oct a difference of &# billion such securities fell as much as in august and in september but tumbled as much as in october on the call with analysts mr kelleher said the mortgage related bets "did not come out of our client facing activities" such as underwriting instead he said "we began with a short position in the subprime asset class which went right through to the first quarter " but as the downturn spread to the senior cdo holdings that were meant to hedge the subprime bet the firms exposure changed "from short to flat to long " mr kelleher said "you go short expecting a certain predefined range of losses " mr kelleher said he added "that range of losses was burnt through by the excessive market action and then you ended up effectively going long " through the first nine months of the fiscal year through august goldman sachs group inc analyst william tanona noted that the bearish subprime bet actually earned morgan stanley a profit of &# billion but the firms disclosure of the paper losses and the position sizes prompted two ratings firms to issue negative outlooks for the companys credit moodys investors service said the news "raises questions regarding the effectiveness of morgan stanleys trading risk management " merrill analyst guy moszkowski said the trade was "too big " morgan stanley ousted a team of cdo traders a few weeks ago
