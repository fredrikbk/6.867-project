adam smith growls the u s dollar is the linchpin of not only the american economy but also the world monetary system " those words were the lead of an editorial in this newspaper on august amid the inflation of the s and the worlds last great dollar crisis are we watching another such period today its not inevitable but this week we all got a reminder of what such a thing looks like and it isnt pretty the dollar is "losing its status as the world currency " declared xu jian a middling official at chinas central bank on wednesday "we will favor stronger currencies over weaker ones and will readjust accordingly " that was perceived as a threat by chinas central bank to diversify its foreign exchange reserves out of dollars and into other currencies especially euros while china later qualified those remarks the dollar nonetheless fell again around the globe stocks plunged and gold and other traditional inflation hedges rose to fresh heights meanwhile french president nicolas sarkozy visited washington and brought a dollar warning of his own "the dollar cannot remain someone elses problem " he told congress "if we are not careful monetary disarray could morph into economic war we would all be its victims " the frenchman was referring to the damage that the dollars record lows against the euro are doing to europes exports and the potential for a return to so called "competitive devaluation " or what used to be called "beggar thy neighbor" currency policies coming from opposite sides of the world these are warnings worth heeding for as our editorial explained years ago the dollar is far more than a medium of american exchange it is a reserve currency held by central banks the world over and the core of the monetary system that underpins what has been a remarkable period of global economic growth by toying recklessly with dollar devaluation our policy makers are also toying with a far larger economic crisis than the current credit problems yet the striking and dangerous fact is that the conventional wisdom in u s financial circles has been that the dollars fall is in fact beneficial wall street wants easier money to rescue the banks caught in the subprime crisis never mind the risks of future inflation and how damaging that can be to stocks manufacturers favor a lower dollar to boost their own exports never mind how exchange rate volatility makes a hash of business planning worst of all are the economists who should know better but have convinced themselves that the dollar must fall so that the "trade deficit" can adjust some want to give a short term boost to exports which they hope will keep the economy out of recession while housing dips others have been preaching trade deficit doom for so long that they view a dollar rout as a kind of policy wish fulfillment what all of this ignores is why the dollar should fall so precipitously now the trade deficit is by accounting definition merely the reverse of a capital surplus to buy something abroad you must get foreign currency so the national accounts will show some offsetting transaction whether borrowing or the sale of assets or goods the trade balance isnt a moral verdict on the strength of an economy but is merely one snapshot in a constant series of global transactions the u s has run trade deficits for years and decades when the dollar was strong most recently in the late s a period of legendary prosperity as long as foreigners want to invest in the u s a strong economy and a trade deficit can co exist for long periods its preposterous to think that millions of foreigners awoke in the last week and suddenly discovered that the u s trade deficit theyd tolerated for years is a crisis to understand the dollars current woes you have to look elsewhere to monetary policy and economic management the supply of dollars in the world is ultimately controlled by a single source the federal reserve with its aggressive easing in september and again in late october the fed has signaled to the world that it cares more about creating dollars in the hope of limiting u s credit problems than it does about the dollars value investors can see this and so they are dumping dollars and looking for other assets to hold this includes commodities such as gold which is now at &# an ounce the nearby chart from economist michael darda gives a sense of how far the dollar has fallen this year the world can also hear the silence from u s economic officials whom they have come to believe are content with the dollars decline treasury secretary hank paulson mouths the ritual lines about a strong dollar even as he keeps pressuring china to revalue the yuan otherwise he is missing in action fed chairman ben bernanke yesterday told congress that inflation remains a risk which shows that he at least has noted this weeks dollar rout but his previous actions have left him and the fed with a growing credibility problem that is perilous for any central banker our current financial woes are in large part the result of previous monetary excess which fueled a debt and asset boom that has become a banking bust the way to emerge from the mess is to slowly but honestly work off the bad debt and write down the losses the one sure way to make things worse is with more monetary excess that could trigger a run on the dollar and the necessity for far higher interest rates to stem it but dont take our word for it listen to adam smith who this week has been growling in the distance ready to enforce his own very rough form of market discipline if the fed doesnt listen
