weekend journal review theater the re producers young frankenstein hilton theatre w nd st &# &# new york six years ago a superannuated director of sophomoric hollywood comedies took a not quite cult movie and spun it into a big budget broadway musical for which he also wrote the score the results were silly vulgar ran for performances won a record breaking tonys and helped to breathe new commercial life into an art form that had been looking as though it were on its last legs now hes trying to do it all over again "young frankenstein" is the purest kind of commodity musical a stage version of the best of the feature films that mel brooks made between and nathan lane and matthew broderick are nowhere to be seen at the hilton theatre but mr brooks has brought back roger bart and reassembled most of the same production team that helped to create "the producers " while the show itself is cut from the same dopey cloth as was its predecessor is it good in places but anyone who goes to "young frankenstein" expecting the musical of the year is in for an unpleasant surprise its one of those promising but uneven shows that had it been written in would have been heavily doctored out of town then brought to broadway for a solid run funny it is sometimes but bulletproof it aint mr brooks and thomas meehan with whom he co wrote the book stick very very close to the source so if you were young in the s you wont need to be told that "young frankenstein" is a sid caesar style variety show sketch blown up to cinematic length specifically its an affectionate horror flick spoof in which we meet dr frederick frankenstein mr bart the nephew of the mad scientist who once upon a time terrorized transylvania by manufacturing a monster dr frankenstein the elder expires and leaves his castle to young frederick complete with monster making manual secret laboratory ugly housekeeper andrea martin and hunchbacked helper christopher fitzgerald frederick thereupon makes a monster of his own shuler hensley not to mention a considerable amount of whoopee with his nubile nymphomaniacal assistant sutton foster before finally attracting the attention of the irate local villagers and his frigid fiancee megan mullally who shows up at an extremely inopportune moment all this took hectic minutes to work out on screen in on stage it takes a bit more than hours and thats the first thing wrong with "young frankenstein" it takes a half hour to get going and runs out of gas a like amount of time before the final curtain not only is the book sorely in need of deep cutting but the songs are neither lyrically nor melodically memorable though a couple of them "join the family business" in particular work well enough in the context of the show still mr brooks is a pasticheur not a true songwriter and it says everything about his strictly limited gifts that the most effective production number in the show "puttin on the ritz " was written by irving berlin problem no is that except for a few fresh well day old jokes the stage version of "young frankenstein" tracks the film version too closely for its own good indeed mr brooks has retained all of his old catch lines going so far as to blow up two of them into full length songs called predictably enough "roll in the hay" and "he vas my boyfriend " some folks go in for this kind of thing i sat next to a woman who barked whooped and or clapped every time she heard a line from the movie but it takes more than that to make me laugh at a musical especially when the score is so nondescript this brings us to the not so small matter of the cast "young frankenstein" was one of the most vividly and distinctively cast film comedies of the s because the musical is so similar to the movie its impossible not to compare the two sets of performers and the new ones mostly suffer by contrast except for ms martin who puts a wild woolly and wholly personal spin on the part of frau blucher mr bart on the other hand is more or less doing an imitation of gene wilder with a light coating of swish while even ms foster who was so show stoppingly good in "the drowsy chaperone " inexplicably lacks the demented sparkle that teri garr brought to the part of inga years ago and what if you are too young to have grown up watching mr brookss goofy movies then i fear youll find "young frankenstein" a bit on the quaint side here too it resembles "the producers " which was a last gasp homage to the anything for a laugh borscht belt schtickery on which the stand up comedy of my childhood was based with four letter words sprinkled on top to give it a factitiously up to date air but tastes in comedy had already changed greatly by and such later musicals as "urinetown" and "avenue q " written by and for a new generation have since redefined the term "shock value " theyre faster paced and vastly more contemporary in feel than mr brookss shows and to my mind much funnier as well im not saying that "young frankenstein" didnt make me laugh but it did so in a way reminiscent of a big stupid german shepherd who knocks you down and nuzzles your face until you finally give in and scratch its ears i prefer comedy that doesnt try so hard and doesnt have to the good stuff in a nutshell andrea martin robin wagners multigazillion dollar sets susan stromans let er rip staging of "puttin on the ritz " which is almost worth the price of the ticket depending on how much you paid for it the "regular" top ticket price for "young frankenstein" is &# but premium orchestra seats on friday and saturday nights will cost you a not so cool &# an all time broadway high i might have paid that much to see ethel merman in "gypsy" or bert lahr in "waiting for godot " but not to sit through a recycled movie with forgettable songs one last thing "young frankenstein" is ear threateningly loud if id known how noisy it was going to be i would have brought earplugs mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts
