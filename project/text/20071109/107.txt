weekend journal sports by the numbers garnetts potential gain it seems like a perfect match kevin garnett has long been one of the nbas best players but the one thing he needs to complete his resume is a championship his new team the boston celtics has the most illustrious past of any franchise in the league with championships but theyve fallen on hard times of late missing the playoffs the last two years and winning just games last season to see how the combination of mr garnett and the celtics is likely to play out we looked at the players of similar accomplishments who have moved to new teams between the season and now mr garnett has been named to the all nba team eight times in his career making the first team three times the players we compared him to had racked up at least four all nba nods the most recent of them coming no more than three seasons prior to departing for a new team either by trade or through free agency the sheer number of such players was the first surprise in addition to mr garnett eight other stars meet these requirements we didnt include grant hill in our stats because foot injuries severely limited his playing time for the orlando magic the good news for celtics fans its a virtual lock that the team will improve this season probably by a lot every one of the seven teams to add an all nba star improved the following season and this superstar differential was substantial from an average of wins in the year before the stars arrival to wins in his first season but regular season success is far from the whole story in the nba when it comes to the postseason the effect of the superstar differential was less dramatic only four of the seven teams fared better in the playoffs with their new star the most dramatic improvement came from the new jersey nets who went from a win season in to a win regular season and an appearance in the nba finals with the addition of jason kidd for the season the other great leap forward came from the miami heat which got to the conference finals in shaquille oneals first season and then won the championship the following season this would all seem to be good news for mr garnett but theres a significant proviso only one of the seven superstars mr kidd was able to get further in the playoffs with his new team than he did with his old team mr oneals title with the heat came after hed won three with the los angeles lakers tracy mcgrady was never able to win a playoff series for the orlando magic and so far hes failed to do it for the houston rockets note that while mr garnett took the minnesota timberwolves to the conference finals in the postseason his team lost in the first round of the playoffs every other time they got there on one level the celtics plan seems solid with the addition of ray allen this team is designed to take advantage of a narrow window of opportunity as stars like mr oneal and tim duncan decline and before such young stars as lebron james hit their peaks but while history has shown that one player can change the balance of power in a conference it also illustrates just how hard it is for even a great player to raise his game or take his team to the championship level
