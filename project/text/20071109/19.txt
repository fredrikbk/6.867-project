bhp billiton bid for rival driven by mining boom the worlds largest mining company made a bold &# billion bid for one of its biggest rivals in the latest sign of how historic global demand for commodities from iron to gold is consolidating control of the earths natural resources the move by bhp billiton was rebuffed by its target rio tinto but bhp signaled it will step up its pursuit and might sweeten its terms the proposed deal would be the second largest ever by value after vodafone plcs &# billion acquisition of mannesmann ag in the bid marks a showdown of two new aggressive chief executives bhps year old chief marius kloppers started in the top job just a month ago rio tinto chief executive tom albanese was in only his second month on the job when he made a strike in july for canadian aluminum giant alcan inc rio tinto completed the final phase of the alcan acquisition yesterday just as mr kloppers was making his announcement the mining industry has undergone a wave of mergers in recent years as commodity prices have risen and the cost of extracting and shipping metals has skyrocketed fast growth in china and elsewhere is stoking demand for copper iron ore and aluminum meanwhile bottlenecks at ports and railroads are constricting supply a merger could allow a combined bhp rio tinto to better manage logistics of getting products from mines to factories the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in the u s and europe the combined companys operations would span the globe from the outback of australia to madagascar to alaska it would become the worlds largest producer of copper and aluminum according to cru a united kingdom research firm it would also be the second largest provider of iron ore a key steel making ingredient behind brazils companhia vale do rio doce according to raw materials group a research firm in sweden it would also sell diamonds uranium and coal it would have more than &# billion in annual sales and about employees rumors of a bhp takeover of rio have been swirling since september after alcan shareholders approved its sale to rio and rio shares have climbed steadily ever since yesterday rio shares in london surged to &lt pound&gt &# about above bhps proposed bid price bhp sank in london trading to &lt pound&gt other miners also rose sharply on the news anglo american plc shares shot up in london "its going to be hard for rio tinto to remain independent you saw a huge reaction in the market today " said wayne atwell a former morgan stanley mining analyst who now heads a hedge fund focusing on natural resources "the pressures now on for rio tinto to either find a new partner or come to terms with bhp " before the recent commodity boom mining companies such as bhp based in melbourne australia and london based rio tinto were managed conservatively they had been burned by big downturns in commodity prices and the fading of heavy industry in europe and the u s people familiar with the matter say bhp executives explored a deal with rio four years ago but the idea fell through today the need to restrain costs makes a deal more attractive but it wont happen without a fight rio said its share price is low compared with rivals and the benefits from the alcan deal are yet to be realized making bhps offer unattractive a rio spokesman said the board reviewed bhps proposal and unanimously rejected it he said mr albanese declined to comment bhp sent rio a letter days ago proposing an acquisition people familiar with the matter said in its announcement bhp offered three of its shares for each of rios a spokesman said mr kloppers declined to comment when bhp reported results oct mr kloppers said publicly he didnt plan any changes in strategy yesterday a bhp spokesman said bhps strategy has been to be opportunistic with investments and acquisitions a combined bhp rio tinto wouldnt necessarily lead to new discoveries of minerals but it could help the companies cushion the rapidly rising costs of transporting metals and other raw materials these costs are at or near all time highs bulk ships are in short supply because of the surging volume of trade involving china india and other developing nations bhp spelled out the potential for transportation synergies in its letter to rio according to a person familiar with the unsolicited bid by combining the companies wouldnt have to compete for ships port time and rail shipments analysts say that recent mining deals have performed well as the high price of commodities has allowed buyers to pay down debt associated with their acquisitions quickly the deal boom includes bhps purchase of australias wmc resources in the losing bidder xstrata of switzerland turned around and bought falconbridge a canadian nickel mining company last year left out of the deal rush is alcoa inc once the undisputed heavyweight in the aluminum industry it was outbid for alcan by rio tinto a big factor behind the deals has been china as it has grown into the worlds leading manufacturing economy it has become the largest customer for bhp and rio tinto china is both the largest producer of steel and largest user of steel importing increasing amounts of iron ore the mineral used to make steel bhps sales to china of iron ore base metals aluminum and other raw materials grew by nearly to &# billion in the second half of compared with the same period a year earlier china now buys times as much from bhp as it did in the beginning of if bhp can acquire rio tinto "ongoing strong chinese demand will allow bhp to control supply and maintain higher prices for a longer time " said james moir head of asia at brokerage firm churchill capital a bhp rio tinto deal would likely get a close look from european antitrust regulators particularly given the overlap in the market for iron ore transported by ship the european union has stepped in during previous merger talks to ensure that no company controls too much of the market for particular commodities jonathan todd a spokesman for the eus competition commissioner declined to comment on the bhp bid for rio tinto u s antitrust officials in either the justice department or the federal trade commission would likely to review the proposed deal particularly if it increases limits choices for u s buyers of raw materials such as steelmakers last year justice officials challenged mittal steel co nvs proposed acquisition of arcelor sa requiring the sale of several tin mills in the u s "the important thing in a deal such as this might be to identify if there are u s customer groups that may be concerned by the impact of this going through " said lisl j dunlop antitrust lawyer at shearman &amp sterling llp bhp said it had "examined in detail the regulatory issues and other practicalities of a combination " rios rejection didnt mention any possible antitrust issue people familiar with the two companies said in the event of a merger competition authorities would likely force them to sell some iron mines to prevent overconcentration in the iron ore market an auction of iron ore mines would likely draw interest from other global mining companies as well as national steel companies in india china russia and elsewhere the proposed deal could be a defining moment for the two ceos both men have risen up through the industry with mr kloppers a former mckinsey &amp co consultant last running bhps nonferrous metals unit mr albanese has spent his career in mining after graduating from the university of alaska with a degree in mineral economics mr kloppers a south african is known for his intense personality he replaced chip goodyear an american who expanded bhp through a series of increasingly large mergers and acquisitions mr albanese who is from new jersey and has been called a bill clinton lookalike joined rio tinto after it acquired a smaller mineral company he ran nerco in since becoming rio tintos ceo in may the silver haired nattily dressed mr albanese has been traveling the world meeting officials in china russia and mongolia and trying to negotiate mining rights in countries that are fiercely protective of their resources ann davis
