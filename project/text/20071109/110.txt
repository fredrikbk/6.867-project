weekend journal taste de gustibus funeral rights at the tomb of the unknown soldier in arlington national cemetery an inscription is carved into the marble "here rests in honored glory an american soldier known but to god " twenty four hours a day days a year an honor guard keeps vigil there for those who fought for their country and died anonymously among the acres of individual headstones the tomb of the unknown draws visitors from across the country as it will this sunday veterans day without name rank or serial number the soldiers buried there stand for all soldiers the tomb came to mind last week on occasion of the death of retired gen paul tibbets the pilot who flew the enola gay over japan dropping the atomic bomb on hiroshima in his will gen tibbets specified that he wanted neither a funeral nor a headstone to mark his resting place to avoid providing a staging ground for protests his request wasnt without reason through the decades he has been a lightning rod for opposition to the bombing that took some japanese lives and hastened the end of world war ii on the th anniversary of the event in he joined veterans groups to criticize a smithsonian exhibit portraying the bombing as an act of blind violence it wasnt that he insisted in a book and in interviews throughout his life the bombing was a choice made by this country to guarantee its future and its freedoms one of those freedoms is now bumping up against the countrys desire to honor those who defend america today a jury ruled earlier this month that the westboro baptist church an eccentric kansas sect that disrupted the funeral of lance cpl matthew snyder a marine killed in iraq should pay more than &# million in damages for the trauma caused to his family the group travels the country to picket and yell at people mourning their loved ones killed in the iraq and afghanistan wars claiming those conflicts are part of a vengeance exacted by god on a country that tolerates homosexuality the protesters carry signs that say "thank god for dead soldiers " with westboro baptist churchs appearance on the scene some states have passed laws restricting or banning protesters within a certain distance of military funerals congress has passed a similar law at federal cemeteries but the bans are unlikely to hold up in court legal scholars say because to pass constitutional muster a speech restriction must be "value neutral " if protesters may not demonstrate neither may a friend hold a sign that says "god bless america " paul tibbetss last wishes may have denied protesters the satisfaction of a site but many of the obituary writers were undeterred "to millions of detractors the nuclear attack on hiroshima was a cosmic example of mans inhumanity to man " the los angeles times wrote while going on to note the irrelevant fact that albert einstein once expressed regret over the invention of the atomic bomb of the many press stories written about gen tibbets over the years nearly all cast a gimlet eye toward this one central fact he never expressed regret for his actions tibbets always told inquisitors that he slept fine "the objective was to stop the fighting thereby saving further loss of life those of us who gained that victory have nothing to be ashamed of neither do we offer any apology " thats a rare position these days when apologies are demanded and extracted within a news cycle much less a lifetime but such apologies are not so easy for mr tibbetss generation which would have been washing its hands of the consequences for hundreds of thousands of american soldiers and japanese of not using the bomb nor did mr tibbets ever avail himself of the modern out by claiming he was "misled " in the best tradition of american soldiers he took on his role in history with eyes open he was briefed on the manhattan project he worked and corresponded with robert oppenheimer and he knew the destructive force of the payload in his plane theres room for ambivalence about the act but not about the honor of the actor when the time came to choose a point man who could train and lead a team that might drop the bomb the general in charge said "paul tibbets is the man to do it " gen tibbetss response he told studs terkel in an interview was "well thank you sir " ms levy is a senior editorial page writer at the journal based in washington
