fda expands its warning for anemia drugs the food and drug administration toughened safety warnings on blockbuster anemia drugs in a move that looked unlikely to help drug makers in their quest to liberalize medicare payments for the medicines two amgen inc drugs aranesp and epogen along with johnson &amp johnsons procrit brought in &# billion of revenue last year but that was before safety concerns arose over their use by cancer and kidney patients to treat anemia a shortage of red blood cells that can cause fatigue and other symptoms in july the centers for medicare and medicaid services said it wouldnt pay for the drugs in cancer patients whose hemoglobin a measure of red blood cells was above grams per deciliter yesterday the fda warned that the medicines have been linked to tumor growth and shortened survival in cancer patients and increased rates of death and heart problems in kidney patients when used to boost hemoglobin above grams per deciliter recent research shows the risks of death and heart attacks rise considerably when an anemia drug gives too big a boost to hemoglobin which brings oxygen to the bodys tissues in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy the fda is now advising doctors not to use the drugs to boost hemoglobin above while in kidney patients it set a range of to amgen and j&amp j seized on the new product label in their quest to get medicare to reverse its restrictive reimbursement decision which has cut into sales of the drugs both companies said they were petitioning medicare to change its stance citing in part the new label as proof the fda finds more liberal use safe and gives doctors more discretion regarding the proper doses for individual patients but the fda defended its new boxed warning as consistent with medicares payment decision thats because the fda instructs doctors to use the lowest dose necessary to prevent the need for a blood transfusion which used to be the main treatment for anemia before the arrival of these drugs known as erythropoiesis stimulating agents jim reddoch an analyst with fbr capital markets said the new label supports medicares decision and the drug makers will be unlikely to persuade medicare to budge based on it "its very rare if not unheard of for people to get transfused if their hemoglobins are or higher " said john jenkins director of the fdas office of new drugs medicare "has tried to take our advice to use the lowest possible dose to avoid transfusion and put payment parameters around it " a spokeswoman for j&amp j unit ortho biotech points to data indicating some patients can require transfusions when hemoglobin levels are above jeff nelligan a medicare spokesman said "cms will carefully review the label changes and their relevance if any " to the centers payment policies the new label broadens previous warnings involving cancer patients and states that the drugs "shortened overall survival" in patients with advanced breast head and neck lymphoid and nonsmall cell lung cancers in clinical studies when used at generally higher than recommended doses however the warning states that the risks of "shortened survival and tumor progression" also cant be ruled out when the drugs are used to target a hemoglobin range that is less than the agencys latest moves reflect findings from two high profile advisory panels convened on the medicines earlier this year the stronger label is less restrictive than some feared still it will likely make it harder to stem the decline of these blockbuster drugs sales
