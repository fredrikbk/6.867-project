politics &amp economics utilities back california in auto emissions suit as california sued the bush administration yesterday in an effort to regulate automotive carbon emissions it had some powerful cheerleaders other industries including electric utilities that want to shift a coming climate change cleanup burden away from themselves californias decision to sue the environmental protection agency in both federal district court and a federal appeals court in washington is the latest twist in a long running attempt by state officials to force auto makers to produce cars that emit lower levels of emissions that contribute to global warming mainly carbon dioxide californias suit was endorsed by other states mainly in the northeast and pacific northwest the auto industry opposes californias effort saying it amounts to an illegal state effort to regulate automotive fuel economy a power reserved for washington under federal law the alliance of automobile manufacturers said in a statement that californias lawsuit against the epa "is not helpful" and that "a patchwork quilt of regulations at the state level is not the answer" to concerns about global warming but utilities are supporting californias effort and the oil industry is not opposing it the inter industry squabble that sets up with auto makers is a harbinger of the fight coming when congress debates whether to cap global warming emissions california has developed rules forcing a roughly cut in greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks sold in the state by but to implement the regulations it needs a waiver from federal law california applied two years ago for its waiver and says in its suit against the u s environmental protection agency the administration is taking too long to rule on the request the epa has been saying it plans to issue a decision on californias waiver request by the end of the year whats bringing the other industries into this fight is simple self interest californias plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks is part of a broader campaign by the state to cut those emissions across its economy by if the state fails to get a federal waiver to force emissions cuts from auto makers it would likely shift more of the burden to other industries thats why pacific gas &amp electric co a unit of san francisco based pg&amp e corp is supporting californias waiver request "pg&amp es customers have a vital interest in ensuring that all sectors of our economy including the transportation sector contribute their fair share toward achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions " the utility wrote to the epa in june the oil industry hasnt taken a formal position in californias fight against the epa but it also isnt opposing the states goals "we are concerned about ensuring that the responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is spread across all elements of the economy " says joe sparano president of the western states petroleum association an industry trade group he adds "we are not at all opposed to improved mileage efficiency for automobiles "
