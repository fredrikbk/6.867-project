mind the gaap discussions about accounting may seem a bit of a snooze but dont tune out just yet an accounting decision coming up soon will have major implications for the worlds capital markets the securities and exchange commission has already proposed allowing non u s companies to file u s financial reports using international financial reporting standards ifrs in lieu of u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap now the agency is seeking comment until nov on whether to allow u s companies to make the shift as well but there is an even larger question to answer should the sec shed its former allegiance to gaap and throw its weight behind the international reporting standards that would be a good idea much of the world is still speaking different languages when it comes to financial reporting its confusing inefficient and outmoded just think of the chaos that would ensue at next years olympics in beijing if teams from different countries played by different rules thats the situation much of the business and investment world is living with today disparities in financial reporting caused by differing accounting standards may have been tolerable when cross border investment was a fraction of what it is today in todays global market these disparities exact a high price by definitively lining up behind a single set of high quality global accounting standards that everyone can use the sec would bring greater efficiency to companies that currently must pay internal and external legal and accounting experts including firms like mine to help them sort through accounting differences across multiple jurisdictions the shift would be good for investors as well a single set of standards would bring a new level of comparability and reliability for investors who place more and more bets in far away places there would also be benefits for emerging markets and the poorest countries of the world a globally embraced set of standards can provide a readily available foundation for capital market activity this could promote investment strengthen the economy and improve peoples lives i manage a firm with a presence in over countries and from my perspective it is clear that the fluidity of the worlds capital markets is outstripping the reach and constraints of national regulatory approaches the pace of change in capital markets begs for bold action the willingness of the u s and other nations to embrace international financial reporting standards and give up gaap provides a glimpse of the prospect for more international collaboration rather than stand alone national approaches in other areas of capital market regulation true it can be difficult for national representatives to relinquish direct control and embrace international collaboration and the transition will have its share of hurdles many u s companies are not ready to make the change and they have legitimate concerns about the degree to which judgments about international standards will be respected by regulators and the courts in many countries the shift to international standards is already underway while english may be the dominant global language of business ifrs not u s gaap is becoming the dominant language for financial reporting today more than countries either require or permit ifrs as their accounting standard or base their own local standards on it canada shifts in while brazil chile india israel and korea are among the countries that have also set a date for a move to ifrs robert herz chairman of the financial accounting standards board recently suggested establishing a target date or dates for transitioning to ifrs following a series of ifrs improvements to take his suggestion a step further the u s should reject a wait and see approach go beyond the possibility of a switch and declare that it will adopt ifrs as of a date certain for all public companies filing in the u s such a move would enable u s companies to begin preparing now and would provide impetus to confront needed legal and regulatory changes that would accompany the shift it would motivate universities to train tomorrows accountants in ifrs and promote similar moves by other jurisdictions to embrace these international standards instead of modifying them for local use this would also help countries establish and work toward the improvement of a single standard rather than devoting their energy to tweaking national standards to make them look more like ifrs at ernst &amp young we will weigh in with strong support for the sec to set a certain date for a shift to ifrs as sec chairman christopher cox has said "having a set of globally accepted accounting standards is critical to the rapidly accelerating global integration of the worlds capital markets " mr turley is chairman and ceo of ernst &amp young see related letter "letters to the editor mind the gaap" wsj nov
