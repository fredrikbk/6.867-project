weekend journal review television crossover stars shine in tv land episodes in which characters cross over from other shows can signal ratings desperation in the case of the wildly popular cbs shows "csi las vegas" p m et thursdays and "without a trace " p m thursdays last nights experiment along these lines was not desperate it was inspired among other things it gave us a clue to the secret of both programs continuing success best of all was the match up between csis broody and enigmatic forensics whiz gil grissom william petersen and "traces" stoic but emotion driven f b i agent jack malone anthony lapaglia there they were two of the most compelling leading men on television side by side on a murder and kidnapping investigation head to head too "sometimes you can go faster by going slow " grissom said "i like to go faster by going fast " jack shot back in my view heart trumped intellect in the "whos cooler" stakes with the cerebral gil seeming to wilt in the heat of jacks macho passion but it doesnt matter although both shows have solid casts and almost uniformly satisfying plots these two men make everything go around female viewers are drawn to them grissom is the nut you want to crack and malone is the person you want to protect you what male viewers think who knows but they must have noticed that neither of these confident guys can be pushed around so it will be interesting to see what happens on csi after this week when grissom who emerged from his carapace earlier this season to propose to co worker sara sidle jorja fox learns that his fiancee is taking a powder even with the crime solving front and center wont it be odd without ms fox on "without a trace " it will be business as usual in new york again as jack malones team investigates the disappearance of a college student after an apparently racist incident darkon" was filmed in the forests and fields around baltimore where every other weekend costumed warriors act out an elaborate medieval fantasy p m monday on the independent film channel its laughable at first sight all the makeup and getups and pseudo archaic language yet soon we are drawn in spellbound by the discovery that darkon is a place of endless intrigue where heroics abound but the agony of defeat can be as real as the hurts many players came to escape since the realm was founded in many hundreds of men along with some women have gathered there to test their mettle and form alliances in the defense of ministates the technical term for what they do is a live action role playing game or larp each participant has created a character and in most cases a set of armor and foam padded weapons while there are joyful feasts and tournaments among the comrades of darkon some deep impulse ultimately drives the knights elves and other denizens into battle a press release for "darkon" says that people who join larp games often are viewed as geeks or are they merely more driven than the rest of us to break out of mediocrity shy and retiring many may be in their everyday lives interviewed in their homes and at their normal jobs behind the counter at a starbucks operating a xerox machine most explain that they have not found the real world an easy place to live in "i always felt like i was born out of time and whatever skills i have dont go well as far as being successful " one says "when youre a player character in any kind of game you control your fate " powerlessness and the urge to shed it is a common refrain when she isnt whirling around in the woods as the free spirited nemesis of caldonia single mother and one time stripper becky thurmond lives with her mother at home she says mom is in control "i go to work my boss is in control i go to darkon im in control " and then theres kenyon wells whose parents tell us that their son grew up a "loner" who was unable to form relationships in darkon however he is the mighty keldar of mordom with a girlfriend called silbury of mordom and commands legions of followers in "the great mordomian co prosperity zone " not everyone looks up to keldar however and by the time the film reaches its climax in a mighty battle we are almost as invested in the outcome as the players are when groups whose land has been conquered by mordom rebel banners flying and swords swinging the stakes are high the losers are stunned to realize that injustice and a sense of failure have now followed them into fantasyland most sorrowful of all seems to be skip lipman the stay at home dad who leads the rebels as bannor of laconia if only mr lipman
