fidelity succession plan weighs splitting chairman ceo posts abby johnson to lead board but maybe not the firm family to maintain a role succession planning at fidelity investments calls for the next chairman of the mutual fund giant to be abigail johnson the daughter of current chairman and chief executive edward c "ned" johnson iii say people familiar with the matter but she might not run the company as chief executive they say the plan would secure a prominent role at fidelity for the johnson family which founded the boston based company in and has made it the largest handler of mutual funds and k retirement accounts with &# trillion in assets under management and million investment customers two important questions remain unanswered when the year old mr johnson will depart from his posts and how much power his daughter will wield if she becomes chairman mr johnson has expressed doubts in recent months about his daughters readiness to run fidelity say some of his confidants under the plan he has shared with fidelitys board says a person familiar with the matter ms johnson wouldnt necessarily become ceo at the same time she assumed the chairmans post in one scenario that mr johnson has described fidelity would have no ceo and the heads of its operating units would report directly to the board which currently includes three johnsons and three nonfamily members who have held top executive posts at fidelity another scenario envisions someone who isnt a family member serving as ceo which if either of these scenarios will come to fruition is uncertain because mr johnson remains in control and hasnt announced any plans to leave fidelitys future after mr johnson who controls fidelity via the johnson familys shareholding has been the topic of intense speculation recently after several executives who were thought to be in the running for the chief executives job left the firm and ms johnsons career path took some up and down turns on tuesday moodys corp issued a report maintaining a high credit rating for fidelitys debt but saying that the lack of clarity about succession could harm fidelitys ability to recruit and retain top talent moodys said the uncertainty could hamper the firms ability "to defend its position in an increasingly dynamic and complex industry " fidelity spokeswoman anne crowley said "we have a succession plan that we reviewed with our board but like most major corporations were not going make public our succession plans " ms crowley said mr johnson remains "very energetic very involved and very much the leader " fidelity declined requests for interviews for mr johnson and ms johnson who is in a statement mr johnson didnt address specific plans but said "the company has grown significantly and we have worked to make certain that we have backup in place for all major operating and staff jobs including mine this is a continuing process we have many talented people and will be able to pass the corporation on in good operating order to the next generation of executives at the appropriate time " the succession plan that mr johnson has devised appears to strike a balance between his wishes to pass along a family legacy to his daughter and sentiment among some within fidelity that she isnt ready to take the reins a person familiar with the plan says "ned has said he wants the business to be family owned not family run " the plan calls on the three nonfamily board members to decide on a successor if mr johnson dies or becomes incapacitated according to people familiar with the plan the three nonfamily members are james curvey john remondi and william byrnes all are from mr johnsons generation and have served in top level jobs at fidelity considered intensely loyal to mr johnson they are expected to go along with his wish that ms johnson become chairman but they would have discretion regarding the ceo position people familiar with the plan say that in the event of mr johnsons death the trio would vote the johnson familys shares for three years this temporary transfer of voting power is apparently designed to ensure that the board triumvirate would be insulated from family influence it would also give ms johnson time to "grow into the job " said one person briefed on the plan mr remondi was named fidelitys acting chief administrative officer in april he was the firms chief financial officer from until and later headed its venture capital and private equity units earlier this year mr curvey who is became a member of the board of trustees for fidelitys family of mutual funds he retired as president and chief operating officer of fidelity in mr byrnes is a former chief executive of fidelitys international operation the fidelity board also includes mr johnson ms johnson and her younger brother edward johnson iv a senior vice president at pembroke real estate a fidelity business the elder mr johnson took over the company from his father years ago when fidelity managed about &# billion and he presided over years of explosive growth but fidelitys dominance is being challenged by rivals including the american funds unit of capital group cos and the vanguard group in august for the first time in years fidelity dropped off the list of the top mutual fund companies in net sales of stock and bond funds according to financial research corp in boston fidelity remains no in total mutual fund assets under management robert reynolds who was the companys chief operating officer and ellyn mccolgan its president of distribution and operations have both left since april both were once seen as potential successors to mr johnson rodger a lawson a marketing specialist who presided over fidelitys retail sales in the late s returned to the firm as president in august leaving his post as vice chairman of prudential financial inc mr lawson has been concentrating on how to boost fund sales and is expected to play a role in grooming ms johnson of mr johnsons three grown children abigail is by far the most prominent in fidelity she joined it years ago after graduating from harvard business school and has rotated through high level management jobs the johnsons shun the limelight and overt displays of wealth or power while the company is one of the biggest philanthropic donors in the region it is rare to see a johnson face in the society pages fidelity dominates the boston financial scene but the only sign at its headquarters is a small placard at the front door ms johnson drives herself to work in marlborough miles outside boston where she oversees thousands of employees in the personal and workplace investing division it sells mutual funds to individual investors and participants in workplace retirement plans mainly k plans "she was late one morning to a meeting and said she got a flat and changed her own tire " jack callahan who oversees fidelitys registered investment advisers said in an interview earlier this year ms johnson started off as a research analyst as her father did in and had solid results managing mutual funds in she became president of fidelitys high profile money management unit she made several shareholder friendly moves lowering fees on index funds and overseeing an effort to cut trading costs but in may ms johnson was transferred as the unit began suffering from weak sales and mediocre investment performance part of the problem was fidelitys emphasis on funds that invest in large companies as smaller company stocks were gaining more favor in the market former insiders say a factor in her departure was a scandal in which fidelity traders accepted gifts and junkets from wall street brokers the scandal eventually prompted fidelity to pay &# million to its mutual funds ms johnson wasnt implicated in any wrongdoing in may mr johnson became president of fidelity employer services co a unit that provides benefits administration to retirement plans under ms johnson assets under administration at the division rose to &# billion as of sept when she left to start her current job however at least three of her high level executives left for competitors this year including jeff carney president of retirement services who took a similar job at bank of america corp according to people familiar with the departures some executives complained that ms johnson wasnt communicative or decisive as fidelity faced tough competition these people say ms johnson has been working with executive coaches to improve her leadership skills ms crowley the fidelity spokeswoman said "i dont think abby gets fair credit for many substantial things shes done " she pointed to post turmoil when many fund companies halted redemptions ms crowley said ms johnson "immediately had the entire team working on how to open funds" and fidelity was among the first to do so
