weekend journal review film lions for lambs leaves audience counting sheep lacks coherent point no country is coen brothers at their best lions for lambs" isnt just wooden but woodish its as if the great issues of our time had been addressed by the hapless filmmaker ed wood in a production being marketed with the tag line "if you dont stand for something you might fall for anything " tom cruise and robert redford play stick figures one a republican senator the other an idealistic professor who speechify against apathy and rattle on about the need for action the journalist played by meryl streep is action averse shes a liberal yet action is in short supply and the film as a whole manages to stand for nothing at all thats no small achievement since so many of its issues domestic politics the middle east the clash of civilizations are debated with such steadfast self importance eventually though theyre all reduced to a snoozeful thrum by a process that works like noise canceling headphones every speech stance or position has its nullifying opposite you could make a case for this as a feature film version of the fccs fairness doctrine but it feels more like a blandness doctrine a pulling and hauling of the tone deaf script which is credited to matthew michael carnahan to the point of perfect vacuousness the films opening scene is a colloquy between jasper irving the united states senator that mr cruise plays with bizarre but entertaining elan and ms streeps janine roth a reporter he has summoned to his office in order to feed her a big story which proves to be small and murky about an imminent new direction in the war against terrorism its hard to know what kind of reporter janine is since she seems to be writing newspaper style think pieces for a tv network but theres no doubt about sen irvings role hes a strangelovian self parodying right winger who speaks with ominous intensity about "taking the high ground " fingers iran as the present enemy and dismisses janines dovishness with elaborate scorn "unfortunately civilizations do not sustain themselves through nonviolent responses " up to this point "lions for lambs" stands clearly enough as a left wing assault on military adventurism and the war in iraq that must have been its original intention but then the movie tries in its bobble headed talking headed way to be all things to all persuasions the reporter turns into a sappy parody of timorous liberalism stephen malley the professor played by mr redford who also directed with a leaden touch peddles only banalities in urging a bright disaffected student to step up to the task of changing the system then theres the ambiguous plight of two of malleys former students they stepped up by joining up now theyre soldiers facing death from enemy fire in the deep snow of afghanistan are they victims of sen irvings hawkishness or of liberal reluctance to prosecute an all out war no way to know "lions for lambs" is a shallow tar pit cluttered with skeletal ideas no country for old men the villain in "no country for old men " a psychopath named chigurh who is played to demonic perfection by javier bardem uses a coin toss to decide a potential victims fate im not advocating the same approach to seeing joel and ethan coens spectacular new thriller only noting both sides of its coin uncommon cinematic artistry along with some of the most horrifically violent moments ever put on screen if watching movie violence is cathartic then this film amounts to heavy therapy its much more than that however this is the best film the coen brothers have done since their glory days of "fargo" and "the big lebowski " maybe the best theyve done period my admiration is tempered only by my apparently incurable resistance to the very qualities that draw others to the coens work the stylization i find self preening the philosophizing that seems sententious yet the film was adapted from a highly stylized crime novel with philosophy at its core cormac mccarthys lean and cinematic disquisition on good and evil and on the question of whether the nature of evil has recently been changing the lethal nail gun wielded by chigurh the most terrifying screen monster since dennis hoppers frank booth in "blue velvet " suggests at the very least that evils arsenal has been upgraded the plot is set into motion into what quickly becomes the headlong motion of a fateful trackdown when llewelyn moss a scruffy texas hunter played by josh brolin stumbles on a small fortune not to mention a shipment of heroin that chigurh is determined to recover at all costs mr brolin gives a fine performance strong but self effacing while tommy lee jones plays the disillusioned and gallantly superannuated sheriff bell its tempting to wonder if cormac mccarthy wrote the book with the actor in mind because whats on screen is a fine but familiar tommy lee jones performance world weariness suffused by regret at human frailty plugged into the perfect receptacle the cinematographer was roger deakins his work is a marvel as it has been in so many coen brothers films including "fargo " "barton fink" and most recently "o brother where art thou " though sheriff bell is the storys soulful philosopher mr deakins captures the movies soul in stark sere landscapes and haunted faces and of course in the spectacle at once spectral and corporeal of javier bardems unspeakable reaper before the devil knows youre dead its tempting to say that sidney lumet at the age of has forgotten more than most young directors will ever know but its wrong "before the devil knows youre dead " which goes into national release today shows that mr lumet has forgotten nothing and still knows more than almost anyone about the elusive art of directing actors his new film stars philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke as andy and hank impecunious and singularly sleazy brothers who decide to rob their parents suburban jewelry story its a dopey scheme to which the two men bring complementary stupidities and the movie begins with the beguiling silliness of an italian farce of the late s when the heist goes wrong however the farce turns into a deadly serious study of cowardice and greed and then into a tale of biblical rage between albert finneys pitiless father and mr hoffmans monstrous son thats not to slight mr hawkes performance hank is simply less flamboyant than his older brother who from the outset is at the end of a very short frayed rope the original script by kelly masterson hops back and forth in time laying out the evolution and execution of the crime then re examining specific events from different points of view the structure is tricky but consistently interesting mainly because mr lumets actors are so effective marisa tomei is andys childlike wife rosemary harris is the brothers mother ron fortunato did the high contrast digital cinematography which is appropriate as well as dramatic this is not a drama of shadings but of ever increasing intensity dvd tip tom cruise was lest we forget charming and winning in his first starring role as joel goodsen the rich kid in the sex comedy "risky business " rebecca de mornay is lana the prostitute who helps turn joels home into a brothel while his parents are on vacation paul brickman directed from his original script
