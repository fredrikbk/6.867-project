a living constitution and original intent in "the founders wanted a living constitution " letters page nov don gooding and peter l wanger close their letters with these statements "we have a living constitution that needs to keep changing with the times " and "the world constantly changes the constitution of the united states must do the same " both writers mention changes that must be accommodated by the constitution but neither answers the following questions must we accommodate bad changes such as socialism what about good changes who decides which changes to accommodate i believe the founders with their extensive knowledge of history deliberately made constitutional changes difficult by requiring amendments to the constitution be ratified by three fourths of the states the difficulty of that process answers all arguments in favor of a flexible constitution robert morgan emerson anacortes wash don goodings conclusion that we need a living constitution while correct neglects to mention that the founders provided a means of change in the founding document he quotes thomas jefferson who said "laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times " from this he concludes that the founders would be content with judicial activists who alter the original intent of the founders i recall however that the founders provided a means of altering the law of the land in article v of the constitution jefferson and others didnt seek to bind subsequent generations to their laws and customs thats why article v is in the constitution the founders after vanquishing the british sought to establish a limited government based on a written constitution that needed substantial public support to alter a limited constitutional government will not remain limited for long if one person or a single court has the power to alter the meaning of its constitution and the founders recognized this thus we have the amendment process incidentally jefferson also said "the two enemies of the people are criminals and government so let us tie the second down with the chains of the constitution so the second will not become the legalized version of the first " tom armstrong maryville tenn both don gooding and peter l wanger imagine that the ninth amendment somehow supports the notion of a "living constitution" that gives judges willy nilly authority to invent new rights and to displace the operation of representative government they are mistaken beyond the rights listed in the constitution the ninth amendment does presuppose the existence of other rights that are retained by the people but these rights are of two sorts first they include the freedoms that are the correlative of the limited powers of the national government as james madison explained placing limits on a granted power operates to secure rights beyond the exercise of that power second they include the broad array of non constitutional rights that state law is free to protect including the basic right of the people to engage in self governance indeed those who seem to think that any right that is really important must be of constitutional stature engage in the very disparagement of non constitutional rights that the ninth amendment is designed to guard against m edward whelan iii president ethics and public policy center washington in his letter peter l wanger plumps for a "living" constitution to him i give an outstanding example of a "living" document the u s tax code makes the heart race doesnt it just think we could have a malleable constitution shaped by present day legislative politicians and our judiciary instead we have this dusty old thing worked out by naive folks makes one wish they had included an amending process oh they did charles moore shreveport la
