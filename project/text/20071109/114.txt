virtue is as a prop for all the beloved side dishes that accompany it unless that is you buy a smoked bird indeed smoked turkeys especially those that are cured brined or otherwise seasoned can have the same depth of taste as a great ham the salt spices and other flavorings plus a hint of smoldering wood all transform the meat into something truly feast worthy little wonder then that some purveyors have trouble keeping enough smoked birds on hand at this time of year greenberg smoked turkeys a gourmet favorite based in tyler texas that ships out birds annually has been to known to run out of its supply by christmastime it doesnt hurt that oprah winfrey once named it one of her food finds but just because a bird is smoked doesnt guarantee its going to be a gustatory success as we

neiman marcus an apple cinnamon glazed smoked turkey exclusive to the high end retailer didnt have that essential smokiness no info was provided on the wood used the flavor was mild at best one of our

nueskes in wittenberg wis and westerns smokehouse in greentop mo received mixed reviews nueskes turkey smoked with applewood had a nicely even brown coloring and a subtly sweet flavor but it was also salty in fact it tasted a lot like a commercial ham westerns yellow hued hickory smoked turkey was a very safe middle of the road choice not too sweet salty or smoked but as a result not too exciting
