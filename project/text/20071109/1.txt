a failure to lead this week is the one year anniversary of democrats winning congress but house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid probably arent in a celebrating mood the goodwill they enjoyed after their victory is gone their bright campaign promises are unfulfilled democratic leadership is in disarray and congresss approval rating has fallen to its lowest point in history the problems the democrats are now experiencing begin with the federal budget or rather the lack of one in democrats criticized congress for dragging its feet on the budget and pledged that they would do better instead they did worse the new fiscal year started oct five weeks ago but democrats have yet to send the president a single annual appropriations bill its been at least years since congress has gone this late in passing any appropriation bills an indication of the mess the pelosi reid congress is now in even worse the democrats have made clear all their talk about "fiscal discipline" is just that talk theyre proposing to spend &# billion more than the president has proposed over the next five years and the opening wedge of this binge is &# billion more in spending proposed for the coming year only in washington could someone in public life be so clueless to say as sen reid and rep pelosi have that &# billion is a "relatively small" difference lets also be clear about what it means to roll back the presidents and tax cuts as the democrats want to do every income tax payer will pay more as all tax rates rise families will pay &# more per child as they lose the child tax credit taxes on small businesses would go up by an average of about &# retirees will pay higher taxes on investment retirement income and now we have the &# trillion tax increase proposed as "tax reform" by the democrats chief tax writer last month failing to pass a budget proposing a huge spike in federal spending and offering the biggest tax increase in history are not the only hallmarks of this democratic congress beholden to moveon org and other left wing groups democratic leaders have ignored the progress made in iraq by the surge diminished the efforts of our military and wasted precious time with failed attempts to force an immediate withdrawal from iraq they continue to try to implement this course which would lead to chaos in the region the creation of a possible terror state with the third largest oil reserves in the world and a major propaganda victory for osama bin laden as well as for iran hamas and hezbollah after promising on the campaign trail to "support our troops " democrats tried to cut off funding for our military while our soldiers and marines are under fire from the enemy for senate democrats this was simply a bridge too far so they voted against their own leaderships proposal democrats also tried to stuff an emergency war spending bill with billions of dollars of pork for individual members now the partys leaders are stalling an emergency supplemental bill with funding for body armor bullets and mine resistant vehicles after pledging a "congress that strongly honors our responsibility to protect our people from terrorism " democrats have refused to make permanent reforms of the foreign intelligence surveillance act that the director of national intelligence said were needed to close "critical gaps in our intelligence capability " their presidential candidates fell all over each other in a recent debate to pledge an end to the terrorist surveillance program then senate democratic leaders thinking there was an opening for political advantage slow walked the confirmation of judge michael mukasey to be the next attorney general its obvious that this is a man who knows the important role the justice department plays in the war on terror delaying his confirmation is only making it harder to prosecute the war democrats promised "civility and bipartisanship " instead they stiff armed their republican colleagues refused to include them in budget negotiations between the two houses and have launched more than investigations and made more than requests for documents interviews or testimony they refused a bipartisan compromise on an expansion of the state childrens health insurance program instead wasting precious time sending the president a bill they knew he would veto and they did this knowing that they wouldnt be able to override that veto why because their pollsters told them putting the childrens health care program at risk would score political points instead it left them looking cynical the list of congresss failures grows each month no energy bill no action on health care no action on the mortgage crisis no immigration reform no progress on renewing no child left behind precious little action on judges and not enough on reducing trade barriers congress has not done its work and these failures will have consequences democrats had a moment after the election but now that moment has passed theyve squandered it they have demonstrated both the inability and unwillingness to govern instead after more than a decade in the congressional minority they reflexively look for short term partisan advantage and attempt to appease the partys most strident fringe now that democrats have the reins of congressional power their true colors are coming out and the public doesnt like what it sees the democratic victory in was narrow they won the house by votes out of over million cast and the senate by a mere out of over million cast a party that wins control by that narrow margin can quickly see its fortunes reversed when it fails to act responsibly fails to fulfill its promises and fails to lead mr rove is a former adviser to president george w bush
