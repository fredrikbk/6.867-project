the afternoon report next chapter for merck online edition merck &amp co seemed to abruptly shift course this morning announcing a plan for a &# billion vioxx program settlement that may put the bulk of its nasty litigation problems behind it after insisting for years it would fight thousands of cases rather than compromise the drug maker today said that it agreed to settle a significant chunk of the nearly claims over injuries allegedly linked to its vioxx painkiller "this is a good and responsible agreement that will allow the company to concentrate even more fully on its mission of discovering developing and delivering novel medicines and vaccines " said chief executive richard t clark under the deal merck will set up two funds a &# billion one for claims of myocardial infarction and another &# million fund for ischemic stroke claims the amount awarded to individual plaintiffs will vary and merck said this isnt a class action settlement claims will be evaluated on an individual basis as such the company said it doesnt know the number of plaintiffs covered by the agreement in a conference call earlier today ken frazier mercks president of global human health called the agreement "a pragmatic decision given the fact that we believe we could have defended these cases successfully for years but that that would have come at considerable cost and distraction to the company " there were several factors at work in the calculus that prompted lawyers plaintiffs and the whitehouse station n j drug giant to aim for an agreement for one thing an established trial track record emerged since vioxx was yanked off the market in september amid cardiovascular safety concerns merck won cases that went to trial and lost five outcomes of those cases helped both the plaintiffs and defendants assess what kinds of win loss ratio and payouts might be expected in subsequent trials but what about mercks long established vow to fight every case "they had to take the most aggressive posture to really force the plaintiffs into knowing that there wouldnt be an easy lowball settlement coming and that plaintiff would have to fight these cases one by one over the years " said david logan dean of roger williams university school of law who added that the random pattern of decisions in vioxx trials so far may have pushed both side toward talks from mercks perspective the deal looks pretty strong to be sure the &# billion price tag is hefty "but compared to estimates of potential liability" and compared to what merck is spending on its legal defense "its just not that bad " said benjamin zipursky a professor at fordham university school of law who has watched the merck cases closely also attractive to merck might be some of the tough stipulations of the agreement such as the fact that of the plaintiffs must agree to it and plaintiffs must pass three hurdles to qualify for the inclusion in the deal "its strong in giving closure " mr zipursky said "its also strong in who it lets in its a pretty tight agreement " investors seemed to like the prospect of a settlement as mercks stock jumped more than &# or about after midday friday shares
