weekend journal the home front charity begins at home sales builders tie projects to giving service civic minded themes partnering with boy scouts in the market for a retirement home last spring design engineer douglas knapman says he looked at communities before deciding on the settings at mackay point in yemassee s c what tipped the balance wasnt the golf course swimming pools or fitness center it was a presentation at an open house by developer richard mcwhorter who invited people to take part in a fishing tournament he was underwriting to benefit the cystic fibrosis foundation in addition to donating &# to the foundation an employee has two children with the disease mr mcwhorter offered to cover the &# entry fee for any resident or home buyer who would take part in the fund raising tournament several people in the audience that day took him up on his offer the presentation also convinced mr knapman that the settings was where he wanted to live "too often developers just take their profits and leave " he says the latest strategy for selling homes isnt to give something to potential buyers its to ask buyers to give something back in a shaky housing market that continues to be wracked by credit turmoil and rising foreclosures developers and builders have been piling on incentives like free basement upgrades and adding showy events like wine tastings now theyre hoping that home buyers jaded by self indulgent amenities will be impressed by activities that have more depth the annual rate of new home sales was down in september from a year earlier to according to the latest data from the commerce department in recent years developers have created communities for residents with a common interest such as flying boating or organic farming but these new developments pitch philanthropy as a lifestyle some focus on a particular theme such as local childrens charities protecting the environment or raising money for cancer research others promote a broader message of civic involvement in a few places donations are mandatory every homeowner is required to pay a fee which then goes into a nonprofit foundation run by the residents to fund local charitable works entries to the national association of home builders annual award for builder charity work have more than doubled to in from in though some developers sponsor one time events others are making charity a long term obligation or part of a marketing effort touting philanthropy as a way of life focus property group the developer of providence a acre unit development in las vegas is hosting fund raisers to combat illiteracy including storytelling festivals and cowboy poetry readings the georgia club a new acre golf course community in statham ga miles northeast of atlanta started a c nonprofit last december that has raised &# and expects to raise &# more this year from its christmas tour of homes daybreak in salt lake city has raised nearly &# for cancer research during a two year span and has sent pairs of shoes and a van of holiday gifts to the needy daybreaks civic commitment was an eye opener for kevin dudley a state tax investigator his wife and five children the family had never volunteered much before moving there two years ago but now they participate eagerly in charity races and other activities in fact mr dudley says his year old daughter jessica insisted on choosing a needy teenage boy to sponsor in a holiday gift giving event because she feared he was too old to attract another donor before they lived in daybreak he says "my children werent thinking that way " the timing is right for such programs in the housing industry says boca raton fla sales and marketing consultant bob schultz who has been advising developers and home builders for years in part thats because the population in general is aging and becoming less acquisitive mr schultz says civic involvement is also resonating because of highly publicized disasters of recent years such as hurricane katrina and the california wildfires "people want to do something more meaningful with their lives than bat a tennis ball around " he says some developers are promoting their own pet charities and their involvement in them john ritter chairman and chief executive officer of focus property group has given each of his three developments a charitable theme and identified a community partner at mountain edge a acre unit community in las vegas valley the theme is the outdoors and a healthy lifestyle and the partner is a local troop of boy scouts who win merit badges for building trails and parks in the development mr ritter spends between &# and &# per event for tents food and staff but since hed host promotional events anyway as part of his corporate marketing plan and since residents wind up supplying much of the manpower the fund raisers dont really increase his costs meanwhile the return has been substantial both in terms of neighborhood goodwill and exposure a recent walkathon for the american heart association drew participants and supporters to mountains edge and resulted in a sales spike that lasted for three weeks the development was the second fastest selling community in the country last year according to robert charles lesser &amp co a real estate advisory firm in bethesda md "philanthropy isnt entirely altruistic " mr ritter says that doesnt bother libby parker an education services manger who is impressed by the level of involvement of mountain edges residents in service oriented causes "theres not too much of that" in las vegas says ms parker who bought a &# home in the development two years ago in addition to the good works they engender charitable activities also foster a sense of community residents say important in places where everyone is a newcomer in august retired sales executive robert cullerton bought a &# home at the georgia club he made the decision to move there after reading about the communitys charitable foundation "i wanted to be part of the social fabric " says mr cullerton who recently drove the lead car in a k fund raising race for special needs children and plans to take part in caroling at nursing homes this holiday season participating in these developer sponsored events which take place two or three times a month has helped mr cullerton put down instant roots "ive made more friends in the past three months than i made in seven years at my old home in california " he says the georgia club foundation is underwritten by two nonprofit trusts one funded by homeowners when they sell their homes ths of one percent of the sale price of each home goes to the fund the other by a &# donation that developer jim vanden berg contributes from each new home sale the foundation is run by a volunteer board of five club residents mr vanden berg and a representative from statham and has distributed &# supporting special needs kids the boy scouts the library and a college scholarship since the three year old community started its program last year sales in the development have increased a noteworthy rise in a moribund market not all homeowners are happy with giving mandates in a program similar to the one run by georgia club residents of mediterra in naples fla are required to pay a transfer fee of one quarter of one percent of the sale price when they sell their home which goes into the developments nonprofit mediterra fund but since the transfer fee which is disclosed in settlement documents when buyers purchase their homes is a mandatory fee not a voluntary contribution its not tax deductible thats caused some of the homeowners there to grumble according to dottie vanderford who oversees the program for the developer the bonita bay group since homes cost between &# and &# million she says the outlay "can be sizable " marc owens a washington d c tax attorney and former director of the exempt organizations division of the internal revenue service says theres nothing wrong with developers setting up foundations to help charity as long as they dont use the money to benefit their businesses directly for instance by building swimming pools that can only be used by residents in their developments nor is it illegal to direct money to developers pet causes or to assess fees as part of a community covenant as long as the groups benefited dont have a racial or religious focus homeowners who feel uncomfortable with particular charitable activities can always buy somewhere else mr owens says in fact while the mediterra fund has acted on some of the developers charity suggestions that they award money to childrens charities education and environmental groups the board has also acted more broadly in its bequests since the fund began making disbursements last year more than &# has been awarded to local organizations including a homeless shelter a food bank and an adult day care center as board member paula powers a businesswoman who owns a square foot home in mediterra puts it the point of giving is to help where it is needed the most "we look at organizations that are really in need " she says
