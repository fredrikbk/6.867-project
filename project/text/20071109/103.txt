weekend journal hollywood report taking the back road to the oscars documentary race rule leads to remote shows an audience of nobody yellow springs ohio at the little art theatre a single screen shoebox in this village east of dayton the concession stand is too small for a fountain soda machine and the yellow "admit one" tickets cant be bought in advance but despite its humble spot in the movie industry food chain this and other small cinemas are playing a pivotal role in this years academy awards race the reason stricter requirements about how widely documentary films must be shown to qualify for an oscar nomination the controversial rule change is playing out this fall in remote unlikely venues throughout the country and while that has brought a short lived windfall to art house theaters it is putting a heavy financial burden on filmmakers in a notoriously cash strapped genre late last year the academy of motion picture arts and sciences announced that in addition to a seven day run in either los angeles or new york feature length documentaries also must be screened in theaters in at least states to be in the running the academy thought it needed to raise the bar for two reasons one is to cope with the growing number of documentaries spawned by cheaper digital cameras and editing tools the other is to make sure that all documentaries in contention have a substantial theatrical release that would discourage documentaries funded by tv networks such as discovery channel from entering the oscar race oscars are limited to theatrical releases while tv productions can win emmy awards this new "multistate theatrical rollout" raised the stakes significantly from last year when a short tour was required only for the handful of movies that landed on the short list of potential nominees this years short list will be announced next week the new rule was a major step in the academys efforts to fix a problematic category critics have complained that oscar voters too often honor obscure documentaries while ignoring those that win wide acclaim such as s basketball story "hoop dreams " in response the academy began requiring a limited theatrical release more recently the problem has been the deluge of submissions historically about feature documentaries vied for nominations each year but that figure rose to the s recently according to the academys executive director bruce davis this season he says submissions have come in "we wanted to make sure that the films we had to sort through have had some theatrical existence " mr davis says "weve been tinkering with this for a while " in fact the rule book is still getting edited last month the academy announced that it had "streamlined" the documentary requirements for next year by eliminating the key change of this year the requirement that contenders be shown in states this season that rule has forced filmmakers to confront a risky cost benefit question an oscar nod can translate into a boost in dvd sales and more lucrative offers from distributors and tv networks yet with only five nomination slots filmmakers had to gamble on whether their odds were good enough to initiate the costly multistate run since these films were untested products theater owners werent likely to agree to run them that resulted in the unusual practice of filmmakers paying a distributor to book a movie in theaters instead of the other way around a handful of distributors stepped in to handle the tangled logistics but instead of selecting films based on their quality or potential to fill seats the distributors mainly acted as contractors one was gregory gardner who charged filmmakers about &# each to fulfill the first stage of the qualifying process with a seven day run of screenings in los angeles for the next stage the multistate rollout he charged an additional &# for each film most of that money was used to rent screens in the far flung theaters the lure of an oscar compelled first time director logan smalley to email another funding plea to the several thousand backers of his movie "darius goes west " about a georgia teen with muscular dystrophy who journeys to california to persuade mtv to "pimp" his wheelchair last summer mr smalley raised the additional &# to pay mr gardner almost half what he spent to make the movie but that didnt leave any money to advertise "darius" during its multistate rollout a lack of publicity for the oscar contenders has resulted in films being shown to seas of empty seats or even totally empty theaters critics say thats an ironic side effect of the academys screening requirement which was aimed at drawing submissions that the public could see in movie houses at the little art theatre in ohio "billy the kid" opened on a recent thursday the film follows an eccentric high schooler with a passion for ac dc and karate as he struggles to find his place in a small town when the lights went down at p m this reporter made up the entire audience only eight tickets were sold during the required six showings over three consecutive days the moxie a single screen cinema in springfield mo sold just over tickets to "meeting resistance " made by two photojournalists who shadowed insurgents in iraq personal appearances by those directors bolstered turnout says moxie owner dan chilton but the other films didnt fare as well "darius goes west" attracted a single ticket buyer whom mr chilton addressed directly during his customary introduction before show time the most popular oscar hopeful so far at the flicks a theater in boise idaho was "the business of being born " a ricki lake produced look at the childbirth industry that caught the attention of the boise birthing community but only one person showed up for the opening of "meeting resistance " "they were probably pretty lonely in there " says owner carole skinner "billy the kid" director jennifer venditti a new york casting agent who discovered her subject while scouting for extras in maine says it cost about &# to qualify her film using two distributors she argues that the pay to play nature of this years documentary race is at odds with the awards image "its supposed to be based on the merits of the film but you cant even be considered if you dont have the money " she says recently as "billy" was completing its qualifying run the movie got picked by a small distributor an official release is set for december and an hbo airing is planned "war dance " about three children who leave their ugandan refugee camp to compete in a music and dance competition has its official premiere today when distributor thinkfilm releases it in new york and los angeles but out of the way markets including montpelier vt and three oaks mich already have had a crack at it for "war dance" and four other hopefuls thinkfilm didnt corral critics to screenings or announce the show venues on its web site because the company is saving up its marketing ammo for a late year oscar push "its better to have them perceived from the get go as awards caliber films " says thinkfilms head of theatrical mark urman in fact there are other sound reasons for signing up obscure theaters to meet the academys requirement for films that havent scored a distribution deal potential distributors could shy away from a movie that already had exposure in bigger cities "in that case the best theater for the qualifying run is the one in the smallest town with the least amount of media " says ken eisen co director of the nonprofit railroad square cinema in waterville maine he also runs shadow distribution which coordinated the rollout of six documentaries although shadow turned a small profit from the venture mr eisen says theres a "certain perversity" in scheduling screenings for which attendance is an afterthought because of mr eisens links to the art house circuit shadow distribution puts out about four of its own indie films a year he was able to line up theaters to participate using the fees he charged filmmakers mr eisen paid theaters &# for each film they locked into their schedule before the academys nov deadline he also allowed theaters to pocket any ticket sales it was an unexpected boon to theater owners accustomed to shouldering risk distributors typically take about half of box office revenue and rarely pay anything upfront "that was the kick in the rear for me " says jenny cowperthwaite owner of the little art theatre a native of yellow springs she started working in the cramped ticket booth when she was years old and now runs it herself with the help of part timers the s era theater survives today "by the skin of our teeth " ms cowperthwaite says with the &# she received to screen five documentaries she invested in a sorely needed dvd projector but ms cowperthwaite wont be able to count on a similar boost next oscar season with the academy scratching the multistate requirement after complaints about the expense and logistical hurdles instead documentaries will have to be screened for at least seven days in both los angeles and manhattan instead of in just one of those cities yet some critics say this change only substitutes one financial burden on documentary makers with another thats because the academy requires that the films be shown in new york and l a using a mm print or with a state of the art digital projector but film prints are costly and most theaters lack such projectors which could force filmmakers to cover the rental fee for the gear
