politics &amp economics fiscal responsibility proves costly pay as you go budget rule often hamstrings democrats agenda washington democrats took control of congress this year with a pledge to be more fiscally responsible than their republican counterparts trying to fulfill that promise however has caused strains among lawmakers forced cutbacks in big policy goals and snagged major legislation the root of the problem is what is known as pay as you go or paygo a budget rule revived by the new majority that says congress must offset new costs with tax increases or spending cuts the rules purpose is to prevent new entitlement spending and tax cuts from increasing the budget deficit thus far it has complicated efforts to pass tax breaks for renewable energy slowed progress on a farm bill and become a sticking point with the bush administration over an effort to expand childrens health insurance its a big reason congress has made slow progress on some of its top priorities the rule is going to cause even bigger fights as democrats scramble to finish important bills one bill would prevent millions of additional people from being required to pay the alternative minimum tax or amt this year and it would extend dozens of expiring tax provisions another would increase medicare payments to physicians under the pay as you go rule congress will have to find more than &# billion to pay for those items alone there are many reasons behind congresss troubles including vetoes from president bush a razor thin margin of majority in the senate and the bitter politics of the iraq war but paygo underpins many of the struggles it requires lawmakers to vote for tax increases or spending cuts that hit powerful industries and campaign contributors and it introduces a tangle of considerations to already complex bills "we are hemmed in by reality and that reality is paygo " said rep richard neal a massachusetts democrat whose attempt to engineer a permanent repeal of the amt was derailed in part by the rule now democrats are faced with an unpalatable choice either abandon paygo and undercut their message of fiscal responsibility or endeavor to push difficult legislation through both chambers when the risk of failure is high congresss approval ratings are already low and republicans who reject the current paygo concept are likely to argue to voters that the institution has lost its way republicans say the rule does nothing to tackle long term budget problems such as financing medicare and social security and that it encourages tax increases "its clear we have lost that mantle of fiscal responsibility " said rep john campbell a california republican "but i dont think the democrats have successfully picked it up " a version of the pay as you go rule was passed in in a bipartisan effort to shrink the budget deficit by the late s lawmakers began waiving it as the budget ran surpluses in congress allowed it to expire democrats revived it this year after what they describe as out of control spending by their republican predecessors to waive the rule in the senate requires votes in the house it requires a decision by the democratic leadership and a majority vote in the full chamber the rules loudest cheerleaders are in the house where many democrats particularly those from heavily republican districts have promised a new era of fiscal discipline they have passed dozens of bills this year that comply with the rule including a &# billion package of college student aid funded with cuts in subsidies to student lenders the bill ultimately became law "its not easy and you dont make friends doing it " said rep john tanner a tennessee member of the blue dog coalition conservative democrats who have long pressed for the rule but he said "the laws of arithmetic dont apply to everyone but the u s government " some of the biggest proponents in the house including rep tim mahoney d fla and rep allen boyd d fla are raising concerns about how the house plans to pay for the amt bill in the senate where democrats have a narrower margin of control the budget rule often is an impediment this summer montana sen max baucus brought a &# billion package to the senate floor providing tax breaks for renewable energy he planned to pay for the changes with reductions in tax breaks for big oil companies amid heavy industry lobbying the measure failed to get the votes necessary to move forward the future of the energy tax breaks is uncertain even though it was one of democrats main agenda items to comply with the rules while expanding the childrens health insurance program democrats pared the amount of new spending in order to get republican support the bill is about to draw its second veto from president bush while many of his objections center on ideological differences with democrats the president also opposes the way congress chose to fund the added spending an increase in the federal tobacco tax worth &# billion over five years the amt is likely to be the biggest test of democrats commitment to pay as you go this year mr neal the massachusetts democrat floated a plan with small groups of house democrats to increase taxes paid by upper income people in order to fund permanent relief for middle and upper middle income people mr neal held hearings on amt and pushed for house action however some democrats were nervous about the prospect of voting for a tax increase and thus providing fodder for negative campaign ads especially if the plan wasnt going to become law already the senate has signaled it wont take up the plan now rep charles rangel of new york chairman of the house tax committee is trying to advance a bill that would fix the amt for one year before it envelops million new taxpayers many republicans and some democrats object to how he plans to pay for this plan raising taxes on a portion of private equity managers compensation called "carried interest " a provision that faces almost no chance of senate passage the concept drew a veto threat from the white house yesterday the pay as you go rule frustrates mr rangel who often must find the necessary funding for legislation "i am at odds with paygo " he said the possibility of waiving the rule has sparked angry outbursts when republican and democratic senators met recently to discuss the amt sen baucus raised the possibility of lifting the rules for a short term fix sen john kerry d mass was leery of paying for something short of full repeal several republicans suggested repealing the amt permanently and extending the and tax cuts without finding offsetting revenue sen kent conrad d n d a staunch supporter of the rule stormed out of the meeting after hearing what the republicans said he told a reporter from capitol hill publication congressdaily that what was being discussed was "unbelievably irresponsible " "weve got to start paying our bills around here " mr conrad said in a later interview "we cant just keep borrowing money from china and japan " in an interview mr baucus suggested he still supports the idea "if we didnt have it wed certainly be criticized there they go again there those democrats go tax and spend tax and spend tax and spend " he said "were trying to be responsible "
