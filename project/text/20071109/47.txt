get set for wave of debt downgrades with investors frazzled real estate softening three rating firms have their markers out the credit rating downgrade deluge thats been rocking financial markets isnt over in the next few weeks debt rating services like moodys investors service standard &amp poors and fitch ratings look poised to downgrade hundreds of mortgage related investments worth tens of billions of dollars creating the potential for more market unrest the three major rating firms owned respectively by moodys corp mcgraw hill cos and fimalac sa of paris have been maligned by critics for originally underestimating the danger of bonds backed by subprime mortgages and other investments tied to mortgages now theyre moving in the other direction aggressively reassessing where they stand on a wide assortment of debt behind the about face a worsening real estate backdrop and frazzled investors credit rating firms have lowered their credit ratings on more than &# billion in mortgage related bonds in the past few months setting off waves of distress in the stock and bond markets theyve also expressed concerns about the outlook for a range of related industries from banking to bond insurance banks and wall street firms including citigroup inc and merrill lynch &amp co took large charges when they were forced to reassess the value of even their highest rated mortgage debt the latest turmoil to hit markets has been a reminder that the raters despite all of the criticism about their approach still have great sway many pensions and other institutional investors are bound to hold only investment grade debt a downgrade into junk territory can have an impact on demand for securities moreover because many mortgage instruments are so hard to value some banks and hedge funds rely on credit ratings even when they know the ratings could be flawed "we are going to be seeing ratings actions coming for awhile" on mortgage related debt says yuri yoshizawa a group managing director overseeing u s derivatives at moodys collateralized debt obligations or cdos look primed for more distress these are investments often backed by portfolios of mortgage backed securities theyre sold in pieces or tranches with varying levels of risk and return the cdo tranches widely held by banks and investors havent been downgraded as quickly as the underlying mortgage securities they hold as of nov s&amp p had lowered ratings on tranches of residential mortgage related cdos it still had a "credit watch negative" on cdo tranches meaning the bonds face a good chance of a downgrade fitch has cdo tranches on negative watch and plans to act on them by later this month through the end of october moodys said it had downgraded so far this year cdo tranches worth &# billion backed primarily by mortgage backed securities it was still reviewing for downgrade another tranches worth &# billion moodys says it hopes to finish its current crop of cdo downgrades in the next few months further downgrades could happen depending on the rating firms assumptions about the underlying economy where the outlook could be changing fast in october when moodys lowered ratings on thousands of subprime residential mortgage backed securities it said it didnt expect another big wave of downgrades on such bonds unless home prices declined by more than from their peak in late that forecast of a fall in home prices was in contrast to the moodys expectation last year of more resilient home prices home prices were recently down around from a year ago as measured by the s&amp p case schiller index last month moodys also changed its assessment of losses that would be suffered in pools of subprime loans from saying it could hit roughly on average compared with a projection of around early this year losses could hit in some of the shakiest loan pools moodys added last month adding to the confusion there is little uniformity in the way ratings firms are acting as they scramble to downgrade cdos and other bonds for example s&amp p has been giving investors comprehensive reviews lately whenever it takes big actions on cdos while moodys has been providing data monthly a moodys spokesman says the firm also provides data on individual cdo ratings changes to investors in september during hearings about ratings firms on capitol hill at least one questioner raised the issue about whether the securities and exchange commission could require more uniform updates from the rating firms which could also boost transparency about the state of the market while the rating downgrades of mortgage backed securities were expected by many analysts the speed and magnitude of the corresponding cdo downgrades caught many banks brokerage firms and investors off guard this past spring even as mortgage delinquencies kept rising some rating executives told investors that they didnt foresee cdo downgrades until thats all changed as the rating companies have slashed their assessments of thousands of subprime mortgage backed securities thats had an especially severe impact on a class of cdos backed by low investment grade securities according to j p morgan research several cdos had over of their underlying collateral affected by the downgrades or reviews the aaa tranches on some of these cdos were subsequently cut by multiple notches some to junk days after the mortgage backed securities downgrades "there will be a lot of chain reactions " says david yan director and head of cdo research at credit suisse group
