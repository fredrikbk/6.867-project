the pungent smell of success wafts over albas truffles others in italy try and fail to steal auction action gubbio digs for white gold alba italy for years this medieval town east of the italian alps has been the uncontested capital of the white truffle a pungent smelling tuber that is one of the worlds most expensive delicacies albas market set in a square at the center of town is the white truffle equivalent of the big board the best place for buyer and seller to connect and on fall weekends the markets center known as "the ring " is teeming with customers from as far away as tokyo who haggle over a few grams of the precious fungus a dry summer this year has increased its scarcity and pushed prices as high as &# for grams sometimes twice that for a prized specimen beluga caviar by comparison at around &# for grams seems cheap alba always gets the best prices last year the city sponsored a televised charity auction for a kilogram white truffle that was bought by a hong kong real estate tycoon for &# another auction is set for sunday "we have the best biggest and most professional truffle market in the world " boasts mauro carbone director of albas national center for truffle studies "no one else can come close " truffles have also become the economic juggernaut of this town of about &# million worth of truffles were sold in october the peak season all that truffle trading led to more than &# million in hotel and restaurant revenues but albas preeminence has planted spores of envy other parts of italy having gotten a whiff of albas success now want to win back some of the lucrative market for themselves "we have always been the serfs of alba " says maurizio bazano head of the truffle hunters association in italys northwestern liguria region he complains that top notch white truffles from liguria are shipped up to alba where they are sold as "tartufi bianchi dalba " robbing his region of fame and a small fortune "thats simply the nature of the market " replies albas mr carbone halfway down the italian peninsula in the remote medieval town of gubbio local officials have been struggling in vain for years to grow their own brand of truffle tourism its not for lack of supply the pristine woods around gubbio are fertile ground for white truffles and of the areas inhabitants are licensed truffle hunters the problem "we have more truffles but alba has the better market " says ermanno rosi an agronomist who runs the local governments truffle department gubbio worked with italys national research institute to try to map the dna of its local truffle to prove that it was genetically unique that might have qualified it for a prestigious european union label conferring on gubbio a special label for its truffles but after six years of research scientists never reached conclusive evidence so gubbio launched another plan to create a detailed map of its best truffle producing woods by crossing forestry records private property deeds and plant life studies truffles grow near the roots of certain trees often just below the surface and truffle hunters need trained dogs to sniff them out the map was aimed at helping tourists nose around the best trees but that also hit a snag local truffle hunters wouldnt let slip where they dig up their bounty for fear of tipping off rivals "there is intense jealousy " says mr rosi the agronomist "they wont tell us a thing " also struggling is a plan to get everyone in gubbio involved in the local truffle business from hunters to wholesalers and restaurants by introducing a special "gubbio white truffle" label it turns out there is a vibrant black market in white truffles so few buyers and sellers want to come forward for fear of attracting the tax man gubbios truffle merchants have enjoyed some moments in the spotlight last year when a hunter came across a prime half kilo white truffle in central italy word quickly spread emanuele musini who runs a company that exports white truffles got tipped off by a phone call and told one of his drivers to race to the site of the find and offer a premium price euros or about &# before the truffle reached his office he had already sold it for euros to a wealthy german who was planning a banquet from gubbio the truffle then traveled to rome where it made a brief appearance on italys national morning news show before boarding a plane for germany "you have to move fast truffles lose of their weight a day " says mr musini "and at these prices thats a disaster " but most often prize truffles wind up in alba where there is a cadre of ready buyers over the years alba has labored to professionalize the truffle trade to keep demand and prices high the city has a top flight truffle research center it publishes weekly average prices on its web site www tuber it and offers comparisons with historical prices a panel of experts inspects each white truffle before it goes on sale at the market to certify authenticity and quality alba even has a customer complaint window which can issue refunds to truffle buyers who claim theyve been wronged in the "ring" at the alba market tohomisa kida a tokyo native who works for an ad agency in london was poking his nose into rows of small white truffles nearby turin retiree vito ruisi sniffed a dozen tubers before haggling down the price of one gram piece enough to season a dinner for one to euros and sealing the deal the tuber magnatum pico is found only in italy and in a sliver of neighboring slovenia and croatia and it grows for just a few months of the year it is much rarer more aromatic and many times the price of its more common cousin the black truffle despite soaring prices top chefs around the world covet the white truffle and the worlds fanciest restaurants use the white truffle in the simplest fashion shaved over risotto or pasta "its like eating an extinct animal " says fernando stovell chef at the cuckoo club a private eating club in london alba didnt win its truffle title overnight in the s and s a local hotel owner began sending the largest truffle he could find each year to celebrities among the recipients marilyn monroe alfred hitchcock and president truman who got the largest white truffle in memory kilos the publicity stunts helped put alba on the map but locals have also devoted time and resources to discovering the secrets of the white truffle the citys national center for truffle studies recently cordoned off stretches of woods to conduct experiments on how temperature rainfall and other factors affect truffle growth alba also has a "dog university" where people can get their puppies trained in the art of truffle hunting isabella gianicolo one of the centers researchers who wrote her university thesis on truffles was in her office recently studying a web site with recent prices paid for truffles at the alba market prices have exceeded euros for grams approaching the euros record set in but speculation among buyers is currently so high she says that even if white truffle supplies were suddenly to increase prices would hold "its a free market " she shrugs
