two weeks that shook the titans of wall street as oneal tottered sandy weill turned on protege prince on the last saturday in october citigroup inc s chairman and ceo charles prince was driving home from a visit with his mother in new jersey en route he checked his email "i need to talk to you " wrote gary crittenden citigroups chief financial officer "can i reach you somewhere " a few minutes later by cellphone mr prince got the news citigroup was facing billions of dollars in new losses from deteriorating credit markets on top of huge write downs it had announced two weeks earlier no one had to tell mr prince what that might mean investors and analysts were blaming him for disappointing financial results a lackluster share price and a string of high profile executive departures they already wanted his head just days earlier another wall street fixture merrill lynch &amp co had taken an unexpected &# billion hit to its third quarter earnings much of it attributed to credit market turmoil the losses at merrill and citigroup would usher in two of the most tumultuous weeks in the history of wall streets executive suites the upheaval played out publicly at merrill that saturday as its board weighed the fate of its ceo stan oneal but an equally tense drama was unfolding privately in the corporate suites and boardroom at citigroup that same saturday oct top executives convened for an emergency session at citigroups corporate retreat and learned that they were facing fresh losses of some &# billion mr crittenden delivered the news to the ceo that afternoon in a matter of days mr princes year career at citigroup and its predecessor companies was over though he had backing from citigroups boardroom his support dissipated quickly from his erstwhile champions including the companys former ceo sanford weill and one of the banks biggest shareholders saudi prince alwaleed bin talal accounts of the days leading to mr princes departure were provided by several people who were closely involved in events as they unfolded at citigroup mr prince through a spokesman declined to comment the dual dramas at citigroup and merrill underscore how unprepared much of wall street has been for the management shake ups that have accompanied the credit market turmoil the boards at both companies were left scrambling to name even interim leaders to replace them companies have been weakened by departures of those below the top tiers too wall street chiefs have shoved out a number of veteran traders and bankers who were caught flat footed when defaults in subprime loans made to high risk homeowners triggered huge losses beginning this summer the chain reaction that clobbered citigroups mr prince had claimed its first victims months before early this summer bear stearns cos announced big losses in two hedge funds that invested heavily in securities tied to the u s subprime market the source of the funds problems were instruments called collateralized debt obligations cdos are pools of securities that are often backed by mortgages these cdos are sliced into pieces and sold on to investors those who take the pieces with the highest amount of risk get the highest returns citigroup considered its cdo investments to be safe because they represented the "super senior " or less risky part of the pie that position was supposed to insulate it from losses except in the unlikely event that practically all of the underlying securities got wiped out by defaults but amid this summers fears in the subprime market investors backed away from all cdos even those deemed the safest with trading thin the instruments became difficult to price the best investors and banks could do was turn to a set of indexes called the abx which measures investor expectations about the performance of subprime mortgages troubles for citigroup began on oct that day moodys investors service slashed the rating on thousands of bonds backed by subprime mortgages that raised investors concerns over the value of cdos containing those bonds the abx fell sharply as a result four days after the moodys downgrade citigroup reported that its third quarter earnings had fallen from year earlier levels it said it would take a write off of &# billion in the fallout from the credit turmoil including a &# billion write down tied to cdo losses through sept on oct standard &amp poors cut ratings on mortgage backed bonds and warned that ratings on cdos that contained those bonds could also be at risk this was particularly bad news for citigroup which is among the largest arrangers of cdos that is it creates the instruments and holds them until it can sell them the key abx index continued to fall further eroding the value of &# billion worth of cdo investments on citigroups books the abx decline was particularly troubling to vikram pandit a former morgan stanley executive who had joined citigroup earlier in the year mr pandit had just taken over responsibility for citigroups capital markets business after a wide ranging shake up ordered by mr prince one of his first tasks was to get a handle on the banks cdo exposure on oct a week after the s&amp p downgrade citigroups cfo was also put on alert cliff verron a finance executive in citigroups investment bank told mr crittenden that the banks capital markets staff was concerned about the potential impact of the abx decline the next day mr crittenden met with mr pandit mr verron and a half dozen other top bankers in a three hour meeting at the investment banks lower manhattan offices mr pandit and the bankers walked mr crittenden though the state of the market and its implications for the firm mr crittenden ordered the group to gather two days later saturday at the banks sprawling corporate complex in armonk n y at merrill that thursday independent directors were also getting anxious the day before the firm had announced it would take an &# billion hit in the third quarter from revaluing bonds and other write downs more than &# billion above the estimated loss merrill had given just weeks before making matters worse mr oneal disclosed at a board meeting that he had approached wachovia corp chief executive g kennedy thompson a longtime merrill client about a potential merger without alerting his directors by saturday mr oneal started calling top executives informing them that he was stepping down said a person familiar with the situation "im out " he told one also on saturday at a m mr crittenden and the other citigroup executives sat down in armonk they started by poring over merrills disastrous third quarter earnings report trying to figure out how the rival firm had valued its deteriorating securities citigroup however had additional damage to survey merrills figures included write downs through sept while citigroup had to tally the effects of the october index decline tension in the room grew as the magnitude of additional potential losses became clear roughly &# billion at then market prices in the few weeks since the quarter ended that could wipe out citigroups fourth quarter profits which were &# billion last year mr crittenden was stunned speaking with analysts about third quarter earnings less than two weeks earlier he hadnt mentioned the &# billion cdo portfolio the securities were considered so low risk that they didnt even merit disclosure he had decided "how in the world could we have been so exposed and how could we not have been properly hedged " he asked incredulous according to people who attended the meeting the response by the time the firms capital markets group had sought to hedge these investments the terms were uneconomical citigroups chief accountant john c gerspach told mr crittenden that the company must disclose the problems in its quarterly report with the securities and exchange commission that filing was due within days thats when mr crittenden called his boss mr prince to deliver the news behind the scenes support for mr princes leadership had already been waning for months he had weathered calls for his departure with three bases of support mr weill the former citigroup ceo shareholder prince alwaleed and a board of directors who supported mr prince in recent months as investors and analysts called for his ouster now those pillars were eroding for years mr weill had refrained from speaking ill of his hand picked successor yet the former wall street titan obsessed with holding down costs when he was in charge steamed as citigroups expenses and employee counts surged known for his loyal lieutenants he was dismayed as his top executives including his president robert willumstad fled the financial giant known for a healthy ego mr weill even bit his tongue as mr prince repeatedly blamed his slow start on dealing with overhanging regulatory issues and investigations "sandy was uncharacteristically quiet through all the turmoil " says one former citigroup executive "he wanted to stay loyal to chuck of course bad mouthing chuck would amount to admitting sandy had made a mistake by anointing him " mr weill also was distressed about citigroups stock price which was now in the dumps during mr weills tenure the return on citigroup stock was he had been hurt that for the last couple years since he retired mr prince hadnt called on him for help on oct when citigroup warned it expected to take a hit of nearly &# billion amid the credit market turmoil mr weill lost what little confidence in mr prince he had left "it wasnt a precipitous or emotional decision" to withdraw support from mr prince says a person familiar with the situation "but a very reluctant one " on oct when citigroup officially announced larger than expected third quarter losses mr weill was beside himself he complained about the growth of the balance sheet and expense structure two of his hallmarks of financial discipline as for the low stock prices he said people were "voting with their pocketbook " although he hadnt listened in on mr princes call with analysts that day mr weill heard that mr prince had said the results were "frankly surprising " mr weill griped that mr prince should have already been abreast as the turmoil continued mr prince effectively forced out thomas maheras one of mr weills favorite wall street executives now nearly all of mr weills favorite deputies were gone mr willumstad mike carpenter marge magner deryck maughan tom jones and todd thomson "a lot of the people i liked and respected are gone " mr weill told a friend finally mr weill decided he needed to meet with prince alwaleed although mr weill and mr prince didnt talk much anymore mr weill called to tell him that he would be flying to riyadh on a citigroup corporate jet which he continued to have access to in retirement the visit didnt seem unusual because mr weill had met with the saudi shareholder a couple months earlier on a trip to check on the weill cornell medical college in qatar prince alwaleed who had previously supported mr prince in the press didnt come to his defense following mr weills visit mr prince and his team didnt appreciate what one called mr weills "meddling " some complained that mr weill was criticizing high expenses while ensconced in a fifth avenue office suite paid for by citigroup nevertheless mr weill offered his help to a couple of directors he told them that he believed the model he created of a financial behemoth is still "valuable " noting that citigroups competitor j p morgan chase &amp co led by his one time protege james dimon continued to perform after merrills board ousted mr oneal citigroups directors still unwilling to force out mr prince feared they may have to take drastic action too returning home that saturday afternoon mr prince immediately sought out his wife peggy wolff a veteran mergers and acquisitions lawyer at law firm skadden arps slate meagher &amp flom llp he told her that his tenure as citigroups ceo couldnt withstand another blow according to someone familiar with the family he would resign he told her mr prince called lewis kaden and told him he was planning to step down a lawyer who joined citigroup as chief administrative officer in mr kaden was a close associate of mr prince and himself had been criticized by investors and analysts for a lack of banking and risk management experience "think about it " said mr kaden urging him to reconsider mr prince also reached out to robert rubin the former treasury secretary who chaired the boards executive committee mr rubin also urged him to reconsider "on the merits of what you have accomplished here i think you should stay " advised mr rubin messrs prince kaden and rubin spoke again on sunday discussing the magnitude of the new losses messrs kaden and rubin also spoke to each other alone hashing over whether mr princes resignation was the best course on monday oct mr prince met with citigroups lead independent director alcoa inc ceo alain belda and handed him a resignation letter "the magnitude of the losses incurred in our fixed income business makes this the only honorable course for me to take as the chief executive officer of the company " the letter said at merrill the next day the company announced mr oneals departure the search for a successor officially began on halloween mr prince addressed citigroups directors in a hastily arranged meeting time warner inc ceo richard parsons traveling in india listened in by phone mr crittenden walked them through the latest financial mess independent board members then gathered and most were sympathetic "its too bad " said one "its not really chucks fault " their conversation turned to replacements almost immediately mr rubins name came up he had previously expressed reluctance to take on additional responsibility at the bank preferring to keep his largely undefined executive role he continued to resist they were in a pickle any internal candidate who was named as a temporary ceo would upset others who considered themselves contenders for a permanent position mr kaden floated the name of sir win bischoff the head of citigroups european operations sir win the ceo of schroders plc when it was acquired by citigroup in had experience running a public company at years old he wouldnt be viewed as a threat to the younger bankers ambitions "we should have thought about this at the beginning " mr kaden said soon after mr kaden placed the call to sir win "i hope you are sitting down " he said "give me two hours " sir win responded he needed to get the sign off from his wife a short while later mr kaden received the call he had been waiting for "rosemary says i can do it " sir win told mr kaden with the operating chief post filled mr rubin decided to take on the chairmans role on sunday citigroups board of directors met at the banks park avenue headquarters and officially accepted mr princes resignation installing sir win and mr rubin the company issued a press release announcing the developments and the new losses shortly after p m later that evening mr kaden called prince alwaleed to tell him the news other investors expressed dismay over the big new losses on monday sending citigroups stock price to its lowest level since april mr prince arrived at work on monday as usual asked how he was doing as he exited an elevator on the executive floor he responded "couldnt be better " shortly after p m on tuesday a group of moving men wearing burgundy t shirts arrived at mr princes office pushing an empty cart and carrying rolls of bubble wrap
