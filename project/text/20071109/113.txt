weekend journal tastings for thanksgiving drink american california cabernet celebrates history and good taste thanksgiving is all about the classics turkey is a classic main course cornbread is a classic stuffing jell o mold is a classic odd side dish in the same way thanksgiving is all about history we talk about pilgrims and native americans and the dishes were using that were handed down from great grandma and somehow this all becomes part of a seamless living narrative in the midst of all of this shouldnt the wine be a classic too a wine with true american history behind it we think it should and we have some suggestions around this time of year a big question on everyones mind is what wine should i serve with thanksgiving dinner truth is whatever wine you choose theres an expert somewhere who says its perfect and theres a good reason for that thanksgiving dinners are so varied that its impossible to suggest a one size fits all wine our advice has always been pretty simple first because this is an american holiday stick with american wine second start with a bubbly this is not only a great way to begin a celebration but the sparkler will also be great with the food if anyone would like to keep drinking it with dinner if you want to serve a white with dinner we conducted a tasting in in which we cooked a thanksgiving feast weeks before the celebration and tried a wide variety of whites we recommended then that you look for a white that is quite dry is bursting with fruit and has abundant acidity at the time the three wines that hit the mark perfectly were hermann j wiemer dry johannisberg riesling from new york gallo of sonoma pinot gris from california and robert mondavi chardonnay reserve from california for the red and to us thanksgiving is a time for red wine we suggested two years ago that it might be fun to try an oregon pinot noir not only are these delicious but having a wine from one of americas most exciting newer wine regions is a fine way to celebrate the bounty of this country all that said though for us there is one perfect wine for thanksgiving dinner a fine american cabernet sauvignon its not just that the flavors match well with the dinner though they do its that a good cabernet has complexity and layers of interest just like the big meal on the table and critically a fine cabernet has the stature to belong on the table this year wed suggest taking this one step further choose a wine that is itself part of american history open one of the classic cabernets of america wines linked to the people who had a vision of great american wine and took risks to help create the modern american wine industry these were the pioneers people like the sparkle eyed russian emigre andre tchelistcheff who proved what was possible in america at beaulieu vineyard robert mondavi who broke with his own family to show the way toward californias future warren winiarski a former mondavi winemaker who stunned the world with his stagss leap cabernet at the paris tasting of al brounstein who smuggled vines from bordeaux to plant diamond creek vineyards and crusty joe heitz who was once asked by the author of a book called "great winemakers of california" whether california wines were as good as european wines and replied "is the best blonde as much fun as the best brunette " goodness knows there were many other pioneers in those early days and there are still pioneers today but a few winemakers and their wineries will always have a very special place in america and times are changing mr mondavi is frail and lost his winery in mr brounstein died last year mr winiarski just sold his winery of course some of these wines are no longer considered among americas best a lot has happened over the years but history should count for something in any event serving one of these wines invites wine lovers like us to remember vintages of our lives because these are names so many of us grew up with to decide which we might recommend we bought a large sample of wines from some of americas classic wineries wine geeks could argue forever about which should be included in any first cut but we chose well known names that have been around since about or earlier and whose top cabernet sauvignon or cabernet blend has been or at least was well regarded for a number of years for our tasting we ordered the vintage if we could find it because its the most widely available but some wineries havent yet released the so we got other vintages we generally tried to skip the vintage which was inconsistent in some cases we tasted two vintages of the same wine we did not taste these blind but instead tried one or two bottles per night so each of these young wines had a chance to show its stuff with and without plenty of air and with and without food great american cabernet sauvignon is something special with the tastes of big ripe proudly american grapes and the skill of a winemaker reining in the tastes to create a tight textured structured whole the combination of power and elegance in a wine that slowly reveals itself layer by layer is a wonder alas that is something we have experienced less as the years have gone on and cabernets have too often become caricatures of themselves with far too much oak cream and alcohol and too little acidity fruit and winemaking elegance in the attached index you will see the wineries and the wines that we liked best among the pioneers these should remind anyone what great american wine can taste like bold and proud but with guiding principles that give them focus and meaning history can be delicious these wines prove it melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones classic cabernet index in a tasting of some of californias long time classic cabernet sauvignons and cabernet sauvignon blends these were our favorites all of these are made in limited quantities they would be great with thanksgiving dinner open
