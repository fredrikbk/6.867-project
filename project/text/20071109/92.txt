tinkering with toys just in time for toy season congress is promoting new legislation to crack down on companies selling products said to be defective or dangerous with an epidemic of tainted chinese imports on their hands industry and regulators have been clamoring for beefed up safety standards so far more than million products have been taken off store shelves since the summer thats not enough for the senate under a senate bill sponsored by arkansas democrat mark pryor the budget of the consumer product safety commission would be increased to &# million from &# million over five years it would also raise the cap on civil penalties against a company selling a defective product to &# million more than times its current level while many agency complaints are now handled through negotiation with a &# million anvil over their heads companies likely would litigate prosecutions would rise while actual enforcement would fall meanwhile the pryor bill would empower all state attorneys general to effectively run their own consumer product safety adjuncts deciding what constitutes a safety defect and making their own judgments about appropriate remedies the result could be a jigsaw system of conflicting standards across the country you can see where this is going banned in michigan hot wheels being smuggled across the border into indiana and so on and without a consistent national standard small businesses would be particularly hard hit lacking resources to monitor the evolving rules nationwide but wait theres more mr pryors proposal would also give whistleblowers within companies bonus cash for coming forward with the dirt fees would float between and of any civil penalties collected by the state or feds at up to &# million thats not a bad finders fee whistleblowers also cannot be fired if they are "about to" provide information on an "alleged violation" of law which sounds like a license for any worker to make himself untouchable among those objecting to this plan is the head of the consumer product safety commission herself nancy nord while shed be happy to have more resources she would prefer to use them for hiring "more safety inspectors and scientists and compliance officers " she said "i dont want to be hiring lawyers " in exchange for this honesty house speaker nancy pelosi called for ms nords resignation all of this is happening at a time when the appetite for business self policing is strong businesses have every incentive to clean up their acts given the costly damage to their brand equity from news stories about tainted toys mattel ran newspaper ads this summer speaking directly to consumers about its efforts to ensure its products were safe other toy companies have already begun raising their own internal safeguards with toys "r" us and walt disney joining mattel in announcing more rigorous safety testing their action even earned them the praise of illinois senator richard durbin who announced himself pleased that they "held themselves to a higher standard " the industry has been loud in its complaints against mr pryors bill and he may yet be willing to negotiate the house has offered a more reasonable version reducing the &# million penalty to &# million and leaving off the whistleblower provision congresss urge to legislate here is we guess understandable given that the members can claim to be doing something to protect children but as with many passing "scandals " the idea that federal legislators have the solution is itself most likely a defective product
