risky debts recovery hits a wall fresh jitters resurface over corporate bonds other market segments in a replay of the summer turmoil that dried up investor demand for all sorts of risky debt pockets of the credit markets that just weeks ago seemed on the road to recovery are weakening again the market for junk corporate debt which rebounded in september and october has softened while the investment grade bonds of some banks and financial companies have dived to levels that make them look as risky as junk bonds demand for asset backed commercial paper which plunged in the summer but showed signs of stabilizing in recent weeks dropped sharply again on renewed worries over subprime mortgage securities to which this paper is often tied even the municipal bond market is starting to show some signs of stress due to concerns over the health of financial guaranty companies that insured many municipal bonds two large municipal debt offerings by authorities in miami and puerto rico were delayed because of drying up demand "there was a feeling that we were out of the woods and thats beginning to dissipate a little " said eric tutterow a managing director overseeing high yield or junk rated debt at fitch ratings the concerns in credit markets drove many investors yesterday into treasury bonds sending their yields falling the price of the benchmark year note rose to push down its yield to the yield on the two year note dropped to its lowest level in more than two years this week wall street underwriters made a second attempt at selling roughly &# billion in loans tied to chrysler llcs automotive business in which a majority stake was acquired by cerberus capital management lp in august it looked like a sign of the markets improvement then rough conditions in the junk bond market forced bankers to call off a &# million bond sale to finance the leveraged buyout of guitar center inc a retailer of musical instruments the guitar center postponement was the first since august bringing back memories of the disorder in the corporate debt markets during the summer when dozens of buyout debt offerings were pulled a separate &# million sale of loans by guitar center went through this week as did some other junk bond sales but values of many leveraged loans and junk bonds fell sharply in september the difference between yields on junk bonds and yields on treasury bonds jumped to nearly five percentage points the highest spread in over three years it was a sign of the higher returns investors were demanding for holding risky assets those spreads had been narrowing until mid october now they are back near five percentage points investors had been returning too buying into the large debt offerings of first data corp and energy future holdings formerly known as txu corp this week money managers said that there were fresh jitters about the large amount of new debt being sold which includes chryslers loan and another &# billion in loans for the buyout of alltel corp in some respects the credit market troubles are worse than the summers liquidity crunch which was triggered by fears of large subprime related losses by hedge funds banks brokerages and other financial firms in recent weeks large scale credit rating downgrades of subprime securities heavy write downs and massive losses reported by wall street firms have borne out much of those fears "in the summer we didnt quite know how bad it would be but we have now put some of those lower earnings in the record books " said joe balestrino a portfolio manager at federated investors "the financials have been crushed " losses on securities tied to subprime loans could actually exceed the volumes of actual mortgages in the loan pools behind them some firms made big side bets on these securities through derivative contracts such derivative trades "have the effect of multiplying the exposures " said jon thompson vice president of structured finance at advantus capital management inc "this is like a vicious circle that continues to play out " he said "as investors hear more bad news and see the magnitude of the losses that are being reported they are throwing up their arms and questioning what else is there and where is it " the market for asset backed commercial paper also is looking shaky again these are short term loans backed by assets such as auto loans mortgages and securities such as collateralized debt obligations data from the federal reserve yesterday showed that the volume of this sort of short term debt outstanding dived &# billion in the past week its largest drop since late august volumes in this market had fallen off a cliff in august but the rate of decline slowed in september and october this week moodys investors service downgraded or said it would cut ratings of structured investment vehicles that issue such short term debt and hold around &# billion in assets some of these vehicles may soon start selling off their assets at depressed
