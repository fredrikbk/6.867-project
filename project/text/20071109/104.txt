weekend journal review books loathed lovable and loopy the complete book of aunts by rupert christiansen with beth brophy twelve pages &# given that most people seem to have at least one aunt and that most women of a certain age are themselves aunts any book calling itself "the complete book of aunts" might as well be re titled "the complete book of nearly everyone in existence " with so many zillions of aunts in the world it goes without saying that they come in all sorts sizes and varieties in my own limited experience i have seen fat ones and thin ones aunts with bushy eyebrows and aunts with practically no hair at all brittle aunts and emollient aunts dunces and geniuses warriors and placaters tyrants and timid mice those who uplift and those who only dismay takers and givers stimulators and bores the list is really endless among my own aunts there was one who ate dog biscuits at teatime one who had moss sprouting from the corners of her mouth during the summer months one who never touched a drop of drink and another who never drew a sober breath my great great aunt constance was i believe some kind of erotomaniac while her two sisters trissie and elsie carried their maidenhoods with them to their graves and i am only counting among the deceased for an author or compiler of "the complete book of aunts " the choice is simply unlimited rupert christiansen and beth brophy have done well to contain their sprawling subject to roughly short pages the book started life in england with mr christiansen the youngish highly cultivated opera critic of the daily telegraph as its sole author the original edition which came out last fall and no doubt sold copiously to those looking for christmas presents for their aunt opened with a personal and moving portrait of the authors dead aunt janet "she stared at me benignly and the purple papery arthritic claw that was once her hand pressed my wrist sympathetically a week later she died " this was followed by a more general essay titled "a short history of the aunt " with the rest of the book comprising an anthology of poems tales lists and short pieces about all sorts of fictional and real aunts although danish by patrilineal descent mr christiansen was born and brought up in england his original edition is not unnaturally rich in examples of english aunts but he does remind his readers of such magnificent specimens as aunt emily caroline kington blair oliphant of ardblair scotland a real woman who used to turn up uninvited to the weddings of complete strangers wearing a cossack hat and criticizing everyone elses attire mr christiansen also remembers aunt dorothea ffoulkes corbett known as aunt dot the brazen maiden from rose macaulays "the towers of trebizond " who takes it upon herself to convert the muslims to anglicanism by riding across turkey on a camel with a bible under her arm unsurprisingly this doughty and singular woman is pelted with rotten fruit wherever she goes but dot is redoubtable and clings admirably to an excellent credo that she passes on to her nephews and nieces "one mustnt lose sight of the hard core which is do this do that love your friends and like your neighbours be just be extravagantly generous be honest be tolerant have compassion use your wits and your imagination understand the world you live in and be on terms with it " and of course mr christiansen includes in his original edition a passage that for me at least remains the seminal text of english literature concerning aunts it is a short section from the opening paragraph of p g wodehouses story "jeeves makes an omelette " in which bertie wooster muses to himself on the abominable problem of auntly relations "if someone were to come to me and say wooster would you be interested in joining a society i am starting whose aim will be the suppression of aunts or at least will see to it that they are kept on a short chain and not permitted to roam hither and thither at will scattering desolation on all sides i would reply wilbraham if his name was wilbraham i am with you heart and soul put me down as a foundation member " now beth brophy a journalist and editor from washington d c has stepped in to give "the complete book of aunts" that all important american zing relegating mr christiansens beloved aunt janet to an epilogue cutting out lots of british aunts aunt dot aunt emily caroline kington blair oliphant and the seminal bertie wooster passage are all lost and refilling the pages of her american edition with a host of all american aunts to delight her all american readers ms brophys new entries include spider mans aunt may aunt bee from "the andy griffith show " a few glitzy names like coco chanel who was apparently brought up by aunts and a whipping spanking tart from fort worth texas advertising herself as "aunt vicki " in this case ms brophy has generously seen fit to reproduce large portions of text from aunt vickis self pimping web site "i use the over the knee position as well as a spanking stool theres nothing more satisfying than the feel of my hairbrush or paddle smacking a naughty bare bottom " elsewhere ms brophy has changed the text to make it appeal to the american reader so for instance mr christiansens "its jolly irritating" becomes "its really irritating" in the american recension it may seem that as an englishman i am biased in favour or if you must favor of the original english edition but i insist that nothing would give me greater pleasure than to read an american book about aunts and that nothing would annoy me more than to know that some patronizing english editor had decided to anglicize it by changing every american "really" to a more english sounding "jolly " we all know that in limey land they say tomarto and in america the quasi fruit is pronounced tomayto it is precisely this kind of linguistic variation that gives the world its charm vive la difference as the french would say and i would have to agree there is nothing wrong either with including advertisements for modern working flagellants in an anthology about aunts at least i do not think there is if aunt vicki is indeed an aunt or even if she is only pretending to be one for the purpose of her professional ministrations she has just as much right to be included in this book as aunt jemima and her pancake mix aunt jane austen and her literary novels or truman capote and his aunt mary ida faulk carter but what i would object to if i were an american would be the wheeling in of hookers superheroes and other low brow americans just to make a perfectly good palatable and popular english book fit in with somebodys crass assumptions concerning the mentality of the average american reader of course in the modern world readers have plenty of choice when they buy books over the internet and can order up either the american or the english edition at the press of a button as an englishman i have to admit that i found beth brophys new americanization quirky foreign and every bit as delightful as rupert christiansens original but if i were an intelligent broad minded american aunt who was given this new version with all its so called american enhancements by one of my smirking nephews or nieces for christmas i am afraid that i would consider it jolly whoops i mean really irritating mr waughs most recent book is "fathers and sons the autobiography of a family "
