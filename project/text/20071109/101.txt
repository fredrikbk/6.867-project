weekend journal missing wonders many of historys most famous shipwrecks tombs and relics are still missing jennifer saranow on the growing high tech hunt for them with as many as active satellites orbiting the earth and the human population approaching seven billion youd think that everything of value on the planet would have been discovered by now but some of the worlds most famous historical objects from the holy grail of medieval lore to the wreckage of amelia earharts plane remain unaccounted for somewhere off the coast of colombia lies the san jose a sunken spanish galleon thought by some to be carrying more than &# billion in treasure archaeologists have spent decades searching for the tomb of the egyptian queen nefertiti and since the middle of the th century nobody has seen a mural by leonardo da vinci that many of his contemporaries considered his greatest masterpiece in recent years a growing army of historians archaeologists and wealthy treasure hunters has been raising huge sums and enlisting new technology in a bid to find these and other treasures maury kravitz a year old semiretired attorney and commodities trader from highland park ill has spent years and &# million to &# million searching north central mongolia for the tomb of genghis khan roger "woody" peard of lake tahoe calif believes amelia earharts lockheed electra e which disappeared over the south

"nobody believes me " he says explorers have had some success last may odyssey marine exploration inc an underwater search and recovery firm announced it had found a colonial era shipwreck it called "black swan" and recovered a trove that includes more than silver coins in a search team found and filmed the wreckage of the titanic while in satellite images helped another group locate what they believe is the lost legendary region of ubar which lawrence of arabia called "the atlantis of the sands " one searcher says he has recovered treasure from the famous flor de la mar shipwreck off the coast of indonesia while a texas professor claims to have purchased a sliver of the true cross the cross used to crucify jesus for about &# on ebay traditionally nonacademic treasure hunts are funded by groups of investors who seek returns by selling media rights and splitting any treasure odyssey marine the most prominent company of its kind capitalized on the interest in treasure hunting in by going public the company has a market capitalization of about &# million and posted revenue of &# million last year it last had an annual profit in but technology is opening up the field using the global positioning system searchers can better pinpoint where to look wireless communications allow searchers to share and analyze information from remote spots satellite photography can suggest likely ancient sites and trade routes while increasingly sensitive and affordable devices use radar signals magnetic sensors and electrical pulses to detect foundations and metal objects at the same time deep diving devices that use magnetometers and sonar detection have enabled searchers to see things underwater that werent visible even five years ago many such techniques are accessible to "pretty much anybody these days " says w fredrick limp director of the university of arkansass center for advanced spatial technologies porcher taylor iii a university of richmond professor has spent nearly a decade analyzing increasingly detailed satellite images of an anomaly on turkeys mount ararat that he believes could be noahs ark in miami geographer ulf erlingsson recently used high tech mapping software to show the similarity between ireland and platos descriptions of atlantis mr erlingsson believes platos descriptions were inspired by an island in the north sea in some cases wealthy people are commissioning searches to find the u s submarine their father died in during world war ii three brothers recently hired two underwater exploration companies to look for it the vessel the uss grunion was identified last august for &# individual treasure hunters can buy ground sensors or hire an underwater search vessel for a day in recent years archaeologists historians and governments have voiced concern that many underwater treasure hunters are pillaging loot with little concern for the historical record under traditional laws governing shipwreck sites in international waters finders are keepers and salvagers are entitled to compensation but governments are increasingly staking claims odyssey marine is now engaged in a legal battle with spain over the black swan laws governing objects found on land are usually more stringent here are looks at seven of the most prized lost treasures what they are where they are thought to be and who is looking for them egyptologists know that this queen of egypt lived in the th century b c was married to the pharaoh akhenaten was possibly not egyptian herself and had at least six daughters they also have a general sense of what she looked like thanks to a famous bust but because her tomb has never been found they dont know when she died or what happened to her after about the th year of her husbands reign her name disappears from the archaeological record her tomb is the one that "everybody would like to find " says nicholas reeves an egyptologist at eton college in the united kingdom not because of the riches it may contain but because nefertiti "is the missing link " whose tomb contents could help clear up a lot of controversy surrounding this period he says dr reeves is one of a group of egyptologists who believe nefertitis name disappeared because she ruled with her husband and then on her own after his death as smenkhkare he believes she is buried in the valley of the kings possibly at a spot that a ground radar survey in placed close to tutankhamuns tomb the spot is also close to a tomb discovered in that appears to be a tomb service room of sorts hinting at the possible presence of a major find nearby dr reeves says others meanwhile believe smenkhkare was someone else possibly tutankhamuns older brother and the disappearance of nefertitis name means that she died some archaeologists have concentrated their search in the royal necropolis at amarna the capital city established by akhenaten and then abandoned not long after his death j d s pendlebury a british archaeologist who excavated amarna in the early s wrote that in the s "a body of men was seen marching down from the high desert with a golden coffin and shortly afterwards appeared golden objects bearing her name " marc gabolde a french archaeologist says nefertiti was likely buried in amarna and then her body was moved along with the rest of the dead royal family to the valley of kings in thebes still others believe that nefertitis mummy is one of the discovered in in a sealed chamber of amenhotep iis tomb in the valley of the kings joann fletcher an expert in ancient body adornment in the u k has proposed that the mummy known as "younger lady" is nefertiti partly because of its swan like neck susan james a california historian believes nefertiti is very likely the "elder lady" mummy found at the same time "if you just overlay the famous bust in berlin over the features they fit perfectly " she says in leonardo da vinci was commissioned to decorate a hall in the palazzo vecchio in florence he worked there for about months on a mural of the battle of anghiari which was fought by florentine troops in he used oils instead of the traditional fresco technique before leaving it unfinished for some reason in still da vincis contemporaries considered it to be his greatest masterpiece in the mid th century cosimo i de medici hired giorgio vasari to remodel the hall and the mural was lost most clues to what the renaissance masterpiece looked like come from da vincis preliminary sketches and copies made before it disappeared the mural has inspired works by rubens pictured and picasso "we are talking about a masterpiece that in its time overcast the last supper " says maurizio seracini an expert in using science to analyze art dr seracini has devoted his life to proving that vasari hid the da vinci mural behind one of his own in he noticed a flag in the vasari mural with the motto cerca trova "he who seeks finds " he then spent years researching the original structure of the hall to get a sense of where da vinci painted his mural using advanced thermal and radar imaging equipment he spotted a tiny air gap in the wall behind the vasari mural precisely where the flag sits he believes that vasari a known da vinci admirer and his first biographer preserved the wall decorated by da vinci and constructed a new one in front of it vasari is known to have preserved a fresco by masaccio in the santa maria novella church in florence but to probe behind vasaris mural without damaging it requires technology that doesnt yet exist by next spring dr seracini director of the center of interdisciplinary science for art architecture and archaeology at the university of california san diego plans to begin testing a new technology called a "neutron activation analysis machine" being developed by the university and two other institutions the goal is that the machine will detect the presence of the paint used by da vinci once the technology is finished dr seracini plans to settle the mystery by scanning the right part of the east wall "that will give the ultimate answer " he says one of the great masterpieces of baroque art the amber room was a gift from king frederick william i of prussia to peter the great in it was installed in many places but ultimately at the russian imperial summer palace at tsarskoye selo its walls were completely covered with amber panels mirrors and marble mosaics a british ambassador is said to have once described it as the eighth wonder of the world when the nazi armies invaded russia in fake walls hastily constructed in the room didnt fool the germans who dismantled the treasure and transported it to a castle in what is now kaliningrad russia where they put it on display in january the room was packed up for evacuation and after the russians stormed the city it was never seen again there have been theories that the amber room was on board the wilhelm gustloff a passenger ship sunk by russian torpedoes in or that its hidden in a german slate mine or even in fort knox the search has lured everyone from treasure hunters to the russian government norman scott of global explorations of gainesville fla has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars looking for the room in places ranging from a cathedral in kaliningrad to tunnels underneath a german castle currently he is trying to get permission from the appropriate environmental department to explore lake toplitz in austria where he hopes to find several crates with russian markings nonetheless even he believes the room is most likely in germany "being controlled by leading aristocratic families" who "move it every six months " helmut gaensel a treasure hunter in the czech republic has been searching for the amber room and is convinced it lies in boxes in tunnels under the ruins of a german castle near the czech border he is awaiting permission to dig to support his treasure hunting efforts he took out a mortgage on a hotel he owns hopes were raised in when a mosaic from the room turned up in germany but evidence shows that that panel was already missing when the germans packed up the room researchers are increasingly concluding that the room perished in in a fire started by soviet soldiers a moscow state historic museum official sent to investigate in concluded the same "the truth is quite banal " says art expert konstantin akinsha an author of "beautiful loot " amelia earhart aimed to be the first person to fly around the globe close to the equator on july three quarters of the way through the trip she and her navigator fred noonan took off from lae in what is now papua new guinea in a lockheed electra e plane they were never seen again about hours into their mile trip earhart radioed "we must be on you but cannot see you " and "gas is running low" to the coast guard ship waiting for them at howland island in the central pacific not long after the ship received her last confirmed radio message saying she was flying "north and south" on a particular navigational line looking for the island a massive weeks long search effort turned up nothing today a slew of groups is betting that current technology will be able to find her plane elgen long an author of "amelia earhart the mystery solved " is a proponent of the "crash and sink" theory that earharts plane simply ran out of gas landed in the ocean and sank he and search exploration company nauticos llc calculated a roughly square mile area where the plane most likely went down based on variables like radio message content and wind and speed data they have thoroughly searched about of that area on previous expeditions without finding anything and now are hoping a free swimming device called an autonomous underwater vehicle will allow them to search the remaining deeper and more rugged terrain such a device which they expect to receive next year at the earliest doesnt have to be lugged by a ships cable and can see into crevices and nooks where other devices cant another team which calls itself the international group for historic aircraft recovery returned in august from its ninth expedition to the island of nikumaroro in the south pacific where they believe earhart and noonan landed and were marooned the artifacts collected including a substance that could be fossilized human feces are currently being analyzed meanwhile there are more than theories for what happened to earhart some say she was a u s spy captured and killed by the japanese others that she reversed direction and crashed back in new guinea david billings an aircraft engineer in australia hopes to prove the latter theory as early as next may by finding the plane with helicopters armed with magnetometers elsewhere tod swindell a los angeles film producer conducted his own "forensics overlay" photography comparison research to test his theory that a now deceased new jersey housewife named irene craigmile bolam was actually earhart he believes the aviator came back to the u s under a new identity ms bolams sister in law says the theory makes sense "she was not an ordinary housewife " she says the san jose is "the holy grail of shipwrecks " says bob cembrola curator of maritime history at the u s naval war college in newport r i after it was blown apart in an ambush by an english squadron off the coast of colombia in the san jose pictured a spanish galleon of the period sank with men aboard its treasure which likely includes gold and silver coins could be worth &# million to more than &# billion depending on whom you ask without the san joses ship manifest the size of its treasure is a matter of debate english estimates at the time put the value at million spanish pesos while gabriel garcia marquez greatly inflates that figure in his novel "love in the time of cholera " historians generally assume the ship had seven million to million spanish pesos about the same as its surviving sister ship the san joaquin the value of that treasure today depends on how much the coins could be sold for likely between &# million and &# million says historian david hebb the san jose legend has lured treasure hunters for years in a group of investors now operating under the name sea search armada announced theyd found the galleon off the coast of colombia and just this past july their nearly year legal battle with colombia came to an end that countrys highest court ruled that anything found that is deemed part of colombias cultural heritage will go to colombia while the remaining "treasure" will be split with the explorers sea search armada hopes to begin excavation by the only problem members of an expedition colombia launched in to verify the finds coordinates say there was nothing there "it was just flat mud and a few crustaceans " says richard cassin of the ocean sciences research institute in la jolla calif a spokesman for sea search armada says he does not believe this search actually took place others claim to know where the ship is too canadian treasure hunter tony dyakowski says he found it in by using the log of an english junior ship officer he hopes to get a search and recovery permit university of minnesota history professor carla rahn phillips author of "the treasure of the san jose " has attempted to pinpoint the ships location with help from navigational experts at the naval war college she plans to publish coordinates next year it isnt clear exactly what the holy grail is historians say it is first mentioned around in a narrative poem by chretien de troyes the author describes the knight perceval seeing a grail but never explicitly states what it was later medieval writers amid debate over the eucharist described it as the cup that jesus used at the last supper the chalice that was used to collect christs blood and a stone with mystical power in the late th century the grail became tied to mysticism and ritual in the th century it was sometimes described as the jar that mary magdalene used to rub ointment on christs feet it also became associated with christs possible child and bloodline a la the bestselling book "the da vinci code" the fact that many historians think the grail was just a literary device hasnt stopped people from looking for it alfredo barbagallo an italian medieval scholar believes there is "a strong possibility" that the holy grail the chalice is in the catacombs under the basilica of st lawrence outside the walls in rome he believes st lawrence received the churchs reliquary treasures in the third century from pope sixtus ii and that the grail is possibly buried there because theres an image of a chalice in a mosaic on the floor he says hes waiting for permission from the vatican to explore the church denies mr barbagallos claim and the vatican didnt return calls for comment last summer vandals broke into st lukes church in hodnet england where some legends place the grail damaging an organ pipe and a stone wall rev charmian beech suspects the culprits were two italian tourists who had visited the church and were "very interested in the da vinci code " nearby in graham phillips author of "the chalice of magdalene " claims to have found an alabaster cup from the first century pictured that he believes "started all the grail legends " juliette wood a medieval folklorist estimates at least eight supposed holy grails have been found in recent centuries including a th century alabaster jar and a medieval wooden bowl but she doubts that the real object was ever saved at the time "there was no real reason to keep any souvenirs " she says nobody knows where genghis khan is buried while historical sources describe the great warrior dying on a campaign in northwestern china in they dont reveal his final resting place in a chinese ambassador claimed to have seen the great conquerors burial spot and in a chinese writer named the location as "kirelgu " but the mystery remains after reading a book years ago about the mongol conqueror maury kravitz the attorney and commodities trader became obsessed fifteen years ago he dreamed up the notion of finding the warriors tomb he assembled an expedition raised &# million won the approval of the mongolian government anything found would go to mongolia and in started focusing on an area local legends had identified as khans burial spot there the team found a burial ground surrounded by a two mile stone wall over two summer expeditions at that spot which were plagued by biting flies and snakes mr kravitz and his team dug up skeletons carbon dated a coffin to the mongol period and found pottery dating from an earlier period by further explorations were put on hold when money ran out and mr kravitz started suffering health problems "my considered opinion is khan is buried there " says mr kravitz who is feeling better and hopes to raise &# to be back by as early as next summer with some "sophisticated metal detecting equipment " in the meantime mr kravitz faces competition from local and foreign expeditions some of which are in the works or claim to be searching in other places one thing all historians agree on it is unlikely that khan was buried with any treasure some believe the mongols were just beginning to adopt the practice of burial in and didnt believe the body needed material things after death in addition "the whole political culture of the mongols was based around the idea of giving away treasures to court support " says christopher atwood indiana universitys chair of central eurasian studies
