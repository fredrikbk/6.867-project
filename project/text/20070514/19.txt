characteristics of the american and european markets " says li shufu chairman of geely "we want to bring chinese cars to the whole world " in the chinese market heightened competition among multinational auto makers and a swarm of domestic manufacturers has sparked a price war which often pressures profit margins in recent years average car prices have fallen about a year in the first quarter of prices dropped says kevin wale president of gms china operations but charles cheung an analyst with citigroup in hong kong says geely remains "less aggressive in price cuts compared to its competitors" and "continues to be a price follower rather than leading the price cuts " mr cheung has a month target price of hk&# for geely shares mr cheung also has a positive view of other chinese auto makers including brilliance and dongfeng motor group and denway motors these firms all have ventures that produce vehicles with foreign partners some also produce cars under their own brand names for geely operating profit margin increased to last year compared with in as the company "steered its product mix towards high end models " wrote ms mak of merrill lynch "geelys sales may not have increased as fast as those of domestic rivals but profit making is always a top priority for a private company they are making steady progress " says dong jianhua an analyst at southwest securities in beijing mr dong says geely has good control of the companys profitability with well planned capacity expansion and stable car prices at present geely holds a share in each of the four vehicle manufacturing plants in china and of a parts company the other shares are held by the parent company which intends to gradually inject its stakes into the listed unit "were going through relevant laws and regulations here and in hong kong " says mr li geelys chairman "if all goes well it can be achieved within this year " analysts say geelys low cost advantage at parts sourcing and inexpensive self developed key components such as auto transmissions and engines help it offset the intensifying price pressure analysts predict the acquisitions likely through new share issuance will boost geelys earnings per share chinas crowded auto market with more than players is causing some analysts to worry about profit health especially compared with companies in other hot sectors such as banking oil and steel "the auto industry was at its golden age and its peak about two to three years ago right now competition is very fierce " says winson fong head of greater china equities with sg asset management in hong kong sg recently sold its holdings in geely ellen zhu
