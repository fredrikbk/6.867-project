unplugged in struggle to rebuild iraq fights texas firm after &# million power plant is idle bunch of cheats musayyib iraq the gleaming new power plant here could have been a rare example of a successful iraq reconstruction project its control rooms are stocked with state of the art computer systems and its enormous generators equipped to boost iraqs total electricity supply by are ready for use yet as iraqis struggle with continual power outages and the searing summer nears most days this sprawling compound miles south of baghdad is nearly deserted the buildings here are shuttered the unused generators gathering dust this plant wasnt derailed by insurgent attacks it was hijacked by a bitter dispute between the iraqi government and a texas contractor a clash that has roped in the u s embassy and escalated into charges of corruption and incompetence the fight highlights the dangers of the bush administrations stated plan to wind down the u s rebuilding effort here leaving it to the iraqi government to rebuild the country u s reconstruction officials say its already clear that the &# billion spent by the u s wont restore iraqs basic services to their prewar levels awash in oil revenue the iraqi government has tens of billions of dollars to spend rebuilding but iraqi officials have virtually no systems in place for negotiating large construction contracts overseeing the work itself or making payments to foreign contractors on time that has led the iraqis to hire foreign contractors who were inexperienced or incapable of doing the job the plant at musayyib which officials say is weeks away from being operational has become the most prominent symbol of the paralysis "the iraqis have spent &# million on this plant and all they have is some metal sitting in the desert " says john dempsey a u s reconstruction official during a recent visit to the plant three years ago the musayyib plant was a symbol of something else the optimistic ambitious push by iraqs first post saddam hussein government in conjunction with its american benefactors and american companies to repair the countrys infrastructure electricity shortages had become a major source of public anger toward the american and iraqi governments with insurgent attacks and production problems pushing iraqs power supply below prewar levels iraqs ministry of electricity signed the contract with southeast texas industrial services inc a privately held company that specializes in building power plants refineries and oil drilling sites the project was the largest undertaken by the iraqi government since the u s invasion a &# million effort to build a megawatt plant plus an adjacent refinery that would process much needed fuel for other nearby electricity plants it was also big step up for southeast texas the assignment was the largest in the companys history and the most challenging based in a low slung brown building in the small town of buna three hours outside of houston southeast had never worked overseas let alone in a war zone like iraq its total revenues were about &# million smaller than the musayyib contract exactly how southeast texas won the iraqi contact is a matter of dispute iraqi officials believe southeast bribed the then electricity minister later arrested on unrelated corruption charges to win the business "to hire a company that is not well known to do a project this big and sign the contract in a couple of days who has ever heard of such a thing " says senior deputy minister of electricity raad al haris "i think money changed hands " mr dempsey the u s reconstruction official concurs "they probably paid a bribe " he wrote in an internal memorandum earlier this year "weve never paid a bribe to anybody " says w c cole the companys executive managing director southeast says it was in amman bidding on a jordanian government project when it got word that iraq was accepting bids for a large power plant southeast says it then submitted what it was told was the lowest bid however the deal originated southeast texas executives say they were excited about the project "we supported our president completely and we thought it would look good for our company if we went in and helped rebuild iraq " says mr cole who has spent years in the construction business the good feelings didnt last long in march the company says it notified the iraqi government that it was behind in its payments having been warned by iraqi officials that the site needed better security southeast says it built new concrete walls and guard towers so it wasnt able to begin work at the site until may nearly four months later than planned insurgents began targeting the site almost immediately on june mortars slammed into the construction site a few days later three of the companys security guards were badly wounded when their vehicles were ambushed on oct the site was hit by nine mortars and a car bomb amid continuing security problems southeast shut down its operations on oct southeast notes that under its contract the iraqi government was responsible for "security for the site and transportation for equipment and personnel to from the site " "the iraqis would promise to send guards but the guys would show up without guns " says paul spence southeasts president and son in law of its late founder "then theyd have guns but they wouldnt have bullets " as a result southeast says it had to spend millions on western bodyguards and other measures the company passed its security expenses on to the iraqi government infuriating many iraqi officials the iraqis acknowledge they were late with payments citing the confusion resulting from many changes of leadership and say they occasionally fell short in meeting their contractual promises but the iraqis also accuse the company of continually setting conditions for resuming work at the plant leaving the site idle for long stretches "i knew they were cheating us but the government was desperate to finish the plant so we gave in " says mr al haris a western educated official involved in the musayyib project since its inception under the terms of a nov agreement southeast agreed to resume work on the plant in exchange for an additional &# million from the iraqi government the company says the next payment didnt arrive until feb days late work on the musayyib plant finally resumed on march one week later the bad blood exploded during a meeting at ammans sheraton al nabil hotel &amp towers according to participants on both sides the iraqis were told they would have to pay more if they wanted southeast to test the plants machinery and bring it on line mr al haris the iraqi government official says he told the southeast executives that they were a "bunch of cheats " and then stormed out of the room in september southeast told the iraqis that its american employees needed defense department badges so they could enter u s military facilities across iraq and take refuge there in emergencies since the badges could only be given to contractors working on u s funded projects al herman a senior u s embassy official suggested awarding southeast a small u s contract to train iraqi workers on the new equipment "the idea was to give them a make work contract worth &# or so " mr herman says a few days later southeast submitted a &# million bid the offer angered the u s embassy officials who felt the company was trying to take advantage of them mr cole says southeast was simply trying to submit an honest bid u s officials had asked the company to send a proposal for six months of on the job training which would entail millions of dollars in security costs alone "they never told us this was a dummy contract " he adds by that point southeast executives had made the decision to walk away from the project in january mr cole emailed karim hasan the new iraqi electricity minister to say that the company was giving the government a final chance to correct its "innumerable" failures to secure the site provide the badges and make timely payments if the ministry failed to do so within four days mr cole wrote southeast would consider the contract "terminated" and begin seeking financial damages in his emailed reply mr hasan accused the company of bad faith "stiss behavior we now see has for some time had the objective of engineering a means for stis to avoid its obligations under its contract " the iraqi official wrote southeast texas formally severed the musayyib contract on jan in an email to mr hasan a lawyer for the company said it would attempt to recover financial damages of at least &# million for its security expenses and lost profits on feb mr hasan accused southeast of "holding the iraqi people hostage to its attempt to extort both the iraqi and american governments" and threatened to open arbitration proceedings and refer the company to the u s justice department mr cole replied in kind "we are confident in our position and in our opinion were you confident in yours you would not succumb to such baseless threats " while the iraqi government and southeast traded attacks u s officials were quietly looking for a way of somehow finishing the plant they had long ago given up on southeast whom they deemed unreliable in his memo to colleagues mr dempsey wrote "i do not believe stis is competent to complete this project " "if the plant is practically complete and were not competent to complete it how did it get this far " mr cole replies "if the u s government had done anything to help us the plant would be up and running already " u s officials say theyre even willing to use american funds to finish the plant but they knew that it wouldnt be enough for them to simply hire another contractor and send them to musayyib without southeasts blueprints and software it would be extremely difficult for another company to get the plants generators and computers running properly when u s officials approached southeast mr cole said in an email that southeast would be willing to turn over the software and blueprints and drop its planned litigation if the iraqi government agreed to terminate the contract and pay the company approximately &# million the iraqis rejected the offer and on april southeast filed arbitration papers with the paris based international chamber of commerce accusing the iraqi ministry of electricity of defaulting on the contract in the filing the firm asks for damages of as much as &# million the iraqi government says it will soon file a countersuit asking arbitrators to force southeast to return as much as &# million to the ministry iraqi officials accuse southeast of pulling out of iraq without meeting its contractual obligations to complete the plant and then refusing to return u s embassy officials side with baghdad saying southeast was incapable of completing the job and charged too much for its services southeast officials defend the quality of their work on the plant and say all the accusations are unfounded managers say they regret what happened at musayyib "do you understand that i lost people on this job friends " asks jack childress the project manager for the musayyib plant brushing away tears as he discusses the saga from his office in the companys headquarters mr childress devoted two years living in musayyib missing his youngest sons high school graduation he became friends with iraqis who worked on the plant and says he was devastated when his deputy was kidnapped by insurgents and never seen again "to get the project this far and not get to crank the machines it stings it really stings " now its up to the u s to try to pick up the pieces during a visit in march mr herman accepted a cigarette from mohammed nashoom a ministry of electricity official stationed at the plant and inhaled deeply mr herman told the iraqi that the u s hoped to hire a boise idaho based contractor washington group international inc to assume responsibility for the plant "the minister of electricity wants you to keep southeast texas off this site from here on out if any of their people come here shoot them " mr herman joked "but when washington group comes greet them with open arms ok " mr nashoom promised to help but told mr herman that southeast welded the doors of some of the control rooms shut which will make it harder for the new contractors to get access to the computers and files stored inside southeast says it did so to protect the equipment left behind on a tour of the plant mr herman pushed open the door to a trailer southeast used for offices a new printer was still covered in shrink wrap and the dusty desks were covered with overflowing ashtrays and empty coke cans mr herman headed to the generator buildings a short distance away a washington group engineer scampered up a short ladder and swung open the heavy metal doors inside was the generator itself a large copper and silver engine it was in excellent condition "its brand new and ready to roll " mr herman said shaking his head "what a damn shame "
