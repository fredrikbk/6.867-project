americas canadas cut and run crowd the vote on a nonbinding resolution to bring the troops home had serious implications for americans but it didnt take place on capitol hill and it wasnt about iraq this vote taken last month was held in canadas house of commons sponsored by the liberal party the resolution called for the country to pull its soldiers out of afghanistan in may when its nato commitment expires though the ayes fell short of victory it was only because the hard left new democratic party which wants the troops out now refused to support it thus despite the loss the resolution creates a lot of uncertainty about canadas reliability in the struggle against radical islam canada is a founding member of nato and has been the u s s security partner in the north american aerospace defense command norad since both nato and norad constitute a recognition that solidarity among western societies plays a key role in the defense of our shared values and way of life thus when canadian politicians start agitating to cut and run from the alliance in the middle of a war its a worrying development one also has to ask whether a wavering canada suggests a more widespread attitude among nato members does the west have the fortitude to go the distance against this determined and lethal enemy our neighbors to the north have been with us in the fight against al qaeda since the first moments of the attacks on that day the top ranking officer on duty at norads command center in colorado which scrambled the jets that responded was a canadian canadian families opened their homes to thousands of stranded air travelers in the weeks and months that followed there was no doubt about support from ottawa the liberal party led by prime minister jean chretien didnt hesitate to commit the nation to the allied response in canada sent troops into the taliban stronghold of kandahar and the country also made financial commitments between and canada is slated to spend &# billion in development assistance in afghanistan making it the single largest recipient of canadian foreign aid liberal prime minister paul martin took the reins in december and canada remained committed in a sept speech defense minster bill graham praised the canadian militarys work in afghanistan noting that "this is not the time for canada or the international community to abandon or even reduce our commitment to a country in which we have invested so much in human and financial resources over the past few years " despite all this by the time mr martin called an election for january canadians had to face the fact that years of liberal rule had gutted the military and that their countrys geopolitical relevance once on a par with that of australia had seriously diminished conservative party leader stephen harper won that election in part because he made restoring canadian pride an issue as if to seal his commitment to the effort the new prime minister chose a visit to the troops in afghanistan as his first trip abroad "your work " mr harper told the soldiers "is about more than just defending canadas interest its also about demonstrating an international leadership role for our country not carping from the sidelines but taking a stand on the big issues that matter you cant lead from the bleachers " mr harper also led and won a vote despite his partys minority status to extend canadas commitment in afghanistan by two years out to may there are now canadian troops in afghanistan and they are doing some of the heaviest lifting unlike many other nato partners which limit their troops participation to the more pacified north canadian soldiers are fighting in the south alongside u s british and afghan units last year canada took command of nato operations around kandahar violence escalated again this spring as allied forces launched another offensive against the taliban this has coincided with an increase in canadian casualties fifty four canadian soldiers have been killed since and nine of those died in a day period in april commencing on easter sunday we are now into the sixth year of this war and polls suggest the public is growing tired of it public weariness is not surprising particularly since the enemy is tied up in the heroin trade and is empowered by civilians who make their living off the poppy crop and by robust demand in europe just ask the colombians how hard it is to fight the organized crime networks that traffic in prohibited and therefore high value substances slow progress is not the only thing working against public confidence recent charges that afghan police abused detainees who were turned over to them by the canadian military have also played a role and the left is having a field day as if canada has its very own "abu ghraib " the opposition senses a weakened mr harper and this explains why it is now attacking the very policy it designed despite the fact that holding up canadas nato commitments and helping secure and build an afghan democracy were once noble liberal goals the opportunity to make afghanistan mr harpers iraq must be tempting to the liberals but by following this line of thinking the party is playing right into the hands of islamic fundamentalists who are eager not only to destroy afghan democracy but more to the point canadas in his speech in afghanistan mr harper reminded the troops that two dozen canadians lost their lives in the world trade center "since that time al qaeda has singled out canada as one of the countries targeted for terror " he warned since then it also has become clear that wealthy saudis are trying to sow radicalism among canadas significant muslim population by promoting fundamentalist teaching in local mosques there has also been an attempt to assert shariah law in canada and at least one significant terror plot has been broken up none of this is unrelated to whats going on in afghanistan and withdrawing from the fight would not reduce the risks to canada on the contrary a canadian surrender in afghanistan would be a victory for terrorists and would energize jihad recruitment in canada its easy to see why ambitious liberals are willing to play the antiwar card so as to return to power its harder to understand why the canadian public would go along with it see related letter "letters to the editor canada stands against freedoms enemies"
