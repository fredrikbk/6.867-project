dow jones ceo zannino the man in the middle just months into his tenure as chief executive of dow jones &amp co richard f zannino finds himself thrust into the midst of a complex takeover drama involving multiple constituents with conflicting agendas news corp s &# a share offer for dow jones represents a premium over the companys stock price before the bid as a result people close to the board say some independent directors believe they have a fiduciary responsibility to support such an offer if it came to a vote much of the companys common stock is now in the hands of takeover traders short term investors who are also pushing for a sale but dow jones is controlled by the bancroft family and family members with of the companys overall voting power oppose the sale in addition mr zanninos predecessor and former boss peter r kann and the ottaway family which controls of the voting power have publicly come out against the offer news corp chairman rupert murdoch has said that he would inject additional resources for news gathering but numerous reporters and editors have urged the family to stay firm in its opposition because they fear a takeover by him would hurt the journals quality and independence mr zannino has "got an incredible dance ahead of him " says michael useem a management professor at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school "hes got to with great dexterity move among what amount to very strong independent constituencies it will be a defining moment for his career " in an interview thursday afternoon in his office mr zannino years old said he is focused on running the company "i love this company and being its ceo " he said "and im committed to doing everything i can to continue to make it a success going forward no matter what happens " so far in his tenure mr zannino a onetime finance executive who has previously worked at apparel and retail companies has gotten good marks from wall street for shaking up dow joness business operations he has created separate business units targeting consumers and business customers and brought in several executives from other companies seven of the eight executives reporting directly to him are new to their positions he has also ruffled some feathers in the process he bested mr kanns wife karen elliott house who had been publisher of the journal in the horse race for the top job and quickly replaced her and the union that represents more than dow jones employees just under of the work force has criticized his cost cutting as it criticized mr kann before him also despite numerous initiatives including the launch of a weekend paper on saturday and the purchase of the financial news site marketwatch both moves mr zannino championed before he became ceo dow joness stock price was stuck in a narrow range before mr murdoch came along mr zannino is quick to point out though that shareholder return in was including dividends a good showing given the lackluster performance of newspaper publishers a relative newcomer to the media business mr zannino had made a habit of meeting with other media executives to discuss the industry he reasons that the landscape for delivering information is shifting dramatically and he wants dow jones to be attuned to the changes "we are a relatively small company we cant be insular " he says "we cant see ourselves narrowly " in addition to the journal and marketwatch dow jones owns factiva dow jones newswires barrons the far eastern economic review dow jones indexes and the ottaway group of community newspapers some meetings have borne fruit a session with barry diller of iac corp resulted in a joint venture getting to know tom glocer the ceo of reuters group plc helped dow jones take full ownership of factiva an information service the company prizes highly "my experience in dealing with old media companies is they chew things around forever and tend to not do anything " mr diller says "i thought his approach was fresh and to the point and direct and not complicated it differs from a lot of my experience with a lot of people who have legacy to protect " mr zannino who lives in greenwich conn with his wife and four children joined dow jones in february when he was years old as the companys chief financial officer and an executive vice president at the time dow jones had been riding the wave of a boom in technology and financial advertising which buoyed its financial results mr zannino has had to navigate the subsequent fall off in print advertising that has hit the journal though to a lesser degree than some other newspapers originally from everett mass he still has the trace of a boston accent mr zannino whose father worked for bethlehem steel and whose mother was a homemaker got an m b a from pace university in new york and a bachelors degree from bentley college in waltham mass prior to joining dow jones he had worked in finance and strategy jobs at liz claiborne inc and saks fifth avenue as well as general signal corp earlier in his career mr zannino developed a reputation as a numbers cruncher in he worked for david l sokol now ceo of midamerican energy holdings a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc mr sokol who was then president and chief operating officer of jwp inc credits mr zannino his year old chief financial officer at the now defunct jwp with helping him uncovering accounting irregularities at the company that resulted in its subsequent bankruptcy filing at dow jones mr zannino drew attention among rumpled journalists for being a sharp dresser although occasionally a casual one he sometimes wears his fashionable loafers without socks he quickly emerged as a candidate to succeed mr kann as ceo and has been an architect of some of the companys acquisitions and divestitures the first nonjournalist to run the company mr zannino has said he wants to bring the business operations of dow jones up to the same level of excellence as its journalism "i know rich was a bit controversial at dow jones because he came from the outside and came from business and retail " mr glocer says "plenty of folks in the reuters newsroom and the dow jones newsroom wondered how could he be sensitive to an extraordinarily professional journalistic culture " but "hes straight he has a sense of humor he can chunk problems into smaller pieces and get on with things " of course it now turns out that one of mr zanninos meetings with a top media executive mr murdoch resulted in an unexpected outcome on march mr zannino who had met with mr murdoch before had breakfast with the news corp chairman at mr murdochs request according to a person close to dow jones near the end of the meal mr murdoch expressed an interest in buying dow jones this person said mr zannino stresses that he has no position on mr murdochs offer "its pretty straight " he said thursday "its the familys decision whether they are interested in selling or not its the familys call and its not my call " bancroft family members are scattered from new england to texas to los angeles and include writers investment bankers philanthropists and equestrians they also control four seats on dow joness member board unlike mr kann who knows members of the bancroft family well from his many years at dow jones mr zannino hasnt had much interaction with them "ninety nine percent of my interaction with the bancroft family is through their representatives on the board " he says some family members have said privately that they worry mr zannino wants to sell dow jones but mr zannino said friday he hasnt advocated any position on the offer "my job is to run the business as best i can " meanwhile james ottaway jr a former director firmly opposed to mr murdochs offer supports mr zannino "the progress that rich zannino and his new management team are making at dow jones is one reason why there is no need for dow jones to be sold to rupert murdoch " mr ottaway said in an emailed statement unlike many companies dow jones doesnt have a change in control provision listing executive benefits if the company is sold other policies in the companys proxy statement indicate that if mr zannino is fired or leaves following a reduction in his duties he would receive at least two years of salary and benefits valued in the companys proxy statement at &# million many companies accelerate the vesting of stock options and restricted stock in the event of a change in control if dow jones did so mr zanninos options and unvested restricted stock would be worth &# million under the terms of mr murdochs offer but what will happen at dow jones is still unclear "this is such a unique case " says mark nadler a partner at oliver wyman a management consultancy in some ways "it goes beyond the basic considerations that normally go into a business decision like this because so much of it is how do you feel about the wall street journal and how do you feel about rupert murdoch its not just what are the business results going to look like its about what is the product going to look like " karen richardson erin white and scott thurm contributed to this article
