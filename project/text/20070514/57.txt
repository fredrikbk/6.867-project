mission adjustment key issue for world bank how to tackle corruption it must balance effort with antipoverty goals even if wolfowitz goes with paul wolfowitz fighting for his job as world bank president the drama is spotlighting a broader issue the bank must wrestle with whether he stays or goes as the bank pours billions of dollars into developing nations how much emphasis should it place on seeing to it that they are better governed and less corrupt an anticorruption drive has been the centerpiece of mr wolfowitzs tenure now his own ethical issues mean the bank could get a new president one who might be more focused on traditional world bank projects such as fighting malaria and building dams roads and schools than on nations governance yet anticorruption efforts are here to stay and now to some degree institutionalized thanks partly to mr wolfowitz it has become conventional wisdom at the world bank that these efforts are an essential part of making aid effective in the long term this spring the bank adopted formal procedures to advance this goal in its projects the question at the bank isnt an either or fight poverty or fight corruption but one of how to pursue and integrate the goals and which to emphasize most the stakes are high and the bitterness of the struggle over mr wolfowitzs tenure has made them higher thats because traditionally the u s the main outside donor to the world bank picks its chief under a deal that lets europeans choose the head of its sister institution the international monetary fund because of the rancor of the wolfowitz fight the white house could now be forced if he steps down to put forward not just one name but a list from which bank members can pick the u s might even be obliged to propose a candidate from elsewhere such as a region of the world where the bank is most active opening the presidency to the developing world could result in shifting its focus away from improving governance and pushing free market economics what some view as rich country priorities and more toward what poorer countries care most about antipoverty projects however some countries in africa where corruption is rampant like nigeria have applauded the current antigraft focus a slimmer possibility a bank president from europe might also affect priorities european officials have been among the most vocal in criticizing mr wolfowitzs aggressive approach of rewarding countries that are less corrupt and punishing those that are more so even if this means withholding aid that would benefit poor local populations the ferment comes at a time when the core missions of the bank and imf are in question since the s some developing countries like brazil mexico south korea and china have enjoyed huge inflows of private capital seeking to invest in emerging markets these nations discovered they could often borrow on global markets to pump up their budgets or build power plants without having to jump through the economic policy hoops demanded by the bank and other multilateral lenders like the imf while annual world bank outflows have remained fairly steady for years at around &# billion private net capital flows to the developing world have exploded reaching nearly &# billion in from about &# billion in according to world bank figures nonetheless the institutions continuing importance was demonstrated in the late s when private investors suddenly got spooked and took their money home from emerging nations the world bank and other institutions helped cobble together tens of billions of dollars in rescue loans for countries from thailand to uruguay moreover the world bank invests in projects that arent attractive to most private investors such as schools and in countries where they tend to show little interest such as the central african republic the banks future approach will hinge in part on what happens this week as its board completes discussions over whether mr wolfowitz should remain as leader of the nation institution he is currently scheduled to go before the member board tomorrow and some officials say there is significant support among board members to seek his resignation a report by a board committee concluded last week that mr wolfowitz breached bank rules when he dictated the specific terms of a pay and promotion package for his companion bank employee shaha riza as she transferred over to the state department the reports conclusion is based in part on testimony from the banks senior human resources official who dealt closely with mr wolfowitz on the riza matter and kept detailed records of conversations with mr wolfowitz said bank officials familiar with the contents of the document mr wolfowitz has said his actions have been above board noting that he disclosed the relationship early and proposed to recuse himself from personnel matters dealing with ms riza that arrangement was later set aside in favor of the plan to detail ms riza to work at state mr wolfowitz has argued the boards ethics committee had agreed that her transfer should include a raise and promotion since she would lose out on promotion opportunities at the bank and that he acted appropriately in determining the terms of her compensation package the draft of the critical report has been closely held for more than a week but is expected to be circulated to the full board today raising the stakes in closed door debates within the board over mr wolfowitzs future with the board debating how to discipline mr wolfowitz the bush administration is expected to ramp up its defense of the banks president that will raise pressure on board members to back away from a confrontation with the u s a key concern is that mr wolfowitzs own ethical issues damage the banks credibility and thus undercut its main mission of reducing poverty bank officials encountered such skepticism several weeks ago when they raised the corruption issue while discussing potential projects with turkish finance officials "who are you to speak " came the turkish response says a world bank official "your house isnt in order " even many who are critical of mr wolfowitzs leadership concede the debate he provoked on corruption issues has improved the banks internal vigilance "wolfowitz was right to talk about this issue " says manish bapna who heads the bank information center a watchdog group in washington "where he went wrong was in elevating anticorruption almost to poverty as an overall mission of the bank " the bank is now incorporating antigraft efforts into its projects by seeking to build up checks and balances systems that can improve accountability in tanzania more than of the banks &# billion of ongoing work goes to government accountability projects one of the biggest costing &# million over five years seeks to train lawyers and accountants bulk up outside watchdog groups and bolster the countrys fiscal controls "if may be hard to see now but the net effect of all this turmoil will be positive " maintains edwin truman a former treasury official who is now an economist at the peterson institute think tank "whoever follows wolfowitz will have no choice but to keep this anticorruption drive going " mr wolfowitz inherited the drive from his predecessor james wolfensohn who in denounced what he called the "cancer of corruption " top world bank officials had long avoided pointing fingers at the bribery and graft that plagued many countries where the bank worked arguing that the bank should stay out of politics mr wolfensohn put in place a system of indexes for measuring both malfeasance and actual progress in bank projects he also formed a unit to investigate misdeeds within the bank itself and its development work it was mr wolfowitz a former deputy defense secretary and ambassador to indonesia who took the effort and ran with it on one of his first days on the job he used a board debate on a routine grant to cambodia to voice his concern about possible corruption in the case though without taking specific action his goal was to send a signal of the importance he put on the issue the idea that accountability was central to turning around poor countries had already taken hold in other development agencies donors including britains department for international development and the bush administrations millennium challenge corp were making grants conditional on whether a country was sufficiently corruption free others were earmarking aid in a way that encouraged countries to push for reforms on their own supporters said that not only was too much aid devoured by graft but the only way to get lasting change and economic growth in poor nations was by establishing systems to root out corruption the promise of aid can provide a carrot for governments to take the necessary steps applying similar concepts to the world bank however was sure to stir controversy the bank is a consensus based organization that is overseen in part by its own numerous developing world borrowers its mission is global making it difficult to exclude problem borrowers mr wolfowitz arrived in june just as the internal investigation unit the department of institutional integrity was wrapping up a probe into the banks health projects in india the report alleged that these projects "were riddled with corruption " as one senior bank official put it with local politicians profiting when mr wolfowitz caught wind that summer that a number of proposals for new indian health project loans were heading to the board for approval he blocked them provoking an outcry among veteran bank managers the banks india country manager ended up resigning in protest undeterred he went on to cancel suspend or delay projects in a range of countries where he believed corruption to be a problem including bangladesh chad kenya uzbekistan and yemen those actions were a first step toward demanding that bank projects in those countries be cleaned up mr wolfowitz also beefed up the investigation departments budget putting an emphasis on ferreting out corruption among bank staff members a bank report issued early this year said the department fired or reprimanded staffers over the previous two years and barred companies and individuals from india to germany from doing business with the bank these moves added fuel to a long simmering debate at the board over whether the bank should single out corrupt countries and their officials or could cut off lending to targeted countries altogether one complaint was that stopping funding for such purposes as building roads and giving immunizations punished local people on the ground not just corrupt officials some bank staff and officials from member countries worried that mr wolfowitz had no consistent policy guiding the bank from case to case his clampdown in india provoked a wave of criticism there that mr wolfowitz was playing favorites with the countrys main rival pakistan by not focusing on its own corruption "it looked capricious which was one of the many problems " says joseph stiglitz a former world bank chief economist who has been highly critical of the corruption drive in april the banks development committee which is made up of finance and development ministers from major member countries and is the banks highest governing body demanded mr wolfowitz write a plan that put his corruption and governance initiative in the framework of larger bank policy this march after months of internal fights and revisions mr wolfowitz struck a compromise with senior bank managers and the board on how to proceed the document which marked a significant softening of mr wolfowitzs original approach lays out ways for the bank to remain engaged even in the most corrupt countries instead of cutting them off completely it suggests for example that the bank can ignore corrupt sectors in a country in favor of working with ministries or local governments that are more reliable it stresses the need to publicly shame and blackball companies found to be cheating the document also puts a heavy emphasis on investing in projects to strengthen government accountability within countries by focusing on areas such as procurement and auditing in kenya this new approach has already begun to take root in small but important ways in early mr wolfowitz ordered the bank not to approve &# million in loans to kenya amid evidence of rampant corruption in government contracting that resulted in the resignation of several ministers in november after an audit of bank work in kenya helped identify where the worst problems were the bank began to move ahead on a limited number of projects some involving traditional development of roads and schools but others of a much different variety one is a &# million project to modernize and automate much of the governments information technology this would make it possible for kenyans to use computers to access land records and renew drivers licenses among other tasks "the idea is to limit the face to face contact between bureaucrats and normal people to take away the opportunities for corruption " says colin bruce a guyana native who is the world bank country director in kenya in march the world bank office in kenya became the first country office to put forward its new development plan after the bank board had approved mr wolfowitzs new governance and anticorruption strategy the page plan for kenya shows how much the antigraft campaign has begun to seep into the banks on the ground work with proposals to work with more honest ministries in lieu of those with a reputation for corrupt practices the plan also calls for investments aimed at making the government more transparent and more accountable including a &# million loan to help modernize kenyas judiciary other projects would strengthen the local media and bulk up the oversight committees in the kenyan parliament the world bank has also waded in to tackle kenyas notoriously corrupt contracting and procurement system helping set up citizen complaint systems and enacting performance standards to measure such things as the thickness of the asphalt in a newly paved road of the &# million the bank expects to provide kenya through june about "very much involves governance projects " mr bruce says "we still do roads schools and health clinics " he says "but as we do the roads we are also very concentrated now on the governance issues involved in building roads this is now something that pervades everything we do "
