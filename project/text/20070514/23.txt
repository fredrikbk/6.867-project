business solutions the winning formula an intranet guru talks about what the best ones have in common if you thought a corporate intranet was just a place to log your expenses and read company press releases try talking to kara coyne ms coyne is director of research at nielsen norman group a technology consulting firm in fremont calif that runs an annual contest to find the best intranets in the world this years winners used their intranets to show job training videos let employees rate the usefulness of news articles and press releases and even post web greeting cards that colleagues could exchange to show their appreciation for one another ms coyne says that intranets have changed a great deal over the years but that they still have the same basic purpose to give employees a central place to find what they need at a time when the amount of digital information inside companies is exploding we talked to ms coyne about what makes intranets work or not the wall street journal why does an intranet matter ms coyne an intranet is a great vehicle to communicate information its one place where you can keep information updated employees know to go there its centralized current and correct in the old days there were so many places to go for information also its a great motivational tool were finding where managers or leaders on a team will put videos online or announcements employees really watch these things really read them and get motivated by them also the intranet is now a worker tool before it just used to be a place where people would post a pdf file and that was the intranet now those days are gone wsj what did an intranet look like years ago and how has it changed ms coyne oh boy ten years ago it was a pdf file of a human resources document even as recently as five years ago many of them were using portal programs and just taking out of the box design and putting it up there but the evolution is designers are getting really creative and really good so intranets have evolved into these great productivity tools wsj can you look through some of the intranets youve seen and tell us about the worst ones ms coyne its not frankensteinian but if you looked at it you wouldnt believe the clutter right now im looking at one where their logo is this red thing and every page has this rather hideous logo all over it the pages look like theyre bleeding its bordering on offensive some of these intranets dont have much content theyre just fluff lots of stock art i have one here with a lot of fake smiling people its like "its an intranet why dont you use some of your real employees " and often theres a lot of clutter wsj why do those issues come up ms coyne there are a lot of politics involved in designing an intranet someone will say im the head of this group or this particular promotion is extremely important and i want it on the home page what upper managers often dont understand is the more items that are there the less likely it is that users are going to see your item if you have too many choices youll end up tuning them all out whereas if people can take a more holistic view and sometimes back off say for instance "maybe my promotion isnt as important this week" thats when things are really going to pay off also when youve got a blank page youve got this leeway that allows you to come up with incredibly good designs or tremendously bad designs some of these designs are tremendously bad wsj how does material get onto the intranet ms coyne it varies quite a lot some intranets still have more of a policing and bottleneck strategy where the intranet team approves everything many intranets are doing something more groundbreaking with wikis online tools for collaborating on a single work basically what intranets are often doing now is creating these areas where anyone can provide content sometimes anyone provides content and it goes through an approval phase and an editing phase and then the content is posted another model is this wiki model where its open its like wikipedia an online encyclopedia thats compiled and edited collaboratively but its on the intranet wsj are there potential drawbacks to that approach ms coyne of course the drawbacks are it could be incorrect or people could go wild ive asked at least hundreds of people about this and the biggest issue is that something was incorrect it wasnt that somebody tried to put bad information out there usually it gets fixed relatively soon people are pretty socially responsible even in a web environment the way you can diffuse this happening is attaching an author name to anything added there since its going to say "kara coyne " im not going to add some bart simpson phrase to the wiki wsj whats the biggest challenge now ms coyne i think where many of the companies have evolved to is there are several different intranets out there and youre trying to consolidate them trying to merge together and still have some identity or intentionally remove identities is a real trick we see a lot of organizations in that situation wsj what should a worker be able to find in a corporate intranet ms coyne any application that youre using like software for filing expenses if its a decent application thats been around for a while i watch hundreds of people using web sites and intranets every year they say they cant find something but if they look harder the feature is actually there some of the things that people dont know about are basic human resources applications videos news archives wsj whats the most common difficulty people encounter in trying to use an intranet ms coyne dealing with the navigation is huge when designers design the intranet they try to pick words that make sense to them but everybody doesnt think the same way thats always surprising to me the other thing thats surprisingly bad on intranets is the search tool wsj why is that ms coyne i think one of the main reasons is that the way many intranets started is via several different siloed completely separate mini intranets then when somebody creates the search the search results are just piecemeal wsj what are some ways that people can easily improve their intranet ms coyne things have to change at least every day you should have new news items the biggest thing is making sure your content is interesting and updated what helps a lot is to structure it by category news about us internal news news about the industry you want to avoid clutter wsj what do you think corporate intranets will look like in years ms coyne what do i think theyll look like or what do i hope theyll look like i hope its going to be a version of what we see today but much cleaner much more beautiful and much more straightforward getting rid of all the headings and categories and boxes and branding what i think is going to happen is there are always new technologies coming out and as these technologies come out were going to see a lot of problems similar to what we see today wsj what are the coolest new features that have lately popped up on intranets ms coyne when we used to look at intranets a few years ago we rarely saw things like classified ads now we do when we ask people about the "killer app" on intranets its usually the phone book or the cafeteria menu now you can request a special meal or find out if your own little hockey team is having a game some intranets even have dating sites ms vara is a staff reporter in the wall street journals san francisco bureau she can be reached at vauhini vara wsj com
