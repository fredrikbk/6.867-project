concentration proves winner at hedge fund atticus beats a path that others follow risk in similar bets tim barakett is an old school hedge fund manager on a tear the year old mr barakett runs atticus capital lp a &# billion new york firm he makes big concentrated bets doesnt care how volatile his performance is and dismisses the notion of cashing in through an initial public offering like some other hedge funds are doing while some large funds have seen limp results after adopting more conservative styles atticus is racking up huge gains last year the firms flagship funds the &# billion atticus global fund and the &# billion atticus european fund each rose about after fees compared with gains of about for the standard &amp poors stock index so far this year atticus european co managed by david slager is up and mr baraketts atticus global is up about again beating the overall market both funds have annualized returns of about after fees since they were established in and respectively mr barakett is estimated to have personally pocketed almost &# million in his firm has grown by &# billion in just the past year with all but &# million of that growth coming from investment gains thanks to aggressive bets on everything from railroad and mining stocks to deutsche boerse ag and mastercard inc now the former harvard hockey star who once lost his front teeth in a game is starting to throw his weight around earlier this month atticus sent an angry letter to deutsche boerse the firms largest position saying that "we are furious with your recent agreement to acquire the international securities exchange holdings inc the transaction has negligible rationale " as much as of atticuss portfolio is in the german exchange last year atticus pressured management of phelps dodge corp to do a better job of using its cash and it even hired bankers to look for a buyer before it agreed to a buyout by freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc atticus was among a number of investment firms that were the subject of a inquiry by the german financial supervisory authority into potential collusive action in regard to the voting of shares of deutsche boerse the inquiry was dropped after the regulator determined it didnt have sufficient evidence to bring any charges mr barakett is at the forefront of a new group of hedge fund titans he started atticus named after atticus finch the crusading lawyer in the harper lee novel "to kill a mockingbird" with &# million in after playing a year of professional hockey in switzerland and doing stints at venture capital and hedge fund firms it took him six months to raise money for the fund but today investors are eager to get in mr barakett disputes the notion that atticus is riskier because it takes a small number of big positions but he acknowledges that "were not the type of fund that is ideal for an investor with just one fund in their portfolio " it helps that his investors have faith "they have a somewhat higher concentration than many others " acknowledges jim goodwin a new york investor in atticus since "but the real test is performance and tim and his team have been extraordinary " increasingly atticuss moves are aped by other hedge fund managers and that is raising questions about whether too many funds are investing in the same stocks the danger here is that if fast moving hedge funds or their own investors start bailing out of the positions they share with atticus mr baraketts firm will suffer in october for example the firm dropped its worst one month decline in part because so many hedge funds got nervous and sold stocks that atticus also owned mr barakett says he cant help it if others copy his investments he has taken steps to make it more difficult for rivals to track him such as making derivative trades that dont have to be reported he argues that when other hedge funds sell it can help atticus since it can buy more of the stocks at cheaper prices indeed by the end of atticus had regained all the losses sustained in that painful october other times he has found that he holds the same positions as chris hohn a friend from harvard business school who runs childrens investment fund management a london hedge fund both firms have held deutsche boerse euronext csx corp and link real estate investment trust mr barakett says that while he talks to mr hohn a few times a year they sometimes hold the same stocks only because they are attracted to companies with similar traits although they sometimes differ on the strategies those companies should follow atticus usually avoids technology retail and health care stocks figuring it is harder to get an edge in those areas it looks for companies that are dominant players in a market have little debt and are out of favor mr barakett then assigns analysts to dig deeply several years ago the firm put together a mine by mine model of copper around the world helping atticus anticipate a recent surge in copper prices most recently he has become a fan of railroad companies last summer as investors became nervous about these stocks as the economy slowed atticus started buying the firm was attracted to the updated infrastructure and pricing power of rail companies and their improving relative position compared with truckers atticus now has of its money in rail stocks such as union pacific corp and burlington northern santa fe corp according to securities filings the moves looked savvy when berkshire hathaway inc s warren buffett recently disclosed he was a buyer of rail stocks and shares moved higher "people enjoy talking to tim hes great at finessing information that maybe they wouldnt normally disclose" and using it for his investments says rick frisbie co founder of venture capital firm battery ventures who was mr baraketts boss from to investors say the year old mr slager also is a big reason for the firms recent success a british expatriate who moved to new york to work more closely with mr barakett mr slager wins high marks for identifying opportunities and rarely wavering even when his stock picks are down "weve built a great team " mr barakett says "but you have to give luck its due " while he no longer plays competitive sports mr barakett says the market is enough of a game "i was always obsessed with statistics mine and others and comparing myself to others " he says "i have a great outlet for that here" at atticus
