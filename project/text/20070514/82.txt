telecommunications inside job as businesses rely more on mobile devices wireless companies are improving their coverage building by building the lush forest view surrounding the bottom floor dining area of chick fil a inc headquarters is soothing but it comes with one aggravating drawback poor cellphone reception the corporate offices of the fast food chain rest atop a hill in atlanta with the lower levels built along the downward slope that low elevation makes it difficult for cellular signals to get through to the dining area and other parts of the building and thats a big problem for a company that provides nearly everyone on the premises with a cellphone for business purposes and expects them to always be reachable to fix the problem chick fil as information technology chief linda mcentire turned to the companys cellular provider verizon wireless which ended up footing the bill last year to install equipment providing coverage throughout the acre facility "when we first turned the system on i got flooded with all these calls from people who would tell me the service was working " ms mcentire says "people who had no coverage now have excellent coverage " the problem chick fil a had is a common one the increasing reliance on mobile devices for business highlights the growing need for offices to provide dependable wireless connections and call quality something that many are lacking the demand has put more pressure on wireless carriers to improve the overall coverage of their networks but its also forcing them to solve some problems building by building sometimes the carriers pay for the necessary equipment and installation in other cases the customer pays "in building cellular systems are becoming more important particularly as more and more wireless to wireless calls are now coming from inside the building " says mary chan president of the wireless business group for equipment maker alcatel lucent verizon wireless which is jointly owned by verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc and the other leading cellular service providers in the u s sprint nextel corp and at&amp t inc all have set up departments to handle the growing demand from businesses to improve their coverage "its a competitive environment for wireless operators and they want to keep their customers " says dan shay an analyst at abi research a technology market research company in oyster bay n y "ensuring there is coverage is a big driver for them " footing the bill for some projects is the price of holding on to big customers chick fil a is a big enough account for verizon wireless with roughly lines in the headquarters building alone counting cellphones and laptops with cellular connections to justify verizon wirelesss paying for the equipment a spokeswoman for verizon wireless declined to discuss how the company makes such judgments saying only that it analyzes such situations "on a case by case basis and every customer is different " verizon wireless also declined to reveal the cost of the chick fil a project as did the customer and the company that installed the system andrew corp of westchester ill an andrew corp spokesman says the cost of in building projects ranges widely from about cents per square foot to about &# per square foot depending in part on how big the location is and whether coverage needs to be boosted for one carrier or multiple carriers mr shay estimates the global market for in building wireless systems totaled &# billion last year he expects the market to triple to &# billion by most of the spending is divided roughly equally between north america the asian pacific region and europe jim erickson who heads up the in building systems group at at&amp ts cingular wireless arm says demand for the groups services has been growing about to annually in recent years and he says cellular coverage has become a top priority for companies moving into new buildings "its one of the first things to look at versus the last thing" before he says the equipment vendors rarely work directly with the end customers instead they work with the carrier for instance in the chick fil a deployment andrew corp did the installation but it worked with verizon wireless not directly with chick fil a there are cases however where equipment vendors will deal directly with the end customers particularly when multiple carriers are involved and at facilities such as hospitals where there is extensive use of wireless communications off the cellphone networks when rick mohnk chief information officer of healthalliance hospital inc based in worcester mass wanted to improve the hospitals coverage for not only cellphones but also pager emergency radio and wi fi wireless broadband frequencies he worked directly with privately held innerwireless inc of richardson texas the system innerwireless installed "could support virtually all the needs of our organization " mr mohnk says innerwireless is one of a raft of smaller companies that specialize in systems that work with multiple carriers and with wireless systems other than cellular deployments cost roughly &# to &# per square foot problems with in building cellular coverage are exacerbated by the growing amount of data being transmitted over the air in particular more corporate employees are using cellular cards in their laptops for wireless connections to the internet with a cellular card a laptop user can connect to the internet anywhere there is cellular coverage rather than having to find a spot thats within range of a wi fi antenna thats a big advantage so cellular cards are growing in popularity but data transmissions dont travel as far on a cellular network as phone calls or penetrate walls as well so that makes it even tougher for cellular networks to provide full coverage indoors and the heavy data traffic can even make a network less reliable for phone calls "theres the concern by operators that coverage in buildings will decrease" with the growth of data transmissions says mr shay the abi research analyst a typical system built to solve the coverage problem starts with one or more base stations from one of the big telecommunications equipment makers like alcatel lucent telefon ab l m ericsson or siemens ag the base stations connect to a communications land line the same line that provides high speed internet connections typically a high capacity digital subscriber line or t connection and then act as the source of signals that are beamed throughout the building to provide cellular coverage companies such as andrew corp powerwave technologies inc of santa ana calif mobileaccess networks inc of vienna va and dekolink wireless ltd of israel provide some additional equipment and work on the deployment at the site theyre the ones that run coaxial or fiber optic lines from the base stations throughout the building capping each line with a small antenna that sends and receives cellular signals but this method becomes less efficient as the building gets bigger since the signal weakens every time a line is split and an antenna is added for larger facilities the vendors doing the installation will provide repeaters small electronic devices that pick up and amplify signals from nearby base stations vendors can string together several repeaters and antennas for a system that effectively covers a large office building or a public space such as a subway station or airport even as the current equipment is being more widely deployed new technology is being developed to further augment cellular networks the most commonly touted option is a setup that combines the cellular network outside and a wi fi system indoors companies such as alcatel lucent and motorola inc are working on dual band phones and equipment that will seamlessly switch calls from one network to another meanwhile sprint expects to spend between &# billion and &# billion over the next two years on building a network based on wimax technology which is essentially wi fi with extended range some businesses may hesitate though at the expense of having to outfit their work force with a new line of phones another option on the horizon works with existing cellular networks and handsets manufacturers are developing and testing devices called picocells and femtocells essentially base stations that would be less expensive and are small enough to fit in small offices and homes the devices are expected to be competitive with wi fi systems on price telecommunications experts say the two methods will likely complement each other and the broader portfolio of in building systems
