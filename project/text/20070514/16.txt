as the fed holds steady stocks lose a lodestar even if wall street wanted to it couldnt fight the federal reserve right now what is there to bet against the u s central bank has held its key interest rate target steady at for nearly a year and as its policy statement last week demonstrated it isnt offering many hints about the economy by the time the feds rate committee meets next in late june its interest rate "pause" will be the longest in a decade because interest rate cuts lower the cost of borrowing they tend to spur consumption corporate profits and the stock market the fed tends to cut rates when it feels the economy needs a jump start but it raises them if there are signs of inflation which means the economy is overheating this week investors will hear comments from fed chairman ben bernanke who is due to speak about subprime mortgage lending at a conference in chicago many wall street pros expect he will hew to the widespread view that such loans to risky borrowers are unwinding steadily but arent producing a big ripple effect throughout the u s economy if those expectations come true it will be confirmation the fed is almost a nonfactor for the financial markets at the moment a rare phenomenon most investing pros welcome periods like these it means they and their clients hold more sway over the price of everything from stocks to commodities there is a downside though there arent many non fed catalysts on the horizon to give the markets clues about the economys state and wall streets own crystal ball has been imperfect lately especially regarding corporate profits analysts say that means the market should stay volatile in the weeks ahead facing a distinct risk of pulling back from recent highs "a market thats driven by economic data tends to be rocky " says jack a ablin chief investment officer for harris private bank "a market thats driven by earnings reports tends to be pretty strong but thats not what we have anymore " with more than of first quarter reports in hand for companies in the standard &amp poors stock index analysts expect that once the stragglers come in over the next few weeks the broad indexs aggregate earnings will show an rise that has been a welcome development for investors but the growth rate is also more than double what wall street was expecting coming into earnings season according to research firm thomson financial the rockiness mr ablin described during periods with few earnings reports and little fed action was on full display last week the feds meeting produced a relatively tame uptick in the market by contrast weak retail data on thursday produced a point drop in the dow jones industrial average followed by a big rebound friday that recouped most of the losses for the week the industrials rose points or to up on the year the s&amp p edged up point to up on the year the nasdaq composite index slipped or points to up on the year jim bianco president of bianco research is generally bullish on stocks especially in light of the recent spree of corporate deal making the merger activity has supported share prices for struggling companies that have been bought out or considered likely targets however he says the market in the months ahead will also be prone to misinterpreting economic data like last weeks retail sales reports trying to use them as indicators of the feds next move while such an approach might have worked well the last time the fed was on pause this long from early to early mr bianco believes it wont be as effective now because of the differences between mr bernanke and his predecessor alan greenspan mr bernanke is a bigger fan of "inflation targeting " or defining clear rates of inflation that should trigger fed rate moves most analysts believe the fed wont cut rates until the annual inflation rate falls below a level it has stayed above throughout the central banks latest pause "when people respond to other bits of data thinking those things tell them what the fed will do next theyre responding to how the old guy worked not the new guy " says mr bianco "its amazing that investors still havent adjusted to bernanke really " because of the risks of slower economic growth and lingering inflation mr ablin of harris private bank says he has been telling clients to buy defensive stocks in sectors like health care consumer staples and basic materials he has been avoiding riskier technology energy and consumer discretionary stocks mr ablin says fed policy makers may cut rates at the end of the year but he isnt counting on it "the most important thing for me is that they seem to have adequate elbow room " he says one of the biggest factors discouraging rate cuts is the strength of the labor market which is the tightest since the dot com bubble according wells fargo economist michael swanson economists point to the potential for inflation from such a large pool of workers with money to spend mr swanson says that danger clearly outpaces the risk from the housing markets slowdown and shakeout in subprime lending "im pretty sure the fed will always give good lip service that they dont want the housing market to collapse " says mr swanson "but i dont think it will be the driver of their policy changes "
