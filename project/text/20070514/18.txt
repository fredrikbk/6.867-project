behind alcoas bid for alcan a test of mettle alcoa inc s bold &# billion bid for canadian rival alcan inc may be alain beldas last chance to preserve his company and create a legacy before he retires mr belda alcoas year old chairman and chief executive has been under pressure from wall street because the companys stock has fallen from a peak of nearly &# a share in to trail behind that of other metal companies over the past six years despite alcoas recent buyback programs and upbeat aerospace guidance and earnings reports alcoa shares ended at &# friday on the new york stock exchange mr belda says the alcan bid is about synergies and the need to compete better against emerging aluminum powerhouses from russia and china "we are facing an increasingly competitive global aluminum industry " he said pointing to the emerging market competitors on a conference call with analysts and investors as the company launched the bid last monday "this proposal is based on its own merits and not in response to any approach to alcoa " he said in the call alcan says it is reviewing the offer and declines to comment on it at present but the lagging stock price has prompted talk that alcoa was and still is a target of larger mining companies which many believe is part of the reason mr belda is going after alcan "im thinking the management did this as a defensive move " says wayne atwell a former metals analyst at morgan stanley who is starting a hedge fund and betting that alcoa shares will decline "i think there is a chance someone will make a bid for alcoa before this is over " others believe the alcan deal if it goes through could be mr beldas effort to preserve alcoa as a standalone company and leave on a high and historic note although mr belda hasnt said anything publicly about retiring "im sure hed like to have it on the record that he accomplished this acquisition " says leo larkin a metals analyst with standard &amp poors "he would probably like to be the one to get the credit for this particular acquisition if it actually happens " some analysts believe there could be a bid for alcoa despite mr beldas move john tumazos a metals analyst at prudential equity group says alcoa is "in play " with a chance it successfully buys alcan a chance it stays by itself and a chance it is purchased by another company that sells off underperforming assets one activist hedge fund and minor alcoa shareholder jana partners llc called for alcoa to put itself up for sale jana says it purchased million shares in alcoa in the first quarter or of the companys outstanding shares the last few years should have been good times for alcoa and mr belda born in french morocco to a portuguese mother and spanish father mr belda joined alcoas brazilian affiliate in and moved up the ranks to head the brazil operations then as the hand picked protege of then ceo paul oneill he moved to corporate headquarters in pittsburgh in the mid s to become vice chairman president and chief operating officer he took the position of ceo in and then the further post of chairman when mr oneill left alcoa to become treasury secretary for president bush in in the years since aluminum prices reached record highs demand soared from china big aerospace companies were replacing their fleets and using aluminum to do so quarter after quarter the company boosted revenue and posted healthy earnings but wall street was unimpressed and thought the company was underperforming finally once patient investors defected u s global investors inc sold its holdings in the company in the past year "we have just had in our opinion better places to allocate our money nickel prices have gone ballistic in the last few years nickel stocks have done similarly well " says evan smith a co manager of the companys global resources fund from outside the company takeover rumors mounted with reports that larger cash rich mining companies such as rio tinto plc bhp billiton xstrata plc or others were looking for aluminum assets within alcoa there was upheaval in the management ranks in two chief financial officers left in succession and yet another was appointed in the past year eight executive board members left the company the company recently granted special retention stock awards valued at &# million to six top executives the awards vest after three years but are forfeited if the recipients voluntarily resign before then rumors began circulating in recent months that mr belda was about to be ousted however the company denies them "he has the full confidence of the board " says alcoa spokesman kevin lowery he further points out that the board has authorized the bid for alcan although ceos at alcoa often retire at age according to longtime industry analysts the company says its policies dont dictate such a retirement age according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission when mr belda was in negotiations with alcan for a friendly "merger of equals" last fall the companies had discussed that mr belda would be chairman of the combined firm until he retired and alcan ceo richard evans would become ceo of the combined firm alcan in december rejected the idea of merging stewart spector a retired aluminum industry analyst and minor shareholder in alcoa and alcan points out that there is no obvious successor to mr belda within alcoa but that hasnt stopped industry observers from speculating about a replacement when mr belda was talking with alcan executives about a merger he knew that if he could make that happen he could deliver on a promise made when he became chairman in to double the size of the company the question now is whether he can make it happen along with convincing shareholders he has to get antitrust approval and win over canadian and european regulatory officials to do so he has tapped a personal charm that sometimes seems better received in europe or montreal than by angry investors or wall street analysts in the u s last week when announcing the offer in montreal mr belda seamlessly switched between french and english mentioning that he had lived in montreal as a child the beauty of mr beldas bid for alcan some analysts say is that it has a silver lining even if it fails "it is probably a no lose situation for him " mr atwell says "either he gets taken out at a premium making shareholders happy or he upgrades his suite of assets it seems like a smart thing to do "
