can cbs put the net into network broadcaster launches plan syndicating shows on web admits old strategy failed a year ago cbs corp announced the creation of innertube an entertainment channel on cbs com designed to make the company a player in online video it streams video of sporting events news reports and reruns of shows such as the hit comedy "how i met your mother " cbss new chief internet strategist now jokes that the web address for innertube should be "cbs com nobodycomeshere " cbs after a year of experimenting with various web initiatives says that forcing consumers to come to one site its own to view video hasnt worked instead the company plans to pursue a drastically revised strategy that involves syndicating its entertainment news and sports video to as much of the web as possible it represents a stark departure for the tv industry most of cbss major competitors including walt disney co s abc general electric co s nbc universal and news corp s fox are to some degree all betting that they can build their own internet video portals starting this week an expanded menu of cbss video content will be available for free to consumers on as many as different web sites ranging from time warner inc s aol to joost inc a buzzy online video service that is just rolling out the company calls its new venture the cbs interactive audience network because cbs plans to sell the advertising that will appear on the digital network the launch is timed to coincide with the industrys high stakes "upfront" ad selling season which kicks off today it is the time of the year when the big networks unveil their fall schedules to advertisers and start negotiations to place some &# billion in ads for the television season which starts in september cbs chief executive leslie moonves plans in coming days to announce a flurry of other deals aimed at giving consumers new ways to use cbs content online for instance cbs is working on agreements with social networking sites such as facebook inc and last fm ltd to allow users to post cbs video clips to their profiles according to people familiar with the matter a deal is also imminent with slide inc which allows users of social networks such as myspace to personalize photos and video for their pages all the big networks will aggressively shop advertising space on their sites to media buyers this week but most of the networks are pursuing a homegrown approach to internet video abc for instance has focused on streaming all of its prime time programming through its own abc com player nbc universal and fox in march said they are creating a new internet video portal to compete with google inc s popular video sharing site youtube in addition to launching the new portal which the two companies plan to support with a &# million marketing campaign the venture will syndicate the content to big web sites those sites include aol microsoft corp s msn tv com news corp s myspace and yahoo inc in contrast cbs has abandoned attempts to build its own blockbuster portal and is instead signing pacts with a raft of smaller and often untested web companies from joost to veoh networks inc a video sharing service unlike other big media companies cbss holdings in cable networks are limited which gives it more freedom to distribute its content widely over the internet without hurting a cable revenue stream cbs is essentially placing bets on which video sites will matter in the coming months and years both in the u s and around the world with any luck the smaller sites will grow in popularity boosting the exposure of cbs shows and lifting the networks haul of online ad dollars cbs will give advertisers the freedom to tweak their ads to fit the different sites the internal code name for cbss new strategy "rolling thunder " "we cant expect consumers to come to us " says quincy smith the president of cbs interactive "its arrogant for any media company to assume that " cbs faces a particularly difficult challenge luring its viewers to the web the network home to franchises such as "csi crime scene investigation" and " minutes " attracts an older average viewer than abc nbc or fox as a result media buyers and analysts say cbss audience is less web savvy and the company has a harder time funneling viewers to its web site with on air promos the likes of yahoo and msn see the networks as trying to leverage their relationships with tv ad buyers to siphon off online ad dollars so while the web companies want to offer their users access to portions of studio movies and tv hits which explains why they are signing deals with all the networks they argue that they should be selling the advertising that accompanies it the company that sells the ads gets to keep the lions share of the revenue in cbss case it gets while the web partners get a cut joanne bradford chief media officer of msn says advertisers would be served better by buying online ads directly from web sites rather than buying internet packages offered alongside their upfront tv deals with the networks "im a little irritated that the networks have put together a digital package that lets a marketer check a box and isnt as robust or deep " she said at a conference last week for advertisers in seattle advertisers will ultimately decide if cbss new strategy is the right one so far media buyers are positive about the move although they note that cbs has had troubles implementing some heavily promoted digital efforts in the past cbs has already signed up major advertisers for its digital network such as procter &amp gamble co general motors co and at&amp t corp s cingular wireless "im really impressed especially regarding the ability for us to make one buy but tailor the ad message differently to each of the sites " says tracey scheppach corporate vice president and video innovations director at publicis groupes starcom usa kevin j delaney contributed to this article
