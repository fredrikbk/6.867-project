can copper rich chile avoid surplus cash pitfalls santiago chile with copper prices soaring chile is flush with cash that may not sound like a problem but for a commodity rich country it can be a big one resource wealth has brought unstable nations in the middle east and africa to their knees by spawning war or corruption even wealthy nations have a tough time handling commodity booms which can drive up their currencies batter their exporters and produce unsustainable surges in imports in a case much studied by economists the dutch economy stagnated after rich natural gas deposits were discovered offshore in the s these days venezuela and other oil producers riding oil backed consumption booms are vulnerable to "dutch disease " especially if oil prices decline chile is trying to inoculate itself in essence the government is saving what it calculates as windfall profits from its state owned copper company and windfall taxes from privately owned mines it is investing the money abroad in bonds and is also considering buying foreign stock funds the idea is that when chiles economy inevitably falters the government can tap this "economic and social stabilization fund" for revenue "the question that plagues latin america and other emerging markets is how do you avoid the booms and busts from commodity cycles " says chiles finance minister andres velasco "in chile we have a simple answer spend that which is permanent and save that which is transitory " so far chile has set aside about &# billion for the stabilization fund and expects to add another &# billion or so by the end of the year the sum would be equivalent to about of the countrys gross domestic product the total value of goods and services it produces in a year thats an enormous political accomplishment try to imagine the u s government putting aside &# trillion about of the u s economys annual output in a rainy day fund invested in foreign stocks and bonds that would be nearly impossible given congressional pressures to increase spending or cut taxes in oil rich norway started a stabilization fund which now has a portfolio of around &# billion a startling sum for a nation of million chile copied norways approach but its fund didnt begin to pile up assets until the past few years as the price of copper soared to more than &# a pound triple its level banking part of that windfall requires far greater sacrifice by chile where the per capita income in was &# about one seventh of norways although chile is considered a success story by latin american standards its economy has grown an average of a year since it has pressing domestic problems including a wide gap between rich and poor a substandard educational system and inadequate ports roads and airports setting aside so much money "is a crime " says chilean sen fernando flores who was once finance minister in the marxist government of salvador allende and later made a fortune as a software entrepreneur in california "we need a model of investment and education to create new industries " but chilean economic officials say it is critical to limit the effect of the copper boom so the country doesnt become too dependent on riches that can vanish quickly resulting in budget shortfalls the government aims for a budget surplus of about annually and calculates its projected revenue using an estimate of the average price of copper over the coming decade when coppers price exceeds the long term estimate as it has in the past few years the government runs up much more than a surplus and routes the excess into the stabilization fund where it is invested overseas one goal of the strict fiscal policy is to reduce the appreciation of chiles currency the peso which over the decades has tended to rise in tandem with copper prices a stronger peso increases the export price of chilean wine wood products fruits and vegetables and makes them less competitive internationally the finance ministry says its stabilization policies have been a success after accounting for inflation the peso is now trading internationally at around its average for the past years even so some of chiles exporters are less than impressed since mid the peso has appreciated by nearly compared with the dollar after accounting for inflation "with the peso at the level we have a lot of export companies have low margins " says recaredo ossa managing directory of vina veramonte sa a big winery in casablanca chile a finance ministry official counters that the exchange rate would have gone through the roof without the stabilization policy generally though public backing for the stabilization fund remains solid the political left is largely quiescent because the government is increasing spending by about this year adjusted for inflation apart from the money it is setting aside for the fund spending on infrastructure health housing and education is rising at even a faster clip for the political right the government a coalition of centrists and leftist parties has offered business tax cuts aimed at spurring innovation "if we spend all the money in consumption nothing will be left " says alvaro saieh chairman of corp group a chilean bank holding company "the capital is being saved " the government also is starting a second fund tied to the copper boom this "innovation fund" comes from a tax on mining thats expected to raise more than &# million annually the funds details are still being worked out in the chilean congress but the goal is to finance ventures that would diversify the chilean economy away from commodities into technology and services harvard university economist ricardo hausmann who consults with the chilean government says that chile resembles california in terms of wine and agriculture "but its a california without hollywood and without silicon valley " in the cautious chilean fashion the innovation fund is meant to bolster chiles long term prospects not produce quick gains "we want a higher trend rate of growth " says mr velasco the finance minister "but we dont want the economy to oscillate with the price of copper "
