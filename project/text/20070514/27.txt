buyout firm close to winning chrysler bidding deal would rid daimler of billions in liabilities shift control to cerberus daimlerchrysler ag is expected to announce as early as today a deal to sell a controlling stake in chrysler group detroits no auto maker to private equity firm cerberus capital management lp according to people familiar with the matter the proposed deal would allow the german auto giant to shed chryslers &# billion in retirement and health care liabilities and could open the door to further restructuring of the nations unionized auto makers a private equity takeover of chrysler would mark a watershed for the industry which is struggling under the weight of massive pension and health care obligations to its union workers those debts and the cash required to fund them have hobbled general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler in the face of relentless competition from asian and european rivals chrysler has estimated that japanese auto makers like toyota motor corp enjoy a labor cost advantage of as much as &# an hour cerberus has a record of slashing costs at operations it acquires and some analysts say a cerberus owned chrysler could move much more aggressively to cut labor costs prune chryslers crowded dealer network in the u s and shift investment to developing markets overseas but any final deal for chrysler also hinges on what happens this summer when the united auto workers kicks off negotiations for new master contracts with all three detroit auto companies the proposed deal calls for forming a new company to assume chryslers pension and health care liabilities in which daimler would hold a minority stake cerberus also would make a payment to daimlerchrysler according to people familiar with the matter the size of the payment couldnt be learned but it is likely to fall far short of the &# billion the former daimler benz ag paid for chrysler corp in negotiations were at an advanced but fluid stage yesterday with terms subject to change conference rooms at new york law firm shearman &amp sterling which represents daimler were abuzz with executives lawyers and bankers filing between meetings said a person familiar with the matter under the proposed deal chrysler chief executive tom lasorda would continue to run the company people familiar with the talks said cerberus adviser wolfgang bernhard a former chrysler chief operating officer wouldnt have an executive role but could have a board seat they said the plan amounts to a massive bet by cerberus that chrysler can be turned around private equity buyers typically acquire public companies or parts of them and take them private seeking to refurbish them outside the public spotlight in hopes of selling them later at a profit in many private equity deals the buyer borrows against the companys assets or makes other financing deals to help ensure an acquisition pays off however chryslers massive liabilities mean that cerberus is planning to inject some of its own capital into the auto maker to keep it running while it restructures operations a sale to cerberus could face opposition from chryslers unions which have said they oppose a private equity takeover the uaw in particular has a contentious relationship with cerberus last month the union which represents about of chryslers workers as well as many in the auto parts industry refused cerberuss demands for wage and benefit cuts for new hires at parts supplier delphi corp that makes it likely that cerberus will pull out of an investor group that agreed to buy delphi out of bankruptcy protection other parties bidding for chrysler are canadian auto parts maker magna international inc and a team made up of the blackstone group and centerbridge capital partners the groups recently submitted a second round of bids to daimlerchrysler billionaire kirk kerkorian who publicly offered &# billion for chrysler was frozen out of the talks the proposed sale to cerberus if it goes through would mark the end of daimlerchryslers turbulent nine year effort to make a success of an ambitious global expansion strategy pushed by former chairman and chief executive officer jurgen schrempp mr schrempp rocked the auto industry in with his deal to buy chrysler which at the time was at a high point in its profit and product cycle billed at the time as a "merger of equals " the deal never delivered the synergies that mr schrempp and his successor dieter zetsche argued it could instead chryslers performance seesawed from losses to profits to most recently losses again for chrysler group had a loss of &# million on revenue of &# billion mr zetsche who led a chrysler turnaround effort from until shortly before he became the parent companys ceo in at first resisted calls to sell chrysler after the u s unit stumbled back into the red last year but shares of daimlerchrysler surged after he acknowledged in february that it was considering selling chrysler cerberus was viewed as a strong contender to buy the company because of its deep pockets and the potential synergies to be had by marrying chryslers chrysler financial arm with cerberuss stake in gmac gms former financing arm cerberus could slash costs by consolidating chrysler financial and gmac analysts say cerberus has invested in various auto parts makers including germanys peguform which manufactures interior and exterior plastic parts earlier this year cerberus strengthened its hand further when it hired mr bernhard the former chrysler operating chief as an adviser mr bernhard is highly regarded by his former chrysler colleagues chrysler would be an especially high profile acquisition for cerberus a firm that actively eschews publicity until about a year ago the firm didnt have a web site even now the site is glaringly sparse it doesnt identify any top executives and gives only an word description of the firms business activities behind the scenes the firm is guided by stephen feinberg a former princeton university tennis champion and paratrooper who is an avid deer hunter mr feinberg is known for his self effacing style but he is a tough deal maker in the s and earlier this decade his new york based firm made its name by buying distressed debt around the globe and foreclosing or settling it at a profit using hard nosed business tactics then cerberus slowly moved into buying whole companies in countries like germany and japan that were struggling with high costs or bloated work forces after acquiring these companies it swiftly slashed costs laid off workers and closed factories shifting production to lower cost spots in asia though many industries in the u s and europe are making similar moves buyers like cerberus typically make profits by drastically speeding up the process over the past couple of months chrysler officials have been asked by potential buyers like cerberus for details and potential strategies for the coming uaw talks one person familiar with the talks said they expected the groups vying for chrysler would seek a provision tying an acquisition to certain concessions by the uaw the key to the deal will be what happens to chryslers &# billion in pension and health care liabilities the uaw and detroit auto makers like gm have been studying a recent deal at goodyear tire &amp rubber co in which the united steelworkers union agreed to let goodyear shift &# billion in future health care liabilities to a fund managed by the union in return goodyear contributed &# billion in cash and goodyear stock to the fund getting a goodyear like deal from the uaw in this years talks would be especially important at chrysler because it could mean that neither daimlerchrysler nor the purchaser of chrysler would have the multibillion dollar liability on its books given the auto industrys history of pattern bargaining whatever arrangement the uaw reaches with chrysler other auto makers will likely demand similar terms that could have major consequences for the union sean mcalinden chief economist and vice president for the center for automotive research in ann arbor mich said he expects union contract negotiations this summer to be long and arduous "if the union gave something to chrysler gm and ford would demand it immediately so this is not just about chrysler " mr mcalinden said if uaw president ron gettelfinger refuses to give in on concessions as he did last year with chrysler any agreement with a buyer could fall through but that could put thousands more union jobs at risk because it would leave chrysler little choice but to cut its work force deeply with a private equity owner chrysler would likely continue to expand its assembly plant capacity outside north america putting more pressure on the uaw and the canadian auto workers union people familiar with the matter said chryslers new owners would inherit a recent agreement by daimlerchrysler to build small chrysler cars in china with chery automobile co another issue is that chrysler like its detroit rivals has too many dealers a new owner would likely take more drastic action to weed out some of chryslers dealers with some proposals calling for a reduction in the dealer network according to people familiar with the matter because of franchise laws auto makers cant force dealers to close and buying them out is costly gm spent &# billion to eliminate dealers to get rid of its oldsmobile brand
