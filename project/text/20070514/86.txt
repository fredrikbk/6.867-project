business day sign up for the e mail here daimlerchrysler this morning announced it had finally concluded a search for "the future concept for the chrysler group " in what amounts to a sale of the u s car maker to the private equity group cerberus capital management but that "concept" is one that opens an entirely new era for detroit and will be closely studied for how it resolves the deep problems rooted in the car industrys past if approved by regulators and daimlerchryslers supervisory board the deal would see the creation of a new entity that gets all the chrysler dodge jeep and finance operations of what we know as chrysler cerberus will put up &# billion and get of the new company with daimlerchrysler holding on to the rest and &# billion of cerberuss money will go to the german parent now bereft of the u s unit that once gave it such high globalizing hopes as the detroit news notes in daimler benz had hoped to revolutionize the industry by combining its luxury vehicles with chryslers mass market products "and pave the way for more international alliances " instead the combined daimlerchrysler "was never able to hit on all cylinders " especially with chryslers profit and loss roller coaster contributing to its diminishing share of the u s market but chrysler is part of a much bigger detroit story and a key quote in daimlerchryslers statement today was the following "the chrysler groups financial obligations for pension and healthcare benefits towards its employees and the employees of the financial services business related to the chrysler group will be retained by the chrysler companies " another key quote was released on behalf of ron gettelfinger president of the united autoworkers union "the transaction with cerberus is in the best interest of our membership the chrysler group and daimler " until today the uaw and organized labor in general have been vocally opposed to the notion of private equity firms getting involved in the auto business and specifically the idea of one buying chrysler as the detroit free press reports like crosstown rivals general motors and ford motor chrysler has troubles on two fronts a growing share of buyers are more attracted to the offerings of toyota motor and other japanese car makers and the more intractable problem the long roster of retired auto workers whose pension and health care costs cant be perpetually offset by the paycheck contributions of whats now a much smaller work force daimlerchrysler today took pains to say that chryslers pension plans are "significantly over funded at present " but as the los angles times points out chrysler "is saddled with more than &# billion in unfunded retiree health care obligations " it will be interesting to watch how mr gettelfingers assurances are reconciled with cerberuss understandable aim of getting more than its moneys worth from chrysler "chrysler has estimated that japanese auto makers like toyota motor corp enjoy a labor cost advantage of as much as &# an hour " the wall street journal notes and "cerberus has a record of slashing costs at operations it acquires " some observers expect that under cerberus control chrysler which already plans to cut jobs or of its work force will move even more aggressively to cut labor costs "but any final deal for chrysler also hinges on what happens this summer when the united auto workers kicks off negotiations for new master contracts with all three detroit auto companies " the journal adds cerberus is betting its reputation that it can turn chryslers profitability around and thats a risky bet the financial times says but as the new york times notes cerberus chaired by former treasury secretary and csx chief john snow has a staff with deep experience running american industry and it seems to have been gunning for control of a major auto company for some time the deal announced today may be the beginning of the end for daimlerchrysler in detroit but the story of change there is far from over three people with direct knowledge of the talks tell bloomberg that members of fords founding family are discussing the sale of part of their controlling stake in that money losing auto maker violence worsens musharrafs standoff pakistans political opposition is leading a general strike today thats being observed in the financial capital of karachi and other large cities following violence over the weekend that at times resembled urban warfare the clashes yesterday in karachi marked a significant escalation of the crisis set off by president pervez musharrafs decision to oust pakistans chief justice on march critics immediately labeled that move an attempt to derail judicial challenges to gen musharrafs rule and a protest movement initially led by striking lawyers has reached the point where its threatening his government last night hundreds of paramilitary troops were authorized to open fire on karachis streets in a bid to end fighting between government and opposition supporters that left more than people dead and hundreds wounded the times of london reports "the dead included a policeman who was set upon and tortured before being shot at close range " the paper says "police used teargas to disperse protesters as vehicles and shops were set on fire " the government itself is being accused of doing little to stop the violence the english language karachi newspaper dawn a critic of the government said the fighting continues today amid a commercially paralyzed city and that "fears of a recurrence of riots suffered by the city in the mid s and mid s forced residents to remain indoors " pakistani analysts tell the new york times the violence has further weakened mr musharraf "i think he has completely ruined himself " rasul baksh rais the head of the department of social sciences at lahore university of management sciences tells the times "the scenes were brutally contrasting young men were dying collapsing before cameras in karachi while people were dancing on the beat of drums in front of the national parliament " a top taliban militant killed in afghanistan u s led troops and afghan forces yesterday tracked down and killed mullah dadullah the most prominent military commander of the taliban and one who promoted himself as the public face of a resurgent islamist militia bent on returning afghanistan to its pre rule mr dadullahs death was reported several times in the past and yesterday authorities displayed his body to reporters on a pink sheet "a bullet hole was visible in the back of his head with two more piercings in his stomach " the washington post reports officials hailed his death "as a critical victory in the fight against the taliban at a time when the extremist islamic movement has destabilized large portions of the country through dadullahs uncompromising approach to warfare " the post adds a newsweek report on mr dadullah last summer noted the one legged guerrilla commander in southern afghanistan seemed to be trying to match or exceed the reputation of the late iraqi al qaeda leader abu mussab al zarqawi with the sheer viciousness of his taliban internet videos "the most revolting footage shows a gang of dadullahs thugs slitting the throats one by one of six afghans they accuse of spying for the americans " the magazine reported mr dadullah was thought to be spearheading the taliban offensive last year with young recruits who seemed only too eager to join him newsweek said adding that "sooner or later dadullah may just push his luck too far on the battlefield but even then someone somewhere will almost surely pick up his mantle " a bigger payday for an armored vehicle a senior u s army official tells the wall street journal it seems increasingly likely that just one or two companies will profit from a decision to change the multibillion dollar competition to make heavily armored vehicles a winner take all event demand in iraq and afghanistan is soaring for the mine resistant ambush protected vehicles which in theory will withstand blasts from roadside bombs better than the armored humvees currently carrying american troops until recently the army and marines planned to buy some of the vehicles but the persistent death toll from such bombs in iraq has prompted u s central command to say that it now needs as many as vehicles nine companies were chosen to build four test vehicles for a bidding process that was expected to produce multiple winners but "now that the pentagon is planning on buying many more of the vehicles army officials say they would like to see one primary design " the journal says "the shift if made would make it more likely that one or two companies would grab the lions share of a much bigger payday " u s military to block youtube myspace the u s defense department plans to start blocking "world wide access" to youtube mtv com myspace and other photo and video sharing web sites saying the significant increase in visits to these sites by military personnel ties up official dod bandwidth and poses "a significant operational security challenge " according to a memo from gen b b bell the commander of american forces in south korea while the memo notes the sites in question are used by service members to share information with their friends and families at home it says the "recreational traffic" is having an impact on the dod network soldiers marines sailors and airmen can still access the sites from home computers but the associated press points out that dod computers and networks "are the only ones available to many soldiers and sailors in iraq and afghanistan " and while the army recently began posting videos on youtube that depict american troops defeating iraqi insurgents and befriending iraqi civilians the new rules mean many military personnel wont be able to watch them also of note associated press in securing a landmark pipeline deal in central asia a pipeline along the caspian
