i didnt attack wolfowitz nor am i succeeding him your may editorial "axis of soros" rests on false premises i did not attack paul wolfowitz when as a result of a longstanding invitation i spoke at the world bank indeed i spoke of my friendship with him but said the situation had to be resolved contrary to your claim i am not a candidate to succeed him you seek to undermine my record as a leading u n reformer by distorting the truth for example you pretend that when i said u n overbudgeting in a peacekeeping operation did not lead to the loss of funds that i was talking about procurement practices overall i set up a task force to investigate procurement fraud you take a comment i made on an interim paul volcker report as relating to his final finding you even imply that there is something amiss in renting a house at market rate from george soros you even get the title of my current job wrong but you got one thing right i am a friend of george soross and proud of it let me conclude on a lighter note to say that i am amused by the debate over what would happen if rupert murdoch bought the wall street journal while i admire your news pages he as good as owns your editorial pages already sir mark malloch brown new york
