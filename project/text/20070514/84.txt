the daily fix with limited improvisation jazz prevail over warriors online edition the stylistic contrasts between the utah jazz and the golden state warriors hadnt been so clear cut early in their second round nba playoff series but last night utah lived up to its billing as a controlled disciplined team dealing golden state its first home playoff loss to go up in the best of seven series the warriors stayed true to form improvising and letting fire from long range didnt work though salt lake tribune columnist gordon monson admired utahs winning formula even if it lacks the free expression of golden states approach "on offense they screen and cut and roll and move the ball until it gets to the appropriate spot " mr monson writes "sunday night that spot was deep in the paint from where the jazz smoothed their inside out game scoring a whopping points down low they swung their picks in the salt mine they do what theyre told and they usually win doing exactly that thats the payoff and the jazz happily know as much " the jazz have been told what to do by the same coach for nearly two decades jerry sloan "sloans so old school he ought to be covered in ivy " j a adande writes in the los angeles times "hes the longest tenured coach in pro sports with consecutive seasons on the job and hes the only head coach who still eats his pregame meals in the media dining room " several columnists are ready to serve up the warriors for mr sloans next pregame meal the jazz can finish off the series tuesday in salt lake city where theyve lost just times in games this regular season and postseason the warriors "acknowledged their fatigue their lack of bulk their inability to withstand utahs grinding physically grueling attack " ailene voisin writes in the sacramento bee "they know theyre too small too slight they suspect their season is almost over " ms voisin is already looking ahead to next season when by her prescription the warriors will need a big man to compete with the likes of utahs carlos boozer but san francisco chronicle columnist scott ostler urges warriors fans to hang on "if youre sticking around to see how this thing ends what you should know is that this is a situation made for the warriors " mr ostler writes "the wild dogs are underdogs to the bone and a task like needing to win three in a row two of the games in utah doesnt bother them " the warriors could do a better job of showing it last night out of frustration they dealt cheap shots to mehmet okur and derek fisher the feel good story of the series "listen warriors america wants to make you its team its plucky underdog worth watching after midnight on the east coast " si coms kelly dwyer writes "dont keep ruining this goodwill with the sort of chippiness and petulance weve seen following the losses to dallas in the first round and the home loss sunday " in the other series out west phoenix will look to even things at against san antonio tonight in the east the new jersey nets will look to do the same against the cleveland cavaliers cleveland plain dealer columnist bill livingston was disappointed that lebron james didnt shoot more nor assert himself more from the inside against the nets in game a nets win "he has too many ways to dominate a game to lapse into the passive role of a jump shooting setup man " mr livingston writes "james has the brute strength of a power forward the central offensive role of a small forward the quicks of a shooting guard and the ball handling ability of a point guard he ought to be too big for the quick ones to defend and too quick for the big ones " in the east finals the cavs nets winner will play the detroit pistons unless the chicago bulls can build off yesterdays win and win three straight including two in detroit chicagos first win in the series didnt satisfy columnists from either city "the bulls played hard for the first time this series and didnt back down for the first time this series " rick morrissey writes in the chicago tribune "it was good to see but frustrating to see its too late " mitch albom was disappointed the pistons didnt finish off the bulls in chicago "this series should have ended sunday in a tepid united center that was almost half empty at tip off " mr albom writes in the detroit free press "there was as much enthusiasm for this game as a teenager has for raking leaves " two playoff games two losses for detroit on sunday the red wings fell in overtime to the anaheim ducks brothers rob and scott niedermayer combined for three points and teamed up for the game winning score "the niedermayer brothers are close " michael farber writes on si com "they live within minutes of each other they carpool to the rink most days they have different personalities scott is uber serious while rob has a more conspicuous lighter side but they are single minded about hockey scott is a duck in large part because rob already was a duck " "the ducks owed this one to the niedermayers obviously but they also owed it to gadgetry and slow mo and stop action and all the stuff that we take for granted on the sofa " mark whicker writes in the orange county register "if game of the western conference finals is played in and not in detroit beats the ducks and not just because scott niedermayer would have been only " anaheim was awarded two goals correctly thanks to replay review "in every sport replay has been resisted then accepted then deemed essential " mr whicker writes "a sport as nebulous as hockey demands it " the kansas city royals began the season by beating the boston red sox since then the red sox have gone while the royals have gone that means its time for joe posnanskis annual kansas city star column declaring the end of the royals season which has often come in may this past decade an average sub inning percentage in both april and may will do that to a team meanwhile the bosox extended their division lead to eight games with a stirring six run rally begun with one out in the bottom of the ninth to beat the baltimore orioles many fans had left fenway park by then earning a verbal lashing from the boston globes bob ryan "dont these people know that baseball is the no clock game " carl is somewhat sympathetic as on his lone trip to fenway he saw many fans streaming out of a bizarre intriguing and interminable yankees red sox game when the scoreboard flashed that the last t was leaving the nearby station in minutes the t is not a no clock transportation system call him a new york snob but such a message wouldnt be seen at shea before a thinned crowd the red sox mounted a rally in the ninth inning that day that fell short and if mr posnanski wrote for the globe he could have written his end of season column the next day phil mickelson won the players championship with his new brand of calm collected golf the toronto stars dave perkins attributes the change to mr mickelsons new alliance with teacher butch harmon who used to work with mickelson rival tiger woods on golf com gary van sickle defends year old sean ohair who was chasing mr mickelson aggressively on sunday but finished in th place after twice landing his ball in the lake on the th hole "it didnt happen because he choked or was nervous or feeling the pressure " mr van sickle writes "it happened because he went for broke and simply misread the wind direction " mothers day may be a contrived holiday but its worth having one day a year to honor women like joanie ryan and emma culpepper both of whom showered extraordinary doses of motherly love on
