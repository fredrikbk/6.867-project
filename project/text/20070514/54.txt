malloch browns friendship wed like to apologize to mark malloch brown for trusting a report in another newspaper that he was a mere vice president in george soross hedge fund empire in a letter to the editor on the previous page sir mark reports that he is in fact a vice chairman which makes him an even more significant part of mr soross team than we suggested as for the rest of mr malloch browns letter it is a tribute to the skills he has developed during his long career in such "multilateral" institutions as the u n such places require a certain rhetorical elasticity he claims that he came to the world bank last week not to bury paul wolfowitz but to praise him sure and some of his best friends are neo cons as smooth an actor as sir mark knew exactly how his words would be interpreted amid the current bank controversy and last week he didnt correct the news reports saying he had encouraged mr wolfowitzs resignation we can guess what mr wolfowitz thinks of such "friendship " mr malloch browns record in downplaying the oil for food scandal at the u n is well known and he knows that paul volckers "adverse finding" against former secretary general kofi annan was first made as part of an interim report not the final version thats when mr annans future at the u n was most in peril and thats when mr malloch brown pushed the public line that mr annan believed he had been "exonerated " theres much more but you get the idea see related article "letters to the editor i didnt attack wolfowitz nor am i succeeding him" wsj may
