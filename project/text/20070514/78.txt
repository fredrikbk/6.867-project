technology a special report how to be a star in a youtube world what it takes to stand out when anyone can be an entertainer there are millions of people trying to get noticed on the web with everything from blogs to podcasts to videos so with the huge glut of material out there how do amateurs get attention let alone become bona fide online stars how for instance did an arizona woman giving grammar advice get to be one of the most popular podcasts on itunes and how do independent video series like "ask a ninja" or "lonelygirl" draw hundreds of thousands of online viewers for each episode it turns out that success in the new media world depends on a lot of the same things as in the old media universe just as in hollywood becoming a hit takes talent effort timing and some luck sex appeal is just as valuable online as off and getting noticed by the "mainstream" press also helps build buzz most important though is the way internet stars exploit the power of the web they employ all the social networking tools available on new media sites like google inc s youtube inviting fans to comment on their work link to it and even copy it and they draw on email subscriptions and other tools to alert fans about new offerings "the most popular are the ones who have really tapped into the social fabric" of the internet says jamie byrne head of product marketing at youtube to be sure the definition of stardom on the web is vastly different than in traditional media "if someone appears for seconds on american idol they have more exposure than the single most popular individual on youtube " says rishad tobaccowala chief executive of denuo a new media consulting unit of french advertising and marketing company publicis groupe sa recently for instance "american idol" drew about million viewers for one telecast while the most popular youtube video that same week a preview for the " rock" season finale was viewed about times but even if the potential audiences are smaller aspiring online stars still face plenty of competition there are hundreds of millions of short videos on the top video sharing sites apple inc s itunes alone counts more than audio and video podcasts yahoo inc says that as many as one and a half million photographs are added to its flickr photo sharing site daily whats more much of the most popular material on these sites comes from traditional media making it harder for amateurs and newcomers to stand out so whats the magic formula for web stardom heres a look at some of the secrets gleaned from looking at those who have already blazed that trail be consistent many of the most popular podcasters and video bloggers take a lesson from traditional media and offer new content with a disciplined regularity "shows that are consistent have a tendency to grow more than those that arent " says todd cochrane a podcaster and founder of rawvoice inc which builds podcasting sites for individuals and companies the video blog "rocketboom " for instance has been delivering three minute news programs five days a week since october "grammar girl " a popular podcast about proper language usage gets an update every thursday like clockwork that regular schedule is crucial to the podcasts creator mignon fogarty "when the shows i listen to dont come out i get very frustrated " she says even those who dont add new material on a fixed schedule try to add new work regularly the "lonelygirl" video series for instance strives to maintain the illusion that its a teenagers personal video blog so it doesnt keep to a regular timetable still its producers add as many as five new episodes a week in less than a year theyve completed more than episodes steady updates are also a rule for rebekka guoleifsdottir arguably the most popular contributor to flickr the year old art school student in reykjavik iceland typically adds two or three new pictures a week for a total of about her work has been viewed more than three million times and her popularity on the site led to a contract with toyota motor corp to provide photography for a local marketing campaign get in early when "rocketboom" went online in late the idea of a video blog posting commentary and news in video form instead of regular text was still novel andrew baron the programs producer says that the program had a small but loyal audience of about daily viewers within a few weeks of launching the site got a big surge in viewers later that year when "rocketboom" collected and broadcast user made videos of the tsunami that struck coastal areas of the indian ocean traffic really took off the following march after a new media conference in austin texas focused on podcasting and video blogging and "rocketboom" was one of the few examples "we definitely had that first mover advantage " mr baron says "it gives you a big advantage if you can stay afloat now that its much more saturated out there people who have big dreams may have a more difficult time " since its harder to break in now aspiring stars must do more to stand out they must have a new twist on an existing idea or do an old idea exceedingly well such as produce a video series with very compelling storytelling find a niche newcomers could also look for a niche that hasnt yet been filled such as "grammar girl " its hard to imagine a less likely internet hit in each three minute episode "grammar girl" ms fogarty discusses a different grammar topic such as run on sentences or the active and passive voices so why does the show consistently rank in the top podcasts on itunes the show is well produced there are no other top educational podcasts on itunes that cover questions of style usage and punctuation "grammar girl" found a narrow niche that a surprising number of people are interested in "everyone has a pet peeve or some question about writing " says ms fogarty a former technical writer in gilbert ariz "grammar girl" has also caught the eye of mainstream television and newspapers appearing on "oprah " and in usa today and the wall street journal where a brief mention last november caused traffic to jump nearly now ms fogarty is exploring new niches in addition to her own show she now produces six other advice podcasts featuring other people including "mighty mommy " about parenting "money girl " about finances and "legal lad " about the law the network gets about a million downloads a month work your network online hits depend heavily on word of mouth and internet stars are good at working the virtual room mr baron of "rocketboom" seeded his audience by alerting a small online discussion group on video blogging about his plans for the new site on flickr ms guoleifsdottir made contacts by commenting on the work of other photographers on the site which in turn attracted notice to her work her comments included a link to her own photos she also maintains her own web site and a myspace page where she shows off work and communicates with fans these techniques were used aggressively by producers of one of the biggest breakout hits in the youtube age "lonelygirl " the series purports to be the video diary of a teenage girl who talks into a webcam about her likes and dislikes and her family and friends and who is at the center of a series of mysteries in reality "bree" is played by actress jessica rose a fact disclosed in a flurry of media coverage last fall the shows creators began building a fan base even before the first episode the lonelygirl team miles beckett greg goodfried and mesh flinders would post comments about other videos on youtube using the lonelygirl screen name this let the fictitious character build up name recognition and a network of friends on youtube when there werent as many users as today the creators also would have the character post remixes of other peoples videos these received as many as daily views subscriptions were also a big help youtube like itunes and other sites allows visitors to "subscribe" to their favorite producers automatically receiving new material when its put online when the material gets enough subscribers the sites will put it on a "most popular" page where it gets even more attention when the first video featuring ms rose went online last year "lonelygirl" already had a couple of hundred subscribers mr goodfried says less than a month later a posting on july was viewed about times enough to get highlighted on youtubes most viewed page and the show took off "theres definitely a cumulative effect on youtube " says mr beckett who came up with idea for the series and is an executive producer and director "the more subscribers the more your views go up and that gives you a chance for the more casual visitor to see your video " the show now has about subscribers on youtube and attracts about visitors a day to its web site numbers that were boosted considerably by all the media attention its most popular episodes have been viewed more than a million times act like a pro the web is full of material that looks like it was produced by amateurs the most popular material is definitely more polished than the rest of the pack even though it may look rough by tv standards although all its fans know that "lonelygirl" is a fiction the producers still strive to give the show the look and feel of a teenagers video diary episodes are shot with a web camera or the kind of consumer video camera a student might own and are edited and mixed with basic home computer software a lot of work goes into making the videos appear unstudied not counting time writing messrs beckett and goodfried estimate that each three minute episode takes about hours to produce that includes preproduction such as finding props lining up the cast and scouting locations filming and postproduction editing much slicker looking is the video podcast "ask a ninja " in each episode a black clad performer uses questions from viewers to launch comic riffs on the legendary japanese assassins in a recent show a viewer asked "do ninjas write poetry or are they just murderous shadows of death put on earth only to act against mankind " answer "wow i didnt realize those were the only two options " the show has been among the top podcasts on itunes since shortly after its debut in late its most recent episodes have been downloaded about times apiece and the videos on the shows web site get about views for each episode the show was recognized as the "best series" in this years youtube video awards the shows producers los angeles improvisational comics kent nichols and douglas sarine spend up to hours preparing filming and editing each three to four minute episode which feature quick cuts multiple camera angles consistent sound quality and most important sharp writing "we hated the first episode it moves so slowly " mr sarine says "but we just went back and tried to do it better with each episode " beauty sells ok this is probably not all that surprising people who are unusually attractive stand a much better chance of getting attention its no accident that some of ms guoleifsdottirs most popular photos are self portraits some of them clocking more than views each when she first started putting her photographs on flickr she admits intentionally choosing pictures "some of them a bit revealing " to draw in viewers and comments "i wasnt taking myself too seriously " ms guoleifsdottir says by the time she started posting more serious work she already had a large audience of devoted fans who followed her updates and commented on her pictures similarly "rocketboom" built an audience around the good looks of its anchor amanda congdon indeed ms congdon became one of the first true stars of the nascent world of video blogging drawing about viewers a day to the show and inspiring comments by prominent bloggers ms congdon left the site last summer and later was hired by abc news site to host a video blog she was quickly replaced at "rocketboom" by another anchor with made for tv good looks former mtv video jockey joanne colan mr totty is a news editor for the journal report in san francisco he
