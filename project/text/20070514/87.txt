the persistent deal maker how murdoch applies his patience will be key to pursuit of dow jones if there is one trait that has defined news corp chairman rupert murdochs half century of deal making it is his tenacity mr murdochs stamina sometimes measured in decades rather than months or years will now be an important factor in his pursuit of dow jones &amp co controlled by the bancroft family family members representing of the voting power of dow jones oppose mr murdochs &# billion or &# a share offer dow jones stock which traded as high as &# on the day mr murdochs offer was disclosed has since slipped it closed friday in new york stock exchange composite trading at &# up &# signaling that investors expect a protracted courtship mr murdoch has encountered such resistance before and often but not always overcame it in past battles for assets as varied as satellite television companies publishers and technology concerns he has faced down government opposition and outmaneuvered rivals by paying more than others thought prudent along the way he sometimes has had to tune out protests from his own shareholders and soothe concerns about the companys mounting debt "his general style is very opportunistic but it fits within a larger strategic framework " says stan shuman a managing director at allen &amp co and a news corp director emeritus who has advised mr murdoch since mr murdoch has also rarely if ever started full fledged hostile bids when a controlling shareholder resists for that reason it is unlikely that he would make a tender offer for dow jones publisher of the wall street journal while such a move which involves buying the class a shares not controlled by the family could secure him board seats it would leave him with a noncontrolling minority holding a position he tends not to like mr shuman says mr murdoch is "purposeful persistent and patient" in his pursuit and his latest approach is part of a long running interest in financial news indeed as far back as the s mr murdoch toyed with reuters group plc and made a hard run at pearson plc publisher of the financial times building a stake in the company news corp sold its pearson stake after the british companys rattled management refused to cooperate on joint ventures mr murdoch has long had dow jones in his sights however making the occasional overture this time though he made a formal offer and timed it particularly well say wall street veterans because dow jones was in the midst of a leadership transition his april letter came the day before the companys annual meeting and the day before the wall street journal named a new managing editor more importantly peter kann the companys former chief executive stepped down as chairman of the board april mr kann has since come out in opposition to the news corp bid but because he is no longer on the board his influence is reduced mr murdochs way typically involves one or more fallback options in case the original attempt falters "he is a persuasive and creative deal maker and there seems to be a backup plan for nearly every contingency " says vijay jayant a media analyst at lehman brothers "if it doesnt happen one way he will find another way " in the s mr murdoch bowed out of an attempt to acquire warner communications inc when an initially friendly approach turned sour as the studio became spooked by his steady accumulation of shares warner found a white knight in herbert siegel and his chris craft industries mr murdoch quickly found an alternate entry to hollywood by acquiring twentieth century fox from marvin davis in mr murdoch is equally willing to duke it out with entrenched rivals and government regulators when necessary a prime example is his effort to break into the italian tv market first he eyed acquiring mediaset a broadcaster controlled by silvio berlusconi he then bought and merged other smaller assets to create sky italia his own satellite broadcaster overcoming tough political and regulatory opposition to win approval for the deal when he later tried to add a stake in telecom italia to his empire however the deal was shot down over foreign ownership concerns sky italia has since become one of europes most important pay television platforms and has given the long existing television duopoly in italy a run for its money perhaps no deal illustrates mr murdochs deal making traits as clearly as his dogged pursuit of directv the u s satellite to home broadcaster that mr murdoch saw as the missing u s link in his global satellite tv platform after an arduous negotiation that was nearing its conclusion directv was snatched from his grasp when echostar communications corp s chairman charles ergen made a dramatic board room play and outbid news corp mr murdoch was undeterred within hours the news corp chief and his advisers set out to scuttle the echostar deal they lobbied intensely on capitol hill they peppered state and federal regulators with legal filings highlighting antitrust concerns and even sought to recruit religious broadcasters as allies it worked after regulators rejected echostars bid mr murdoch jumped back in and finally gained control of directv in december it was cheaper too he ended up paying &# billion for a controlling stake versus the &# billion in stock and cash that mr ergen had originally put on the table for the entire company that drama didnt end there as cable television providers and telephone firms stepped up competition for subscribers the go go years for satellite broadcasters appeared over and mr murdoch last year used his stake in directv to secure the shares of news corp that john malone owned achieving another important objective nonetheless directv has continued to thrive and is holding its own against increasing competition another important murdoch tactic is more basic money talks just as his &# a share bid for dow jones was meant to blow possible competitors out of the water his acquisition of social networking web site myspace for &# million prompted executives at rival viacom inc which was also pursuing the asset to gripe that mr murdoch had overpaid guessing mr murdochs next move is almost impossible he is widely known for finding ways to keep competitors and adversaries off balance in the fall of mr murdoch told shareholders that his directv deal would cap his drive to assemble a "perfect balance" of global content and distribution he boasted about having just the "right mix" of businesses spanning "a geographic breadth unmatched by any media company " he suggested news corp didnt foresee any additional major acquisitions and instead would focus on organic growth and raising dividends that proved to be short lived
