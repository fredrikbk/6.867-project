chinese pet food tricks chinas reaction to international economic criticism is often to fix the problem fast so it is with the recent pet food scandal in which poisoned products were shipped to the u s an uproar ensued and beijing hurriedly shut down the offending factories its another indication that as china opens up to trade it will increasingly have to clean up its domestic policies the pet food fiasco is only the latest in a string of chinese food and drug safety problems in panama at least people have died since october after using cough syrup tainted with a chemical cousin of antifreeze the deadly ingredient originated in china other cases in recent years include pesticide tainted frozen spinach exported to japan and turbot spiked with a carcinogenic chemical shipped to hong kong mississippi this month banned shipments of chinese catfish in which state authorities said they had found levels of two antibiotics not allowed in the u s given shipping volumes tens of thousands of foodstuff containers arrive each year it is not possible to scan every export that reaches u s shores even if it were feasible testing for an array of potential contaminants would be prohibitively expensive a single test of one food sample for the toxic compound dioxin can cost &# or more so the focus turns back to the source in this case china where domestic regulators have a spotty record thats partly due to lax laws melamine for example is a legal additive in china but not in the u s or canada another problem is weak oversight in some of chinas far flung provinces in the pet food case its thought that someone deliberately tried to evade regulatory scrutiny by mislabeling a shipment of tainted rice protein as "textiles " corruption is a problem too zheng xiaoyu the former head of the chinese equivalent of the food and drug administration is accused of taking up to &# in bribes in exchange for approving unproven medicines one antibiotic is said to have killed more than people as chinas consumers grow wealthier and more informed they are becoming less tolerant of such transgressions take the baby food scandal of in which ersatz formula killed dozens of infants and sickened hundreds with severe malnutrition thanks to the internet and mobile phones that scandal received national attention and public outrage was met with at least arrests and mass demotions although outside agencies such as the fda and the world health organization are working with chinese authorities this is at heart a problem only beijing can solve doing so is a matter of self interest for the chinese government which is trying to expand opportunities for agricultural trade beijing recognizes this which explains the state councils announcement that a new enforcement campaign directed at agricultural producers is designed to make companies hew to "standards used in food importing countries " thats where trade will play a key role chinas domestic problems arent contained to china anymore if beijings policymakers dont get serious about fixing their food and drug safety problems the rest of the world will shut out chinas products
