consumer technology castles in the air for a century architects have speculated about the house of tomorrow where did they go wrong its seven years into the st century so what happened to the "home of the future" that visionaries have been predicting since the turn of the th century youd think wed at least have a decent dishwashing robot by now if not the "rosie" who did it all for the jetsons visions of ultramodern homes with jarring designs and heaps of high tech conveniences date back to at least the early s when the architect le corbusier laid down his famous dictum "a house is a machine for living in " to a great extent of course many of the visions proved less than prescient that was partly because seers usually banked on a one size fits all vision of mass produced homes or focused on one material out of all proportion such as designing homes made entirely of steel or plastic sometimes they simply figured incorrectly about how a big trend would play out the idea of a garage for private airplanes for instance seems as ludicrous these days as the jetsons food a rac a cycle which could conjure any meal at the push of a button yet many of the elements in those forecasts have actually come to fruition some of americans have microwave ovens for instance though they seemed unlikely to catch on when they were exhibited in the monsanto house of the future at disneyland in and dishwashers were still a housewifes dream when george and william keck included one in their model house presented at the homes of tomorrow exhibition at the chicago worlds fair a look back at past houses of the future shows some inspiring ideas some surprisingly accurate predictions and many that were off the mark a vision of concrete le corbusier himself was arguably the designer of the "home of the future" that had the most influence for better or worse on how people actually live today he did everything from master plan communities to design pieces of furniture his grand plan he wanted rationality and structure in contrast to what he saw as the chaos of the city his most influential design was the "towers in the park" concept now seen throughout the world in the u s this vision became the template for the countrys public housing in the s and s that aspect of le corbusiers vision was a dismal flop for the most part public housing brought stark rows of large concrete towers that concentrated poverty and crime playing the trends one of the typical failings of the house of tomorrow is taking current fads and trends to an absurd length for instance the kecks proposed a house with a first floor airplane hangar predicting that americans would need garages for their soon to be ubiquitous aircraft the house now rests in a national park in indiana still some extrapolations do end up coming true even if it takes quite a while at the worlds fair in new york rca designer john vassos designed a home theater concept that is rapidly becoming the norm in high end homes albeit after plus years the soundproofed room featured a radio record player movie projector and pop up television screen along with a book and record library according to "better living " a book about american industrys impact on th century pop culture exchange cds and mps for the records and dvds for the movie projector and it sounds a lot like the home theaters being installed today a plastic tomorrow often homes of the future were built by companies whose interests in certain components or materials may have clouded their crystal ball that was the case with the monsanto house of the future the plus shaped modernist inspired structure was made almost entirely of plastics guides boasted that there were virtually no non manmade materials in the house monsantos house got some things right such as a microwave and a model of a flat screen television but the plastic home never caught on its design grew stale just a decade after its unveiling in and years before its predicted "future" was supposed to arrive monsanto wasnt the only one with a vision of a plastic tomorrow architects alison and peter smithsons house of the future which they referred to as h o f was meant to be built entirely out of plastic down to the nylon bedsheets plastic they figured was durable and easy to clean the h o f designed for a british newspaper in also came loaded with futuristic gadgets some have since come to fruition including a type of answering machine home automation systems that controlled lighting and temperature and a television remote control but other ideas like eggs that came precracked in little plastic bags and a self cleaning bathtub didnt pan out most people also dont store steak and fish in plastic containers in their cupboard after bombarding them with radiation to kill bacteria and air jets that dry you when you come out of the tub have yet to appear cookie cutter homes other visionary homes were too often meant to be mass produced and stamped out one size fits all says kent larson principal research scientist at the massachusetts institute of technologys school of architecture and planning at the chicago fair lustron corp showed its design for mass produced all steel homes that never had to be painted and were "vermin proof rust proof termite proof " the concept never quite caught on but unlike many homes of the future the lustron model had some success the company eventually sold of the houses many of which are still standing and occupied one of the most famous mass produced home designs came from buckminster fuller the visionary polymath after the death of his young daughter in mr fuller decided he wanted to do something for humanity so he brought his considerable brainpower to bear on housing his dymaxion dwelling machine was his attempt to design a cheap and efficient home meant to be mass produced and able to be disassembled and shipped in a tube mr fullers round aluminum house weighed just pounds and was cooled and heated by the elements its shower was supposed to use less than a quart of water it vacuumed itself and was meant for owners to be able to reconfigure it turning say three bedrooms and a living room into two bedrooms and a bigger living room for a dinner party the house was built on a central mast which contained all the utility lines and which held the house above the ground allowing it to be built almost anywhere says dana hutt director of architectural documentation and special projects at the art center college of design in pasadena calif "whats important about that house is its a prototype for affordable easy to build housing solution for the general public " ms hutt says "it was not seen as an elite building type " a few of the design elements were right on the mark the water was filtered and recycled and solid waste was to be compressed and used as fertilizer something a handful of so called green homes do today and the windows were insulated with double panes now a hallmark of energy efficient housing other elements never caught on his "o volving" shelving comprised multiple bins that moved up and down behind a wall and were capable of bringing the desired bin of clothing linens or pantry items to a chest high hole in the wall this theoretically allowed a lot of stuff to be stored in multiple bins behind the wall but only required a single inch tall opening mr fuller never got the funding to fully realize his vision just one dymaxion dwelling machine was even partially built in wichita kan and it now sits in the henry ford museum in michigan whats next while past predictions relied too much on a cookie cutter model todays visionaries are more likely to focus on letting individuals tailor their own homes thats in part why mr larson says he founded the house n research consortium at mit instead of predicting specific gadgets or designs that might be employed somewhere down the road mr larson focuses on creating a platform for individuals to tailor their own homes "its illogical to propose a singular vision for the future " he says "its like proposing a computer of the future who knows what its going to be like " he proposes to build such a platform in part by creating standards for how building components like walls windows roofs and computer systems connect enabling homebuilders to put up radically different homes efficiently so does he have any predictions about where the house is going mr larson says the home is reverting to a role similar to the one it played two centuries ago before the industrial revolution "you worked at home " he says "before you had your shop downstairs or your cow downstairs now you work on your laptop in the dining room the home is becoming a place of learning with the internet and home schooling thats where kids were taught in earlier days "
