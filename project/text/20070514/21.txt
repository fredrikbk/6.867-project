brazil looks to perk up countrys biodiesel sales sao paulo brazil move over espresso if a local researcher is right brazilian coffee producers could begin brewing their own biodiesel as early as next year even as they boost the quality of their countrys coffee stocks at the same time the studies which are being conducted at the federal university of minas gerais suggest that making both biodiesel and ethanol via coffee residues is technically and economically viable at least for small scale use within the countrys coffee cooperatives said leandro soares de oliveira a professor of chemical engineering at the university in an interview "we began working with the idea of extracting oils from coffee beans that werent of good quality " he said "we were looking at alternative uses for these beans for producers instead of just having them thrown into the domestic coffee supplies and depressing its quality " brazil is the worlds largest coffee producer and exporter but as much as a fifth of brazils coffee production for its domestic market is plagued with low quality beans low quality beans are those that are broken flawed or low grade since the studies started the researchers have improved the oil extraction rate from coffee beans from roughly to mr de oliveira added by next year the project is likely to be ready for implementation he said despite such improvements a coffee bean remains an unlikely choice for biodiesel given its mere oil to mass ratio compared to roughly for soy and for castor beans at the same time it is particularly difficult to extract oils from coffee beans given their hard shells nevertheless if coffee cooperatives chose to use their lowest quality beans for biodiesel use then it would allow them to produce enough of the biofuel to power their trucks and agricultural machinery said mr de oliveira every kilograms pounds of coffee will produce roughly nine kilograms of oil the estimated investment for coffee oil extraction equipment as well as a biodiesel plant that could produce anywhere from liters to liters gallons to gallons of biodiesel a day is a mere reals to one million reals or about &# to &# said mr de oliveira in addition to his biodiesel project mr de oliveira and other researchers last year began studying the possibility of brewing ethanol from coffee husks however the universitys biodiesel study which began in is far more advanced than its ethanol study which began in the second half of last year mr de oliveira added every liter of biodiesel needs an input of either methanol or ethanol "the idea is that the ethanol could be brewed by fermenting the coffee husks and that would be sufficient for the ethanol input for biodiesel production " said mr de oliveira noting that a liter of biodiesel requires about of a liter of ethanol
