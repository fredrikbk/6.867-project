corruption fighter jakarta fighting corruption is a hazardous mission in poor and developing countries you can be assassinated which happened to journalists georgy gongadze in ukraine and carlos alberto cardozo in mozambique in even in france there is danger as magistrate eva joly discovered ms joly prosecuted the state owned credit lyonnais which had incurred billions of dollars of losses through mismanagement her seven year investigation of the elf aquitaine oil company exposed corruption at the highest levels of business and political life as a result she was subjected to intimidation and death threats and had to be constantly under police protection her adversaries even produced a film portraying her as an unstable zealot in the norwegian government asked her to return to her native land and promptly appointed her a special adviser in the ministry of foreign affairs and justice but ms joly whom i have been privileged to know remains steadfast in her efforts against official corruption and assists where she can other anti corruption activists all over the world she gathered international support for me when i was sentenced to one year of incarceration by an indonesian court in my crime was that of being the editor in chief of a newsweekly magazine that published a story about the possibility of arson in one of indonesias largest traditional markets instead of using our story as preliminary information to start an investigation the police decided to investigate us and we ended up as defendants in a criminal defamation case and it was during this difficult time that another friend paul wolfowitz wrote an op ed in the new york times about my case he was then second in command at the pentagon and a very busy man yet he came forward to help now it is mr wolfowitz who is having a very difficult time as president of the world bank he is accused of secretly helping his girlfriend shaha riza get a hefty pay raise some former high officials of the bank have demanded his resignation i was shocked when i read the news i have known mr wolfowitz for more than two decades and i have never doubted his personal integrity i have also known ms riza for more than a decade we share a passion advocating for a more liberal and democratic interpretation of islam than what is now prevalent in the middle east since i have been covering news for more than a quarter century my reporter instinct automatically went to work the material available to the public shows that mr wolfowitz declared his special relationship with ms riza to the banks ethics committee when he first took his position and asked to be recused from matters relating to ms riza a longtime bank employee the ethics committee denied this request and recommended that mr wolfowitz have her leave the bank promptly and be compensated fairly mr wolfowitz followed this advice and subsequently the chairman of the ethics committee sent him two letters thanking him for his action and acknowledging that the matter was considered closed judging from all the documents that are available to the public it seems to me it is the conduct of the ethics board and not that of mr wolfowitz that should be investigated by an independent team perhaps headed by eva joly this should be done promptly in order to save the world bank from losing its effectiveness in its main goal of eradicating global poverty in fact this crisis can turn out to be a great opportunity to show the world how to handle problems of conflict of interest in high places this is a common problem among world bank clients the developing countries poor countries usually lack skilled managers and many of their competent managers are clustered in a few big families and among those families members intermarriages are quite common hence conflicts of interests are much more prevalent and a solution for handling this problem is greatly needed the world bank which prides itself as being a knowledge bank is well positioned to provide the answer the question now is can the bank accept this challenge i am quite confident that mr wolfowitz can based on how he handled "odious debt" at the world bank the situation in which loans are made with the knowledge that a big chunk of the money will probably be stolen he did not give in to the pressure from the left to write off odious debt and he did not give in to the pressure from the right in the opposite direction his answer was to increase the corruption prevention and asset recovery capabilities of poor countries he has found many champions in this endeavor nuhu ribadu the chairman of the economic and financial crime commission of nigeria is one under his leadership and with &# million of assistance from the world bank his commission has been able to recover &# billion worth of stolen assets and to prevent further aid money from being corrupted it is not by coincidence that mr ribadu has publicly stated his support for mr wolfowitz to remain the president of the world bank many critics of mr wolfowitzs anti corruption policy argue that suspending a loan is bad policy even if there is indication of corruption because poor people will suffer the most but consider one of the most successful world bank projects in my country the kecamatan development project kdp which has given more than &# billion to millions of poor people in subdistricts the poor people decide by themselves in a very democratic way which project the money should be spent on not a single penny goes through government coffers and therefore nothing can be stolen by public officials the project is done in a transparent way and is supervised by the whole community and funding will be stopped by the bank if any misuse is detected this threat of suspension as a collective punishment works very well for many poor people in indonesia this is the first time that any outsider has helped them in building public infrastructure in their area it is such a successful program that many countries are now mimicking it china for instance is planning to implement a similar project in indonesia it is widely believed that around of foreign loans disbursed in the past were stolen the world bank has given &# billion in loans to my country since which means almost &# billion of these loans ended up in the wrong places imagine how much more effective the world bank would be if its entire loan program was free from corruption fortunately some of the stolen money may still be recovered if countries like indonesia can learn from the nuhu ribadu experience and are assisted by the bank this is an exciting challenge and all the more reason to support the wolfowitz presidency i am writing this not just to support a friend in need but to help save a great institution mr wolfowitz is on the right track and has the passion needed to succeed in the difficult task of changing the mistaken and deeply embedded paradigm at the world bank mr harymurti is the editor of the weekly newsmagazine and daily newspaper published by tempo interactive
