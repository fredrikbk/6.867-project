the afternoon report crosscurrents in the gulf online edition washington and tehran have agreed to sit down at the negotiating table in iraq but the adversaries gave no indication that their decision to hash out one issue would lead to a broader discussion of other differences days after vice president dick cheney said on his visit to the persian gulf area that tehran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons and dominating the region iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on a persian gulf tour of his own said that his country would be forced to retaliate if the u s launched a military attack he also called on washington to withdraw its military presence in the region while calling on states there to join with iran in a security alliance "this region wont allow other powers from thousands of miles away to threaten the region and create enmity " he said "our talks with our brothers in the united arab emirates reiterated this truth again and again " though the sunni arab powers that lie across the gulf from iran are generally seen as wary of the growing influence of their shiite neighbor the iranian leader has received a generally warm reception during his recent excursion around the gulf he hosted a loud anti american rally in soccer stadium in dubai over the weekend and was welcomed with great fanfare by leaders of the u a e where mr cheney received a more subdued reception last week the pointed remarks from irans president came just one day after tehran and washington said that they had agreed to sit down for discussions about the security situation in iraq "both parties have confirmed the talks will take place in baghdad in the presence of the iraqi government " mr ahmadinejad said in abu dhabi "we decided we were ready and prepared to do this to support the iraqi people " the bush administration had resisted previous calls from the iraq study group and other observers to hold discussions with iran and syria on the situation in iraq citing what it claims are irans nuclear weapons ambitions and support of violent sectarian factions in iraq that target u s troops but those who pushed for talks think that dialogue with tehran and damascus could help stem weapons and fighters flowing across iraqs border speaking from russia secretary of state condoleezza rice said the u s had concluded the time was now right for discussion "weve had that channel for some time and it seemed like a good time to activate it " she said meanwhile in iraq u s forces were battling suspected sunni insurgents as the military continued its massive search for three soldiers who went missing in a volatile area to south of baghdad the islamic state of iraq linked to al qaeda claimed that it captured the troops saturday in an attack on a u s convoy four thousand u s troops supported by aircraft intelligence units and iraqi soldiers were scouring the mahmoudiya area and the military reported that it had killed two suspected insurgents and captured four others lt col christopher garver said the military couldnt verify the groups claim of responsibility but said that "it would not surprise me if al qaeda in iraq is involved in this because there are similarities to what theyve done before " the terror network said the u s should end its search "what you are doing in searching for your soldiers will lead to nothing but exhaustion and headaches your soldiers are in our hands if you want their safety do not look for them " said a statement posted online stocks stall out stock markets were fairly quiet to start the week as many traders
