readback keeping readers hooked in required writing english poet philip larkin defines the characteristics of a great novel online edition in the english poet philip larkin was a judge for the booker prize englands most prestigious literary award "we read about childhoods middle ages and old ages about men women and children animals and robots we read about people in imaginary situations and imaginary people in real situations as well as about nameless people and people who didnt know themselves who they were all this was very testing " the experience forced him to try to consciously define the characteristics of a great novel "i found myself asking four questions about every book " mr larkin later said "could i read it if i could read it did i believe it if i believed it did i care about it and if i cared about it what was the quality of my caring and would it last " these seem like obvious questions about literature but i had never heard them enumerated so unapologetically as mr larkin does in his collection of essays and reviews "required writing " usually when i decide not to finish a book i think its because im not smart patient or sophisticated enough mr larkin lets me off the hook he thinks its at least as likely that the author isnt doing his job "to be honest " he said about the booker contenders "very few survived as far as question four " i picked up "required writing" because i had failed to finish two books in less than a week a record for me i had considered both suitable candidates for this column but after reading more than pages of each in one case i decided i couldnt in good conscience recommend them one was joseph hellers "something happened " which i had read and loved many years ago the other was elizabeth bowens "the death of the heart " which is no on the modern librarys list of the best novels "something happened" seemed stale and cartoonish but worse a sizable chunk of it is about sex or the main character thinking about sex or plotting to have sex in principle this is fine sex is a rich source of fodder for novelists but i write this column for a family web site if i kept the dirty talk to an acceptable minimum i wouldnt have much else to say about "something happened " that wasnt going to be a problem with "the death of the heart " which stops short at kisses between the romantic leads but this felt too much like a book you were assigned for your college literature class you could admire it without really enjoying it although there were flashes of beautiful prose i found much of ms bowens writing which has been compared to that of henry james nearly impenetrable i dont mind a reading challenge but i expect a generous payoff for my trouble mr larkin who died in at the age of wrote two novels but he is best known for his poetry which he wrote at night by day he was a university librarian "ive always thought that a regular job was no bad thing for a poet " he said "indeed dylan thomas himself not that he was noted for regular jobs said this you cant write more than two hours a day and after that what do you do probably get into trouble " as a critic mr larkin is skeptical but courteous erudite and eccentric he loves poetry and his own poems are as another critic wrote "quirky lyrical despair made beautiful " but mr larkin worries about poets becoming too cozy with literary and academic critics "the poet has gained the happy position wherein he can praise his own poetry in the press and explain it in the classroom and the reader has been bullied into giving up the consumers power to say i dont like this bring me something different poetry needs to be rescued from among our duties and restored to our pleasures " sometimes i hear from readers who say they couldnt get through a book that i had recommended in this column they dont doubt my taste they doubt their own for these readers i quote mr larkin quoting samuel butler "i should like to like schumanns music better than i do i daresay i could make myself like it better if i tried but i do not like having to try and make myself like things i like things that make me like them at once and no trying at all "
