trappist command thou shalt not buy too much of our beer monks at st sixtus battle resellers of prized brew brother joris plays hardball westvleteren belgium the trappist monks at st sixtus monastery have taken vows against riches sex and eating red meat they speak only when necessary but you can call them on their beer phone monks have been brewing westvleteren beer at this remote spot near the french border since their brew offered in strengths up to alcohol by volume is among the most highly prized in the world in bars from brussels to boston and online it sells for more than &# for an ounce bottle times what the monks ask if you can get it for the monks at st sixtus however success has brought a spiritual hangover as they fight to keep an insatiable market in tune with their life of contemplation the monks are doing their best to resist getting bigger they dont advertise and dont put labels on their bottles they havent increased production since they sell only from their front gate you have to make an appointment and theres a limit two bottle cases a month because scarcity has created a high priced gray market online the monks search the net for resellers and try to get them to stop "we sell beer to live and not vice versa " says brother joris the white robed brewery director beer lovers however seem to live for westvleteren when jill nachtman an american living in zurich wanted a taste recently she called the hot line everybody calls the beer phone after an hour of busy signals she finally got through and booked a time she drove hours to pick up her beer "if you factor in gas hotel and the beer i spent &# a bottle " she says until the monks installed a new switchboard and set up a system for appointments two years ago the local phone network would sometimes crash under the weight of calls for westvleteren cars lined up for miles along the flat one lane country road that leads to the red brick monastery as people waited to pick up their beer "this beer is addictive like chocolate " said luc lannoo an unemployed year old belgian from ghent about an hour away as he loaded two cases of westvleteren into his car at the st sixtus gate one morning "i have to come every month " two american web sites rate beer and beer advocate rank the strongest of westvleterens three products a dark creamy beer known as "the " best in the world ahead of beers including swedens narke kaggen stormaktsporter and minnesotas surly darkness "no question it is the holy grail of beers " says remi johnson manager of the publick house a boston bar that has westvleteren on its menu but rarely in stock some beer lovers say the excitement over westvleteren is hype born of scarcity "its a very good beer " says jef van den steen a brewer and author of a book on trappist monks and their beer published in french and dutch "but it reminds me of the movie star you want to sleep with because shes inaccessible even if your wife looks just as good " thanks to the beer phone there are no more lines of cars outside the monastery now but production remains just cases per year while demand is as high as ever westvleteren has become almost impossible to find even in the specialist beer bars of brussels and local joints around the monastery "i keep on asking for beer " says christophe colpaert manager of "cafe de sportsfriend " a bar down the road from the monks "they barely want to talk to me " on a recent day a recorded message on the beer phone said st sixtus wasnt currently making appointments the monks were fresh out of beer increasing production is not an option according to the year old brother joris who says he abandoned a stressful career in brussels for st sixtus years ago "it would interfere with our job of being a monk " he says belgian monasteries like st sixtus started making beer in the aftermath of the french revolution which ended in the revolts anti catholic purge had destroyed churches and abbeys in france and belgium the monks needed cash to rebuild and beer was lucrative trappist is a nickname for the order of cistercians of the strict observance who set up their own order in la trappe france in the s because they thought cistercian monasteries were becoming too lax the monks at st sixtus sleep in a dormitory and stay silent in the cloisters though they speak if they need to today though trappists are increasingly famous for making good beer seven monasteries six are belgian one la trappe is dutch are allowed to label their beer as trappist in they set up an alliance to protect their brand they retain lawyers in washington and brussels ready to sue brewers who try use the word trappist every few months brother joris puts on street clothes and takes the train to brussels to meet with fellow monks to share sales and business data and plot strategy the monks know their beer has become big business thats fine with the brothers at scourmont the monastery in southern belgium that makes the chimay brand found in stores and bars in europe and the u s theyve endorsed advertising and exports and have sales exceeding &# million a year they say the jobs they create locally make the business worthy other monasteries which brew names familiar to beer lovers such as orval westmalle and rochefort also are happy their businesses are growing to meet demand not so at st sixtus brother joris and his fellow monks brew only a few days a month using a recipe theyve kept to themselves for around years two monks handle the brewing after morning prayer they mix hot water with malt they add hops and sugar at noon after boiling the mix sufficient to fill roughly bottles is fermented for up to seven days in a sterilized room from there the beer is pumped to closed tanks in the basement where it rests for between five weeks and three months finally it is bottled and moved along a conveyor belt into waiting cases monks at st sixtus used to brew by hand but nothing in the rules of the order discourages technology so theyve plowed profits into productivity enhancing equipment st sixtus built its current brewhouse in with expert advice from the company then known as artois breweries in the s the monks even debated whether they should continue making something from which people can get drunk "there is no dishonor in brewing beer for a living we are monks of the west moderation is a key word in our asceticism " says brother joris in a separate email interview "we decided to stick to our traditional skills instead of breeding rabbits " the result is a brew with a slightly sweet heavily alcoholic fruity aftertaste one day recently the wiry sandy haired brother joris returned to his office in the monastery after evening prayers he flipped on his computer and went online to hunt for resellers and ask them to desist "most of the time they agree to withdraw their offer " he says last year st sixtus filed a complaint with the government against two companies that refused belgianfood com a web site that sells beer cheese chocolate and other niche products and beermania a brussels beer shop that also sells online both offer westvleteren at around &# a bottle "im not making a lot of money and i pay my taxes " says belgianfood com owner bruno dourcy "you can only buy two cases at once you know " mr dourcy makes monthly two hour car trips from his home in eastern belgium "seek the kingdom of god first and all these things will be given to you " counters brother joris quoting from the bible adding that it refers only to things you really need "so if you cant have it possibly you do not really need it "
