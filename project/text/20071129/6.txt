amid hopeful signs worries linger and water and power are unreliable online edition sarmad to gina i was glad to read stories over recent weeks on how the violence in baghdad seems to have been gradually waning and that as a result many families who had fled their homes are now returning to the city but the news seems too good to be true in the past baghdad has seen relative peace from time to time but it has been fleeting the kind of quiet that proceeds a storm do the people returning seem nervous or tense about being back most of my friends approach times like these with wary anticipation they want it to be better but fear a return to chaos do people seem to feel like the quiet now is different from the quiet other times gina the situation here is definitely better but its hard to say whether its permanent whether its sustainable people are hopeful but they are also scared to have hope you know iraqis have been through so much and have seen a lot of their cities like mosul go back and forth between being safe and dangerous since i returned to iraq one month ago ive heard a few car bombs and mortar rounds including ones that went off on thanksgiving day a roadside bomb that exploded outside the international zone two weeks ago was close enough that the house shook but im told its nothing like it was this past summer when mortar rounds were coming in every day u s generals here say al qaeda is on the run but they also warn that al qaeda is still out there and so are the shiite militia groups and many iraqi friends have apologized for not inviting me to their homes because its still unsafe for them to be seen with foreigners there are reports of iraqis returning to the country but its unclear what that means the government and the iraqi red crescent disagree over the numbers and some nongovernment organizations think the statistics of returnees are being used for publicity purposes one iraqi friend said three of his family members who left for syria have come back although one didnt feel safe enough to go back to his old home but another iraqi friend said some of those people coming back are just here temporarily until they can get a visa to go back to syria some of those coming back simply ran out of money in syria or jordan the other question is what theyre coming back to especially if their savings have run out and they dont have a job waiting for them here even though they are back they could still be in a pretty bleak situation sarmad meanwhile the iraqi government seems to be working on rebuilding some of the places that have been targeted in various bomb attacks like al mutanabi street the main local book market which was hit in march i used to go there almost every friday joining the crowds to sort through the piles of used books and magazines are there still vendors there do the streets seem to be filling back up with more people venturing out to markets despite what has happened to many of them in the past gina yes the government has a plan to rebuild al mutanabi in a &# million project that will take about six months to finish and vendors are slowly coming back an iraqi acting troupe also built a makeshift theater there out of tents and has had some performances my friends also tell me that they actually saw families standing in line to get into the zoo and restaurants are seeing more customers so life is slowly returning to normal but it seems some government officials are getting ahead of themselves some have talked of plans of making basra in southern iraq the next dubai but basra is still plagued by infighting between different shiite groups like moqtada al sadrs mahdi army the supreme islamic iraqi councils badr corps and the fadhila party one of the things they are hoping to control is oil smuggling which largely runs out of the port in basra people describe basra as like the wild west where anything goes as long as you have enough weapons and it remains to be seen whether life will go back to the way it was in terms of the makeup of iraqs neighborhoods many areas that were formerly mixed with sunnis and shiites are now exclusively made up of one sect or another old friendships have been severed and countless families have been destroyed as one of my iraqi friends said and perhaps some of those areas will remain segregated so it could be a more secure iraq but possibly still divided in many ways sarmad is it as dangerous as before for people to visit or walk around neighborhoods other than theirs for instance for a sunni to go into a shiite neighborhood gina that is definitely a factor most people know how the neighborhoods are divided between sunni and shiite so they know where they can and cant go and many sunnis in shiite areas and shiites in sunni areas have already been driven out so the neighborhoods are largely ethnically cleansed and people know the dividing lines the government and the u s military are trying to encourage those people to go back to their original neighborhoods but they know they cant force it sarmad it sounds like there is still a long way to go as far as infrastructure and providing iraqis with the services they need families like mine still have to wake up in the middle of the night to collect water which is available for only a few hours at a time power is also sporadic i hear numbers like four hour outages and then two hours of power what have you been hearing about the water fuel and electricity situation why are basic services still so limited are they improving gina that is one of the biggest complaints from all sides that the government hasnt taken real advantage of the improved security situation it seems like for the most part its business as usual for them which means they are still hampered by political wrangling and corruption the government used to blame the violence for its inability to adequately provide services "bad security is no longer an excuse " general abud qambar of the baghdad operations center told me recently "iraq is a rich country we should have electricity and water these are basic things " indeed there are still long lines at gas stations the electricity supply is still erratic and getting clean water is still difficult for many we are lucky that we have two generators but the power still goes out several times a day i cant imagine what its like for people who have only one generator or no generator at all at a gathering of local and government leaders earlier this month in the once al qaeda infested taji area the power went out for about minutes as dignitaries were giving speech after speech to highlight the security improvements in the region assistants fiddled with microphones and sheikhs talked on their cellphones while they waited for the power to return and the sound system to come back on that seemed to give them more ammunition for their argument that basic services like electricity and water have been slow to improve despite the improved security sheikh nadeem hatim al sultan a shia leader of the tammimi tribe complained about the erratic electricity and crumbling schools in which to students share one class sheikh naji khalil al salman of the obeidi tribe a sunni agreed and noted that sunnis and shiites are taking steps toward reconciliation and now it was time for the government to step in write to gina chon or
