review &amp outlook editorial cable coup foiled cable operators were granted a partial reprieve when kevin martins plans to burden the industry with additional regulations crashed and burned this week as beltway defeats go it was a doozy mr martin who heads the federal communications commission prides himself on being a political sharpie someone capable of deftly negotiating washingtons corridors of power but at a hearing tuesday both of his fellow republican commissioners abandoned him so did jonathan adelstein one of the two democratic appointees and rightly so mr martin wanted his colleagues to sign off on a report that said more than of households with access to cable are subscribers this would have given the fcc the authority to unleash all manner of new rules on the industry it didnt matter to mr martin that the report culled from a single survey conducted by warren communications contradicted internal fcc data mr martin wants more control so he can tell cable companies how to market their products his holy grail is a la carte regulation that would require time warner comcast and others to sell programming on a per channel basis social conservatives say this will keep offensive programming out of homes that dont want it liberal groups say it will reduce cable bills because customers will only pay for the channels they watch but an a la carte cable model ought to be a decision for businesses not regulators by putting politics above the merits mr martin managed to alienate everybody
