some colleges cut eliminate student debt soaring tuition pressure to spend endowments spur schools to offer more grants colleges are moving to eliminate or at least ease student debt as pressure builds in washington for them to spend more from their endowments to help families afford the rising cost of school this month williams college announced that it will eliminate loans from all financial aid packages beginning next school year and replace them with grants amherst college recently announced a similar initiative and davidson college in davidson n c began this fall replacing loans with grants and student employment other schools are stopping short of getting rid of loans entirely but are still finding new ways to minimize debt at least for some students colby college a private college in waterville maine announced this month that it will eliminate loans for maine residents starting next fall beginning with next years freshmen wesleyan university in middletown conn will eliminate loans for its neediest undergraduates and reduce debt by an average of for all other students on aid and this year emory university in atlanta announced its "emory advantage" program which eliminates loans for undergraduate students whose families earn less than &# a year while capping total loan volume at &# over four years for families with income of up to &# jessica mestre a sophomore at amherst college who works as a photographer in the schools public affairs office expects to graduate in with only &# in debt thanks in large part to the new no loan initiative "i dont know my major or my career plans yet but this relieves the pressure " says the year old the moves to ease many students debt burdens come in the wake of big elite schools programs to make college more affordable for low and middle income families of undergraduates harvard university last year expanded its low income program begun in to include families that earn up to &# starting this academic year columbia university is replacing loans with grant money for students whose families earn less than &# a year and stanford university this year is expanding its low income program to offer an additional &# million in funds for families with incomes from about &# to &# aimed at reducing the parent contribution and what students must borrow in determining financial aid schools typically assess family income and assets to come up with an "expected family contribution " they subtract that expected contribution from the total cost of attendance tuition fees room and board and other expenses to come up with a determination of "need " then the school offers a financial aid package which may comprise loans grants and a student job to meet that need schools like amherst in amherst mass and williams in williamstown mass are offering grants to replace what the need based loan would ordinarily be to be sure a family could still take out loans to lower their expected contribution some federal loans such as certain stafford loans or the plus loan for parents and graduate students dont require applicants to show need but for these schools loans are no longer part of the financial aid package offered to families to finance the new aid initiatives some schools such as williams and stanford are reaching into their endowments but plenty are hoping not to have to dig too deep wesleyan is curtailing nonacademic spending cutting back on certain administrative positions and raising new funds davidson is planning to raise &# million from alumni and other benefactors colby received a sizable donation that allowed it to kick off the initiative and plans on raising additional funds before having to reach into its endowment the moves come as members of congress from both sides of the aisle are prodding schools to spend more of their endowments many colleges have seen enormous growth in recent years in their endowments which are donated funds that colleges invest and use the proceeds to support the schools mission surveys of hundreds of schools by the national association of college and university business officers show that the percentage of schools with endowments valued at over &# billion has doubled since to in legislation to renew the higher education act which addresses college financing issues rep john tierney d mass included a section that would direct the secretary of education to conduct a study into the amounts and uses of college endowments "at a time when the cost of college continues to rise at an alarming rate are wealthy colleges just hoarding or is enough of their growing endowment meeting the public policy of fostering education and helping students " asks mr tierney sen charles grassley of iowa the senior republican on the senate finance committee suggests that congress should consider a minimum payout requirement for college and university endowments to help lower the cost of college for students and their parents amherst college for instance spent of its &# billion endowment in the fiscal year ended june that is the average that colleges spent that year according to a study by the national association of college and university business officers still amhersts endowment rose in market value in that year compared with the previous year to pay for its new initiative amherst says it will dig into reserves from its endowment and other sources in the short term in future years it anticipates alumni fund raising to cover the program "while the endowment has done well in recent years weve also had years of zero or negative return " says amherst president anthony marx "we do have an obligation to continue in perpetuity and there will be up years and down years " some outside experts think that schools can afford to pony up more particularly as tuitions continue to increase faster than the typical rate of inflation "the federal government should require colleges and universities to report their payouts annually and i would hope that would generate public pressure for them to spend more " says lynne munson adjunct research fellow at the center for college affordability and productivity in washington who testified before the senate finance committee at a september hearing on college endowments "if that doesnt happen then i do think congress should seriously consider a mandatory annual payout requirement " she says ms munson and others point out that private foundations are generally required to spend at least of their endowments each year but other nonprofits defined under section c of the tax code which would include colleges and universities dont face such a requirement the escalating amount of student debt may have implications for the future work force researchers at princeton university this year released a study looking at the career choices of graduates from "anon u" a school that is widely believed to be princeton itself the school was the first major university to replace loans with grant money that didnt have to be repaid starting with academic year princeton researchers tracked the career choices of aid recipients before and after the implementation of the policy they found that once debt was eliminated students were likelier to enter lower paid professions such as those in the nonprofit education and government fields "as a society we have benefited enormously from people being able to follow the career trajectories that gets their blood moving " says bob shireman president of the institute for college access and success a public policy research center in berkeley calif "sometimes that is public service work but it can also be taking on a start up inventing something or graduate school that involves risk that you cant take when you have a lot of student debt hanging over your head " cutting down on debt colleges face pressure to ease students debt burden some colleges offer grants in lieu of loans in aid packages debt reduction programs are sometimes limited to needier students colleges may fund the programs from their endowments or by raising new money
