politics &amp economics eu toughens stance in dealings with china new outspokenness over trade deficit and exchange rates is welcomed by the u s the european union after years of soft pedaling disputes with china over trade and human rights is adopting a tougher u s style approach the change in europes tone driven by a soaring trade deficit with china is getting a welcome in washington u s officials see the eu as a strong potential ally as they push for a stronger chinese currency and a more open chinese market but if the u s has found it tough to change china the eu is likely to find it even harder that is because europes internal divisions make it easy for powerful capitals such as beijing to play the blocs nations against one another china also has become such an important growth market for european companies that beijing could retaliate against any eu attempt to limit chinese exports analysts say beijing could impose more restrictions on foreign investment or raise duties on imports from the eu "china bashing could turn into europe bashing " said patrick messerlin a professor of economics at sciences po in paris still adding europes complaints to those of the u s will increase pressure on china the eus new assertiveness was on full display at yesterdays eu china summit in beijing "we demanded specific action to remedy the trade deficit " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said in an interview after the meeting which he termed "my toughest china visit ever " earlier this week mr mandelson made two strongly worded speeches in beijing where he criticized china over product quality and inadequate protection of intellectual property rights vice premier wu yi chinas most senior trade official said after mr mandelsons speeches that she was "very dissatisfied" with his comments according to news agency reports mr mandelson warned recently that the eus growing trade deficit with china is a "policy time bomb " which could trigger a wave of protectionist measures in europe the eu is deciding whether to impose dumping duties on chinese steel and has threatened to extend quotas on chinese textile imports germany europes trade powerhouse has also challenged china over human rights recently chancellor angela merkel invited the dalai lama the exiled tibetan buddhist leader to meet her in berlin two months ago something neither she nor her predecessor had done before since then the chinese government which sees the year old monk as a separatist has pulled out of a string of meetings with german officials and business representatives for years the eu took a conciliatory approach toward china it saw trade deficits as an american problem it was washington not brussels that played tough in negotiating terms for beijing to join the world trade organization in after the invasion of iraq much of the eu also saw beijing as a counterbalance to u s power the eu came close in to lifting the arms embargo it had imposed on china after the killings of tiananmen square demonstrators despite heated u s opposition but new leaders in the major eu capitals are now trying to align themselves more closely with washington as concern over the eus own spiraling trade deficit with china has prompted growing tensions with beijing talk of lifting the arms embargo has disappeared since the eus trade deficit with china has tripled in the first eight months of the eu posted a &# billion deficit with china wider than a year earlier in the same period the u s china deficit widened to &# billion trade officials in brussels say the eu is on track for the first time to run a wider trade deficit with china than the u s does europes change of approach is visible on the issue of chinas tightly controlled currency in the past the eu has pressed china to revalue its currency only in private staying silent when the u s made public appeals but the yuan has fallen by more than against the euro this year as the chinese currency has strengthened against the dollar giving chinese companies an increased cost advantage against european competitors "we have the same message " european central bank president jean claude trichet told reporters in beijing yesterday after he called publicly for beijing to raise the yuans value against the euro "the only difference is that we have been very discreet in comparison with others " that new outspokenness is welcomed in washington "the more international voices the better " said alan holmer the u s treasury departments special envoy to china "chinas trade imbalance isnt just an issue with the u s " chinese premier wen jiabao countered in a speech yesterday that the yuans recent fall against the euro was mainly caused by the dollars broad decline china agreed to form a working group on trade and exchange rate policy with the eu this week although economists see that move as largely symbolic chinese officials say european companies have significant foreign investments in the country chinas ministry of commerce says eu companies in china had &# billion of domestic sales in and exported an additional &# billion of goods figures that chinese scholars say should be taken into account when looking at the balance of interests between the two economies those existing investments and the sheer potential of the chinese market to deliver rapid sales growth for european companies gives china potential leverage in facing down pressure to open up its markets analysts say french president nicolas sarkozy announced chinas purchase of some &# billion of mainly french made airplanes drugs and nuclear power and telecom equipment during a visit to beijing on monday he avoided strong criticism of chinas human rights record "thank god for china " arthur j higgins chairman of bayer healthcare a unit of bayer schering pharma ag said in an interview "along with brazil and russia its offsetting the decline in mature western markets " one bayer made kidney cancer drug nexavar is selling better in china than in the united kingdom despite its cost of about &# for a years supply said mr higgins chinas growing wealth means it has less need to vie to bring in money from outside six years after china joined the wto promising to dismantle barriers to foreign trade and investment many businesses are wondering how to push for another wave of market concessions "people are a little bit weary and a little bit disappointed that china is not following through on wto commitments " said joerg wuttke president of the european union chamber of commerce in china in an interview there are questions as to whether mr mandelson or other eu leaders will be able to sustain any tough bargaining with china given the divergent interests of the eus member states when the eu sought to impose dumping duties on chinese textile imports in and shoes a year later eu nations split down the middle countries with significant shoe and textile industries such as italy and poland fought for protective tariffs richer consumer driven economies opposed them arguing that the measure would choke off a welcome supply of low cost goods for consumers marcus walker in berlin contributed to this
