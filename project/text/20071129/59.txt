judgment trumps experience as these late november days fade away the critical iowa caucus looms ever closer less than six weeks away which explains why the rhetoric of the two leading democratic candidates is becoming more shrill but also more clarifying hillary clinton and barack obama have taken off their gloves in one corner stands the champion of experience with the best executive coach in the free world at her side and a dog eared playbook of strategies that have won in the past standing in the opposite corner is a young contender fairly new at the game underweight and probably overmatched but a natural as they say mr obama and his handlers are putting their money on his judgment disdaining the experience card as a stale rerun of earlier campaigns skewering mrs clintons twisty judgments about iraq and subtly pushing the present over the legacy of the s destiny over dynasty one newspaper article on mrs clintons latest tv ad noted that it mentioned her experience five times bloggers also highlight the themes of experience and judgment whenever they describe the ever more heated fight between the democratic front runners where do we put our money first let us cite ted sorenson one of john f kennedys closest advisers and speechwriters when asked about his former bosss judgment mr sorenson responded "i cannot emphasize how important that elusive quality is far more important than organization structure procedures and machinery these are all important yes but nothing compared to judgment " after a five year study of leadership covering virtually all sectors of american life we came to the inescapable conclusion that judgment regularly trumps experience our central finding is that judgment is the core the nucleus of exemplary leadership with good judgment little else matters without it nothing else matters take any leader a u s president a fortune ceo a big league coach wartime general you name it chances are you remember them for their best and worst calls can anyone forget that harry truman issued the order to drop the first atom bomb or kennedys handling of the cuban missile crisis when nixon comes to mind so does watergate the first george bush "read my lips " clinton monica george w iraq leadership is at its marrow the chronicle of judgment calls these will inevitably write the leaders legacy dont get us wrong we are not discounting the importance of experience seminal and appropriate experiences must be drawn on and understood before judgments can be informed but experience is no guarantee of good judgment there is a huge difference between years of experience that advances ones learning and one year of experience repeated times in fact there are numerous times when past experiences can prevent wise judgments barbara tuchman long ago observed how generals tend to fight the last war refusing to face new realities almost always with disastrous consequences and often especially in todays dizzying world we need to understand what zen buddhists call the "beginners mind " which recognizes the value of fresh insight unfettered by experience in this more contemporary view the compelling idea is the novel one perhaps no one articulated the nature of the beginners mind better than the composer hector berlioz when he said of his more popular rival camille saint saens "he knows everything all he lacks is inexperience " judgment isnt quite an unnatural act but it also doesnt come naturally and speaking from decades of experience were not sure how to teach it we know it can be learned wisely processed experience reflection valid sources of timely information an openness to the unbidden and character are critical components of judgment as well as david mccullough reminds us over and over again "character counts in the presidency more than any other single quality " yes mrs clinton experience is not without value but judgment fed by solid character should determine the choice of our next president mr bennis is distinguished professor of business at the university of southern california and mr tichy is professor of business at the university of michigan they are the co authors of "judgment how winning leaders make great calls" penguin group published earlier this month see related letters "letters to the editor judgment vs experience" wsj december
