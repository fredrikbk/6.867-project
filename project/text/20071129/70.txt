not the seurat we think we know new york the paintings of the pointillists may amaze us with their ability to render the visible world in pinpoint dots of color but only rarely do they move us standing in front of georges seurats most well known work "a sunday on la grande jatte " we feel admiration pleasure and possibly even a nostalgic longing for some calmer more pacific golden age before we were born yet all that is a far cry from the powerful near visceral reaction so commonly evoked by a rembrandt or a van gogh too often as we look at a pointillist canvas some obstacle seems to intercede between the eye and the heart perhaps its the dazzle of technique or the chill of theory cerebration and scientific calculation so its all the more surprising to note what an utterly different set of responses are occasioned by the magnificent exhibition "george seurat the drawings " currently at the museum of modern art curated by jodi hauptman associate curator in the museums department of drawings the show contains over works by the artist who was born in and whose prodigious and productive career was cut short by his death most likely from diptheria at age in addition to the drawings there are several paintings studies in color for the major works and sketchbooks that have been digitized so that viewers can at least virtually page through them shimmering lambent suffused by a remarkable combination of intimacy and mystery the drawings are not only impressive but profoundly affecting you want to spend time with each one trying to fathom precisely why it seems so original so haunting and so lovely that you may be inclined to agree with the opinion of seurats fellow pointillist paul signac who claimed that these were "the most beautiful painters drawings in existence " done on handmade paper in conte crayon these paradoxically unassuming masterpieces depict a wide range of subjects that include portraits nudes rural and industrial landscapes figure studies images of animals wagons nurses and children a series of views of the cafe concert parisian clubs in which singers musicians and dancers performed convey the smoky theatricality and the heady mix of glamor and seediness that characterized these popular venues all or nearly all of the drawings share a moody tone a certain melancholy dreaminess and a shadowy quietude yet the pronounced differences among them make it appear as if the artist had somehow succeeded in finding a unique perfectly appropriate and utterly unpredictable way to represent each of the figures and scenes that caught his eye a clear hard line lends "drummer at montfermeil" an air of slightly aggrieved jauntiness portrayed in a silhouette "foal" has an expressive minimalism that brings to mind a childs drawing "seated monkey" is as simultaneously unmistakable and insubstantial as a shadow while "seated woman" takes the form of a brisk angular sketch the dark vertical stripes that represent "tree trunks reflected in water" exhibit the simplicity and the calligraphic spareness of asian landscape painting the gentle divisions between light and shadow in the artists depictions of his parents "embroidery" and "man dining" give these portraits a tenderness infused with fond memory and affection whats even more striking is how difficult it would be to identify these drawings if we except the easily recognizable studies for the more monumental paintings as having been done by seurat that is the seurat we know or think we know from those celebrated canvases if we have associated him with sunny harbors magical circuses and solid citizens taking the air on a leisurely sunday it comes as something of a shock to see how strongly he was attracted to the edges and margins to the barren expanses outside city walls to the ragpickers and tramps existing beyond the fringes of respectable society many of these images evoke the oeuvres of other artists without necessarily seeming to have been influenced by them while others anticipate the vision of painters and even photographers whose careers began decades after seurats death his gleaners and agricultural workers might well have been laboring in the same fields as jean francois millets farmers while his misty landscapes prefigure those of atget "woman with a dog" has the gothic ferocity of a figure from edvard munch while his industrial and city scenes may remind you of charles sheeler or edward steichen toward the end of the exhibition are a few small paintings that recall the more familiar aspects of seurats work having seen the drawings you cant help seeing these canvases in an altered more complex way but after the glories of "georges seurat the drawings " these magic tricks performed with dots are something of a letdown its almost as if in switching from black and white to color someone had mistakenly turned off all the lights ms prose writes about art for the journal
