building awareness starting up giveaway slipups online edition this is part of a part series on giveaways looking at when it makes sense for a small business to offer free products as a marketing strategy read part here when dante pauwels the founder of dante beatrix inc a designer bag maker in new york spotted "desperate housewives" star marcia cross carrying one of her peace stroller totes in a tabloid magazine recently she was elated though a little bit confused just days before pauwels and her business partner claire theobald had sent cross a different bag as part of the companys effort to take advantage of the baby boom in hollywood with hopes of garnering attention for the dante beatrix brand which sells assorted baby tote bags and dog carriers the business partners sent out baby beatrix bags to oft photographed celebrity mommies "weve seen pictures of cross carrying this bag in numerous tabloids and its been helpful to our business " says pauwels but the actresss bag choice appears to be a coincidence unrelated to dante beatrixs giveaway strategy that makes pauwels wonder what happened to the other bags that were sent since each free bag could have sold for &# to &# in addition to packaging and shipping costs pauwelss marketing efforts were neither cheap nor easy for one thing finding the contact information for all these celebrities was a pain she says plus packing up the boxes so the bags looked good and writing notes was time consuming and so far she says "we have yet to see any of those bags in use by a celebrity " for start up business owners giving away products can raise awareness of your brand as well as spark future sales but theres a fine line between giving away just enough to tantalize would be customers and giving the store away here are a few common giveaway pitfalls and ways to combat them pitfall gbp paying any price for celebrity clients marketing consultants agree that lassoing a celebrity client or two can do wonders for a small business in terms of exposure but reeling in these would be customers with freebies can also be risky says robert d hisrich director of the entrepreneurship center at the thunderbird school of global management in glendale ariz "if celebrities dont like your product and they talk about it negatively thats a high risk proposition " in september for example washington wizards guard gilbert arenas criticized the design of his second signature shoe created by adidas ag before its release on his blog on the national basketball associations web site since then adidas has redesigned the shoe targeting celebrities can be tricky expensive and ultimately fruitless even business owners who succeed at getting a product into a stars hands need to parlay that brief moment into a lasting way to generate sales pitfall gbp thinking more is better tim berry the founder of palo alto software inc and a business planning consultant in eugene ore learned the hard way that business owners can give away too much to too many people at a trade show a few years ago berry offered a chance to win free business planning software to attendees who submitted their business cards after three days he collected six fishbowls full of business cards however during the follow up berry learned that "most people dropped their card in just to get something free " he says the next year after offering more information about the software rather than giving it away he estimates that his effort returned one third of a fishbowl full of business cards even though there were fewer submissions berry says "these people were seriously interested in business planning " be sure to give freebies only to your target customers "otherwise youll waste time and money " he says pitfall gbp giving away products that dont make sense for entrepreneurs who sell big ticket items its not economical to give away those products for free instead its best to hand out less expensive promotional products but make sure those freebies have a tie in with your product or brand marketing consultants say if your company sells tires for example dont give away balloons or lollipops instead suggests berry give away a free tire pressure gauge and make sure giveaways encourage future business for example a bank that wants to attract customers to its full line of financial services shouldnt just give away free checking instead a better strategy is to offer free or discounted financial services for those who sign up for an account pitfall gbp diluting your products value if youre too quick to give stuff away people might begin to question why instead of triggering future purchases consumers may decide that your product isnt worth as much thats because "what you give away for free is generally not respected as much as something you pay for " says nicholas e bade author of "marketing without money for small and midsize businesses " the solution is to attach some strings to your giveaways he says for example offer customers a free product when they buy one or instead of totally free provide a discount bade suggests for ongoing product offerings such as a magazine subscription or a service provide an introductory discount rate that way he says "you induce sampling but also create customers " another good idea is "giving away something different than what you offer in the marketplace " says thunderbirds hisrich for instance a sample size of a product rather than a full size version can pique a customers interest and spur future sales pitfall gbp failing to follow up the most important aspect of giveaways is the follow up says jay conrad levinson author of the "guerilla marketing" series of books in debary fla "youre not supposed to make money on the first sale its the follow up or the repeat business where your profits come from " he says to ease your efforts be sure to get your customers email information if they purchased a product follow up with a thank you and possibly a complimentary product suggestion to get addresses be sure to offer value such as discounts coupons or even a newsletter in exchange you can also use email to introduce your web site for further product information "starting up " a weekly column written by diana ransom for smsmallbiz com follows entrepreneurs through the early stages of launching a business write to her at dransom smartmoney
