citis deal may be wiser than thought at first glance citigroup looks like it paid a dear price to the abu dhabi investment authority for its &# billion capital infusion this week citigroup in exchange for abu dhabis investment to buttress citigroups coffers agreed to issue convertible preferred shares to the middle eastern sovereign wealth fund the shares will convert to a stake in the bank in about three years and citigroup will pay abu dhabi an interest rate in the interim critics said citigroup was taken to the cleaners by abu dhabi and pointed out that even companies rated junk only pay interest rates but looks can be deceiving details of the deal which is private are scant and therefore analysts say it is difficult to value however many agree that the dividend on the preferred shares isnt unreasonable compared with the dividend yield on citigroups common shares at the time the deal was announced looked at this way abu dhabi is getting a percentage point premium for stepping up when everyone else was fleeing the sector in addition the structure of the deal limits abu dhabis upside and the potential dilution of citigroup shares other reasons why the investment fund should get a premium to the dividend finally abu dhabis ability to sell its shares will be restricted through in this deal abu dhabis shares will convert into citigroup common stock between march and september with the amount of the shares to be determined by where citigroup shares are trading the terms include a lower strike price of &# and a cap of &# the lower strike price limits abu dhabis downside but also caps its upside if the share price increases sharply the number of common shares granted to abu dhabi falls as the share price rises if it rises to &# or above abu dhabi will receive a maximum of million shares but if it falls to &# or below the fund receives million if the price is within the range abu dhabi gets some amount of shares in between depending on an undisclosed formula traders call this range which limits abu dhabis upside the "dead zone " for its part citigroup managed to raise tax deductible tier one capital it has also locked in a long term investor who has promised not to meddle much in its daily affairs which in this age of shareholder disgruntlement and activism could be worth its weight in gold
