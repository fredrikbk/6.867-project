wonder land does reading matter time pressed christmas shoppers who visit amazon com nowadays see a homepage pushing kindle kindle is amazons "revolutionary wireless reading device " this ambitious &# and ultimately admirable gadget springs from the hopes of amazons visionary founder jeff bezos whose e company began with books but in time found that profitability required the selling of things that people prefer to do with their ever dwindling free time it was hard not to notice that kindle was born unto us about the same moment the national endowment for the arts released a report on readings sad lot in our time amid much other horrifying data it revealed that the average to year old spends seven minutes daily on "voluntary" reading cheerfully this number rises to minutes on weekends an earlier equally grim nea report "reading at risk " announced the collapse of interest in reading literature basically books this newer study widened the definition of "reading" to include magazines newspapers and online leisure no matter even if the definition of literate life includes persons who spend their seven voluntary minutes with "instyle" magazine or online reviews of hdtvs the report still suggests that unmandated reading is heading for the basement as someone whose professional hero up to now was johannes gutenberg im obviously cheering for mr bezoss kindle whose pages appear in a book like technology called e ink it must be counted as good news that amazons web site says the first run of the kindle machines is sold out a spokesman said they wont disclose how many hmmm still one must ask are kindles early adopters the leading edge of a new literate future or a small fanatic band of bookish monks like those in walter m miller jr s sci fi classic "a canticle for leibowitz" not yet available on kindle who preserved books in a post nuclear apocalypse are we in a post digital apocalypse for serious reading and if so does it matter the nea authors posit "greater academic professional and civic benefits" with high levels of leisure reading in other words readers profit at least in their souls from time spent with works of the imagination or with books that explain the past i agree herewith however an anecdote that may suggest one reason for the decline at a wall street journal focus group session awhile ago the facilitator asked young professionals readers of the journal about their reading habits i was struck by the comment of a something woman "look " she said "i spend my entire day at work on a computer when i go home at night i just want to read something " she no doubt would be one of leibowitzs monks the fact is that many people who used to read a lot today have jobs that require staring at a screen smart people work long hours mostly onscreen ingesting things like legal documents commercial leases prospectuses for initial public offerings yahoo headlines and whatever computer engineers read then they crawl home at night to play video games or watch season three of "" from netflix rolling your eyeballs across endless snowdrifts of pixels hours a day even for good money is tiring thus post pixel reading defaults to absorbing the synopsis on the back of a dvd box if you can read angelina jolies name what else do you need to know one criticism of the nea studies is that they dont capture the "new" ways people read away from work this means the endowment doesnt validate new pastimes such as reading text messages on cell phone screens add the input output of text messaging to the data base of readers and the daily voluntary reading time likely rises from seven minutes to six or seven hours is this literacy in years no one may ask this is an inventive age though so it was inevitable that smart people would devise a response to the flight from literature french professor pierre bayard has written a book called "how to talk about books you havent read " he suggests we skim rather than read the classics a less suspect fix is the web site dailylit com its a site for people beset with guilt because they dont "read" anymore select one of their classics or poetry and theyll push five minutes of it to your email box each day at the same hour i read f scott fitzgeralds "the beautiful and damned" this way the story was fantastically depressing but the expiation helped one wonders if readings status isnt more complex unlike years ago when most of ones acquaintances could at least talk about cheever malamud updike plath baldwin mailer et al there is no longer a common conversation about literature today its come down to one book harry potter maybe two "the kite runner " and yes a million people will read david mcculloughs grand "" and talk about it but other than oprah the institutional agenda setters and critics that created the common conversation are gone anecdotally though there seems to be an amazing amount of real reading going on a recent phenomenon on the streets of new york is people walking amid crowds their nose in a book one sees it all the time the subways are full of people reading books on just one subway car this tuesday one saw "tales from da hood" by nikki turner "the catcher in the rye " "dont know much about history" by kenneth davis small book clubs abound as do book web sites there are small presses dedicated to writers "no one" is aware of beyond several thousand loyal acolytes but they are reading it isnt just books theres no common conversation about popular music either musics subcategories now are endless and arcane other than movies still seen together in theaters cultural interests once widely shared have subdivided into many discrete communities but the neas broader policy issue still holds will people who simply stop "reading" be at a disadvantage yes in the future i suspect that the adept "readers" will be telling the non readers what to do a canticle perhaps for the next leibowitz see related letter "letters to the editor joy of reading for pleasure" wsj dec
