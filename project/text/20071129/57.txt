how private equity payoff misses some study says workers face more cutbacks than similar firms though private equity firms say they their decisions make companies healthier it turns out the payoff isnt always so great for the rank and file according to the preliminary summary of a study on private equity job creation the widely anticipated study presented at a conference tuesday at the american enterprise institute in washington compares net changes in employment at buyout backed firms to the net changes at firms of similar size and age it reveals a few intriguing nuggets over the first five years of ownership private equity firms reduce their work forces by amounts greater than the other companies the losses come mostly in the second and third years and cuts are greater in retail businesses than in industrial companies the researchers include steven davis of the university of chicagos graduate school of business and josh lerner of harvard business school they stressed that their findings are not yet complete particularly the researchers have not yet calculated how many jobs are added within private equity backed companies as a result of newly opened facilities the results "can look very different once we factor in those facilities " mr lerner said nevertheless the final results are likely to play a prominent role in discussions about the economic impact of private equity firms a topic that suffers from a dearth of reliable data "theres huge political interest in this question " mr davis said private equity firms came under new scrutiny in washington this year as democrats took control of congress and expressed concern that wealthy equity managers are able to pay a capital gains rate instead of higher ordinary income tax rates on much of their compensation beyond the beltway there is an even fiercer struggle over the public image of these increasingly influential buyout firms the firms have stressed their importance as reformers of broken companies at a recent european conference blackstone group chief executive stephen schwarzman described the industrys role "we take the tough unpopular decisions that other management teams dodge we move people from jobs rooted in the past into the jobs of the future in the markets set to grow " messrs davis and lerner working with staff of the u s census bureau analyzed buyout deals in the u s between and to calculate the impact of private equity ownership on companies employment they found that companies owned by buyout firms maintained employment levels on par with competitors in the first year after a buyout however their employment levels dropped in relation to competitors during the second and third years by the end of five years job growth within private equity backed companies was a "few percentage points" lower than competitors mr lerner said in some cases that means those companies eliminated more jobs than competitors in other cases it means they simply added fewer new workers to the payroll additional differences surfaced when the researchers broke down results by industry sectors within the manufacturing sector for example where buyout firms make lots of acquisitions lbo backed firms maintained employment levels very similar to competitors within the retail sector however lbo backed companies maintained significantly lower levels the researchers acknowledged that many questions remain unanswered and said they would try to address these points when they present their final findings at the upcoming world economic forum meeting in davos switzerland sarah lueck and matthew monks contributed to this article
