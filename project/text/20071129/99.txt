regulators to deal france telecoms hand after operating in crisis mode during his first year and a half on the job didier lombard has righted the ship at france telecom sa but whether the turnaround can last now depends largely on regulatory decisions out of his control when he took over as chief executive in late february mr lombard a former engineer who is now years old had to contend with repeated profit warnings as the companys core fixed telephone business hemorrhaged clients the stock price fell about between march and august since then mr lombard has managed to generate growth and profits by succeeding at a strategy where others such as telecom italia spa had stumbled selling services that meld the companys fixed line mobile and broadband networks such as internet television and mobile video those new services accounted for of its revenue in mature markets in the first half of this year up from in the same period last year france telecom reported net income of billion euros &# billion and revenue of billion euros last year "weve found a new equilibrium between our old services and our new services " mr lombard said in an interview the stock is up more than year to date mirroring a good year for most european telecommunications stocks and this week the group is throwing lavish parties as it launches apple inc s iphone in france and inaugurates a new store on the champs elysees it may not be smooth sailing from here on mr lombard faces significant challenges in mobile and in broadband and how they turn out will affect france telecoms profitability and growth french regulators are weighing issuing a license for high speed mobile service to a fourth operator which would usher in more price competition and lower margins in what has been one of europes cushier markets in october the government held up the sole bid from frances iliad sa over terms of the deal but there are signs the government might consider a compromise to allow the license to be issued in a report credit suisse analyst david george estimated that a new mobile phone competitor in france would lower "medium term" earnings per share forecasts by to mr lombard played down such concerns "the market is very worried about this but i am not " he said experience in other european markets shows that any new competitor would have trouble taking clients from established operators he argues and a new entrant wouldnt arrive until at the earliest "i will have lots of time to prepare " he said the other challenge looming is the construction in coming years of a next generation fiber network to supply very high speed broadband spurred on by nimbler competitors like neuf cegetel sa and iliads free with ambitious fiber plans france telecom has begun laying a fiber network in paris and a few select cities but regulatory and political factors will likely affect the overall cost of the network and shape the competitive dynamics even after the french regulator said yesterday that france telecom would have to share certain parts of the network such as underground ducts the details of prices and access will be a subject of contention among operators for at least another year the government which still owns about of france telecom could also pressure the former state monopoly to lay fiber to every little town in the french countryside driving up costs and driving down average revenue per user raj sinha an analyst with j p morgan securities said the cost of building the network could swell to billion euros from billion euros depending on such factors mr lombard denied there was any political pressure on him and said the market would drive his decisions on fiber "i have to answer to my shareholders so i will build only if and when i can achieve a reasonable return " he also has been careful to call the period through the end of a "predeployment stage" of fiber and investments will be limited to about million euros "there is no plan on fiber yet " he said "i havent made up my mind yet about how to proceed " although france telecom will try to influence the regulatory debates it faces somewhat of an uphill battle despite its deep historical ties with the state regulators have promoted competition in telecom services often at its expense mr lombard remains upbeat about the progress france telecom has made in reshaping itself the company unveiled a series of new gizmos and services at a "fashion show" for the press on tuesday including a mobile payment system designed for emerging markets and a souped up home media library that allows users to access all their photos music and videos remotely from a mobile phone or computer
