the evening wrap beijing blinks online edition with trade politics on a steady boil the bush administration announced today that china has agreed to settle some u s complaints about unfair subsidies to its exporters the deal which stems from a u s filing before the world trade organization in february was hammered out in extensive discussions and could signal a significant development in the sometimes tense economic relationship between the two trading giants according to u s trade representative susan schwab china agreed to cut tax breaks that encouraged chinese companies to ship more goods to the u s and other countries china also assented to cutting tax and tariff penalties that hamper foreign companies trying to sell products in china such measures critics contend have helped fuel the countrys huge trade surplus with many of its major trading partners so why did china decide to settle this case now "first of all the chinese were going to lose on the legal merits on these cases " said gary hufbauer a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics "nothings a slam dunk but it was pretty straightforward that the u s had a strong legal case on these practices " but its likely politics also played into chinese decision making mr hufbauer said saying beijing would like to "lower the temperature on capitol hill " democrats in congress have been critical of the administrations trade policy in particular vis a vis china which rang up a &# billion surplus with the u s last year "chinas currency doesnt float freely certain u s industries with competitive advantages cant operate freely in chinas economy and some of the products it exports are faulty and dangerous " said sen charles schumer d n y of todays announcement "it seems that china has taken a small step on the long road toward playing more fairly in global trade but only time will tell " trade tensions have even broken out among republicans a wall street journal nbc news poll last month showed that by a nearly to margin republican voters believe free trade is bad for the u s economy a shift in opinion that mirrors democratic views and suggests trade deals could face high hurdles under a new president a spate of recalls regarding unsafe toys many manufactured in china have added to available ammunition for those seeking to criticize trade todays deal comes just a little more than two weeks before treasury secretary henry paulson is slated to head up a cabinet level delegation to china for a third round in the u s china strategic economic dialogue the bush administration can use todays news to point to progress in that effort but theres still plenty to talk about in another pending wto case the u s has accused china of not clamping down on rampant copyright piracy of u s products a separate case contends china is hampering the sale of american movies music and books through its censorship rules and another u s case filed along with the nation european union charges china with maintaining a wto illegal tax system to block imports of foreign made auto parts "the chinese may very well settle some of those cases for the same combination of reasons " said mr hufbauer "theyre going to lose and why not get some sort of political advantage " markets close slightly higher a massive two day stock rally wobbled but the markets stayed positive
