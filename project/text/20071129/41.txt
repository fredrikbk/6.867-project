fashion journal style showdown &# sweater faces &# rival its one of the abiding mysteries of fashion is it really worth paying &# for a white cotton blouse or &# for one of the turtleneck sweaters we see in high end stores and magazines if the labels fell off would these basic items still feel like theyre worth so much the question arises more often these days as stores like zara and h&amp m thrive on selling inexpensive fashions that resemble those of high end designers like chanel and dior with the holiday gift giving season upon us i decided to put a couple of standard sweaters to the test while i anticipated differences in style and quality i was unprepared for the political issues that arose from my study of these two sweaters what started out as a look at fashion choices turned into a lesson on globalization for this test we chose two cashmere sweaters from clothiers with excellent reputations for quality and service one at each end of the price spectrum one came from lands end and cost &# before tax and shipping the other from italian luxury cashmere maker brunello cucinelli cost &# before tax and the valet parking fee at saks fifth avenue in beverly hills the sweaters are outwardly similar long sleeved black mock turtlenecks knitted with two ply yarn which means each string is made of two strands that have been twisted together both sweaters are made of cashmere combed from mongolian goats which are said to grow fine long hairs to survive the tough winters the long hair leads to less pilling which is a real sweater killer and both garments arrived with deficiencies my lands end sweater felt stiff and glossy after wearing it twice i tossed it in the delicate cycle of my washing machine and it emerged soft and supple i chose a style called a "cashmere tee" that is trimmer and more feminine than the companys core big and snuggly cashmeres new this fall the mock turtle is cut to layer under a jacket despite the fresh styling it lacks sophistication and the fabric tends to wrinkle particularly at the crook of the arm still its an attractive basic sweater soft comfy and hey the price was right according to michele casper a spokeswoman for lands end it should last for many years if not she noted i can exchange the item or get a refund "everything we sell at lands end is guaranteed period " the cucinelli sweater has a springier weave that drapes gracefully and hasnt wrinkled or bagged at stretch points it was a little more uniformly soft than the lands end fabric while all mongolian goat hair is prized prices vary according to quality and some italian manufacturers pride themselves on buying the best grades of cashmere at auction one reason for some sweaters higher prices the sweater also has subtly stylish details such as small buttons at the back of the neck that make it easy to pull the sweater over a hairdo and makeup thats a nice feature but when i got it home i discovered the sweater had unraveled at the teardrop opening at the nape of the neck this required a tiresome trip back to saks where they repaired the tear telling me that if it happens again i should bring it right back at that price they can count on it but cucinelli should probably incorporate some sort of reinforcement at that pressure point a spokesman for the designer called the flaw a "fluke" and said cucinelli has a damage return rate of just the standout facets of the cucinelli sweater are sleeves that taper at the forearm and then flare at the wrist and layers of silk chiffon that have been hand sewn at the neck and wrists my friend roberta tried it on "it does feel really nice on my neck " she said noodling her head around these style details drew attention as i wore the sweater the lands end sweater garnered no compliments but people looked stunned if i told them the price so there were style differences between the luxurious designer sweater and its counterpart however solidly made another sort of distinction emerged as i learned how each sweater was manufactured the goat hairs took very different paths after being bundled into bales and taken to auction in mongolia the label of the lands end sweater says "made in china " lands end gave me an extensive primer on its mongolian yarns but it turned out that the company isnt involved in that part of the process it purchases the finished sweaters from a factory in china and its the factory that buys cashmere at auction ms casper said the chinese factory spins cards combs and dyes the yarn and weaves it into garments according to lands ends specifications lands end she said tests the results and requires the factory to meet "all compliances" from sears holding corp which owns lands end she declined to elaborate or to divulge the name of the factory or even the region of china where its located she did say "the cashmere factories are very clean and feature all state of the art updated equipment the employees feel honored to be employed there " i was troubled by the companys reticence about the factory that made my sweater this came against a backdrop of news stories out of chinas industrial sector that included recalls of toys toothpaste and other consumer products many people have seen film and photos of chinese factory workers living in sparse dormitories far from home and working long hours concerns about chinese labor and manufacturing standards have led to the recent increase in "made in the usa" labels on products made here all this contrasts sharply with brunello cucinelli a company founded in by year old designer brunello cucinelli both the saks saleswoman and massimo caronna cucinellis u s spokesman and owner of italian fashion distributor imc group eagerly elaborated on the manufacturing mr caronna even invited me to visit the factory where my sweater was made in the tiny italian village of solomeo in umbria though i didnt make the trip according to him the goat hairs in my sweater traveled in bales from mongolia to one of several factories in italy where it was made into yarn cucinelli buys about of its yarn from the italian luxury thread purveyor cariaggi the yarn was then shipped to the cucinelli factory which is in a th century castle each of its employees has a key says mr caronna they work each day from a m until p m breaking for a minute lunch many go home for lunch but mr caronna says that those who stay are served a free three course meal cooked up by three local women who shop for fresh groceries every morning employees return to work from until p m and then head home mr cucinelli wanted to improve on the conditions he saw his father endure as a farm laborer mr caronna says the designer has donated some company profits to improvements in solomeo such as restoring the town square building a local school and most recently constructing a town theater the company which competes with loro piana and also owns the gunex and riva monti fashion lines expects revenue of &# million in mr caronna said the italian manufacturing process also explains a little more about the cost of my &# sweater hand work allows sophisticated design details like the chiffon that would be impossible in a garment made entirely by machine and of the factory employees are devoted to quality control before leaving the factory every item is washed by hand one reason the cucinelli sweater arrived softer than the lands end lands end wont tell us details such as whether its chinese factory has paid for local schools or serves its workers free three course meals but its safe to say that the cucinelli is the superior sweater when it comes to style quality and global social awareness whether its worth nearly times the price though is a matter for you and your wallet
