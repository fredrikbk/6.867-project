will bofa laugh last bet on countrywide looks funny to some but patience may pay in the three months since bank of america corp made a &# billion investment in countrywide financial corp the value of the countrys biggest mortgage lender has fallen precipitously on paper the stake now looks to be worth only about &# billion and some wall street analysts have begun snickering however even in a worst case scenario the investment could still hold important strategic long term value for bank of america due to some of the particulars of the deal the conventional wisdom among some rivals investors and analysts is that bank of america soon may be forced to make an even bigger infusion into countrywide to bolster the company which is also one of its major corporate clients if history is a measure bank of america wont do that at least not anytime soon bank of america the biggest u s bank by market value grew to its gargantuan size by gobbling up companies coast to coast often those banks were in major distress and bank of america seized that advantage people familiar with the thinking in its executive suite say the company is in wait and see mode for one thing the bank has long aspired to become a big player in the mortgage business which has historically been small relative to the size of the bank the two companies once mulled a joint venture that would have put countrywide technology and staff into bank of americas ubiquitous branches those types of discussions are now on indefinite hold as the companies sort through the credit crisis in an interview last month bank of americas chief executive kenneth d lewis described the stake as a passive investment "we dont have a lot of contact with countrywide other than as a client " mr lewis said meanwhile bank of america has already emerged on its own as more of a player in the current mortgage market fueled by a new "no fee" mortgage product bank of america was the highest volume u s retail mortgage lender in this years first nine months according to inside mortgage finance a trade publication countrywide is still the biggest in overall mortgage lending including loans arranged by brokers and bought from small mortgage banks yet it is struggling with rising defaults falling loan volumes and declining home prices which reduce the value of collateral its unclear how serious countrywides problems really are ceo angelo mozilo is adamant that countrywide has ample cash and borrowing capacity to meet obligations and has predicted a quick return to profitability just last week countrywide was rocked by mortgage related jitters prompting it to take the unusual step of issuing a statement denying rumors that it was near bankruptcy countrywide declined to comment for this article even if countrywide were to fail bank of americas stake still could have important value for the firm one significant factor in return for its &# billion investment bank of america was given first right of refusal to buy countrywide if it were put up for sale bank of america also has the right to meet any competitors bid some analysts say mr lewis is prepared to sacrifice some of his initial investment if it meant he got a better deal on buying countrywide assets such as its product suite and loan processing technology "he did it to plant a flag and keep others away " said bank analyst nancy bush of nab research in aiken s c she compares the countrywide strategy to the banks snapping up credit card giant mbna corp in largely to keep it out of the hands of competitors such as cross town rival wachovia corp bank of americas &# billion investment isnt quite as shaky as it may look at first glance the bank invested in countrywide nonvoting convertible preferred stock which can be converted into common stock at a price of &# a share but until that option is exercised the investment operates much like a convertible bond paying a dividend or &# million annually the first quarterly payment was due earlier this month bank of america and countrywide declined to comment on whether it was paid bank of america still views the stake as a good investment although a person familiar with the thinking of top executives described it as "more on the margins than it initially appeared " it was a different picture on aug when the bank announced the deal boasting that it was making a smart investment for shareholders and doing its part to stabilize the nations biggest mortgage lender bank of america first appeared to have tallied a quick &# million paper profit as countrywide shares rallied on the news of the investment countrywide shares have since tumbled amid prolonged turmoil in the mortgage market and fear of potentially debilitating losses in countrywide mortgages as low teaser rates reset countrywide shares fell to &# off cents or in new york stock exchange p m composite trading yesterday while bank of america shares rose or &# to &# also on the big board bank of america points out that if countrywide were to seek bankruptcy law protection the bank would be in line to be repaid behind bondholders but ahead of common shareholders if any other party purchased countrywide the new owner would still be on the hook for the full &# billion obligation the chances that countrywide could have to seek court protection in the traditional sense seem remote to some bank analysts in part because of the companys deep relationship with the federal government the deposits in its banking arm are federally insured and it has borrowed heavily from the quasigovernmental federal home loan bank in atlanta in its corporate history bank of america has a precedent for letting one of its struggling investments sweat out its troubles a bit in one deal in bank of america then called nationsbank corp bought a &# million stake in and an option to buy a struggling baltimore bank called mnc financial inc it had assets of &# billion when the investment was made but was facing losses in its commercial real estate portfolio as mncs situation deteriorated bank of america was pressed to invest more to help right the ship but then chief executive hugh mccoll mentor to current bank of america chairman and ceo mr lewis refused seven months after buying the initial stake bank of america snapped up mnc in a stock swap valued at &# billion or times book value a bargain compared to the average two times book value of other bank deals that year regarding countrywide analyst richard x bove of punk ziegel &amp co argues that if it were indeed to fail the federal government would facilitate a sale to bank of america much as many believe that regulators encouraged bank of america to take the stake in the first place in that respect mr bove compares a potential takeover to the legendary maneuver in of firstrepublic then the largest bank in texas bank of america got its foothold in texas for a bargain with huge tax benefits mr bove says that if countrywide got in deeper trouble regulators might also be willing to waive regulatory limits that bar any u s bank from an acquisition giving it more than of total u s bank deposits "ken lewis was happy to do it even at &# billion and overpriced because the position it puts him in to buy this company is extraordinarily good " said mr bove who recently raised his rating on bank of america shares from "hold" to "buy " james r hagerty contributed to
