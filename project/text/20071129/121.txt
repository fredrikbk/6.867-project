whats next in pakistan pervez musharraf was sworn in as pakistans civilian president today after doing what opposition leaders in his country and the bush administration have been asking him to do for some time resign as army chief the move has helped clear the way for elections early next year but those elections will be neither free nor fair unless mr musharraf does much more to restore the rule of law and repair the damage hes done to pakistans civil society and constitution mr musharrafs desire to change pakistans politics the justification for a coup ousting then prime minister nawaz sharif remains unfulfilled indeed mr sharifs return to pakistan on sunday after eight years in exile points out the poverty of mr musharrafs idea of reforming pakistani politics without democratic political participation mr sharif it would seem was allowed to return in the hope that his old rivalry with another former prime minister benazir bhutto would be rekindled and ideological polarization would enable mr musharraf to remain in power although ms bhutto and mr sharif agreed to a "charter of democracy" last year and represent strong populist constituencies their ideological differences are quite pronounced ms bhutto stands for modernity and identifies closely with the west her pakistan peoples party is the countrys largest political organization that describes itself as social democratic and has feuded often with pakistans entrenched civil military oligarchy she spent her years in exile writing in american and english publications and lecturing at u s universities her opposition to islamist extremism and jihadism is unequivocal mr sharif on the other hand is a religious conservative who started his political career as a protege of former military dictator gen zia ul haq in his tenure as prime minister plagued by accusations of corruption he tried to impose shariah law in the country after the coup he was jailed and then exiled to saudi arabia after promising to stay out of politics for years he returned to pakistan on a special plane provided by king abdullah overall mr sharif is more acceptable to the religious elements within pakistans army and intelligence services that ran pakistan before and remain influential within the country he too is opposed to islamist terrorism but is likely to be more compromising towards extremist groups the fact that ms bhuttos homecoming rally was targeted by suicide bombers while mr sharif faced no such threat highlights the different attitude of islamist terrorists towards the two leaders mr sharifs pakistan muslim league is divided into two factions one led by him and the other supporting mr musharraf even if mr musharraf seems averse to the idea many in the pakistan army and intelligence services would like the two factions to unite in the hope that pro jihadi elements within the security services could then reassert their influence while the u s appears to be giving mixed signals to mr musharraf the british commonwealths decision to suspend pakistans membership until certain benchmarks for the restoration of democracy are met is the right message for pakistans military leadership although mr musharraf has stepped down as army chief he has not lifted the nov imposition of martial law disguised as a state of emergency he has also issued decrees that allow him to wield draconian powers even after he lifts the state of emergency mr musharrafs hand picked supreme court has rubber stamped all his decisions while the majority of judges of the original court remain under house arrest yes legislative elections have been scheduled for jan and more than of the estimated people arrested under the emergency decree have been released but these partial steps are meant to silence critics without changing the reality on the ground few pakistanis believe that a free and fair election can be held without a free judiciary a free media or freedom for political parties to campaign many candidates and campaign workers of major opposition parties remain in prison mr musharraf has stacked the election commission and the caretaker cabinet which under pakistani law must be neutral during the run up to elections with his own supporters u s public opinion is solidly against mr musharrafs autocratic measures according to a poll by opinion dynamics released by fox news this week of those surveyed said "yes" in response to the question "do you think the united states should cut off aid to pakistan until the state of emergency is lifted and democracy is restored " thirty four percent disagreed and expressed no opinion the bush administration however seems willing to let mr musharraf get away with suspending pakistans constitution and sacking independent supreme court judges now that hes resigned his army post and promised to hold elections the administrations reasoning appears to be based on the limits of u s influence within pakistan and the need for gratitude toward an ally in the war against terror but mr musharrafs stepping down as army chief and holding elections in an atmosphere of intimidation would not make pakistan a democracy it would make pakistan resemble many of americas middle eastern allies notably egypt where elections are routinely held and a weak civil society survives at the sufferance of a dictatorship subsidized with american aid for his part mr musharraf is unhappy with even the limited criticism of his policies by u s officials he has said that he feels "let down by the west" and "betrayed by the media " he recently spoke of ms bhutto as "the darling of the west" a disparaging reference to stalled u s efforts for a negotiated transition to democracy that would have accommodated mr musharraf as a civilian president and allowed ms bhuttos election as prime minister yet it is mr musharraf not ms bhutto who has received billions of dollars in aid from "the west" and personal praise from a long list of u s luminaries ranging from president bush to former defense secretary donald rumsfeld mr musharraf has been proud of his american connections citing on more than one occasion u s support since as somehow conferring legitimacy on his military regime now however it is useful for him to pretend the west has turned its back on him and through no fault of his own in doing so mr musharraf is following in the footsteps of the shah of iran ferdinand marcos of the philippines and manuel noriega of panama challenged by their own people each one of these u s backed authoritarian rulers blamed the america for failing to understand their compulsions and for creating the circumstances that eventually led to their downfall the uproar against mr musharraf has been caused by his disregard for pakistans constitution and his disrespect for the rule of law not by his support of u s policy in the region and the war on terror last saturdays deadly terrorist attacks outside pakistans military headquarters prove that martial law has not improved the pakistani governments ability to fight terrorists the way forward does not lie in legal or political maneuvers by mr musharraf or for the military to cling to power this would only result in greater instability a better course would be the creation of a government of national consensus comprising secular and moderate politicians and civic leaders such a government could mobilize popular support for the war against terrorism and prosecute that war effectively while ushering in a transition to democracy through free impartial and fair polls yesterday president bush helped clarify u s policy by saying mr musharraf has "got to suspend the emergency law before elections " he might also make it clear to mr musharraf that foreign policy cooperation does not give him license to trample pakistans constitution underfoot mr haqqani director of boston universitys center for international relations is the author of "pakistan between mosque and military" carnegie endowment hes also served as adviser to several pakistani prime ministers including ms bhutto
