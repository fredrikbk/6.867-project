maxed out as medical costs soar the insured face huge tab jim dawson hit cap after hospital padding the &# million bill merced calif one day in late july jim dawson happily returned home he had spent the previous five months in the hospital battling an infection that nearly killed him the phone rang shortly after mr dawson and his wife loretta entered their house it was the hospital california pacific medical center was calling to remind the dawsons that they owed it &# million mr dawson years old had health insurance through his employer but had maxed out his plans &# million lifetime cap halfway through his long hospital stay in addition to the bill from cpmc mr dawson owed tens of thousands of dollars more to scores of doctors who were involved in his care mr dawson and his wifes combined assets totaled a fraction of their medical debt "i had never thought in a million years that anything like that could ever happen " says mrs dawson as spending on health care has climbed to almost &# trillion a year or of the u s economy the number of americans burdened with massive medical bills has soared as well according to a survey by the commonwealth fund an estimated of adults aged to face problems with medical bills or have accrued medical debt a majority of those people had health insurance the survey found million dollar medical bills like mr dawsons while still unusual are becoming more common as insurance policies once thought to provide catastrophic coverage prove inadequate when it comes to high cost illnesses part of the problem even as medical progress and new technologies raise health care costs health plans have been slow to raise their caps mr dawsons &# million cap was relatively generous by todays standards the segal company an employee benefits consulting firm says the average health plan cap among companies it advises is &# million a person the same as it was in the s when the purchasing power of &# million was the equivalent of nearly &# million today another issue is the widespread practice of bill padding by hospitals and other health providers while hospitals say bill padding is their only defense against the aggressive cost reduction efforts of insurers and government programs the end result is that individuals can with little warning be left stuck with wildly inflated medical bills for instance cpmc charged mr dawson &# for stockings designed to improve blood circulation the same pair can be purchased on the internet for as little as &# allan pont cpmcs chief medical officer acknowledges that the charges on mr dawsons bill are "disneyland numbers" that health insurers and government programs like medicare and medicaid never pay but he says they reflect the hospitals operating costs such as paying for doctors nurses and medical equipment as well as markups to compensate for the fact that cpmc collects only a fraction of what it bills every year mr dawsons health calamity and the resulting &# million in health care bills it generated was due to a staph infection a bacterial skin infection that is usually easily cured if caught early but mr dawsons condition was missed by various doctors and spread throughout his body for years mr dawson worked for oil refiner valero energy corp and its predecessor companies selling gasoline products to gas stations across california big and burly and with a deadpan sense of humor mr dawson spent much of his work life on the road in late mr dawson noticed strange dry spots on his right arm over the course of the next nine months they grew into big calluses and mr dawson took to hiding them under bandages he felt ok but the calluses were unsightly in september mr dawson went to see his primary care physician patrick golden in fresno calif dr golden referred him to a dermatologist who gave mr dawson an injection the calluses disappeared within days but mr dawsons health began to sharply deteriorate in mid november he was on a business trip in victorville calif when excruciating back pain woke him in the middle of the night he checked out of his hotel in his pajamas and drove home to merced a small middle class city miles southeast of san francisco after lying in bed for two days mr dawson didnt feel any better and couldnt move his right arm worried mrs dawson decided to take her husband to the emergency room at emanuel medical center in turlock minutes away mr dawson was hospitalized there but his wife checked him out after three days because she says the hospital seemed unable to determine what was wrong and she felt he wasnt being properly cared for john gilbert a spokesman for emanuel medical center says mr dawson was examined by an internist who consulted with four other specialists he says the hospital diagnosed mr dawson with cellulitis of the hand disintegrating back discs chronic kidney disease acute renal failure and gout a form of arthritis characterized by sudden attacks of pain and tenderness in joints no one realized it at the time but all were likely consequences of the staph "we feel that he was provided good care " mr gilbert says emanuel billed valeros health plan &# for the three day stay using its bargaining leverage as a large plan valeros health plan negotiated the amount it paid down to &# mr dawson returned to see dr golden who only diagnosed him with gout dr golden gave him painkillers for his back and an anti inflammatory drug to reduce swelling in his arm but mr dawson continued to feel ill and lost his appetite in just a few months he went from pounds to pounds his skin turned grayish and he continued to experience terrible back pain in february mr dawson collapsed at a convention in las vegas mrs dawson and their year old son noel drove miles from merced to pick him up mr dawson went back to see dr golden but he says dr golden continued to maintain that his condition wasnt serious and told him to return for a checkup in days reached at his office in fresno dr golden declined to comment with her husband looking sicker by the day mrs dawson grew frantic thinking mr dawson was suffering from a spine infection she called her dentist who she knew had back problems he recommended going to the spine center at seton medical center in daly city on march mr dawson was admitted to seton delirious and screaming it was there doctors realized he had a staph infection that had spread through his bloodstream and invaded his entire body his organs were failing and he was going into septic shock a nurse told mrs dawson her husband was very sick and might die doctors at seton began treating mr dawson with massive doses of antibiotics but surmised they wouldnt be able to cure him unless they removed mr dawsons pacemaker which was encased in bacteria mr dawson had been carrying the device in his chest since the surgery didnt go well one of the pacemakers two leads wires that connect the device to the heart broke off as it was being extracted and remained stuck in mr dawsons right ventricle on april mr dawson was transferred to cpmc in san francisco a leading cardiac hospital in the region the dawsons wouldnt find out until later but the six week stay at seton was costly the hospital billed valeros health plan &# after negotiating a &# discount valeros plan paid &# more than half of mr dawsons insurance had been used up a spokeswoman for seton declined to comment about mr dawsons case citing the hospitals patient privacy policy at cpmc mr dawson was operated on again the plan was to remove the broken pacemaker lead and replace part of mr dawsons infected aortic valve with the valve of a pig doctors also needed to repair another heart valve that had been damaged by the infection mrs dawson was told the odds were very low that her husband would survive the extremely complex operation but the surgery was a success and mr dawson pulled through over the next few weeks mr dawson fought through various other complications and began to recover then on june he went into cardiac arrest during a rehabilitation session he was rushed into intensive care and revived doctors decided he would need another heart operation to implant a defibrillator on june mrs dawson says she was leaving the hospital when she was ushered into a small conference room by ema beronilla an employee from cpmcs financial office she says ms beronilla told her that her husbands insurance had run out and showed her a sheet of paper indicating that they owed the hospital more than &# million valeros health plan had just paid cpmc &# for mr dawsons care through may and informed the hospital that he had maxed out his policy any additional bills were mr dawsons responsibility a spokesman for cpmc kevin mccormack confirms the meeting but says ms beronilla was merely trying to help mrs dawson understand her financial options not pressuring her to pay the bill ms beronilla handed mrs dawson forms for hospital financial assistance and for medi cal californias medicaid program the hospital bill was equivalent to several times the dawsons assets which consisted of equity in their house and a retirement savings plan mrs dawson implored ms beronilla not to tell her husband about the bill because she worried it would affect his still fragile health three days later while mrs dawson was away a man came by mr dawsons room and briefed him on the financial situation mr mccormack the hospital spokesman says that ms beronilla relayed mrs dawsons request to her supervisor and that she doesnt know who informed mr dawson "we regret that this happened " he says mr dawson always good humored took the news in stride later that day a representative for health care legal services an organization cpmc employs to coach uninsured patients on their financial options called mr dawsons room to enroll him in medi cal mrs dawson answered the phone and declined thinking her husbands income was too high to qualify him she also wanted to review their options with an attorney hcls sent the dawsons a letter stating that it was returning their account to cpmc "so that they can initiate their collection efforts " under intense emotional stress mrs dawson says she interpreted the letter as a threat an official for hcls says it wasnt trying to intimidate the dawsons but merely to educate them about available assistance programs and help them apply for them on july a defibrillator was successfully implanted in mr dawsons chest while her husband resumed his rehabilitation mrs dawson drove to palo alto to see michael gilfix a lawyer who specializes in estate planning mr gilfix told her medi cal might be willing to cover the hospital bill retroactively but to qualify their assets excluding their home had to be less than &# that meant they would either have to spend down their retirement savings plan or donate the money in it to their son giving up their retirement cushion in addition medi cal would require that the dawsons contribute any monthly income beyond &# to their medical bills mrs dawson decided to rule out medi cal because with a mortgage on their house she says there was no way they could live on that small an income valero continued to pay mr dawson his full time salary until state disability kicked in beyond the period it was obligated to according to the dawsons mr dawson was also told his job would be waiting for him even though valero could hire someone to replace him after six months he says valero declined to comment on the case citing its employees privacy cpmc discharged mr dawson on july and mrs dawson drove her husband home as they entered their house mr dawson lost his balance and fell mrs dawson was trying to help him up when the phone rang it was ms beronilla the hospitals financial counselor mrs dawson says ms beronilla reproached her for declining to meet with hcls and fill out the medi cal enrollment forms and told her the hospital would start billing immediately with her husband still splayed out on the floor mrs dawson remembers replying "do what you have to do " ms beronilla declined to comment mr mccormack the cpmc spokesman confirms the phone call he says ms beronilla called the dawsons at home only because she had unsuccessfully tried to get in touch with them before they left the hospital the purpose of the call mr mccormack adds was merely to see whether the dawsons had filled out the hospitals financial assistance forms effectively uninsured with his valero coverage exhausted mr dawson still needed close medical attention fortunately he had served in vietnam so he was eligible for care from the department of veterans affairs mr dawson enrolled in the va system and began attending physical therapy sessions at a va hospital in fresno three times a week but the va wasnt obliged to cover his previous medical bills hoping to stall cpmc mrs dawson sent the hospital two checks for &# bills were also piling up from doctors so mrs dawson also sent them small sums to keep them at bay the dawsons weighed whether to declare personal bankruptcy before they made any decision mrs dawson asked to see an itemized bill from cpmc when she received it she was shocked by how much the hospital had marked up inexpensive items like the stockings cpmc charged mr dawson between &# and &# a night for an oxygen mask to help him breathe while he slept after he was discharged from the hospital the dawsons rented one from a medical supply store for &# a month mrs dawson resolved to try to negotiate the bill drastically down "i do not deny that our charges look insane " says dr pont cpmcs chief medical officer but all hospitals operate the same way he says "its the reality of the industry " once its operating costs are factored into an items charge price dr pont says the hospital marks up that price by threefold to account for the fact that it only collects on average a third of what it bills in any given year although the nonprofit hospital reported &# million in operating income last year dr pont says the money goes to charity care cutting edge medical equipment and new facilities to comply with the states stringent earthquake safety guidelines cpmc says it dispensed &# million in charity care last year and gave another &# million to community clinics and health centers in her quest to know exactly what she was being billed for mrs dawson also asked the hospital for copies of all her husbands medical records a copy service used by the hospital called to say the copies would cost &# mrs dawson was outraged further angering her a letter from cpmcs foundation soliciting a donation came in the mail earlier this week mrs dawson was contacted by a cpmc official with surprising news the hospital said mr dawson had qualified for financial assistance under its charity care policy and wrote off his entire bill asked why the dawsons hadnt been told they could qualify for charity care before a reporter contacted the hospital cpmc said mrs dawson never gave it the opportunity to explain its policy to her told at one point that he would never walk again mr dawson is looking forward to going back to work at valero in january an avid car racing fan he recently went to see his son officiate at a race
