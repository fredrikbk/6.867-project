rights wrongs and fairness of subrogation in serious injury cases i read with great sadness your front page article "accident victims face grab for legal winnings" nov about wal marts mistreatment of a critically injured employee although deborah shank paid her premiums when healthy and would not have been individually liable for medical expenses in a general sense wal mart maintains that it has a right to seek repayment from third parties while this reasoning makes sense from an accounting and legalistic point of view in practice it is an incendiary and unjust policy wal mart has the legal high ground in this matter as it has successfully pursued its claim to a federal appellate court in so doing however it has also claimed the moral low ground wal mart argues that it has a fiduciary responsibility to its medical plan and shareholders but this is mere obfuscation companies rarely resort to recovery from such tragedies precisely because it is unseemly the fact that wal mart feels unrestrained and unrepentant in its pursuit for company justice is a shocking indictment of our culture and of this company andrew griffin wilmette ill the rationale for judicial enforcement of subrogation rights is clear otherwise the ultimately responsible person or company evades such responsibility simply because the victim of his or her misconduct had insurance coverage pursuit of subrogation claims advances the broadest societal interests by ensuring that all actors within a society ranging from the largest corporations to mom and pop shops behave responsibly and conduct their businesses so as to avoid harming others by exercising "reasonable care " however most subrogation claims arent perfected for a variety of reasons including lack of or inadequate liability insurance coverage or insubstantial assets on the part of the responsible third party tortfeasor under these circumstances the insureds of course retain the insurance proceeds paid to them and the insurer obtains no reimbursement at all for its payment of policy proceeds to its insureds while it is easy to point a finger at the insurer or a self insurer like wal mart for rightfully exercising its subrogation rights under circumstances when there are insufficient assets to compensate both the insurer and its insured for their respective damages the true responsibility for this extremely unfortunate result rests with the responsible third party that exacerbated its negligence in having caused injuries by also exercising financial irresponsibility by failing to secure ample liability insurance coverage elliott r feldman president national association of subrogation professionals edina minn employers have a fiduciary duty to recover these expenses since allowing an employee to recover "twice" for the same injury shortchanges fellow employees in the health plan and ultimately increases the cost of health care for all as sad as the facts concerning ms shank may sound there is a winner amid all of this her personal injury lawyer who promptly received approximately of ms shanks medical settlement randel johnson vice president labor immigration &amp employee benefits u s chamber of commerce washington wal mart is within its legal rights and the company has a responsibility to its stakeholders to lower health insurance costs however as wal mart donates millions to charity each year i hope that management will consider making a donation to ms shank as the old saying goes "charity begins at home " tzippora klugmann brooklyn n y the journal is to be commended for pointing out that when a catastrophically injured woman isnt fully compensated in a settlement for the lifetime cost of her care its an unimaginable economic hardship it is made doubly worse when years later the employers health plan sues her for the full share of medical costs it paid under these circumstances a better way would be to limit the health plans recovery to no more than a pro rata share of the entire amount recovered from the wrongdoer thus when recovery from the wrongdoer is inadequate to provide restitution to the injured person and to reimburse the employers health plan each party would receive a share of the recovery proportional to their loss this would serve as a standard of fairness to ease the burden of a lifetime of care and ensure that the injured person wouldnt be injured a second time by her insurance company kathleen flynn peterson president american association for justice washington
