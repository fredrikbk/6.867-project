and performed by others ten years ago bob dylan was hospitalized with pericarditis an inflammation of the lining that surrounds the heart later in he released "time out of mind " his first album of new material since its themes of love desolation and mortality coupled with mr dylans sudden medical crisis seemed to compel eulogistic reviews of his career the latest of which is "im not there " the todd haynes film in which the now year old mr dylan is portrayed at various parts of his career by six actors one of whom is cate blanchett another a left handed african american boy inventive and occasionally tedious it explains next to nothing about why mr dylan is one of the great figures of american art but a two cd album that accompanies the film also titled "im not there" sony does exactly that with tracks of dylan compositions recorded by a variety of new and veteran musicians three additional tracks are available at itunes it contains only one performance by mr dylan himself a previously unreleased version of the title track recorded during the "basement tapes" sessions in but the album reminds us why he deserves our acclaim and esteem his songs are so rich that they welcome reinvention and continue to reveal aspects of his writing a familiar line takes on a new meaning we find insight in what seemed merely a clever turn of a phrase liberated from mr dylans arrangements new relationships between his words and melodies are disclosed or we see how each song works well with different time signatures and tempos mr dylans less well known recordings are a major lode of source material for the "im not there" album and film particularly those found on "the bootleg series volumes " sony released in these include the touching alternate version of "idiot wind" and the brilliant "blind willie mctell" that support key scenes in the film and mr dylans versions of "mama you been on my mind" and "moonshiner" that are reinterpreted on the "im not there" album by jack johnson and bob forrest respectively the "im not there" discs also include takes on two songs by mr dylan that he never released on an album "cant leave her behind" and "what kind of friend is this " both by stephen malkmus and sonic youths lee ranaldo mr dylans versions appear in the documentary "eat the document " and you can find them on youtube some of the best performances come from songs mr dylan wrote in the mid s and s including "dark eyes " a collaboration between the excellent tucson based group calexico and the singer sam beam who records under the name iron &amp wine tom verlaine and a band that includes guitarist nels cline and organist john medeski strip the snap from "cold irons bound " turning it into a dark lou reed like dirge joe does reading of "pressing on" is an extraordinary marriage of rock and gospel with their folk and blues based musical directness and lyrics open to broad interpretation even mr dylans best known songs have an elasticity that allows repeated reinvention "knockin on heavens door" is offered by antony hegarty as a surrender to death thus denying the narrator the defiance of mr dylans version breathy and bright charlotte gainsbourgs "just like a woman" isnt unlike the french pop her mother jane birkin sang in the s "all along the watchtower" by eddie vedder may be more a tribute to jimi hendrix than to mr dylan but it works too early dylan provides the bulk of the material for dramatic purposes in the film three songs from his third album s "the times they are a changin " are almost re creations two by mason jennings who provided the voice for christian bales "dylan " and "when the ship comes in " by the talented year old youngster marcus carl franklin who plays an african american vagabond with a sweet not yet formed voice whos named "woody guthrie " but a fourth "one too many mornings " gets pushed to a deeper blue by joe henry "highway revisited " issued in is represented by four songs ramblin jack elliotts reading of that albums "just like tom thumbs blues" is so uncluttered that it shows that the words work without the sluggish disorienting backing of mr dylans original version but the cozy homespun songs for the albums "john wesley harding" and "the basement tapes" that mr dylan wrote in after he shucked the pursuit of celebrity following an exhausting european tour and a motorcycle accident yield the most interesting reinterpretations singer jim james minus his group my morning jacket joins calexico for a "goin to acapulco" that manages to be both dour and sunny and the black keys a drums and guitar duo blast through "the wicked messenger " brushing off mr dylans restraint on "harding " while retaining his threat of biblical retribution the performances on "im not there" suggests the singers and musicians gave not a seconds thought to trying to decode mr dylans lyrics or wondering if they are consistent with which of "the many lives of bob dylan " as mr haynes puts it is responsible for the song when willie nelson takes on "senor tales of yankee power " he gives it a melodramatic reading that the lyrics and structure require the idea that mr nelson would say "mmm which mr dylan wrote this" or "how do i honor his celebrity" is dopey mr elliott and richie havens who sings "tombstone blues " knew mr dylan before he became a legend how can they be cowed by it its a disservice to our understanding of mr dylans great achievement to suggest as mr hayness film does that he lacks an overarching persona or that there isnt some logical flow to his career but we have the songs themselves and as they are performed on the "im not there" album they continue to be the best insight into mr dylan and his gift mr fusilli is the journals rock and pop
