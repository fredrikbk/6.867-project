home &amp family cranky consumer finding a good fit for the female form we size up stores that help women buy the perfect bra many women worry more about their outerwear than their underwear thats too bad because more than two thirds of american women wear ill fitting bras that are uncomfortable unsupportive and unflattering say many in the undergarment industry could we be among them to find out we sought assistance from lingerie departments in macys and nordstrom and at lingerie chain victorias secret many retailers offer special bra fitting events where an expert fitter provides guidance and measurements but we sought help from rank and file staff to see how day to day service stacked up we learned that theres a fair amount of variation among bra fitting methodologies and bra sizing methodologies available at retail stores free of charge elisabeth squires a seattle based author of a breast health and bra guide says this is typical bra fittings have customarily comprised two measurements one across the breasts and another below the rib cage however she says different sales personnel and manufacturers use different calculations with these two measurements to arrive at a womans bra size this means a salespersons assessment method and size determination may not apply to all brands add to this discrepancy the fact that bra styles underwire padded and so on and small weight fluctuations affect bra size and its clear that ultimately women need to try plenty of brassieres to arrive at a fit "most really good fitters will tell you this is an art not a science " ms squires says in our experience the measuring process varied from store to store all took the traditional measurements across the breasts and across the rib cage but each in a different manner the nordstrom saleswoman had us disrobe in a dressing room and don a "fitting bra" before measuring us unclothed a macys saleswoman took us in a dressing room and measured us over our clothes a sheer top as did a victorias secret saleswoman though the latter had us stand outside the dressing rooms for an over the clothes measurement session at nordstrom we were impressed that our assistant sought a second opinion from a colleague who told us our size was pegged properly she also gave us some bra fitting tips for solo bra shopping in the future the band encircling our rib cage provides of a bras support she said adding that many women mistakenly think the bras support comes from shoulder straps and they thus pull the straps unnecessarily tight she brought us five bras priced from &# to &# two of those bras fit she also offered additional models at all three stores sales staff told us we needed a bigger band size and were able to identify appropriately fitting brassieres for us in a larger size the nordstrom and macys saleswomen both said a larger cup size might be in order too depending on the brand or cut of brassiere in question at macys we were offered six bras ranging in price from &# to &# but some cups and styles seemed designed for a person with significantly larger breasts and were a bit too bulky in their support and too matronly for us at victorias secret much of the merchandise was too skimpy or appeared designed for a younger or thinner customer however the stores "ipex" bras available in two styles and priced at &# fit us perfectly we appreciated that at victorias secret bras are organized by size in drawers rather than hung on racks this allowed us to swiftly locate appropriate bras without flipping through lots of hangers all in all we were glad we asked for professional bra fitting help rather than going it alone we were surprised to learn that we were wearing the wrong band size had we gone shopping unassisted we might have bought the wrong
