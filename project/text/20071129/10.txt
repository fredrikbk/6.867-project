bob dylan the artist his works in a museum chemnitz germany on the second floor of the kunstsammlungen chemnitz the galleries are comfortably packed with people enjoying the watercolors on the walls with over paintings there are enough of them to see the heavy attendance is remarkable in that this is the painters first ever exhibition anywhere but its readily explained by the fact that his name is bob dylan dylan fans have long known about the singers painting the front cover for the bands first album "music from big pink " was one of his oils as was the cover of sing out magazine in when he gave his first interview in years to john cohen both were to be charitable amateurish although the bulky guy with the guitar on the magazine cover had a certain charm a couple of years later a drawing graced mr dylans "planet waves" album but based on whats on display in chemnitz both his draftsmanship and his color sense have improved greatly over the decades the works in the exhibition have an interesting origin between and mr dylan made a number of drawings in pencil in of them were published in a book called "drawn blank" but never exhibited this year he had them all scanned and digitally printed on deckel edged paper several copies of each drawing he then overpainted them with gouache or watercolor doing this allowed him not only to add color but also to play with some of the design elements clarifying or obscuring details in the originals clearly the work interested him and involved him deeply in eight months he created paintings from which the ones shown here have been selected but why chemnitz this rather russian looking city renamed karl marx stadt by the east germans after the war stuck in a corner of saxony by the czech border isnt a major tourist destination nor is it as well known for culture as nearby leipzig or somewhat more distant dresden "well " explains the shows curator irene moessinger "i was the first to reach him and ask and my request just reached him at the right point "you see " she adds just a bit defensively "were doing big shows here cranach baselitz picasso toulouse lautrec who lived in chemnitz for a short while the kunstsammlungen has works in its central collection including many works by karl schmidt rottluff german expressionist painter who was from here " if the intention of the "drawn blank series" show is to put eyeballs on walls and draw attention to the museum it certainly seems to be succeeding based on the number of visitors on the day i saw it the press officer was answering phones every couple of minutes italian television was due later that day but the question remains is this about art or about exploiting the name of a celebrity whose whole career has an aura of deep mystery about it the museum has certainly given mr dylans daubs an imposing overture the first gallery before one reaches the "drawn blank" show is a round room with several of georg baselitzs huge oils and one imposing sculpture but it becomes clear in the next room that mr dylan is no mere sunday painter either one of the first works one sees is "two sisters " a nicely ambiguous picture of two women on a bed one clothed her gaze outwards and the other clad only in a brassiere regarding her in this first of two versions both women appear happy the clothed woman sports a wedding ring her sister seems to be whispering some joke to her in the second one the situation is less well defined with the clothed woman seemingly in despair and her sister consoling her nor does the original sketch reproduced as with all of them on the title card in much reduced size but available for closer scrutiny in the excellent catalog help clarify matters much and what is one to make of "statue of liberty" on the opposite wall liberty appears to be standing in a plaza her book reads "rape is not sex " and a figure in a hooded sweatshirt emblazoned with the word "cowboys" walks away most of the works though are pretty straightforward and one can draw several conclusions from them one mr dylan is a skilled portraitist i have no idea who t t red tom clark sylvia paul kararian or nick leblanc are but their images radiate personality mr dylans "neverending tour" has generated numerous images of hotel rooms and the views from them and he plays with these pictures adding and subtracting details experimenting with the way colors play off of each other sometimes in several variations hes a skilled sketcher of landscapes which recall van gogh without being imitative rather its the knowing primitivism and fine sense of color that trigger the association "man on a bridge" evokes chagall "mirror image " william steig and mr dylan also seems deeply playful the sketch for "corner flat" has a woman seated at the table the three painted versions of the work show three different men each a humorous but warm portrait another conclusion one can draw is that mr dylan likes women with meat on their bones the nudes and the "woman at the red lion pub " which is being used to advertise the show depict substantial presences "hes someone whos moving all the time in a permanent creative process " dr moessinger says and this show certainly bears out that observation one gets the feeling that tomorrow he may have another idea for the two sisters or someone else to sit in the corner flats chair the chemnitz show is as mr dylan titled an early album another side of bob dylan and one that in my estimation bears watching mr ward is a free lance writer in berlin and rock historian for nprs "fresh air with terry gross " see related article " and performed by others" wsj nov
