after annapolis however history judges president bush it will surely grant him this he did few things small from regime change in afghanistan and iraq to social security and immigration reform mr bush has been an ambitious executive and in seeking in his last year in office to negotiate the end to the israeli palestinian conflict as he did this week in annapolis maryland the president is being true to type mr bush comes to the task with some advantages among israelis he has a reputation as perhaps the friendliest american president in history giving him credibility and leverage few of his predecessors enjoyed his june speech calling for a palestine that could govern itself democratically and tolerantly and live in peace with its neighbors set the right benchmarks for eventual statehood and in president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayad he has as moderate a palestinian leadership as we have seen mr bush is helped too at least in theory by the rising power of iran and the fear this inspires among sunni regimes that tehran will capitalize on the palestinian issue for its own revolutionary ends this helps account for the presence of egyptians and jordanians at the annapolis conference but also the saudis then again if the arab regimes were really keen to settle the conflict they might be slightly more forthcoming than saudi foreign minister saud al faisal who attended on the condition that he wouldnt shake hands with israelis and they might be more realistic than palestinian negotiator saeb erekat who has ruled out recognizing israel as a jewish state even though israel was created explicitly as such by a u n resolution approved years ago today as historian bernard lewis pointed out in these pages monday how do these so called moderates expect israel to cede territory when theyll cede nothing on the right of israel simply to exist thats a point mr bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice need to consider as they move beyond annapolis the administration is making a large political investment on achieving a settlement and it will surely be blamed for every failure along the way yet the u s is in no realistic position to force peace on people unwilling or unable to make it to get mr abbas to reclaim the gaza strip for instance or prevent hamas from raining rockets on israel nor can the administration decently ask israelis to compromise their security for the sake of a "peace process" that exists more in the minds of western diplomats than it does among the human beings living in harms way mr bush and ms rice run the risk of repeating the mistakes of the clinton administration which made a fetish of photo ops left the hard issues to the end and tried to substitute atmospherics for substance that was the road map to failure at camp david in the squandering of presidential prestige and the bloody five year intifada barack obamas assertion that talk alone can make things better is not always true only the churlish could wish the sincere annapolis peace makers ill but neither does it help to cheer them down a path that has led to failure so many times before
