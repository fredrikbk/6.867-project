has consciously made them a central part of his stump pitch "were a multiplier effect " tagg said from his office at the campaigns boston headquarters this week "were able to be in new hampshire south carolina michigan florida and iowa all on the same day " but having the sons on the trail is a double edged sword campaign staffers have instructed them to avoid talking policy though childhood tales
