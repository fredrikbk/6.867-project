feds hints of a rate cut cheer markets the federal reserve faced with mounting signs of a slowing economy opened the door to an interest rate cut next month cheering the nations stock market which staged its biggest two day rally in five years the latest signal from the central bank came in remarks by donald kohn its vice chairman which represented a fed acknowledgment that the financial market turmoil that started this summer remains a threat to the economy in a speech in new york mr kohn a confidant of fed chairman ben bernanke said recent turbulence in the credit markets has "partly reversed some of the improvement in market functioning" that was seen last month "the degree of deterioration thats happened over the last couple of weeks is not something i personally anticipated " he added partly in response stocks shrugged off disappointing news about the housing market and reports suggesting weak consumer spending the dow jones industrial average rose points or to the latest in a five day string of point plus moves that have whipsawed investors the sharp moves reflect uncertainty about the economys direction as the credit crunch continues to play out in slow motion in august worries about defaults on risky mortgages froze up credit markets and led banks to impose stricter lending terms the fed responded by injecting funds into financial markets easing loan terms and ultimately cutting interest rates initially stocks rallied and yields on risky debt declined but those trends reversed this month as banks and other financial institutions reported unexpectedly large losses on mortgage related investments tighter credit continues to depress the housing market fueling fears about a downturn in consumer spending and threatening business investment over the past two days the dow industrials have risen more than points or more than the biggest two day percentage gain since all stocks in the blue chip average were up yesterday but that rally followed a point decline on monday which put the industrials below their record of hit on oct fulfilling the textbook definition of a market correction yesterday hopes for a rate cut by the fed were particularly welcomed by investors in financial stocks merrill lynch &amp co soared goldman sachs group inc j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp tuesdays upturn was buoyed by news of the abu dhabi investment authoritys &# billion investment in citigroup a sign of hope for banks and other financial companies many of which need fresh capital in the wake of mortgage related losses citigroups shares rose yesterday building on tuesdays rise mr kohn and other fed officials are increasingly worried that banks stung by losses from soured mortgage bets will as he put it "adopt a more defensive posture in granting credit not only for house purchases but for other uses as well " that would bode ill for economic growth private sector economists already think the economy will grow at much less than a annual rate in the current quarter morgan stanley economists yesterday halved their estimates and now foresee fourth quarter growth of just the government today is expected to revise sharply upward its estimate of third quarter growth but that wont help the outlook for the current quarter or next year the latest readings on the housing market also are bleak the national association of realtors said yesterday that u s sales of existing homes fell again in october and at the current sales pace there are now months worth of single family homes on the market the most since july reports from the feds regional banks released yesterday suggest that the pace of growth is slowing with indications of "relatively soft retail spending" and a "slow holiday season " they also cited "mixed" reports on manufacturing and some signs of weakness in commercial and industrial lending the market had been worried the feds concerns about inflation would keep it from taking action at its next meeting on dec "now the market smells a move by the fed in two weeks " says jim swanson chief investment strategist at bostons mfs investment management "thats giving the market a lift " others cautioned against reading too much optimism into the upturn "the market is having a bounce after a correction " said alan gayle senior investment strategist at trusco capital management "the rally could last for a few days but its not going to take us to a new high since the market hasnt finished factoring in the negative news " derek frey head trader at odom &amp frey predicted more volatility as the euphoria of the past few days is followed by mood swings in the other direction although futures markets lately have been betting that the fed will cut its target for short term interest rates now at by one quarter percentage point on dec fed officials have been sending mixed messages several have emphasized publicly that inflation remains a worry despite the worsening outlook for economic growth which complicates any discussion of cutting rates mr kohn didnt say yesterday whether he thinks a rate cut is needed but his apparent openness to a cut represents an important shift in tone by the feds leadership mr bernanke may provide more clues in a speech scheduled for tonight in charlotte n c fed officials had hoped the central banks moves since august to lower the discount rate the rate at which it lends directly to banks and to cut benchmark interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point would be enough to boost confidence in the financial market and head off a credit crunch but the re emergence of turbulence underscores the potential threat tighter lending standards pose to consumer and business spending on the heels of reports earlier this week that consumer confidence was deteriorating the most recent reading on the housing market wasnt encouraging sales of existing homes including townhouses condos and co ops fell in october to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of million units the realtors group said yesterday sales are now running behind last year the decline came mainly in the midwest and west the price of the median house or condominium the one right in the middle of the market dropped to &# down from a year earlier prices for single family homes are down from october the feds mr kohn said yesterday housing continues to deteriorate at a "very very rapid" rate adding "i dont think we have seen the bottom " if the housing market bottoms out by spring fed officials believe consumer spending could remain resilient allowing the economy to sidestep a deeper downturn several wall street forecasters however are expecting declines totaling before the market hits bottom only a third of which have already occurred "there seems to be no silver lining in the darkening cloud overhanging the housing market " nomura securities chief economist david resler said yesterday in a note to clients "the risks that the weakness in this sector will pull the overall economy into recession are rising by the hour " separately the commerce department said orders for durable goods items designed to last three or more years dropped in october the third month in a row the volatile measure has fallen "new orders while showing their typical month to month volatility have traced a sideways pattern in the past one to two years " said michael moran an economist with daiwa securities orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched barometer of business investment fell in october after a gain in september so far this year these orders are running behind last year michael s derby craig karmin and carolyn cui contributed to this article
