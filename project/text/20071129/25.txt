doctors may risk overuse of ct scans doctors are ordering too many unnecessary diagnostic ct scans exposing their patients to potentially dangerous levels of radiation that could increase their risk of cancer according to columbia university researchers the researchers writing in this weeks new england journal of medicine conclude that in the coming decades up to of all cancers in the united states may be caused by radiation from computed tomography scans performed now children face the most danger they said in ordering ct scans doctors are underestimating the radiation danger says david j brenner a radiation biologist who collaborated with eric j hall on the study in many cases the researchers say older technologies like x rays and ultrasound that expose patients to lower radiation doses or no radiation at all would work just as well since ct scans were introduced in the s their use has grown to an estimated million annually an estimated four million to five million scans are ordered for children mr brenner said adults receive scans for diseases of the stomach colon breast and other areas children most often are scanned for appendicitis it has become a favored technology because it provides detailed information about patients bodies is noninvasive and typically is covered by health insurance while the scans save lives the authors say doctors are leaning on them over safer diagnostic tools because they underestimate the levels of radiation people receive from the scans the authors measured typical levels of radiation that ct scans emit they found levels they say were comparable to that received by some people miles from the epicenters of the atomic blasts over hiroshima and nagasaki japan arl van moore chairman the american college of radiologys board said "it is our belief there are scans performed that may well be unnecessary " but he called the authors conclusions about the possible rate of future cancer diagnoses "a reach " the authors say that children may face the most danger because there is a long lag between radiation exposure and a potential cancer cancers can gestate for decades in someone scanned as a child they said the researchers recommend that doctors try alternative diagnostic techniques patients they said should query their doctors as to the medical benefit gained from the scans and what alternatives exist
