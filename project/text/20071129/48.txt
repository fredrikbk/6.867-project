fcc plan would clear way for tribune sale real estate magnate sam zells &# billion buyout plan for tribune co was back on schedule to be completed by year end after federal communications commission chairman kevin martin proposed a vote tomorrow to grant waivers needed to close the deal the waivers would allow tribune to own newspaper and broadcast properties in the same market they would last for two years or until six months after the conclusion of any litigation stemming from the fccs efforts to rewrite media ownership rules which could take years to resolve approval of the waivers which is expected would mean the buyout can go through next month without requiring tribunes new owners to divest assets mr martin said yesterday he intends to go ahead with a dec vote on his proposal on cross ownership limits which would allow media companies to own both newspaper and broadcast properties in the top markets he said he didnt think it was fair to hold up the tribune deal while the fcc was tied up in negotiations over his cross ownership proposal or for the company to be forced to divest any stations while his ownership proposal was tied up in court which he acknowledged would likely be "quite some time " in particular the waivers would avoid the need for now to sell the companys newspaper or one of its television stations in hartford conn although tribune may eventually have to do so because the hartford market is too small to be covered under mr martins cross ownership proposal the company had sought waivers with no time limits attached so it wouldnt have to sell a hartford outlet at all an fcc official said tribune could gain time however by challenging the fccs move to grant only a temporary waiver on hartford thereby keeping the waiver in place as long as a court challenge was pending mr martin circulated the plan to the fccs other four board members shortly after midnight yesterday following a contentious day tuesday during which the four rejected his plan to tighten regulation of the cable television industry the chairmans proposal to resolve the sticking points in the tribune deal was seen in part as a reaction to that defeat officials involved in the deal have pleaded with the chairman to act quickly on the waivers one commissioner democrat jonathan adelstein publicly accused mr martin of holding the tribune deal hostage to improve chances the agency would adopt his plan to change media ownership rules mr adelstein is expected to vote against the waiver plan as is fellow democrat michael copps the fccs three republicans are expected to pass it tribune chief executive dennis fitzsimons said that the company was pleased with the martin proposal and that it would "enable tribunes going private transaction to close by the end of the year "
