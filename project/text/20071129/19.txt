can wind power find its footing in the deep fifteen miles off scottish coast venture intends to show turbines can be effective without spoiling anyones view off the moray firth scotland rising high above the water the two gleaming white structures look like an outsize art installation but they have a more practical purpose each is a giant wind turbine part of a british project that could prove a breakthrough for wind power around the globe among the dwindling oil and gas fields of the north sea britain has built the worlds biggest wind turbines each has blades longer than a football field in the moray firth a large inlet off the rugged east coast of scotland whats unusual about the effort is its dimensions while existing offshore wind projects tend to be in shallow waters close to the coast the moray firth venture is expected to culminate in the first offshore wind farm in deep water feet far from land miles talisman energy inc the canadian oil and gas company running the project in a joint venture with utility scottish &amp southern energy plc plans to ramp it up into a spectacular turbine wind farm that would turn north sea gales into enough electricity for a million people a fifth of scotlands population completion is probably at least seven years away the company says called project beatrice after the oil field beneath it which itself was named by dallas tycoon t boone pickens for his second wife the effort is being closely watched in the u s where not in my backyard pressure groups have led noisy campaigns against near shore wind farms that they say blot the coastal landscape just such a protest is confronting cape wind associates llcs plan to install wind turbines six miles off cape cod mass close to resorts like marthas vineyard the alliance to protect nantucket sound has pointed to beatrice as proof that wind power stations neednt be close to land "beatrice shows deepwater is a technical reality today " says audra parker a spokeswoman for the alliance deepwater wind farm technology also has its critics who say the turbines can encroach on shipping lanes and harm seabird sanctuaries they can also be prohibitively expensive because they require long undersea transmission lines to hook turbines up to the grid system beatrice bears that out so far it has cost &# million or about &# million per megawatt of installed generating capacity by comparison a gas fired power station costs less than &# million per mw installed to build britain is trying to combat those high costs with financial incentives that have made it the most attractive market for offshore wind farms in europe according to a recent study by accounting firm kpmg llp the united kingdom says it will generate of its energy from renewable sources by what gives britain a potential edge in developing large scale deepwater wind power is the nations long history of offshore oil and gas discovered in the s the massive oil reservoirs of the north sea have fueled britain for more than years and sparked a huge services boom especially in places like aberdeen on scotlands east coast the oil there is running out fast "a hundred thousand people work in the energy sector here " says paul obrien head of the renewable energy development team at scottish development international "were looking at renewables as a way of keeping people employed " scotland has around of europes wind energy resource and some of the continents best potential wind wave and tidal sites mr obrien calls pentland firth a strait between north scotland and the orkney islands the "saudi arabia of tidal power " locating a wind farm so far out to sea presented talisman with technical challenges most offshore wind turbines are built on tripods or monopiles drilled into the seabed but you cant use them in water deeper than about feet so talisman used a jacket structure with four legs and a lattice frame a design borrowed from oil rigs such a structure uses less steel so its lighter and more flexible says allan mcaskill beatrices project director the beatrice subsea structures were built by local engineering firm burntisland fabrications ltd at methil a yard near edinburgh that had produced many of the offshore rigs and platforms deployed during the north sea oil boom methil is now reinventing itself as a center for renewables "we wanted to diversify and not be too dependent on oil and gas " says john robertson chief executive of burntisland methil will soon start mass producing the beatrice turbines turning out to of them a year he says being an oil and gas company also made it easier for talisman to get beatrice up and running the company fast tracked the permits needed to install its turbines by using its existing north sea oil and gas operating license thats because theyll initially be used to power talismans oil platforms later the companys rigs will serve as a base to maintain and monitor the wind farm so talisman wont have to decommission them a task that can cost millions of dollars so far even in scotland offshore wind is in its infancy there are only megawatts of offshore wind power capacity installed globally with denmark the world leader accounting for about a third of that britain with megawatts is in second place but has big ambitions "were working with the government on having mw of offshore wind capacity installed by " says gordon edge director of economics and markets at the british wind energy association "were easily going to be half the market for this technology "
