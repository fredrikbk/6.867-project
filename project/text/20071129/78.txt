politics &amp economics economys varied picture fed finds regions affected differently dollars two sides for all the focus on the state of the national economy powerful forces including a real estate bust surging energy prices and a weak dollar are hitting different regions in different ways creating a patchwork of many losers and a few winners california nevada florida and arizona are bearing the brunt of the worsening housing slump but they wont be hurt much by higher home heating costs which are set to punish the northeast and midwest energy producing states like wyoming texas and alaska are benefiting from higher fuel prices the falling dollar meanwhile has boosted exports from the farm states of indiana and kansas but it could eventually hurt consumers who buy goods made overseas the varied economic picture is captured in the latest federal reserve "beige book" report prepared for the dec policy making meeting on regional conditions across the country the report compiled by the feds regional banks and released yesterday noted that retail sales are slowing in most areas as higher energy prices and lower housing prices weigh on the consumer it also said tourism is up across the country as some cities have been deluged with foreign shoppers taking advantage of lower prices caused by the falling dollar while different regions are being affected differently there is one common theme just about every area is getting hit by something "this is very unique from a regional perspective the problems are diffuse theyre not as severe but theyre everywhere " says mark zandi chief economist at moodys economy com an economic research company the housing market has taken the biggest hit but there are regional differences prognosticators long held that house prices would never drop nationally but they have been proved wrong one reason is that there are two housing slumps right now each with its own causes cutting through both are the problems with subprime mortgages which as they have gone bad have led to an increase in foreclosures across the country in and around the coasts rampant speculation and creative financing fueled a price bubble that has popped yesterday the california association of realtors reported that home sales decreased in october in california from the same period a year ago while the median price of an existing home fell over the past year florida nevada california and arizona have seen first mortgage delinquency rates increase between and percentage points the highest in the nation according to moodys economy com as a whole residents in arizona nevada and california have seen their personal net worth shrink over the past year florida residents saw their personal net worth increase the lowest increase in the nation in the midwest housing is taking a beating as people lose their jobs and see their incomes fall in housing accounted for just under of jobs in the u s according to economy com what has economists worried is that the sector continues to deteriorate and could drag down other parts of the economy while home sales construction and prices are sliding and northeast banks and financial firms have had layoffs as a result of the subprime debacle and subsequent credit crunch employment has yet to take a big tumble "youve seen a slower labor market but not as slow as we might have expected " says seamus smyth an economist at goldman sachs &amp co in new york rising energy prices also are hitting different regions in different ways home heating oil prices were about higher this month than a year earlier a rise sure to be felt in northern and midwestern states massachusetts new york michigan illinois and wisconsin are among the nations highest per capita consumers of natural gas and home heating fuel but the higher prices are leading to an increase in drilling and prompting companies to tap fields that would be unprofitable at lower prices this has been a boon for big western energy producers like alaska wyoming and new mexico yesterdays beige book noted that "drilling was particularly strong in the energy producing regions of colorado and oklahoma " firms reported labor shortages and expect drilling activity to increase in the three months ahead the report noted that texass oil and natural gas drilling has risen "to the highest levels since the s " the declining dollar meanwhile is drawing foreign travelers to the u s irish nationals are flying to manhattan for bargain shopping tourism is up in florida and the fed said yesterday that canadian traffic has lifted sales at a mall in fargo n d but the dollars decline has been particularly good for states that are big exporters concentrated in the pacific northwest and farming states washington generates of its gross domestic product from exports the largest proportion of any u s state oregons share is kentucky tennessee and indiana are also among the largest exporters in the country the risk of the falling dollar is that it could raise consumer prices at a time when shoppers are being struck by high gasoline prices for retailers which in a slow competitive environment are under pressure to keep prices low a weaker dollar can cut into profit margins
