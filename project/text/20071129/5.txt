amazons kindle makes buying e books easy reading them hard companies have failed for many years to produce a successful electronic reader a dedicated device that would do for books what apples ipod has done for music allow you to carry around large numbers of titles and enjoy them in a convenient way just a year ago sony took another stab at this concept with a product called the sony reader like the ipod it was linked to an online store where you could buy thousands of titles that could be downloaded to the reader unlike the ipod it hasnt been a hit with consumers partly because the store was hard to use and had a very limited selection now the biggest name in online book sales amazon com is entering the fray with a &# electronic book reader called kindle that aims to succeed by offering a much better shopping experience the kindle is the first e book reader that allows you to select buy and download titles directly to the device instead of downloading them to a pc first and then transferring them over amazon is offering a large collection of digitized books about compared with fewer than for sony the kindle also can download newspapers magazines and blogs directly and update them automatically this is possible because the kindle comes with free built in wireless internet access using a cellular data network ive been testing the kindle for about a week and i love the shopping and downloading experience but the kindle device itself is just mediocre while it has good readability battery life and storage capacity both its hardware design and its software user interface are marred by annoying flaws it is bigger and clunkier to use than the sony reader whose second version has just come out at &# like the sony the amazon reader uses a high contrast but low power screen technology the kindles six inch screen can display only monochrome text and gray images and theres lag time and a flash of black every time you turn a page but i did find that the screen was good enough to make me forget i wasnt reading the book on paper the kindle holds about titles in its internal memory and can accept memory cards for storing more books periodicals and blogs you can also keep and read some types of personal files and photos on the kindle but you have to email them to amazon for conversion to a proprietary kindle format the battery lasted me a couple of days between charges with the wireless on longer if i switched it off using the well organized kindle store i was able to purchase books like "boom " by tom brokaw "stone cold" by david baldacci and "american creation" by joseph ellis the process was fast and simple partly because the kindle comes preconfigured with your existing amazon account information new releases and bestsellers cost &# each compared with a typical amazon price of &# to &# for the paper volumes prices for other books vary widely but are generally cheaper than the paper versions i also successfully subscribed to electronic editions of the wall street journal the new york times time magazine and several blogs and news feeds this was a much less satisfying experience the layout of these publications was much clumsier and harder to use than on the web and they cost more blogs and periodicals that are free on the web cost anywhere from cents to &# a month the kindle has some nice software features it includes a small keyboard that lets you make notes in the margins of books and perform searches theres also a built in dictionary but the device is poorly designed it has huge buttons on both edges for turning pages forward or backward they are way too easy to press accidentally so my reading was constantly being interrupted by unwanted page turns plus the buttons are confusing one called "back" doesnt actually move to the previous page but supposedly to the prior function i never could predict what it would do the "home" button for returning to the list of content on your kindle is tiny and located at the very bottom of the keyboard there is no button to take you to the online store you have to open a menu and scroll the book like cover intended to protect the device attaches so weakly that its always falling off and because the power buttons are hidden on the back reaching around to use them practically guarantees youll knock off the cover the software interface also is clumsy there is no way to organize titles into groups or categories so you have to keep turning pages in the home area to find a particular item to read and doing many tasks requires you to scroll a barely visible silver cursor along a narrow side panel also there is no way to email friends to tell them about books or articles send excerpts or links or even buy them a kindle title as a gift amazon has nailed the electronic book shopping experience but it has a lot to learn about designing electronic devices email me at mossberg wsj com find all my columns and videos online free at the new all
