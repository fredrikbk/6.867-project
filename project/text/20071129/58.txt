inside pakistans drive to guard its a bombs amid political turmoil troubled regime tests scientists religious zeal rawalpindi pakistan inside pakistans nuclear program scientists are allowed to grow long beards pray five times a day and vote for this countrys conservative islamist politicians religious zeal doesnt bar them from working in top secret weapons facilities but religious extremism does its up to the programs internal watchdog a security division authorized to snoop on its employees to determine the difference and drive out those who breach the boundaries in an interview a top security official for pakistans nuclear program outlined a multilayered system put in place over the past two years to try to avoid the kind of devastating lapses uncovered in recent years a series of rogue scientists were found to have sold secrets or met with al qaeda leaders finally spurring a screening and surveillance program along the lines the u s uses but with a greater focus on weeding out an increasingly religious generation of would be scientists and engineers with the regime of gen pervez musharraf wobbling the eyes of the world have refocused on the security of the atomic arsenal of pakistan long regarded as the most politically unstable of nuclear powers mr musharrafs move yesterday to relinquish his military leadership provided at least momentary calm but worries that weapons technology or materials might leak out remain amid pakistans continuing turmoil pakistani officials say the most far reaching change in their nuclear security web is the personnel reliability program named after its model in the u s it involves a battery of checks aimed at rooting out human foibles such as lust greed or depression that might lead one to betray national secrets like the security methods of other nuclear powers the new pakistani program delves into personal finances political views and sexual histories but it probes most deeply into degrees of religious fervor one employee recently was booted from the nuclear program for passing out political pamphlets of an ultraconservative islamic party and being observed coaxing colleagues into joining him at a local mosque for party rallies said the security official a two star general who declined to be identified citing the sensitive nature of his job even though the employee did nothing illegal his behavior was deemed too disturbing "we dont mind people being religious " said the general sitting in a spartan office behind a code locked door in a military compound outside pakistans capital islamabad "but we dont want people with extreme thoughts " security officials try to draw a line at people who are inclined to force their religious beliefs upon others especially in the workplace urging colleagues to attend islamist political rallies is seen as less acceptable than quietly taking a break from work to pray the attempt to strike this delicate balance between allowing faith and excluding fundamentalism is all the more difficult in a time of upheaval for this muslim nation of million people since july pakistan has been hard hit by an escalation in extremist violence with an islamist insurgency spreading from the lawless border area with afghanistan widely believed to be the home of osama bin laden to pakistans major cities that was one of the reasons president musharraf gave for declaring a state of emergency nov but the attacks havent abated just last weekend suicide bombers struck this heavily guarded garrison city killing yesterday mr musharraf turned over control of the military to a handpicked successor today he is to be sworn in as a civilian president many experts say it is unlikely that islamist militants would be able to penetrate pakistans nuclear establishment or to steal weapons they see a bigger threat in a rising tide of young people inclined to be more religiously conservative and spurred by the u s led invasions of iraq and afghanistan after the terrorist attacks of sept more anti american that includes the college campuses that are most likely to supply recruits to the nuclear program "you can improve physical security by building high walls and establishing a well guarded perimeter its much harder to defend against insiders " says robert einhorn a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and a former assistant secretary of state for weapons nonproliferation within pakistan a strong contingent opposing any nuclear weapons questions whether the recent attempts to improve the governments security screening are enough critics say religious conservatism gripping the applicant pool makes it too difficult to discern potentially dangerous zealots "its a source of worry that the secret institutions are seized with religious fervor " says pervez hoodbhoy chairman of the physics department at quaid e azam university a large source of scientists for pakistans nuclear program pakistans allies including the u s have expressed public confidence in the nations controls "id like to be very clear " navy adm michael g mullen chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told reporters earlier this month in washington "i dont see any indication right now that security of those weapons is in jeopardy " but the u s has long had contingency plans in place under which american special forces operatives would deploy to pakistan to secure nuclear weapons sites in the event of an islamic takeover some u s military and intelligence personnel fear that there may be additional weapons sites that the u s doesnt know about "its going to be some time before pakistan overcomes the confidence deficit " says mark fitzpatrick an arms control specialist and senior fellow at the london based international institute for strategic studies pakistans nuclear arsenal is believed to contain about warheads that when mounted on missiles are capable of striking anywhere in archrival india according to the international institute for strategic studies which recently produced a report on the programs history it also estimated the arsenal kept at secret commando guarded locations could be expanded significantly with pakistans stockpile of weapons grade material components and core materials are stored separately an additional security measure experts say is undertaken by both pakistan and india those components are supposed to be put into operation only with the consent of a national command authority comprising the countrys top civilian and military leaders pakistan has worked to advance its technical security along with its human checks introducing fingerprint and iris scanners that are commonplace in other countries nuclear programs according to current and former pakistani nuclear officials pakistan has developed its own version of "permissive action links " or pals a sophisticated type of lock the u s uses to prevent unauthorized launching no countrys program is immune from mishaps last month the commander of a nuclear powered u s navy submarine was fired after failing to do safety checks and falsifying records to cover it up in august a b bomber took off mistakenly carrying nuclear tipped missiles both incidents caused embarrassment but no damage but pakistans past security breakdowns have eroded the credibility of its assurances that its program is in safe hands in a q khan who headed a national research laboratory named after him was placed under house arrest for selling nuclear secrets and materials to north korea iran and libya making a personal fortune in the process in late acting on tips from u s intelligence pakistan detained two of its retired nuclear scientists who had met with members of al qaeda in afghanistan including mr bin laden some analysts suspect pakistan continues to buy weapons materials on the black market in part because of trouble procuring supplies through legitimate channels that suggests to some that at least parts of the procurement network engineered by mr kahn still widely considered a national hero remain active despite pakistans assertions that it has been shut down the bush administration has ruled out any plan to share nuclear technology with pakistan even as it seeks to complete such a pact for indias civilian power program nuclear suppliers have followed suit denying some safety equipment that pakistani nuclear officials say are meant for civilian use for example pakistan hasnt been able to buy a system to monitor potentially problematic parts at its power reactors say these officials pakistans current emphasis on security marks a shift from its early focus on acquiring technology rather than safeguarding it that stemmed from a race with india to build the bomb which culminated in when both countries conducted a series of tit for tat nuclear tests more than two decades earlier spurred by indias test of a nuclear device in prime minister zulfiqar ali bhutto built up the nuclear program around a coterie of patriotic scientists among them the metallurgist mr khan as the program advanced mr khan assumed an ever more powerful role rising to head his own laboratory that operated free of much if any government control mr khan eventually turned his attentions to selling the secrets to other countries including iran current and former army commanders maintain mr khan acted within a tiny circle without their knowledge general mizra aslam beg then chief of army staff says he told an iranian military delegation shopping for technology and material in the s that he couldnt help he advised them to get what they wanted "like us through the underworld " a major early problem was weak oversight from the civilian government mr bhuttos daughter benazir helped craft pakistans nuclear policies on exports and deterrence yet says she was mostly kept out of the loop by the countrys intelligence services while she was prime minister her successor nawaz sharif who like ms bhutto recently returned to pakistan to challenge mr musharrafs rule didnt fare any better during his two terms in office at a meeting with president clinton in washington mr sharif says in an interview u s intelligence informed him that pakistani military transport planes were carrying used nuclear centrifuges which can be used to produce weapons grade uranium out of the country "no no " mr sharif recalls responding "that couldnt happen " but before he could check out the allegations he says his government fell in gen musharrafs military coup a former director of the centrifuge program was later arrested gen musharraf began to revamp pakistans nuclear bureaucracy he established the national command authority and formalized the role of a secretariat called the strategic plans division set up in to oversee the nuclear programs policies gen musharraf sidelined mr khan launched an internal investigation and later publicly arrested him after the u s presented evidence of his misdeeds when mr khan confessed however gen musharraf pardoned him in ailing health he still resides in his heavily guarded islamabad home just after the september terrorist attacks in the u s pakistans intelligence service detained two retired nuclear scientists who had met with senior members of al qaeda including mr bin laden during charity work in afghanistan one sultan bashiruddin mahmood was a former director at the pakistan atomic energy commission and a controversial islamic scholar who had postulated that energy could be harnessed from fiery spirits called djinns mr mahmood who remains under house arrest had sketched a rough diagram of a nuclear bomb for mr bin laden during a meeting pakistani officials said pakistani intelligence agents later described the drawing as absurdly basic but his unauthorized travel to afghanistan highlighted gaping holes in the system "despite our proactive measures it will haunt us " air commodore khalid banuri a director in pakistans strategic plans division said of the bin laden meeting "i dont know for how many years " when news surfaced of the meeting air commodore banuri was in the u s on a fellowship studying how pakistan could apply a personnel reliability program at home later the u s decided to help according to two former directors of pakistans strategic plans division "we want to learn from the wests best practices " says one of them feroz khan who also is a retired brigadier general "why shouldnt the u s share this with developing countries " after years of sensitive exchanges it took until for pakistan to put in place the u s style reliability program to hone its loyalty tests pakistan says it has departed from the u s program in significant ways it focuses much less on drinking for example since consumption of alcohol is severely curtailed in muslim pakistan and more on finances and religious beliefs recruits are subject to a battery of background checks that can take up to a year new employees are monitored for months before moving into sensitive areas they may also be subjected to periodic psychological exams and reports from fellow workers for a handful of top scientists and military officials life becomes a fishbowl of eavesdropped phone calls tailed movements and monitored overseas travel according to feroz khan the former strategic plans division director most top officials now are watched into retirement usually while given undemanding advisory positions "the system knows how to distinguish who is a fundo fundamentalist and who is simply pious " he says pakistans hardline islamic parties have vigorously promoted the nations nuclear program as a way for muslim countries to combat american hegemony and dont share the governments concern about the kind of security lapses that alarm the u s in july a senator for pakistans largest islamic party jamaat e islami criticized the governments confinement of a q khan as "an act of cruelty against one of the greatest benefactors of pakistan just to appease the american administration " at quaid e azam university the nuclear critic mr hoodbhoy says his students are more radical than a previous generation they have come up through an education system that increasingly stresses islamic ritual and come of age in a charged political environment theres widespread sympathy for those fighting americans in afghanistan and iraq he adds although most wouldnt want to live under a taliban like regime on campus young women stroll in groups along shrub lined pathways cloaked head to toe in scarves and gowns "the students arent conscious that theyve changed but this new dress wouldve looked so odd ago " says prof hoodbhoy "even five years ago " during lunch at the university a group of graduate students huddle outside a physics classroom one year old says he has applied for work at khan research laboratories known as krl still named after the famous scientist despite his arrest the student says hes not particularly religious praying twice a day he does worry about the security program though and asks not to be identified thinking that talking to a reporter might jeopardize his job chances "im under observation " he explains the general whos a top security official says nuclear program employees are well aware of the lines they cant cross the electronics engineer who was fired for passing out pamphlets had been clearly warned the general says with an earlier job transfer out of a sensitive area today security agents continue to keep an eye on the engineer he adds they know hes tutoring students in a small room off the side of his house jay solomon contributed to this article
