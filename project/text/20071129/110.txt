kohns warnings about recent market turbulence were measured by some standards but his unusually explicit acknowledgement that the ground has shifted since the last fed meeting sent the dow jones industrial average up points or to in what the wall street journal notes was "the latest in a five day string of point plus moves that have whipsawed investors " and this market leap out of "correction" territory came on what seemed like yet another day full of bad financial news but first the money quotes literally in this case from mr kohn in remarks that seemed pitched toward fed critics he noted that the central banks should avoid creating moral hazard meaning investors must bear the consequences of their risky decisions but said "innocent bystanders" shouldnt be punished as well "to be sure lowering interest rates to keep the economy on an even keel when adverse financial market developments occur will reduce the penalty incurred by some people who exercised poor judgment " he said in a speech at the council on foreign relations "but these people are still bearing the costs of their decisions and we should not hold the economy hostage to teach a small segment of the population a lesson " and while minutes of the feds oct meeting suggested officials felt interest rate cuts made then and earlier could protect the economy from housing and mortgage market trouble mr kohn said yesterday that "increased turbulence of recent weeks" had reversed what the fed had judged to be improvements "should the elevated turbulence persist it would increase the possibility of further tightening in financial conditions for households and businesses " he said "heightened concerns about larger losses at financial institutions now reflected in various markets have depressed equity prices and could induce more intermediaries to adopt a more defensive posture in granting credit not only for house purchases but for other uses a well " as if to back up that

mid november "not once in the years since the fed began tracking such numbers in has this artery of finance constricted so rapidly " the times says "smaller declines preceded three recessions going back to at other times such declines tended to occur in conjunction with an economic downturn " the washington post notes the credit crunch has made it harder for cities school systems and other issuers of municipal bonds to raise money "leaving them with a tough choice either put off the projects or pay higher interest rates on their bonds a cost that ultimately would fall on the backs of taxpayers " meanwhile e trade financial ceo mitch caplan appears to be the latest boardroom victim of the mortgage market problems even as his company looks set to get a &# billion cash infusion from
