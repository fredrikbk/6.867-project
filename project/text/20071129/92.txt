review &amp outlook editorial citi of arabia investors seem delighted that abu dhabi is injecting &# billion into citigroup bidding up stocks in general on new confidence that the mortgage solvency crisis might ease we hate to spoil the party but it strikes us as unfortunate if not a tragedy that americas largest bank had to go hat in hand to arab sheiks because of bad management and blundering u s monetary policy the citi play is being spun as a master stroke by robert rubin the chairman of the banks executive committee the bank gets a capital infusion without having to cut its dividend and gives up only a minority stake while abu dhabi gets no seat on the board even better from a political point of view abu dhabi will be able to convert shares for no more than a stake which comes in just below the level that requires approval by the federal reserve mr rubin even seems to have greased the skids on capitol hill with new york senator chuck schumer already forgetting his campaign against dubai ports world citigroup did have to shore up its balance sheet and we suppose petrodollars are a better source of capital than u s taxpayers under a "too big to fail" doctrine on the other hand where were mr rubin and the bank board when citi was betting so much on subprime given the the bank is paying abu dhabi citigroups other equity holders might also be better off down the road had they taken a dividend cut instead most important no one should be under any illusions that abu dhabis investment is a normal commercial transaction it comes from a sovereign wealth fund controlled by a foreign government which has political as much as business interests from an arab government that has a troubling history with american banking laws and it offers a middle eastern entree into the u s financial system that since plays a pivotal role in the war on terror readers of these columns might recall in particular abu dhabis adventures in beltway banking it was sheik zayed the father of the current ruler of abu dhabi who owned the infamous bank of credit and commerce international or bcci whose fraudulent tentacles spanned the globe including the highest levels of washington politics a decade and a half ago the current emir sheik khalifa bin zayed al nahyan is not his father who always maintained that he was a victim of the bcci fraud himself and robert morgenthau the manhattan district attorney who investigated bcci tells us that abu dhabi "has been responsible" since bcci on the other hand the bank was forced to settle for hundreds of millions of dollars after lying to evade american banking laws mr morgenthau also recounted that the elder sheik zayed once called to inform the state department that if mr morgenthau indicted anyone in the royal family over the scandal he would pull his billions out of the u s and make no further investments here mr morgenthau says this message was passed to him via the justice department his reply "tell them that you dont control that cranky s o b in new york " as a long time new york da mr morgenthau could stand up to such political pressure the way the justice department might not in certain corners of the world large investments come with political expectations perhaps the abu dhabi of today has moved beyond such threats the united arab emirates have helped us in the war on terror and the u s is the ultimate defense for the oil rich emirates on the edge of the arabian peninsula one can argue that investments like abu dhabis draw both sides more closely to each other and so are mutually beneficial yet everyone should also admit that this investment means that arab interests will now have inordinate sway over americas largest bank abu dhabis stake combined with the stake of saudi prince alwaleed bin talal makes them the banks dominant shareholders and who knows how many other smaller holdings are in middle eastern hands the small gulf states may be governed separately from saudi arabia but they are closely linked by geography family ties and national interests for purposes of political influence they often behave as part of the same tribe in that regard the gambit looks all the more troubling as a way to avoid fed scrutiny if the investors motives are merely commercial why go to such lengths the wire transfer system is crucial in the war on terror and at a minimum the fed and u s treasury need to know that citigroup will continue to cooperate in sanctions against terror states and tracking terror financing citigroups enforcement unit should be given a thorough scrubbing speaking of the fed no one should forget that its monetary mistakes helped to make possible citi of arabia its easy money policy this decade created a subsidy for debt that led to the housing bubble and citis mistakes in the mortgage and siv markets it also fed a global commodity boom that has enriched the oil producers and other countries that have a low propensity for domestic consumption their petrodollar windfall has to go somewhere and so it is gobbling up u s assets this recycling may help citigroup now but it has also weakened american influence more broadly as the dollar has continued to decline and it left abu dhabi better positioned than american finance companies to rescue citigroup no one favors open capital markets more than we do and foreign investment is a crucial part of american economic success but since commercial calculations must also consider national security wed feel better if this deal were inspected by u s officials and we especially agree with mr morgenthau when he says "its a sad day for american financial markets when youve got to turn to abu dhabi to get bailed out " see related letters "letters to the editor citi of arabia no magic carpet ride but a cautionary tale of errors" wsj dec
