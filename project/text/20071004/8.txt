a war surtax congressional democrats have tried about every possible ploy to "end the war" in iraq albeit without having to take responsibility by cutting off funds now in their frustration theyre trying to revive an lbj golden oldie a war "surtax " house appropriations chairman david obey entered congress in so perhaps he had a vietnam flashback this week when he announced the new tax to "pay for" the war in iraq he was joined by fellow house spending barons jack murtha and jim mcgovern who said they hope to raise &# billion to &# billion annually by imposing a new baseline levy on almost all taxpayers ranging up to for the highest brackets now thats a surtax their argument echoed often in the media is that such a tax is needed because war spending is busting the budget and crowding out domestic priorities iraq "will result in draining the treasury so dry that it will result in systematic disinvestment of americas future " mr obey says with his customary understatement "we need to stop pretending that this war doesnt cost anything " someones pretending all right but it is those who claim that iraq spending represents some unique and overwhelming fiscal burden in fact the u s is spending relatively little on defense by historic wartime standards and thats including the &# billion in to fund the efforts in iraq and afghanistan its true that overall defense spending in dollars adjusted for inflation is higher than it was during the s and thank heaven for that defense spending as a share of the economy in the clinton years dipped to its lowest level since as we lived under the illusion of a "peace dividend" while al qaeda was gaining strength the nearby charts illustrate the defense budget picture since and the end of the cold war the bottom chart shows that as a share of the overall economy defense spending fell almost in half to of gdp from it has since climbed back to and may hit all of once final figures are in for fiscal which ended last week thats still far below the peak during the reagan arms buildup of in and less than half the vietnam peak of in but isnt the war in iraq crowding out urgent domestic needs not even close as the top chart shows defense spending in will probably come in at of total federal outlays see accompanying illustration wsj oct the bush administration request for fiscal is which is still below what it was in when bill clinton was elected as recently as it was mr clinton and congress slashed that defense share to in before they began to remember that the world remains a dangerous place if youre beginning to suspect that this fight really isnt about iraq youve broken the beltway code as house appropriations impresario mr obey has committed himself to passing spending bills for fiscal that surpass president bushs discretionary spending target by &# billion hes thus trapped himself between a veto threat and the pent up spending demands of his liberal constituencies his "surtax" gambit is an attempt to change the debate by blaming his predicament on the costs of an unpopular war mr bush isnt buying this and neither should taxpayers the federal budget deficit continued to decline in fiscal to something close to &# billion thanks to another year of buoyant revenue gains of about those revenues flow from a growing economy that mr obeys surtax would hit like a two by four if mr obey wants a tax increase to fund more domestic spending he ought to be honest and say so his problem is that this wouldnt be as politically easy as blaming iraq and it wouldnt even be popular with many of own democratic colleagues speaker nancy pelosi proved that when she quickly disavowed the obey murtha mcgovern surtax on tuesday at least some democrats have met a tax increase they dont like
