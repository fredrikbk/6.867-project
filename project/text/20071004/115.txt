the green colored contempt for humanity and its prosperity how odd and sad that my generations educators so intent on ending americas shame centered chauvinistic judeo christian indoctrination by public schools has replaced it with such an energetically shame centered curriculum "inconvenient youths " weekend journal sept as my five year old daughter and i passed a home under construction a few years back she commented that the builders were "scarring mother earth " this message she was getting from teachers was a valuable part of the story as far as it goes but i wanted her to know that she can be a responsible member of creation and that she has as rightful a place in creation as any other creature she isnt stealing or destroying something by the very fact of being a human placed in creation the prospect of guilt can rightly keep us from doing harm but shame for existing isnt her rightful calling the real shame lies with the fact that whatever her teachers believe about the detrimental impact of persuading young people to feel ashamed of being human it is overwhelmed by an overriding belief that humans have proved a vile blight on the planet and the only fair thing to do is to disavow our abilities to husband nature and await rightful retribution the era of economic progress and wealth creation stretching over the past five centuries is now over a friend on the left recently told me our tainted concept of civilization has had its day our children he said cannot escape a future massive comeuppance such contempt and hopelessness for humanity have become characteristic of leftist thinking in my generation amounting to a suicide pact that now extends to exhortations to lay down our arms in the face of islamofascist mass murderers it also extends to hatred of a western economic system that provides prosperity around the globe to an abhorrence of having children and to snuffing out millions of pregnancies each year with abortions what other side of the story is there for al gore laurie david and bacich elementary school principal sally peck to teach well one persons indoctrination is anothers enlightenment this dad shall have his work cut out balancing one with another peter lambert venice fla children who become aware of environmental issues and then bring their concerns home shouldnt be portrayed as pests brainwashed by some leftist green freak group as a year old i can say that i have been aware of environmental issues for some time on the television show "barney" i learned to turn the water off while brushing my teeth and on "bill nye the science guy" i learned to cut plastic six pack holders so they wont harm sea life if trash gets into the oceans although i discuss environmental issues with my parents i certainly dont consider myself inconvenient when they chose to get a volvo instead of a hybrid i understood their decision had to do with vehicle safety especially since my sister and i will be driving soon each morning on the announcements at my school the environmental club gives the message to "reduce reuse recycle " recycling receptacles can be found in all classrooms and the cafeteria at a recent pep rally my senior classmates could be heard chanting "recycle " referring to pieces of paper with the schools alma mater printed on them did i forget to mention that in the presidential election student poll president bush won environmental concerns arent political and they arent only for liberals parents who care about their childrens and their grandchildrens futures should think about what kind of planet they are leaving for them kathleen zilch queensbury n y it is difficult to judge which aspect of the article is more tragic the politicization by left leaning teachers of young children who will naturally believe what they are told or the parents of these propagandized children allowing decisions involving many thousands of dollars to be influenced by their misled children the use of schoolchildren to advance a political agenda is an excellent reason to support the increased use of educational vouchers and the expansion of home schooling opportunities as for the teachers advancing a political message to schoolchildren shame on them robert graves vacaville calif
