designs on a new market niche targets little known unit for commercial interiors aims to expand its business phoenix when the arizona diamondbacks decided to overhaul the interior of their year old baseball stadium last winter the teams executives went to target not one of the retail stores around the country but the retailers less well known commercial interiors division designers from target corp spruced up the stadiums clubhouse made the suite level dining areas more inviting and hunted down a massive conference table for the teams boardroom while target has built its brand as a purveyor of stylish but affordable apparel and mass market merchandise it has quietly carved out a profitable niche applying a similar philosophy to designing interiors for companies perhaps surprising for a company that caters to midmarket shoppers at its stores much of its interiors work is at image conscious businesses including some of americas largest companies and white shoe law firms now the unit target commercial interiors is trying to broaden its reach to medium size and small companies as well and its nudging its way into the spotlight with more jobs at sports venues hotels and other sites in the public eye tci as its known inside target headquarters is a relatively small part of the retailer which had nearly &# billion in sales last year but the interiors business is growing in scope the units more than employees many of them certified interior designers dont shop at target stores for their decorating supplies but they do leverage the companys scale and sourcing ability to get good prices and find cutting edge products an advantage in an industry dominated by regional and local design and architecture firms tci with offices across the street from targets headquarters in minneapolis was previously dayton commercial interiors a year old unit of targets original parent company dayton hudson corp since adopting the target name in tcis projects have included designing many areas in the minneapolis headquarters of general mills inc tci designers have been seeking out furniture and fixtures for a minneapolis w hotel one of starwood hotels &amp resorts worldwide inc s boutique hotels set to open next summer targets team tracked down sleek gray bureaus and round hot pink lacquered minibars for the rooms "with the target name the world is your oyster the name is everywhere " says tci president joe perdew he says high end clients havent had any qualms about an association with a discount store brand "many of our clients buy very nice expensive wood furniture you would think that they would balk at buying it from target but the problem never came up " he says tci offers a full slate of design and decorating services but frequently works with outside architects and designers the unit sees an opportunity in work for smaller companies because their options have been generally limited to office supply stores or local office furniture dealers which tend to have a relatively narrow product range says ashok dhariwal tcis vice president of operations as part of its effort to reach new customers tci opened its first office furniture store in bloomington minn two years ago the store branded target commercial interiors carries professional grade furnishings from about manufacturers and a broad selection of merchandise from wall art to different models of office chairs some of the manufacturers smaller less expensive items such as &# adesso desk lamps are also sold in targets discount chain stores target says sales at the furniture store are running above expectations for the year though it wont disclose numbers and target officials say they see great potential in the concept however there are obstacles to expansion one key issue several furniture lines the store carries such as steelcase inc have exclusive agreements with furniture dealers in other cities carl bergauer outgoing chairman of the office product dealers association says tcis approach is unique in the industry "if it catches on youll see other dealers try to emulate it " he says but mr bergauer who is also president of dallas based facility logistix an office furniture company that supplies large and midsize companies says target faces challenges if it plans to expand its office store concept outside its home market "its difficult to hire strong enough people in a retail environment earning retail wages that also have the experience thats needed " he says he adds that its equally challenging to find installation and delivery services in different markets for some the target name is a leap when it comes to large scale design and decorating projects jeffrey moorad the diamondbacks general partner and chief executive officer admits he was taken aback when the teams chief operating officer tom garfinkel told him he was hiring target to spruce up the stadium bypassing companies that specialize in athletic facilities "now i dont know what i like better the job they did or what they charged us " says mr moorad he declined to reveal the price and tci says its rates are proprietary information mr garfinkel learned about tci in when he was working for chip ganassi racing an owner of car racing teams in north carolina and tci designed the interior of a new facility the chase field revamp came after a rebranding of the team that included changing its color to red from teal and purple to emphasize the romance of the game tci designer lynn munyon replaced commercial sponsor signs next to concession stands with big black and white photos of fans in frames that can be updated with new images noise inducing ceramic tiles were replaced with industrial grade carpet tiles that can be changed as they get dirty the designers also found a way to avoid the expense of replacing the portable concession stands instead they simply covered them with industrial adhesive paper in the new team color the challenge at winthrop &amp weinstine a general practice and litigation law firm in minneapolis was to find furniture to suit the rich african cherry wood architects had used in the offices ms munyon found modular wood furniture that looked custom made but cost less "although target is a discount store this division is pretty high end yet affordable " says becky jenness the law firms executive director the furniture for a partners office for example cost about &# "architects are not always practical and functional " she says "target was both and helped us come in under budget " corrections &amp amplifications carl
