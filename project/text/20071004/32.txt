seminar that gives an overview of college admissions testing such programs which are offered free to employees come at a time when health care premiums are rising and employers are cutting back many benefits to compensate companies are adding more "soft" benefits from group discounts on gym memberships to pet insurance that cost them very little if anything "there has been a more open attitude towards benefits that are off the mainstream " says barry schilmeister principal in the health and benefits division of mercer the human resources consulting unit of marsh &amp mclennan cos as companies increase their employees out of pocket costs they are looking for "touchy feely" benefits that can soften the blow he says employers also see the services as a way to encourage worker productivity since many employees already spend countless hours at the office researching the complex web of college admissions and financial aid "we think its a stressful point in peoples lives financially and emotionally " says tracy simpson associate director of human resources at millennium pharmaceuticals "when something stresses you out emotionally it could affect your worklife as well " the third party companies that have provided these services for a few years are now seeing a huge surge in business and others already in the college admissions business are seeing new potential customers in the corporate world thanks to the general publics obsession over the increasingly competitive world of college admissions "increasingly im hearing from my members who are saying theyre being contacted by companies" to provide counseling to employees says mark sklarow executive director of the independent educational consultants association in fairfax va "theres no doubt im hearing about it more than ever before " college coach based in watertown mass offers programs to companies that include seminars one on one counseling and a toll free hotline that employees can use to make unlimited calls when they or their children have a question the firm now owned by corporate child care company bright horizons family solutions inc employs over two dozen education counselors to teach the seminars and answer calls many of whom used to work at admissions offices at elite schools including georgetown yale and the university of pennsylvania business in the past year has soared says president michael london who signed up twice as many new companies compared with last year bringing the total of companies on the current roster to the corporate clients typically have more than employees and pay anywhere from &# to &# depending on the size of the business and services offered program subjects that college coach offers include helping parents and students weigh the pros and cons of taking the act test versus the sat possible advantages to early application programs how to ensure great recommendations from teachers and dos and donts of college essay writing mr london says the benefit offers what could ordinarily be expensive services making them available to a broad swath of employees whether they are secretaries or ceos he declined to estimate how much such services would cost if offered individually but mr sklarow of the consultants association says that if a private client were to pay for just the individual counseling a typical minute session can range anywhere from &# to &# depending on the region of the country and services offered bruce morbit vice president for organizational development at new york based clothing company phillips van heusen corp attended seminars and private counseling sessions on college admissions last year and another on financial aid this past spring the seminars he says helped him get a better feel for the process and his financial aid prospects for son jonathan a high school junior the fact that the college admissions seminar was led by a former admissions officer from yale gave him confidence in the quality of advice he was getting "i would have never found as good a resource on my own " says mr morbit mary kazan group vice president for corporate benefits at phillips van heusen says the sessions on college admissions offered in both the new york and new jersey offices filled to capacity with employees in bridgewater n j and in new york she says a lot of the value stems from having a helpdesk available to employees to answer their college application questions any time "people can call and say my son wants to study chinese and french and we need to know what schools he should be looking at and they will tell you if you wanted to submit the essay they would give feedback " she says quickly adding "they wont rewrite it its all very above board " ms kazan says that "typically with benefits you hear about things when they go wrong but weve had people stop by our office for the sole purpose of telling us how wonderful this was and how much time it saved them " while she wouldnt say how much it cost the company she said it was "less than one half of one percent of our benefits budget " making it an "extremely wise investment " kaplan inc a unit of washington post co says its programs

service that many employees consider valuable kaplan in turn gets a marketing plug as employees often end up turning later to the company for classes and materials that they pay for applywise in new
