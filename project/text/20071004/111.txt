is equally brutal "having embarrassed themselves in every other way the new york knicks the nbas flagship franchise that plays blocks from the league office broke new ground tuesday " mr heisler writes new york columnists also come out firing at the principals found at fault in the case messrs dolan and thomas and two figures who werent knicks guard stephon marbury and nba commissioner david stern who has been missing from this story unfolding blocks from his office in the new york times selena roberts directs her fire at mr dolan "under jims reign a perverse office lingo developed filled with b words and p words the alphabet soup of misogyny that functioned as daily salutations " ms roberts writes "under jims ownership a rise in superstar entitlement provided stephon marbury with a green light to rock his truck during some backseat boogie with a garden intern after a strip club escapade under jims nose thomas added to the gardens creepy vibe by dismissively treating browne sanders as if she were nothing more than a groupie he once charmed during his playing days " for more on dolans reign at msg the fix highly recommends s l prices profile in sports illustrated from earlier this year new york post columnist mike vaccaro wasnt swayed by the post ruling statements from mr thomas and msg "after a jury properly condemned thomas for what he is and for what he has always been a one man wrecking crew whose staggering levels of arrogance and incompetence have drowned yet another operation with his fingerprints literally all over it there was nothing left for the petulant perp to do except jump up and down and try to scream over another professional shipwreck " he writes on espn com j a adande wonders why mr stern hasnt stepped in to punish the knicks for their bad behavior "he holds players accountable for what they wear to the games what lines they rap in a recording studio how they behave in the offseason " mr adande writes "but when it comes to owners hes been a softie " after telling the press hes innocent mr thomas boarded a plane and headed to knicks training camp in south carolina nba players are back on the job and several columnists check in on what the summer has wrought two columnists check in with players who have expressed unhappiness with their current teams shawn marion showed no hints of a detente with the phoenix suns "marion refused to give any details about his trade demands or his deep unhappiness with the organization " dan bickley writes in the arizona republic "he just sounded defiant elusive and hurt or like someone yearning to play in front of jack nicholson as kobe bryants wingman " but baron davis was more conciliatory when asked if he still intended to walk next summer if the golden state warriors didnt extend his contract now "the warriors hard line stance on davis has nothing to do with love or respect " bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "they think hes an mvp candidate one of the leagues most exciting players and maybe its no point guard behind steve nash hell their whole life revolves around davis if he were to disappear tomorrow the franchise would descend into utter chaos they simply dont see any point in tearing up an existing contract when they hold all the cards they know its downright crazy to make a long term investment in a year old player who still needs to establish his durability davis has missed games over the past five years and maybe davis came to realize that " another two columnists check in with east teams that were swept in the first round of last seasons playoffs two years removed from a title the miami heat are humbler greg cote writes in the miami herald "maybe thats good " mr cote writes "the idea of a repeat championship evidently couldnt motivate this team perhaps humiliation might " the washington wizards crumbled late last season under the weight of star gilbert arenass season ending injury and too much internal dissent "whatever calamity was supposed to undo their aspirations whatever damaged relationships were supposed to detonate their postseasons to come they dealt with them internally and refused to buckle to public opinion " mike wise writes in the washington post true hoops henry abbott meanwhile considers knicks guard marbury in light of his strange summer mr abbott interprets mr marburys strange behavior charitably as wandering and soul searching "when your aging superstar is not playing well its a good thing if hes suddenly open to trying new things " mr abbott writes "maybe at some point hell try the thing that everyone has always wanted of him professionally to prioritize winning above statistics looking good and building his legacy " the slate of baseball and football games sunday pushed college footballs remarkable saturday off the fix agenda monday in any other week though losses by seven of the top ranked teams would be worthy of comment los angeles times columnist chris dufresne attempts to get a handle on the day of upsets "boston college has to be the first team in history to move up five spots from no to no after beating a division i aa team at home by points " mr dufresne writes "sometimes it just pays to be standing on a street corner " south florida which years ago wasnt fielding a football team is the most surprising but not least deserving entrant in the top after coach jim leavitts bulls beat auburn and west virginia "imagine going to acting school then years later being nominated for an oscar " gene frenette writes in the florida times union "or learning to fly a plane and piloting air force one within the same time period what usf has done is off the charts insane especially with a head coach straight out of the bill snyder charm school leavitt has a demeanor about as warm as a glacier but the man who has run usfs program since its inception knows something about coaching defense and hiring a staff that can develop talent " when the baseball playoffs begin today a sentimentalist nl fan with no other rooting interest might find herself rooting for the philadelphia phillies only world series win or the chicago cubs last world
