ruing cdos down under australian beach suburb discovers its exposure to u s subprime woes sydney australia at a recent meeting of the manly council which governs a beachfront sydney suburb topics included meals on wheels an antismoking policy for outdoor areas and u s subprime mortgages earlier this year the council handed million australian dollars us&# million to grange securities a small australian investment bank council staffers were taken with the idea of slightly higher returns that grange representatives proffered they also were put at ease by granges client list which includes dozens of australian councils grange was "quite firm and quite positive about the fact that they thought they could do a bit better than what we were doing ourselves " says jenny nascimento manager of finance operations at manly council now manly is ruing its investment decision as are many councils across australia manly officials say a&# million of the money the council gave grange was invested in collateralized debt obligations bonds underpinned by large pools of debt including in one case u s subprime mortgages as of aug manly was facing a paper loss of a&# on the money it gave to grange funds that were collected from residential and business taxes and charges for sporting facilities and parking among other things "all of the client base are recognized as sophisticated investors who are responsible for their own due diligence relating to their investment decisions " a grange spokesman said "however we do spend a great deal of time explaining the investments to our clients and ensuring all risks etc are clearly outlined in the documentation " initially cdos and other mortgage backed securities were almost solely in the purview of investment banks and hedge funds as these sophisticated buyers became saturated and the u s housing boom of the past several years kept delivering vast quantities of mortgages the banks that created cdos and other mortgage securities looked further afield for potential buyers to sop up the supply last year banks issued &# billion of all types of cdos world wide up from &# billion in according to dealogic a data research firm they found a willing audience among town councils small governments charities conservative state run banks and risk averse individual investors most of them were outside the u s and many had just a few million dollars at most to invest cdos were appealing to many of these average investors because they promised to add a dash of juice to their investment portfolios although cdos often are portrayed as complex and risky derivatives that offer huge returns in many cases they offer an interest rate just a smidgen above government securities or a savings account but supposedly with no more risk sachsenlb a conservative state run bank in germany was so enamored with mortgage securities that it set up an operation to trade mortgage securities and handle other investments from an office in dublin bank of china ltd a big state lender said its exposure to u s subprime mortgages stood at &# billion in the u s by comparison the take up among conservative investors looks relatively small the cdos that washed up on manlys tree lined beaches were selected by grange which has since been bought by wall street brokerage lehman brothers holdings inc the firm distributed its first cdo in grange negotiated with investment banks such as lehman or barclays plc of the united kingdom to tailor products for its conservative client base people close to lehman said "we saw an opportunity and indeed a need from an investor base to get advisory services and have access to the broader fixed income market " said glenn willis granges country head by august there were a&# billion of publicly offered australian cdos outstanding according to an australian central bank report since roughly of australian cdos were bought by such investors as local governments or charity endowments manly is part upscale sydney suburb and part beach town many of its residents enjoy one of the worlds most stunning commutes riding ferries across sydney harbor past the famous sydney opera house to get to work the town which invested a sum equivalent to roughly of its annual operating budget with grange now is counting its losses manly saw the value of its investment in one cdo called federation plummet to a&# as of aug from its original investment value of a&# many other australian councils face the same predicament and must decide whether to suffer the losses now or hang onto securities that face an uncertain future "were good at local government but were not necessarily good at investment " said ross fleming manlys chief financial officer three councils say grange put them into cdos that were outside their criteria for investments or contained other irregularities according to people familiar with the matter for instance the cdo called federation is due to mature in exceeding the year limit for the woollahra council another sydney suburb to hold any security grange has paid at least several million dollars in reimbursements to councils council officials say they declined to comment on why the money had been paid citing confidentiality agreements with grange woollahra council for instance demanded the federation security be bought back and grange complied said tony lewis managing director of lewis securities ltd who acted as an independent adviser to the council grange declined to comment on individual clients a spokesman said that the firm has "canceled trades" in a limited number of instances and that it "engaged in appropriate selling practices in the distribution of its products to clients " people close to lehman note that more than of granges cdos have performed well so far another gripe was that some of its cdos which contained u s and european assets had australian names such as kalgoorlie a western australian mining town famous for gold nickel and brothels these labels disguised the true nature of the investments some say "i will make the conclusion that they were trying to mislead us by giving australian names to u s assets you can draw your own conclusion " said councillor andrew petrie in woollahra which owned kalgoorlie "if theyd been called detroit youd have said whats this " the grange spokesman said the securities were denominated in australian dollars and had other australian characteristics market participants said it wasnt unusual for such securities to have australian names carrick mollenkamp in london craig karmin in new york
