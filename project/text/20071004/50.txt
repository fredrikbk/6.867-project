especially for the newer eco friendly brands how much money would be saved and would delivery be as reliable as our babys changing schedule we tried to buy size s of the classic pampers swaddlers and newer seventh generation diapers the only one of the eco brands that was widely available from several different web sites the pampers werent as ubiquitously available as we anticipated but we managed to find them on four mainstream web sites amazon com babies "r" us drugstore com and diapers the seventh generation brand was available at three of those places we also found them at specialty eco shopping and health oriented web sites like babyorganic where the markups were often much higher at our local grocery store pampers cost &# for a pack of or cents apiece and at a nearby specialty grocery store the seventh generation brand was &# for or cents apiece both excluding new york city and state sales tax most but not all of our online sources were cheaper we found we needed to shop carefully because the additional delivery charges and tax at babiesrus com sometimes made them less of a bargain than they initially seemed we were pleased that the greener option didnt cost that much more than the pampers sometimes it even cost less unfortunately not every web site was able to fill our order as reliably and swiftly as we would have liked amazon com and its affiliates gave us the most frustrating experiences we bought a count box of pampers from bbhealthy com one of the independent merchants that sell via amazon the initial price of &# seemed like a good deal but a steep shipping fee &# brought the total cost to cents a diaper the second most expensive in our test moreover while this was by far the biggest delivery fee we paid the diapers took a week to arrive on our doorstep and didnt even leave the warehouse until after all the other diapers had been delivered a spokesperson for bbhealthy com said "we arent big enough at this time to offer free shipping to our customers but we hope to be one day " a spokesman for amazon said that the company works with its third party merchants to ensure a good shopping experience but that their delivery fees and standards are ultimately not under amazons control that isnt the end of the story amazon itself was able to sell us a count box of seventh generation for the equivalent of cents a diaper pretty good but we opted for the one click check out option which doesnt show you your final tally it took us several additional clicks to get into the part of our account where we could look at a receipt when we got there we discovered that while the item qualified for free shipping they chose standard shipping for us which would cost nearly &# and take longer than the free option we were able to change the order but it turned out to be a moot point six days after we made our purchase amazon emailed us to let us know that instead of one week it would take up to three weeks from the original order date for the product to arrive an amazon spokesman said he couldnt comment on our experience but did say the company "tries very hard to ensure a good shopping experience for our customers " getting an online discount doesnt matter much if you have to pinch hit with pricier nappies from the grocery store while you wait for your order to arrive we couldnt cancel the order online but with some amount of hassle we were able to do it over the phone at the other end of the spectrum diapers is the web site we are most likely to order from again prices amounted to cents a diaper for pampers and cents for

half an hour of placing our order but four days later a follow up email informed us that the store was canceling it because the diapers were out of stock we appreciate that they didnt make us cancel the order the way amazon did but a store that specializes in baby goods shouldnt run out of diapers to our surprise drugstore com had the highest prices and actually charged more than our local grocery stores the online drugstore didnt have the pampers in the large bulk package the best we could do was an count economy size for &# or cents a diaper the seventh generation count was &# or cents apiece but service was efficient and delivery was fast and free the items arrived four days after we placed the order among the specialty stores that carry seventh generation we found a relatively good deal at babyorganic the companys price on a bulk order amounted to cents a diaper a penny more than we found locally we were able to link to the product on babyorganics web site directly from seventh generations web site which made the diapers easy to find delivery took five days also pretty good and this was the only company to send us a ups number for tracking which was a nice added service company amazon com product and price pampers &# for including shipping fee cents apiece seventh generation &# with free shipping for cents apiece shopping and delivery the order was split between amazon and a third party merchant we canceled the first part of the order after amazon told us delivery would take three weeks the third party charged a steep fee for delivery that took
