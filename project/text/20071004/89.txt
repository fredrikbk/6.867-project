politics &amp economics u k s brown must decide if early vote is worth risk a worsening outlook for the united kingdoms economy has presented prime minister gordon brown with a tough choice on whether to call early elections in recent days speculation has grown that mr brown will announce a snap parliamentary election as early as monday allowing his labour party to seek a new five year mandate before an expected slowing in the economy threatens his popularity at the end of the opposition conservative partys annual conference yesterday party leader david cameron challenged mr brown to go ahead "its been gathering a head of steam " says paul richards a political author and labour party special adviser noting labour staffers have been told to be ready to report to campaign offices as soon as next week if mr brown moves to dissolve the member house of commons and call new elections most likely for november he will be going where few british prime ministers have dared to go as prime minister he has the power to determine the timing of the next general election which must occur before the current parliaments five year term ends in may but it has been more than three decades since any u k prime minister called voters to the polls in the first few years of a parliaments term if labour emerged victorious mr brown could remain in power until at least if mr browns party lost he could become britains shortest serving prime minister since the th century the main argument for taking the risk is economic when mr brown took over from tony blair in june the u k economy had been growing at a healthy pace for more than a decade that prosperity has been closely associated with mr brown who served as chancellor of the exchequer or treasury chief under mr blair more recently though trouble in the u k mortgage and housing markets brought into sharp relief last month by a run on deposits at u k mortgage bank northern rock plc has caused many economists to sharply lower their expectations for growth next year the centre for economics and business research a london consultancy has forecast that the worlds fifth largest economy could grow at an inflation adjusted pace of only next year compared with nearly this year "the economic outlook for next year suggests that it would make sense to go now" with a snap election says jonathan said senior economist at the cebr he and other economists expect growth to rebound by but waiting that long could be a daunting prospect for the prime minister and his party the labour governments successful handling of an attempted terrorist plot and recent floods has put it in a good position mr browns approval rating reached in september compared with for the conservatives mr cameron that differential will be difficult to sustain on average a governments approval rating in the u k falls by about a th of a percentage point for every month in power and labour has been in power since despite labours lead in opinion polls voters could act differently if the idea of an election became a reality some of labours votes could go to the liberal democrats a third party that focuses on environmental issues and is often under represented in opinion polls that could result in a parliament with no majority forcing mr brown to search for a coalition currently labour has seats and the conservatives seats in the house of commons "i think gordon brown would be pretty well bonkers to call an election now but it looks like hes gotten himself into a situation where hes going to have to do it " says patrick dunleavy professor of political science and public policy at the london school of economics the economy isnt the only thing on voters minds other issues such as immigration crime and the health system matter at least as much a fact that could tip the scales toward waiting
