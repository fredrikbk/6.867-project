earlier this year came with its management and labor flying smoothly together there may be rough air ahead gerald grinstein who just retired as chief executive managed to cut deltas costs deeply while winning unusual loyalty from the companys largely nonunion work force a typical gesture for the grandfatherly year old late one night last year he scrubbed carpets and seats of a joining other senior executives and front line employees who volunteered to deep clean planes for no pay "you couldnt impress people by just going in there and shaking hands " he says he also made sure workers shared in the financial benefits of the airlines emergence from bankruptcy court protection while forgoing any special compensation himself grateful workers greeted mr grinsteins retirement with five months of farewell dinners and a &# ad in deltas in flight magazine now he has been replaced by a former ceo of a rival carrier known for the most contentious labor relations in the business new chief executive richard h anderson a prior head of northwest airlines corp says employees shouldnt prejudge him that he inherited a tradition of labor confrontations there and likes mr grinsteins approach at delta but many delta employees worry of clashes to come a campaign to unionize flight attendants which could erase the airlines singular advantage over rivals is resurgent deltas new dynamics reflect the complex path being traveled by the major u s airlines four of which have undergone bankruptcy restructurings since the sept terror attacks the industry overall returned to the black only last year after the major airlines pared staff by in the past six years and reduced wages and benefits for those who remained but maintaining profitability could prove as difficult as regaining it weak demand in the u s and rising fuel prices threaten to hasten the next industry downturn the challenge for delta and other big airlines is to hold down costs even as employees push for rewards for enduring tough times at amr corp s american airlines management has rejected pilots demands for pay hikes last month it offered to tie raises for mechanics and ground workers to company profits pilots at northwest refused this summer to fly more hours to make up for reduced staffing forcing cancellation of more than flights the airline agreed to offer overtime and bonuses and hire more pilots now flight attendants say they are overworked and are demanding similar inducements mr grinsteins turnaround of atlanta based delta the third largest carrier by traffic relied partly on an expensive and ambitious expansion of international routes it also combined harsh cost reductions with improved customer service mr grinsteins bold moves helped him raise morale even while reducing workers compensation but along with mr grinsteins solutions as ceo mr anderson inherits potential problems deltas international expansion the cornerstone of its new strategy is risky it is taking on carriers with entrenched success overseas the airline based its post bankruptcy business plan on crude oil in costing &# a barrel plus a cushion for refining costs but lately the price has risen above that to north of &# and the recent love affair between management and employees could sour quickly if labor groups begin pressing for restoration of lost pay and benefits "its a vulnerable industry and hes got to keep that message coming out " mr grinstein says of his successor mr anderson has begun by borrowing from mr grinsteins populist playbook showing up in employee break rooms and energetically courting similar rank and file support mr grinstein joined the delta board in after engineering the sale of western airlines inc to delta for &# million during the next years he was a powerful delta director and led a turnaround from to of the railroad burlington northern inc which became the nations biggest rail company as westerns ceo he persuaded unions to accept pay cuts and work rule changes in exchange for company stock and seats on the board at burlington northern mr grinstein was initially rebuffed on an offer trading concessions for profit sharing and his personal overtures didnt build alliances with labor leaders but he was able to lower debt labor costs and other expenses by consolidating functions in mr grinstein co founded a seattle based venture capital fund madrona venture group which invested in amazon com inc among dozens of technology companies and start ups that helped make him independently wealthy in with delta reeling from an industry depression and the weight of the most expensive pilots contract in u s airline history ceo leo f mullin departed mr grinstein agreed to step in delta was gushing &# million in losses per day and had amassed &# billion in debt rank and file workers were incensed that &# million had been set aside by mr mullin for special pension payouts to retain top executives while regular employee pensions were underfunded by nearly &# billion pilots were under pressure to accept a pay cut delta employees were known for a company spirit that included ordering personal checks with the company logo and wearing their uniforms around the atlanta area where they could count on hearing compliments for deltas service but by "you had an overwhelming reaction that bordered on a sense of betrayal " among employees mr grinstein said one of mr grinsteins first acts as ceo was to go where few delta executives had ventured he strolled from his office across deltas campus of low slung red brick buildings near hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport to eat lunch in the cafeteria "you could see he was trying to start off breaking down this us and them type of barrier " said then chief operating officer jim whitehurst he became a frequent visitor early on mr grinstein vowed to keep delta out of bankruptcy worried that morale would collapse and damage customer service he aimed to slash &# billion more in annual expenses including &# billion in concessions from pilots in november delta pilots agreed to a bigger wage cut than mr grinsteins predecessor had sought plus increased flying hours and a less lucrative pension plan the deal allowed delta to avert a bankruptcy filing by just minutes mr grinstein was convinced front line workers had to have a stake in the turnaround in he started paying employees bonuses of up to &# in months in which delta ranked among the top three airlines in on time arrivals completed flights and baggage handling large digital boards in work areas tracked service improvements nearly &# million in bonuses were paid out over and mr grinstein granted full access to board meetings for one of five employees elected by deltas nonunion workers to represent them in discussions with management starting in early chris muise a safety and compliance manager attended as directors discussed plans including sending planes for feeder routes to outside operators instead of its own subsidiary "we were almost literally mortgaging the entire company " mr muise said later "you couldnt see that effort that absolute commitment from outside the boardroom " in july mr grinstein hired glen hauenstein a former executive at continental airlines inc to reorganize deltas flights in their first meeting mr grinstein unleashed a rant about past senior managers flashy cars "i dont know how we can expect our people to understand when we make job cuts and were driving mercedes " mr grinstein said according to mr hauenstein the owner of a mercedes benz sl mr hauenstein quickly leased a volvo to drive to work mr grinstein at the time drove a chevrolet impala as fuel prices continued to soar delta finally filed for chapter protection in u s bankruptcy court in new york on sept hours later northwest did the same mr grinstein and other executive faced some hostile crowds of workers as they explained the move but employees also were helping delta recover by the end of deltas on time performance had climbed to no among the big carriers from last place it rose to no for all of and the first half of toni weinfurtner a flight attendant based in san diego said small changes under mr grinstein like stylish new uniforms for cabin crews began to restore employee morale as did conference calls in which managers sought flight attendants input aside from the pilot pensions mr grinstein declined to abandon other workers retirement plans instead to cut costs the company negotiated with employee groups to reduce health benefits among other cost cutting moves along with northwest which kept all its pensions intact delta also successfully pushed for legislation giving some airlines extra years to fully fund their retirement plans when us airways group inc of tempe ariz announced an &# billion hostile bid for delta on nov delta employees launched an opposition campaign management helped by giving &# million to the employees council though delta claimed employees were acting independently mr grinstein said it was the employee councils choice how to spend the money meanwhile delta was hitting financial targets outlined in its restructuring plan and key creditors were cooling on the proposed merger some of them worried about the effect on delta morale on jan creditors rejected the merger proposal and endorsed mr grinsteins stand alone reorganization in the plan mr grinstein would take no compensation tied to the companys emergence from bankruptcy beyond his &# annual salary he directed the board to use his stock awards to create an emergency assistance fund for employees company officers were to receive no salary raises until wages for front line workers reach the industry standard unbeknownst to most nonmanagement workers they were to get a equity stake plus nearly &# million in cash raises and other pay it was mr grinsteins way of rewarding them for their sacrifices but also discouraging them from unionizing which would raise costs and threaten the restructuring when northwest emerged from court protection four weeks after delta chief executive doug steenland mr andersons successor took an equity package then valued at &# million over four years line workers received no equity but were given bankruptcy claims worth &# billion and a new profit sharing plan the northwest flight attendants union at the time called mr steenlands package "obscene unfair and out of spirit of any notion of shared sacrifice " northwests ben hirst senior vice president of corporate affairs and administration said the reaction was "based on a misunderstanding of the plan " in public mr grinstein made clear he wanted either mr whitehurst who had developed an intense following among rank and file workers or then chief financial officer edward h bastian to succeed him "our people will feel better if they have someone from inside who is a motivator " mr grinstein said in early summer but he also had set in motion the possibility of mr anderson a longtime acquaintance in early he had suggested mr anderson when board members asked him to recommend his replacement if he suddenly died "that may have had something to do with the decision they made" about ceo he acknowledges on aug delta named mr anderson then executive vice president at minnetonka minn based insurer unitedhealth group inc as the new boss mr bastian was given the newly created post of president eight days later mr whitehurst resigned mr whitehurst declined to comment mr bastian called mr anderson "a great choice " "it would have been more comfortable to have somebody lead us who went through the battle " said otis strong a customer service agent in atlanta in an interview "we dont really know much about our new ceo " mr anderson a texas native and former prosecutor there was chief operating officer at northwest before the board appointed him ceo in labor relations at northwest long had been marked by aggressive unions and hard line management mr anderson noted in an interview "it was hard to try to turn around decades of behavior " he said his more open style of leadership marked "a cultural shift " said danny campbell president of the northwest flight attendants union at the time mr campbell said mr anderson met with him every quarter and defused some tough issues but mr anderson drew ire in when the company reneged on an agreement struck years earlier to buy back &# million in stock given to workers employees who had taken the shares in exchange for agreeing to &# million in concessions to keep the airline out of bankruptcy felt betrayed the decision "was his no downfall" with employees said stephen gordon president of the northwest unit of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers mr anderson who left northwest the next year said in the interview that the reneging "was really a board decision " in northwests bankruptcy proceedings the employees received &# million after winning a breach of contract court ruling over the stock delta employees heightened worries are strengthening an effort to unionize the roughly delta flight attendants according to organizers who have spent the past year building a national field operation for a card signing drive "we have a lot more interest than originally expected " said ms weinfurtner the delta flight attendant adding that many workers are "apprehensive" about mr anderson she also notes the airline hasnt returned wages to the industry standard yet mr anderson says delta employees have nothing to fear and that the plan put in place by mr grinstein is a good one his job will be to make it work and he wont bring northwests tough labor traditions to delta mr anderson says "for an airline to be successful " he says "youve got to care about your customers and care about your employees " joann s lublin contributed to this article
