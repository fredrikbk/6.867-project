readback mr nouveau riche in h g wellss tono bungay the source of wealth shifts online edition "tono bungay" may not appear on the conventional and usually heartsinkingly dreary lists of "best english novels " but its main character edward ponderevo should be recognized as one of fictions most intriguing and rascally white collar criminals why there arent more great novels about financial crime is a mystery to me to call ponderevo a snake oil salesman is accurate but it vastly understates his wealth and influence starting with his first tonic tono bungay "mischievous trash slightly stimulating aromatic and attractive" he built a financial empire that made him one of the most powerful men in england for his creator h g wells ponderevo personified the revolution in english society in the late th and early th centuries when wealth was democratized no longer was money channeled only through bloodlines now it could be gouged out of the purses of a new class of consumers edward ponderevo was the quintessential mr nouveau riche with his basketball paunch expensive cigars and mcpalaces he saw nothing wrong with selling "rubbish" bottled "for the consumption of foolish credulous and depressed people " as his nephew george described tono bungay but like most rich entrepreneurs he was admirable in some ways infectiously passionate about life loyal to a fault the book is set during a period of frenzied speculation when the financial markets were unregulated and volatile it was a time of "expansion and confidence much money was seeking investment there remained little more for edward to do in his climb to financial greatness than as he said to grasp the cosmic oyster while it gaped " like mr wells the narrator george ponderevo grew up as the son of a housemaid the english aristocracy was second nature to him even if he saw it from below the stairs he lived in the midst of stupendous wealth but his own means "were insistently finite things were few and customs simple " there was no such concept as rags to riches rags stayed rags and riches begot riches so for a man like edward ponderevo who started as a small town chemist to become one of the richest men in the country violated centuries of english tradition like george ponderevo mr wells found the change a decidedly mixed blessing "one felt that a smaller but more enterprising and intensely undignified variety of stupidity had replaced the large dullness of the old gentry " the industrial revolution also wiped out other traditional values when edward told george that he was thinking of cornering the market on quinine to drive up the price george said "i had the clear impression that anyone who contrived to do that would pretty certainly go to jail now i know that anyone who could really bring it off would be much more likely to go to the house of lords " herbert george wells was born in and worked as a drapers assistant and a teacher before he began writing novels short stories and essays he is best remembered for his science fiction including "the war of the worlds" and "the time machine " he was a student of politics science literature business and love and critics said he tried to stuff too many of these subjects into "tono bungay " it certainly is what my mother used to call a shaggy dog story digressive to a sometimes irritating degree "mr wellss habit of letting his pen wander at large is growing upon him " a reviewer wrote in when "tono bungay" was published "he rather boasts and glories in not keeping to the point " another early critic complained the novel was "far too exuberant too unsifted " but i found the book full of odd bits of information and insight and sometimes just wonderfully fun i liked edward ponderevos disdain for what he called "drum and trumpet history" the battles the mistresses the treaties "what i want to know is in the middle ages did they do anything for housemaids knee and what did they put in their hot baths after jousting " both excellent questions another excellent novel about business and financial mischief during roughly the same period is anthony trollopes "the way we live now " i was forced to read it a few years ago when two people in my book group rammed it through the approval process and i was steamed its pages but i came to thank those book group tyrants although i never admitted it to them
