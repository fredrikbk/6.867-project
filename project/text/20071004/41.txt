fiscally fit be careful when selling a car an old pickup sold long ago comes back to haunt the cullens online edition there are few things i hate to get more than a certified letter its almost always bad news and so it was last week when i opened an envelope to find a collection letter from a local car towing and impound service the letter stated that a vehicle of ours a f ford pickup was impounded april by the local police department we do own an f pickup but it was parked in our driveway the truck thats sitting in the pound is the f gerry owned almost a decade ago and sold to a friend of a friend the certified letter said we owed the following "towing service &# and storage at &# per day plus sales tax for days " that came out to &# for towing and &# for storage not to mention &# in sales tax grand total to spring a year old pickup from impound &# the letter warned that if my husband gerry didnt respond to the collection notice in the next five days he would be subject to a fine of as much as &# and his driving privileges might be suspended or revoked for not more than two years i figured it was just a simple mix up so i called the towing service and spoke to the manager but he wasnt exactly helpful the car was impounded by the local police he said because it was abandoned and the license plate didnt match up with the cars vehicle identification number the towing service did a vin search and my husbands name appeared as the cars most recent owner the manager told me and then he said something that really worried me "if the person you sold the truck to didnt retitle it in his name when you sold it to him your husband is still considered the legal owner of the truck " i admit i was cowed gerry had handled the sale of the car and i wondered if he or the buyer might have skipped a crucial step that could leave us responsible for this mess and if the buyer didnt bother to retitle the car maybe he didnt bother to insure it as well i couldnt bring myself to think about what could have happened if we were legally responsible for a truck being driven around new jersey uninsured for a decade if we had sold the car through a dealership the paperwork would have been handled for us but wed sold the car to an individual so it was our responsibility to make sure wed made the transfer properly gerry assured me that hed done everything he was supposed to do under new jersey rules to legally transfer title of the truck to the buyer each state has different rules regarding proper title transfer in our state and many others both the seller and the buyer have paperwork to fill out to ensure the transfer is legal per our states rules gerry signed the back of the trucks existing title along with the date the trucks sale price and the odometer reading before handing it over to the buyer philip reed author of the book "strategies for smart car buyers " says providing an accurate odometer reading is critical when selling a vehicle once you sign off on the title the odometer reading provides proof of the moment in time the car is no longer legally yours "the key for readers is to actually look at the odometer dont round it off " he says "the buyer could go around the corner and have an accident and claim that you are responsible " gerry also gave the buyer a receipt and asked him to sign off on a letter stating the terms of the sale most states recommend that buyers and sellers complete a bill of sale to provide proof of the transfer and to protect sellers like us from any future tickets violations or other problems with the vehicle dmv org a clearinghouse of motor vehicle information from all states provides a sample bill of sale here other states require sellers to fill out an additional vehicle transfer form finally gerry turned the trucks license plates into our local motor vehicle commission agency and received a receipt which canceled the registration of the truck in his name to complete the transfer of the vehicle in our state a buyer needs to retitle the vehicle register the car in his or her name and pay transfer fees typically states require the buyer to show proof of insurance the signed title the sale price and a sales tax form some states also require additional documentation such as a current emissions inspection or smog certification or if the car is financed a lien release notification you can find your own states rules on title transfer here we looked over the paperwork from the sale of our truck which we keep tucked away in our fire box along with purchase and sale documents from every car weve owned gerry was right hed followed all the rules to transfer the title to the buyer and we had the bill of sale and the license plate receipt as proof still the towing service manager said that if the buyer hadnt held up his end of the deal and retitled the car in his name we might be legally responsible but thats generally not so according to keith kiser vice president of vehicle programs at the american association of motor vehicle administrators "as long as you can prove you sold the vehicle and everything is properly dated you shouldnt be legally bound to the failings of someone else " he says so our bill of sale signed off title and license plate receipt provide proof of legal transfer but some states also recommend that sellers take the additional step of notifying the county tax assessors office of the sale that provides another layer of protection in the event the future owner fails to properly title the vehicle gerry hadnt been in contact with the buyer in years when he finally tracked the buyer down he assured us he had registered and retitled the vehicle but told us that he in turn had sold the truck a few years ago he then contacted the motor vehicle commission and discovered the most recent buyer had never registered the vehicle the fraudulent plates found on the truck belonged to yet another person to clear ourselves of the towing service charges i took our documents down to the police station that originally impounded the vehicle and provided proof that the truck didnt belong to gerry we gave the police the name and address of the trucks current owner which we got from the original buyer the police in turn contacted the towing service and provided the correct information so we were no longer on the hook i also called the towing service manager and asked him to provide us with another letter this one stating that gerry wasnt responsible for the vehicle in the pound the incident drove home how important it is to maintain a paper trail when buying and selling a car just a month ago id considered weeding out some of older documents because our fire box was teeming with papers instead ill be buying a bigger
