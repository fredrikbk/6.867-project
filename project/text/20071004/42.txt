cubs milwaukee houston cincinnati nl west los angeles san diego arizona san francisco colorado our guest pickers had lots of comments about how the pennant races played out "yikes i went in predicting the division winners and with the wild card i said the indians would get the al wc and they won the division go figure " alex belth writes "aw nertz i had the dodgers beating the indians in the serious too so whatta i know i also didnt think the yankees would be able to do it this year this is the third season where theyve had to dig themselves out of an early hole and the hole was deeper this year than in or they brought back roger clemens for an absurd amount of money and he was ok but they didnt trade any young talent at the deadline instead they found a goldmine in joba chamberlain who seemingly solved the bridge to mariano rivera for the red sox josh beckett was the man kevin youkilis was great in the first half and mike lowell was wonderful all season jonathan paplebon was terrific for a second straight year but in the end david ortiz is their greatest weapon the rockies cmon winning of their last not to mention their first playoff game thats what makes baseball great the mets losing a seven game lead with to play absolutely agonizing its what makes baseball break your heart " jon bois writes "on paper every american league postseason team is better than every national league postseason team if the nls going to take the series it has to send a team with some momentum that team of course would be the rockies philadelphia has a little momentum but their playoff berth had as much to do with the mets collapse as it did their record over their last games the other nl contenders chicago and arizona arent terribly great teams and if it werent for their energy colorado wouldnt be either " larry borowsky writes "my regular season predictions what a joke i only called three of the eight playoff teams and neither of my predicted pennant winners even made the playoff field and those were my most accurate calls they were so execrable i hesitate to offer any predictions for october no thats a lie i dont hesitate for a second im still convinced i know what im talking about its part of a sports fans license so lets make it red sox over yankees for the al pennant cubs over the rockies for the nl pennant with the sox taking it all couldnt they just leave the national league out of the playoffs entirely this year the senior circuit only produced one team with as many as wins the diamondbacks and they finished with a minus run differential the nl best d backs would have missed the playoffs by four games in the american league so why allow these flawed teams to compete for the championship just let the four american league teams play it off if mlb absolutely must have three rounds of playoffs to satisfy the tv contract then add the tigers and mariners plus any two nl teams chosen at random or maybe the tigers the mariners the braves because whats october without john smoltz and the national league all star team the all stars might be capable of extending the bosox or angels to games in the world series " nick dallamora writes "wow so i actually got a couple of these things right oh and dont believe carl if he tries tell you his as pick in the al west was for angels skuuunkkeeeddd " will leitch writes "its always comforting having the yankees in the playoffs it would feel weird without them but this is a different looking yankees team and oddly they look stronger than recent years but id rather play the angels in the first round than the indians " as for the collapse of his cardinals as well as the mariners dodgers and orioles the writes "well the cardinals should have never been here in the first place that team was terrible and they still finished only five games off last years pace a friend from seattle said hey the mariners got us to the nfl season thats enough that sums it up until jeff kent shaves his mustache the dodgers will never make it to the next level and the orioles were good at some point " joe sheehan writes "im pretty sure that no one had all four of the playoff teams given that i dont think anyone had the rockies before the season started theyre a great story even if they and the phillies screwed up a pretty strong nl set of picks for me the story of the year has to be the parity especially in the nl while some people will focus on the yankees and red sox and not entirely without merit the other teams in mlb just arent separated by much increased revenue sharing and a clutch of new parks have eliminated whatever excuses may have existed at the start of the decade " paul steiger focused on the fourth place finish of the los angeles dodgers last years nl west champion he had predicted theyd win the wild card "ok so it wasnt an epic last minute horror like the one in flushing " steiger writes "still the la dodgers did a pretty impressive nosedive wins and losses and the best record in the national league in mid july followed by the rest of the way the reasons in late september they ran into the hottest team in baseball the colorado rockies whom they ordinarily dominate but who beat them seven in a row during a depressing two week period before that final dive they had pulled to within games of the nl west lead with a run there was also the loss of randy wolf for the season in june with a shoulder injury but most important are the moves that general manager ned colletti and manager grady little made and didnt make over the winter and in the first half of the season the previous year they were geniuses not this time the worst of the bad moves acquiring juan pierre and luis gonzalez letting nomar garciaparra clog first base and third base and hiring journeyman outfielder brady clark they need to do better this offseason starting with the starting rotation and the offensive black hole at third base " dave studeman writes "the american league may be the superior league but every winning story in the national league was a special tale the phillies who set an all sport record for losing this year with their th win won the national east in an improbable comeback the cubs long the doormat of the national league in the immortal steve goodmans words managed to come from far behind the brewers to capture the national central the diamondbacks managed to win games despite all expectations to the contrary and the rockies went in september and won of their last games to take the wild card slot its hard not to like an al team winning the world series however in our preseason selections i picked the red sox and phillies to advance to the world series and thats still a pretty good guess however the phils just dont have the pitching depth behind cole hamels isnt kyle kendrick one of the best surprise stories of the year so im moving my nl choice to the cubbies who have the pitching depth fielding chops and bullpen to make it into november first time ive ever said that november yikes " fry "one for eight and i picked the reds wow when youve been revealed as a complete dope always fall back on lines from the simpsons so anyway

philadelphia new york mets atlanta los angeles san diego st louis chicago cubs milwaukee arizona houston florida colorado pittsburgh san francisco in each of the last five years at least one wild card team made it to the world series this year readers think their pick for the al wild card will win the league championship while think the same about the nl wild card kansas city and washington are the only teams chosen by no one to make the playoffs kudos to benjamin hazelwood the only reader who picked the rockies borowsky weighs in on what strategy built the two wild card teams and other playoff teams and contenders "the age of player development is upon us the rockies lineup is almost entirely homegrown ditto the indians angels and diamondbacks the phils four best hitters rotation ace and closer all came up through the system even the checkbook driven yankees have a homegrown ace and closer and their starters at all four up the middle positions were developed in house and this is to say nothing of the teams that barely missed the playoffs the brewers braves and dodgers drew most of their talent from within among the playoff teams only the red sox and cubs rest upon a foundation of players brought in from other organizations related to the above according to usa todays payroll rankings three of the playoff teams were among the bottom eight in payroll the indians had the rd largest payroll in the league the rockies were th and the d backs th " leitch writes of the rockies "theyre absolutely winning that division next year "  which two teams will go to the world series

beckett and john lackey were outstanding as well i give the nod to the indian pitchers over beckett c c pitched a bunch more innings carmona had a better era but its a close call dallamora "peavy is a

by just a teeny tiny bit jake peavy should win it in the national but there are a slew of good candidates in the american my choice is c c sabathia "  who will win the al and nl mvp awards each al

alex rodriguez is a shoo in to win his third al mvp award in five years after leading the majors in home runs and runs batted in he also leads baseball in win shares a stat that combines a players contributions and distills it into the number of wins contributed to the team david wright and albert pujols lead the nl in that stat but their teams disappointing absence from the playoffs a year after they met in the nlcs eliminates them from contention matt holliday of the rockies or jimmy rollins of the phillies will likely win and either would be deserving so would rollinss teammate chase utley belth " ops+ thats an impressive looking line for magglio ordonez who had hits including doubles and drove in runs a career year and still its only good for second place in the al mvp voting because alex rodriguez had perhaps the greatest season of his career according to ops+ rodriguezs campaign was even greater than ops+ and and yet whether rodriguez remains in pinstripes will surely be determined shortly if he repeats his and playoff performances its hard to imagine him staying if he performs reasonably well even if the yankees lose or does ok and the yankees win its a no brainer that hell stay in new york " bois "the mvp races are easiest for me to call right now alex rodriguez has been a given for the al award all season the nl though is almost as easy jimmy rollins did have a great season but matt holliday is going to win it he and to a lesser extent troy tulowitski carried this team through a few stretches without holliday the guy who finished homers short of the triple crown the rockies would be nowhere but then again i picked jermaine dye and andruw jones to win mvps at the seasons start so i know absolutely nothing about baseball " borowsky "albert pujols played all year with a wobbly elbow and a hamstring that was wound even tighter than his manager psyche he had no protection behind him st louis got the leagues worst production out of both the no and no batting order slots he set career lows in homers runs and rbis and yet somehow he managed to finish fourth in the national league in ops second in win shares th in vorp and third in win probability

albert pujols wont win and im annoyed that one of my possible alternate picks david wright should win he wont because jimmy rollins is a better story and its all about the story most of the time " studeman "back in march i picked a rod and pujols for the mvp awards a rod will obviously win but the nl mvp is a toss up if the cardinals had made the postseason pujols would probably be it but now

scored in any one regular season game in the majors this year by the two teams combined how many games decided by one run will there be in the regular season average answer for runs in the highest scoring game median most popular answer lowest highest average answer for number of one run games median most popular answer lowest highest on july the twins beat the white sox as they added a pair of field goals to two touchdowns later that day the twins beat the white sox again this time with four field goals despite minnesotas one day offensive explosion it scored fewer runs than all but five teams for the season as a whole that beats last years high scoring contest by four runs and even tops this years victory by texas over baltimore there were one run games this season topping both the median and mean picks by more than nine people guessed the highest scoring game would feature runs no one predicted there would be one run games but thomas sattler and guest picker nick dallamora came the closest guessing and dallamora gloated about it "bow suckas "  which team will have the most improved record measured in increase in total victories chicago cubs cleveland arizona milwaukee kansas city tampa bay pittsburgh baltimore atlanta seattle anaheim cincinnati colorado st louis boston houston san francisco texas the cubs have improved by wins the indians by the diamondbacks and the rockies by apiece and the red sox and mariners by each dallamora "its really good to see the cubbies back in the playoffs picking up games on last year was more than i had predicted but no prior and

hits median most popular answer lowest highest average answer for jeters playoff hits median most popular answer lowest highest its unclear what implication this has for the playoffs but for what its worth jeter had hits during the regular season more than a rod dallamora who guessed that a rod would get hits and jeter writes "too bad for my pick that sabathia and carmona play for the same team "  there were runs scored per game in the regular season by what percentage will that change in round to the nearest percentage point and specify a direction up or down average answer for percentage change in runs per game rounded to nearest whole number median most popular answer biggest decline biggest increase the average was runs per game down from last year but up from runs the first time we checked in on the contest and runs in august readers got this right dallamora i really hadnt noticed how out of control baseball games get in terms of scoring so my pick makes me look pretty stupid the rangers beating up on the orioles last week was downright embarrassing utter shenanigans  name two teams that will have only one all star counting those who are on the active roster for the game and those who are chosen but skip it for each team you get correct washington kansas city pittsburgh tampa bay baltimore seattle colorado milwaukee cincinnati texas houston san francisco arizona florida oakland philadelphia anaheim atlanta san diego in the rosters the mariners rockies and brewers each with two or more players selected as all stars were the big surprises for our readers no one picked these one representative teams blue jays cardinals and white sox  on what date will barry bonds hit career hr no just readers didnt think hed pass hank aaron on the all time list this year of the who expected it this year the median and mean was august the most popular answer was july bonds hit no on august he added six more afterwards six people predicted no would come on august and three predicted august but no one got the correct date bois has some thoughts on bondss destination next season now that the giants have announced they wont sign him "obviously barry bonds is only going to an al team that doesnt respect itself so that narrows the list down to three teams minnesota tampa bay and baltimore tampa bay probably wouldnt want to pony up the cash it would be hilarious to see the twins throw away their future and use their freed up johan santana money to sign bonds but baltimore does have a reputation for throwing money at bloated unproductive has beens albert belle sammy sosa rafael palmeiro im calling the orioles " dallamora "the giants letting bonds go was a big surprise to me not only are they essentially saying get lost but its emphasized times when you think about how the fans of any other ballclub are going to act towards his arrival i see him on the rangers they definitely need a dh and freed up a ton of money by ditching teixeira they also have no idea how to spend money on pitching " fry "the more interesting question is where a rod will wind up " pondering where bonds will end up next year leitch writes "in all of our hearts oh and texas " write
