something new under the sun cheaper solar technology attracts more homeowners larry hagmans tribulations when bill and margaret oliver decided to take the plunge into solar energy earlier this year the retired long beach calif couple searched for months to find someone who could install newfangled solar panels atop their three bedroom home despite the hassles and though the panels cost them &# after government rebates the olivers say theyre ecstatic to be escaping power bills that had soared to almost &# a month the panels contain a relatively new technology for the home called "photovoltaic cells " which convert direct sunlight into electricity with the installation complete their latest monthly bill totaled just &# "we had a cake party when they finished the job " recalls the year old mrs oliver for decades solar energy use was largely confined to a small fringe of diehard conservationists and their sole option was typically a "solar thermal" system that stores heat from the sun to warm pools or appliances but these days solar power is going mainstream in many more homes helped along by a proliferation of new solar technology like cheaper photovoltaic cells and new solar powered gadgets photovoltaic cells most of which are made from silicon have exploded in use around the country over the past five years as once prohibitive costs for home use of the technology have declined between and the number of new photovoltaic systems installed in u s homes nearly tripled to from according to the interstate renewable energy council in latham n y industry officials say that such installations are expected to top this year the number of solar gizmos for the home is skyrocketing as well at last months solar power conference in long beach a record attendees including luminaries like media mogul ted turner crowded past aisles crammed with brochures and products including everything from solar powered water heaters to carports one of the products shown was the sunray sx golf cart made by cruise car inc of sarasota fla the cart comes equipped with a volt battery that is charged by electricity generated from a sheet of black solar cells on the roof the cart can travel as long as three days without having to be charged again the company says and retails for about &# or &# after federal tax credits thats in line with the average price of an electric golf cart also on display were redesigned heating coils for swimming pools heliocol usa inc for instance displayed plastic tubes that collect heat for pools and come battened down with high strength alligator clamps to withstand winds from hurricanes and severe thunderstorms for a typical backyard pool in say arizona the system runs around &# or &# after tax credits since it costs as much as &# a month to heat pools when the weather cools in the arizona desert heliocol vendors say the system can pay for itself in two years but as the olivers discovered when they tried to get their panels installed the solar industry and especially the part centered on the new generation of cheaper photovoltaic cells is going through growing pains that can make the experience of going solar a headache two installers made appointments to come to the couples house but never showed up a third asked the olivers to fax in their power bills then dragged its feet three months later the couple finally got a company akeena solar inc to install the panels on their roof one problem is that there are hundreds of photovoltaic installers to choose from in states such as california and new jersey which are among the most aggressive in offering consumer credits to use solar that makes it difficult to tell whos reliable officials with the solar energy industries association trade group advise consumers to check out installers through their web site www seia org as well as to make sure they are certified by the north american board of certified energy practitioners former "dallas" television star larry hagman for one also had problems with his solar installation in he contracted with an installer to put in a &# array of photovoltaic panels at his acre avocado farm in the mountains above ojai calif but mr hagman says the installer faced the panels away from when afternoon sunlight was strongest another installer he hired took so long he had to fire him and hire another in all it took a year and a half before a job that was originally estimated to take six months could be finished mr hagman says "oh my god i had troubles " says the year old actor whose installation of some solar panels ranks as one of the largest on a residential property one of the biggest questions for homeowners is whether converting to solar power will really save money installers often say you can pay off a photovoltaic roofing system which typically costs &# to &# after rebates and other incentives in as little as years by saving on the cost of traditional power which can easily run &# or more a month but some rooftop systems end up not delivering as much power as promised because the panels arent installed properly or because the electric conversion equipment malfunctions industry officials for their part say the new solar systems generally pay off over the long term sharp corp of japan a major photovoltaic manufacturer estimate consumers spend as much as &# for conventional power over a lifetime and that total could rise since utility rates are soaring around the country because of deregulation by contrast a &# photovoltaic system can appear cheap for mr hagman the economics made sense while he paid &# in cash for his photovoltaic system he says he got a &# rebate from his utility southern california edison co he also slashed his annual power bill from &# to a mere &# mr hagman says what motivated him to go solar was more his concern over power reliability following the blackout in the northeast "i felt if our infrastructure was so delicate i better look to making my own electricity " mr hagman said in a telephone interview from his farm to help make the high costs of solar systems more palatable companies such as solarcity inc have expanded their offerings to include remote monitoring of customers solar production that helps ensure everything is working and that customers are getting the biggest bang for their buck from their solar technology the consumer can also monitor their own systems performance through a web site say officials of the foster city calif firm another option for homeowners who find the installation cost prohibitive is to lease a solar system a san francisco startup called sun run generation llc launched a program in january under which a homeowner can prepay as much as &# for solar power a fraction of the cost of a full &# photovoltaic system the company then installs its own photovoltaic system on the property for the life of a year lease contract consumers who cant afford a full photovoltaic system may also be able to get solar for parts of their home a san diego firm called envision solar inc for instance says it plans to start selling carports covered with photovoltaic cells to generate power for the home and hybrid cars late next year the carports are expected to sell for between &# and &# and there are also new products that use the older solar thermal technology canadas enerworks inc is marketing a solar thermal water heater called the space saver which is designed to cut power bills while taking up less room than a traditional heater priced at &# or about &# after government and utility rebates in some states officials of the company say the tank can pay for itself in as little as three years the most economical approach of all industry officials say is to buy one of the growing number of new homes already equipped with solar homebuilding giant lennar corp is building about homes in california in a partnership with sunpower corp of san jose calif officials of the miami based builder say they can sell the homes priced at &# to &# in the biggest tracts around sacramento calif without charging extra because of tax credits and the lower costs of installing solar equipment in a new home in return lennar officials say the sales rate for their solar homes is running almost three times greater than conventional ones in a down market
