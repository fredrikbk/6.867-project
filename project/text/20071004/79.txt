politics &amp economics bank bills senate champion has ties to industry sessions drives patent provision has shares in firms washington in late july sen jeff sessions began promoting legislation that would aid some of the nations biggest banks among them two institutions in which he and his wife hold shares working closely with allies in the industry the alabama republican championed an amendment that would allow banks to avoid paying what an industry executive says could amount to billions of dollars a year in royalties the royalties on a technology that converts paper checks into electronic images are being claimed by datatreasury corp of plano texas which holds a handful of patents related to the process at mr sessionss urging the measure was folded into broader legislation aimed at overhauling the u s patent system which is being prepared for debate this fall on the senate floor mr sessions says the amendment reflected his longstanding desire to limit what he considers excessive civil litigation as well as his concerns about predatory patent suits he also has close ties to the banking industry which has been among his top campaign contributors over the years mr sessionss efforts come against the backdrop of a legislative battle over the nations patent system that is forcing lawmakers to pick winners and losers across the economy the banking provision advocated by mr sessions shows how members of congress can expose themselves to potential conflict of interest questions when their actions support a particular industrys agenda alongside movement in congress in recent years a series of federal court rulings related to the patent system has tilted against what critics describe as predatory litigation among other things the rulings have limited the use of injunctions against firms accused of infringement and made it more difficult for damages to be imposed on infringers mr sessions and his wife own stock in two of the institutions that would be shielded by the amendment according to financial disclosure records mr and mrs sessions between them own shares in compass bancshares inc birmingham ala valued at between &# and &# his wife also owns stock in citigroup inc valued at between &# and &# in an interview last week mr sessions said his stock holdings had "nothing to do" with the amendment which he says was needed to address a problem that "legitimately deserved fixing " the compass stake was inherited from his wifes parents he says "id not given it any thought " he adds "that was just not in any way a part of my calculations " after queries by the wall street journal mr sessions this week decided "to seek counsel" on what steps he might take to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest such as placing his holdings in a blind trust said his spokesman stephen boyd mr sessions is willing to do "whatever he needs to do" to "remove even the appearance of impropriety " mr boyd said the spokesman said "theres no ethical violation here " noting the senators actions were in keeping with senate rules in the case of compass mr boyd said the amendment couldnt have influenced the stock price because the company is being acquired and the stock price for existing shareholders is fixed the nations banks have been among the senators most reliable campaign supporters from to they donated more than &# that ranks sixth among the senators top contributing industries according to records analyzed by the center for responsive politics a watchdog group contributions from executives at compass bancshares and from the companys political action committee totaled &# over that time according to the center citigroups contributions to mr sessions totaled &# the center said at issue in mr sessionss amendment is the growth of check imaging technology which financial institutions use to convert paper checks into digital images the concept received a boost after sept when the flow of checks around the u s was halted by the grounding of air traffic in the wake of the terrorist attacks congress responded in by passing a law to encourage electronic check transfers requiring banks to accept any check presented electronically datatreasury which has only three employees according to the company claims most of the rights to that technology and has sued dozens of large banks alleging patent infringement while some firms have settled and others have signed licensing agreements more than banks and check clearinghouse firms remain defendants in litigation brought by datatreasury they include big institutions such as bank of america corp and citigroup as well as regional concerns such as compass bancshares which does business across the sun belt and is a major part of the alabama business community it isnt clear how much is at stake for compass which is named in a suit filed by datatreasury pending in the u s district court in the eastern district of texas a compass spokesman declined to comment saying the company doesnt comment on pending litigation or legislation citigroup declined to comment datatreasury spokesman eric wetzel portrays the company as an underdog "small inventors like datatreasury are crucial to american innovation " he says datatreasurys founder claudio ballard an expert in electronics secured two of the patents the company later acquired patents on related technology from a banker who now sits on datatreasurys board mr wetzel says datatreasury which once employed about workers has been forced to pursue legal remedies american bankers association president edward yingling said the fees at stake "are potentially in the billions of dollars " mr yingling and others point to the wide legal net cast by datatreasury as an example of a patent system gone awry mr sessions describes datatreasury as a "patent troll " suggesting the companys primary business is to generate licensing revenue by filing lawsuits to enforce patents putting a stop to predatory litigation is a primary goal of legislation moving through congress that would overhaul the u s patent system and is a big reason why the financial services industry has played a prominent role in pushing the bill the impact of many of the provisions in the bill wouldnt take effect until after enactment the sessions amendment would reach back providing immunity to institutions already sued by datatreasury a former alabama attorney general mr sessions is a longtime proponent of imposing limits on civil liability claims supporting legislation that would shield doctors and handgun manufacturers among other things "i believe in americas litigation system but we have a lot of abuses " mr sessions says mr sessions says his office worked closely with the financial services industry on the amendment citing discussions with the financial services roundtable a trade group representing an array of financial services firms mr sessions says his office also had discussions with an alabama based bank which he declined to name except to say it wasnt compass bancshares
