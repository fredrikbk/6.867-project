a cultural conversation with joseph thompson working to repair a reputation north adams mass the news from the massachusetts museum of contemporary art has been one long string of positives since it opened in and even in the years prior to that when its founders and backers offered up the museum project as an economic stimulant for the blighted city of north adams however since last spring and intensifying in the summer mass moca as it is called has come in for an unrelenting stream of criticism from all quarters of the art world not for the works on display but for the breakdown in relations between the museum and one of its artists in residence it is a long complicated story in which neither the museum nor the artist in question a year old swiss installation artist named christoph buchel has come out looking good but at least a ruling by a federal district judge on sept on their legal dispute absolved the museum of violating an aspect of u s copyright law known as moral rights various elements of the art world may scream bloody murder about the ruling but those same people have been denouncing the museums director joseph thompson all year long so he can probably handle that asked in to take up residency at mass moca and create a new installation over six weeks in mid with the show originally slated to open to the public by last december mr buchel gave museum officials a growing wish list of found object elements it was always more more more never a fixed list "he would drive around north adams pointing to things and say i want that i want that " mr thompson said the installation titled "training ground for democracy " was to offer a wry commentary on american style democracy and perhaps the too much is never too much theme of the display infected the artists aspirations as well "what surprised me " the year old mr thompson said "is this notion that museums as commissioning agents as patrons of the arts should simply be willing and ready and able to deal with the art diva even if his demands arise from nowhere because they are an expression of passion it was all the artist has rights and we at the museum have responsibilities and we heard very little about the artists responsibilities and our rights this notion of the free spirit artist whirling around in their own orbit toiling away against constraint irrespective of all those other people and realities is an early modernist romantic idea it is also an idea that most of the artists we have worked with most of the artists i know and respect do not share particularly in projects that require a high degree of collaboration and respect and responsibility where there are deadlines " this is the story mr buchel finally showed up on oct to create a massive assemblage artwork for the football field size gallery in building of mass moca "training ground for democracy " which was supposed to have been placed on display starting last december went way over budget but the problem problem no was that there had been no formal budget or written agreement of what was to be produced and what that production would involve in july at a preliminary hearing u s district court judge michael ponsor chided the museum for its lackadaisical approach stating "jeez a second year law student could have drafted a contract that would have eliminated of the problems that the parties are now arguing about " mr thompson defended his approach stating that "we enter these relationships based on goodwill and good faith " but goodwill and faith cant be a one way street mr buchel provided mass moca staffers with an ever growing list of items he wanted the museum to find and purchase for the installation such as a movie theater a mobile home a carousel a voting booth a police car a bus an oil tanker a jetliners fuselage stuff that would be burned or smashed then hung from the ceiling or placed around the gallery as the artist saw fit before mr thompson said "enough" back in january causing the artist to stay in switzerland and refuse to complete the installation more than &# had been spent on buchels wish list almost double the &# that thompson had casually mentioned back in the fall of in a note to the artist about other things no small sum for a museum with an annual budget of only &# problem no mass moca earns its money from admissions rent from commercial tenants at the site and from donations and gifts from individuals and foundations in approximately equal proportions when talks between the museum and the artist failed mr thompson decided to take mr buchel to court on may problem no in order to determine whether the museum would be violating the visual artists rights act an extension of federal copyright law if it exhibited the as yet uncompleted installation until that ruling came down mass moca staffers placed tarpaulins over the various elements of the installation making them unviewable to the public but also suggesting that there was some problem with the art that needed to be hidden from the public problem no criticism from around the art world has been heaping up the boston globes then art critic ken johnson described mass mocas actions as "sad dumb and shameful " a new york times critic roberta smith noted that "by opening this strange quasi display mass moca does damage to itself and to its reputation as a steward of art and as a conduit between living artists and the public " newsweek critic peter plagens gave the pox on both your houses verdict "the artist he hopes comes off as a genius just a little too brilliant for this dumbed down world and the museum comes off as a stuffy pusillanimous censor of real creativity " a pained expression is evident on mr thompsons still boyish face "i spend nights rolling and thinking about exactly what decision started this avalanche that was impossible to stop " he said but each decision may have been one too late throughout the process he and the other staffers at mass moca did things the way that theyd done them before ways that had garnered them praise in the past when discussions with mr buchel reached an impasse mr thompson said he sought the right thing to do "we didnt just open the show to the public which we might have done nor did we just back up the trucks to the door and shovel the material out which we might have done " hoping to force a negotiated solution mr thompson chose to take the artist to court seeking in a declaratory judgment what the museums options actually were things didnt work as intended mr buchel refused to budge and an outcry over a large contemporary art museum suing an individual artist reverberated throughout the art world obscuring mr thompsons hopes and even the facts of the case prevailing in court doesnt mean convincing the world just ask o j simpson and mr thompson who has devoted the past years to mass moca knows he has repair work to do that process begins with a recap of the museums experience as a patron of artists "weve probably worked with well over artists over the past eight years at mass moca " he said he continues with a defense of mass mocas noncontracts "our deals with artists are if nothing else the model of simplicity we say come here spend a certain amount of time four or six weeks and make a new work sometimes we have a very clear understanding of what that work will be sometimes we dont there is usually some sense of scope " mr thompson came back again and again to his disdain for formal contracts for agreements with artists that are "heavily mediated by pages and pages of contingencies and remedies papering all of which is anathema to me " it is not clear why he is so bothered by written agreements artists are commissioned all the time to create public art projects by city state and federal agencies as well as by corporations hospitals universities and other institutions and individuals and the process doesnt somehow get gummed up by the existence of a formal document contracts exist to provide clarity not to obscure it what is clear is that he doesnt plan to add more paper and lawyering to the agreements he creates with artists nor will he be more selective about the artists asked to come for a residency "there could be some small risk that it could happen again " he said "you rely on good will and im willing to rely on that if it happens again and it might i still hope to maintain the same statistical average that we have in the past well be just fine we can put up with one buchel every three four or five hundred artists if thats the cost of being able to do the other projects i will accept that risk " mr grant is the author of "the business of being an artist" allworth
