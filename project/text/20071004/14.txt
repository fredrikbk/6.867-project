companies try to score with athletes who blog last month executives at shoemaker adidas ag got a shock when they read the latest blog entry from their star endorser pro basketball player gilbert arenas he had seen the design of his second adidas signature shoe which had yet to be revealed to the public and he wasnt impressed "im sitting there looking at the shoe like i hope you guys arent serious because im not going to wear this shoe nobody is going to wear this shoe " said the blog post from the washington wizards guard he said parts of it reminded him of a "ballerina " adidas executives learned that day what an increasing number of marketers have found that pitchmen armed with a blog can be tricky blog posts are typically candid and breezy not the kind of safe stock answers that athletes are often advised to give in postgame interviews says david carter executive director of the usc sports business institute in los angeles blogs "can either help elevate the status of the companies or it can wreak havoc on the brands they work with " he says mr arenas is one of several star athletes writing blogs or in his case phoning an national basketball association staffer who faithfully transcribes his thoughts for the nba web site every days or so other sports bloggers include red sox pitcher curt schilling and injured nba rookie greg oden several have seen their online comments turn into public relations debacles for example earlier this year mr schilling fueled an outcry when he used his blog to dress down orioles broadcaster gary thorne for suggesting that mr schillings bloody sock in the playoffs which became a symbol of his determination despite a foot injury was a fake mr thorne backed off the charge in addition j d durbin a philadelphia phillies pitcher apologized for making sexually explicit comments on his myspace page and texas rangers pitcher c j wilson apologized for posting a picture of a black man with a watermelon on a teammates page the foot in mouth epidemic caused the sports blog deadspin com this spring to plead "honestly athletes stop using the internets sic it can only cause you pain " mr arenas has made his share of blunders online he blogged about the scolding he got from nba officials for making a &# bet with a fan at a washington wizards portland trail blazers game in march soon after the league removed the post from mr arenass blog mr arenas and the league said that he has agreed not to post on topics like gambling on nba games mr arenas has also complimented certain sneaker styles by nike inc and starbury the line endorsed by the new york knicks stephon marbury despite his own endorsement deal with sneaker competitor adidas his criticism of adidas new signature shoe created an even bigger issue adidas which wasnt ready to talk about the design wasnt happy with mr arenass criticism according to adidas spokesman travis gonzolez but "we all took a step back we said its gil being gil and theres not a lot we can say we dont want to affect what he writes " says mr gonzolez in the end adidas says it benefited from mr arenass commentary the company reworked the design with mr arenas who blogged "i think people are going to like the colors but theyre also going to like the shoe " starting in november adidas is releasing different versions of the shoe which is dubbed the giliizero after one of mr arenass nicknames "agent zero " mr arenas started blogging last year one of a handful of nba players asked by the league to post their musings on its web site part of a four year old effort to get fans closer to players an all star player known in basketball circles for his quirky sense of humor the year old mr arenas says he initially saw the blog as a way to show fans a "lighter" side of his personality on march for instance he blogged about the birth of his son alijah amani arenas "were trying to get him sponsored by aaa now and get his diapers paid for " he blogged other postings dish about everything from him dropping his baby daughter he says shes ok to arguments with his girlfriend mr arenas has also blogged about his salary fans have responded "agent zero the blog file" has drawn about three million page views since it started in october according to the nba that makes it the most popular athlete blog on the nbas web site says the nba mr arenas is the only one of the group from last year still posting though hell be joined this season by new nba player bloggers the utah jazzs morris almond and the chicago bulls luol deng the blog has brought mr arenas a heightened profile that has helped him win new endorsement deals in recent months mr arenas has extended an existing contract with adidas signed a deal to be on the cover of "nba live " from electronic artsinc s ea sports and signed a four year deal with basketball maker spalding a unit of atlanta based russell corp mr arenas also endorses coca cola co s vitaminwater both spalding and ea said they decided to work with mr arenas in part because they believed his blog would appeal to younger consumers as mr arenas puts it companies think "kids latch onto this guy so we need him with us " he says "thats from blogging and the response from kids " while mr arenass early posts focused on basketball he has lately been dropping more references to his marketers a post about a spalding promotion where the winner of an essay contest would win a backboard rim and balls was great free advertising for the company says spalding vice president of marketing dan touhey "thats what this consumer that were all trying to tap into wants they want to hear from the horses mouth whats going on " mr touhey says spalding is featuring mr arenas in a tv print and online campaign starting nov mr arenas has also posted about how excited he was to be on the cover of nba live still adidass experience with the blog has been bumpy aside from the posting about the new shoe design mr arenas used the blog to alert fans to a forthcoming "golden ticket" promotion with adidas and ea sports that would give winners a free shoe but the promotion never happened neither did a collaboration with adidas and benihana inc that mr arenas featured in his blog adidass mr gonzolez says that while the golden ticket and benihana promotions were discussed no one later informed mr arenas that the ideas were scrapped adidas executives eventually asked mr arenas to clear information about coming shoe releases with them before he posts on his blog these incidents have given mr arenass marketing partners pause they say they realize they cant control what he says and that he might criticize them jordan edelstein marketing director at ea sports says the company debated mr arenass blogging style before the company chose him for the cover of the game "we knew if there was something he didnt like he would say so probably to everyone " mr edelstein says ultimately the company decided that mr arenass honesty was a plus "thats why his fans respond to him we felt it was worth the risk " still adidas ea and spalding each say that whether an athlete blogs and how they can work together with the blog will be a part of future endorsement negotiations for his part mr arenas believes that readers are interested in unfiltered information "for some reason everyone wants to be this golden boy like you cant make a mistake " he says "i dont think my blog would have been successful if i wasnt as real as i am and as willing to let people into my life " corrections &amp amplifications adidas ag and
