north korea pact marks big step deal to disable key parts of nuclear system raises concerns for both sides as north korea pledged to dismantle key components of its nuclear weapons system and the u s said it would move toward dropping pyongyang from its terrorism sponsors list both sides faced a tough question has each in its own view given up too much in exchange for too little with the agreement announced by china yesterday north korea appears to be moving swiftly to take apart the weapons program that brought international condemnation almost a year ago when it tested its first nuclear device but with it north koreas totalitarian leader kim jong il could be giving up his biggest strategic leverage u s critics meanwhile charge that washington has yet to secure from pyongyang a firm timeline and process for mr kims government to destroy the nuclear weapons that it has already developed questions also remain over north koreas alleged role in aiding third countries such as syria in pursuing nuclear programs even washingtons lead u s negotiator with north korea assistant secretary of state christopher hill admitted that there is a risk that hardliners inside the north korean military could refuse to hand over pyongyangs nuclear weapons stock "i think well be dealing with some people who dont want to take that very last step " mr hill said tuesday under the agreement announced yesterday north korea pledged to dismantle by year end its main nuclear reactor at yongbyon which can be used to produce weapons grade plutonium u s experts are set to go to north korea in two weeks to help start the process which would result in key equipment and components of the yongbyon plant being sealed or shipped to other countries north korea also agreed to publicly account for its entire nuclear weapons program including the number of devices it built and the scope of its research into other nuclear materials including highly enriched uranium in return the u s would take steps to drop north korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism removing a series of prohibitions that have prevented the country from receiving certain types of economic assistance or from purchasing weapons internationally the agreement said the u s will work with north korea on the timing of such a move which would require congressional approval white house officials hailed the pact as a key victory in efforts to stem weapons proliferation they said north korea is following libya as the second regime that has given up its weapons of mass destruction program through dialogue with washington yesterdays pledges "effectively end north koreas production of plutonium a major step toward the goal of achieving the verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula " said gordon johndroe spokesman for the national security council the agreement marks the second phase of a broad diplomatic pact reached in february among six parties the u s north korea china south korea russia and japan some national security officials in washington particularly vice president dick cheneys office continued to look warily upon yesterdays pact said u s officials engaged in the diplomacy besides questions over north koreas existing nuclear weapons stock the bush administration has yet to clarify with pyongyang suspicions that it might have shared nuclear technology with syria following an israeli air strike on a syrian military site last month neither israel nor syria has described the target precisely but some u s officials say intelligence points to a syrian weapons facility developed in cooperation with north korea both pyongyang and damascus have denied such allegations u s diplomats acknowledged that concerns remain but they said the current diplomatic track is the best way to stop any potential future proliferation of pyongyangs nuclear technologies key allies like japan meanwhile remain concerned about pyongyangs illicit activities such as drug smuggling and currency counterfeiting some u s critics feel that the u s has already given a lot of ground on north korea in march washington ended an investigation into a macau bank that held north korean funds believed to be linked to illicit activities then spent weeks arranging for &# million that had been held up in the probe to be returned to north korea it also helped arrange for heavy fuel and other assistance to be sent to pyongyang as north korea met diplomatic targets outlined in the february pact for north korea each step forward in negotiations pushes mr kim closer to the fateful decision of whether to preserve the nuclear program and the countrys decades long strategy of using threats to get favors and money from others in the u s agreed to provide heavy fuel and build two nuclear power plants in north korea in return for pyongyang shutting down the yongbyon plant the bush administration reversed that deal in after north korea revealed it had been cheating on the pact by exploring other ways to produce nuclear weapons fuel despite the countrys poverty there are few signs that mr kim is considering big changes to his approach critics point to the reception he gave south korean president roh moo hyun the second meeting between leaders of the two sides since they were divided years ago mr roh arrived in pyongyang with plans amounting to billions of dollars in joint economic development projects on tuesday but mr kim barely spoke to mr roh in a minute welcoming ceremony his talks yesterday with mr roh were shorter than those between the countries leaders at the first such summit and mr kim didnt attend a dinner hosted by the south korean delegation the bush administration is also looking to boost political and cultural exchanges with north korea "we think these types of cultural exchanges are important" to push the diplomatic process forward mr hill said
