hitting the books without having a clue educations end by anthony t kronman yale university press pages &# in the late s the oxford classicist hugh last organized the defeat of a measure to make anthropology a degree subject at the university "an acquaintance with the habits of savages " he said "is not an education " behind lasts quip was a claim that anthropology is in no way formative knowledge of the kind that students require exactly what students require what "an education" really entails is the subject of "educations end " an impassioned defense of the study of the humanities by anthony kronman a professor at yale and formerly dean of its law school "one cannot live a meaningful life " mr kronman writes "unless there is something one is prepared to give it up for peoples lives are therefore meaningful in proportion to their acknowledgment that there is something more important than the lives they are leading something worth caring about in an ultimate way the question of course is what that something is or ought to be " when john harvard bequeathed part of his fortune and books to "the new college" in cambridge mass in the intention of american higher education was to prepare men for the clergy and the kingdom of heaven little changed until after the civil war when certainties about god began to fade and colleges started to incorporate new subjects and new ideas and offer students choices with specialized departments organized around such new subjects as english philosophy and modern languages replacing the old fixed curriculum and its classical texts without a strong religious idea at the center of higher education mr kronman argues educators lacked a core mission they sought to teach as woodrow wilson put it "not so much learning as the spirit of learning " what followed was the century of "secular humanism " as mr kronman terms it admiringly from charles eliots appointment as president of harvard in to the campus revolts of secular humanism was the seeking of a middle way between dogmatic belief in god and militant atheism as a teaching doctrine it focused on the enduring nature of human institutions and cultural achievements and it tried to convey a variety of approaches to human fulfillment into this paradise a snake was invited the research ideal of the german universities it rewarded professors for scholarship more than teaching and emphasized specialization thus the graduate students who would become the professoriate of each successive generation were forced away from general knowledge and pushed to pursue their learning in ever narrower subject areas this research imperative worked to perfection in the hard sciences but in the humanities it led to endless reinterpretation and the acquisition of esoteric marginal knowledge if that the humanities mr kronman argues began to lose their strength and to abandon the traditions of broad intellectual inquiry all that the socratic dialogues had once meant to the university the radicalism of the s and the rise of identity politics completed this destructive process mr kronmans chapter on political correctness is a calm indictment of what multiculturalism and a misguided idea of "diversity" have done to our universities humanities departments "the more a classroom resembles a gathering of delegates speaking on behalf of the groups they represent " he writes "the less congenial a place it becomes in which to explore questions of a personally meaningful kind including above all the questions of what ultimately matters in life and why in such a classroom students encounter each other not as individuals but as spokespersons instead they accept or reject their teachers as role models more on account of the group to which they belong and less because of their individual qualities of character and intellect and the works they study are regarded more as statements of group membership than as creations of men and women with viewpoints uniquely their own " anyone who has perused the course catalog of a liberal arts college wesleyans english department for instance offers "chicina lesbian literature speaking in tongues" and "law race and literature an introduction to critical race theory" will recognize what mr kronman is talking about "educations end " though concludes on a hopeful note foreseeing a revival of traditional humanism and the guided study of "something worth caring about in an ultimate way " mr kronman observes that the rise of fundamentalism has put spirituality and its ultimate questions at the center of cultural debate that political correctness has lost some of its momentum on campus fingers crossed and that students are clamoring for organized study such optimism is not entirely convincing but then mr kronman is a kind of idealist as a professor perhaps ought to be he teaches today in the directed studies program at yale a freshman year long examination of the works that form the foundation of western civilization his decision is itself a hopeful sign mr messenger is a senior editor at the weekly standard see related letter "letters to the editor poor but educated" wsj oct
