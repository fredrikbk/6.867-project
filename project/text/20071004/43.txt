free trade treaties mean impoverishment in response to mary anastasia ogradys oct americas column "democrats vs central america" while i strongly disagree with the wall street journal editorial pages right wing ideology ill give you points for persistence year after year despite all of the evidence you continue to be a cheerleader for the unfettered free trade policies that while benefiting multinational corporations have caused so much economic pain for working families here in the u s and our trading partners abroad ms ogrady is telling the people of costa rica how wonderful passage of the central american free trade agreement will be for them the journal said the exact same thing to the people of mexico during the debate over the north american free trade agreement and what happened with the passage of nafta in mexico the agricultural sector has been decimated by cheap exports from american agribusiness poverty has increased the middle class has declined and people are literally dying in the desert trying to flee mexico for the u s working families in mexico suffer the rich have gotten richer and we now have the obscenity of the wealthiest person in the world mexican carlos slim helu coming from a country in which millions of families struggle to feed their children this may be the kind of economic development championed by you but not by me we can have trade policies that can do better that must do better its not only mexico and other developing countries that have been hurt by these unfettered pro corporate free trade agreements its also the working families in the u s who are now engaged in a horrendous "race to the bottom " despite an explosion of technology and a huge increase in worker productivity poverty in america is increasing the middle class is shrinking and the gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider in the past six years millions of good paying jobs in the u s have been lost as companies shut down here and move to china and other low wage countries during that same period median household income for working age families has declined by about &# million americans have lost their health insurance three million have lost their pensions and millions are working longer hours for lower wages meanwhile the gap between the rich and the poor in the u s is now the highest of any industrialized country and greater than at any time since the s on oct costa rica will become the first country where citizens have the opportunity to vote for or against a trade agreement despite being heavily outspent by the moneyed interests despite opposition from the costa rican government and the u s ambassador despite an extremely hostile media the latest polls have the election as a toss up incredibly just the other day in a nation of only four million people well over marched in opposition to the treaty a sign of the deep grassroots opposition there to cafta notwithstanding ms ogradys assertions my recent trip to costa rica was not about telling the people there how to vote thats their business not mine the trip that rep mike michaud and i made was to help counter the lies being spread in costa rica that suggested that if the people there exercising their democratic rights voted "no" on cafta the u s government would punish them by excluding them from the caribbean basin initiative as well as other punitive actions the journal and i may disagree on the merits of unfettered free trade but there should be no disagreement that when the people in a free democratic and independent country like costa rica vote their conscience they should not be punished by the worlds superpower that is not what democracy is about sen bernie sanders i vt washington see related letters "letters to the editor a senators obtuseness regarding economics" wsj oct
