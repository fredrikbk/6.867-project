dna decoding maps mainstream future dropping costs may make gene sequencing of patients more common this past summer biologist j craig venter published his own complete genetic blueprint on the internet a multiyear effort that cost more than &# million now dr venter is decoding himself again this time using new less costly technology he hopes by december to redo the gene job for just &# the price of reading a persons genome is plummeting raising hope for new medical discoveries and cures it cost the human genome project &# billion to extract the first complete genetic blueprint which was completed in now four companies are racing to bring the cost to below &# at that price it may become more common for patients to have their genes sequenced for medical tests cancer researchers hope to use sequencing to learn what went wrong in the dna of cells that became tumors drug companies hope to usher in an era of personalized medicine with custom made medicines that change cell behavior whichever company reaches the &# mark first has a shot at winning a &# million prize offered by the x prize foundation based in santa monica calif which is trying to encourage faster and cheaper gene sequencing "once people see the value of this information nobody will want to go backwards " says dr venter who has put up &# of the prize money the contenders illumina inc of san diego applera corp s applied biosystems unit in foster city calif roche holding ags life sciences in branford conn and helicos biosciences corp of cambridge mass havent achieved the &# level yet it currently costs between &# and &# million to sequence a genome but with better chemicals and faster computers the companies say the cost will fall to &# within a few years one reason for the advances is that sequencing machines no longer have to start from scratch human dna is made up of pieces or chromosomes and each chromosome has roughly million chemical letters arranged like beads on a string as ts cs and gs it isnt possible today to read million letters at a time so to sequence a persons dna researchers traditionally chopped up the chromosomes into overlapping pieces each about letters long in both the government funded human genome project and dr venters first effort scientists used a technique invented in the s called sanger sequencing to input each piece into a computer then the overlapping pieces were put back together with software to form an entire chromosome a painstaking process somewhat like putting together a jigsaw puzzle without a picture on the front of the box the new machines take advantage of those existing genetic blueprints in effect supplying the missing picture instead of dividing chromosomes up into letter strings the new sequencers make the jigsaw pieces much smaller sometimes or chemical letters long and read many pieces at once for example helicoss machine which isnt yet on the market will be able to scan in at least million such pieces simultaneously compared with just for the older machines the newer machines run faster than the old methods and require fewer chemicals which account for the bulk of gene sequencing costs the new machines match the tiny pieces to where they fit best on the existing genetic blueprints a process known as "resequencing " to date only one new machine has successfully resequenced a human genetic blueprint roches genome sequencer flx which costs about &# this summer the company assembled the genes of james watson the dna pioneer by putting together pieces of his dna about letters each on top of the blueprint published by the human genome project the company estimates it costs about &# million to &# million and takes about a month to sequence a human genome with its machine dr venter says he plans to resequence his own dna for &# using a new machine from applera called the solid system the aim is to test the accuracy of the new faster systems and compare them against the copy of dr venters dna published this summer using the old method after that his research institute plans to sequence between and human genomes in with the goal of finishing such sequences in the next years illumina says it has sold more than of its sequencers known as the genome analyzer the company also is one of the biggest sellers of dna arrays or "gene chips " a hot product that allows doctors and researchers to test if patients have certain genes sequencing which can test for every single gene at once threatens to make such chips obsolete if it can be made more affordable "what well see is sort of a gradual transition in the marketplace as sequencing becomes easier and cheaper " said adam lowe a spokesman for illumina another candidate in the race is helicoss heliscope which the company calls the first "dna microscope " unlike the other machines helicoss skips a step where pieces of dna are duplicated before being read into a computer helicos says that will make its machine cheaper and easier to operate the company estimates its equipment set for release later this year will cost &# million with it the price of sequencing a persons genome will drop to &# the company says
