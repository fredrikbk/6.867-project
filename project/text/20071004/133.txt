worries shift to overstating summer losses are banks charges result of honest tack or big bath strategy in the world of banking honesty can be a tough sell in recent days as some of the worlds largest banks have come clean about billions of dollars in losses related to this summers market mayhem their stock prices have bounced on the belief the worst may be over at the same time some investors are wondering whether banks are being so conservative with their accounting that they will quietly book profits down the road as the securities they still hold rebound in value fans of accounting scandals know this as filling the cookie jar later the cookie jar is emptied giving earnings a boost when needed most yesterday german banking giant deutsche bank ag joined the bloodletting announcing that it would take a billion euro &# billion charge in the third quarter cutting its pretax profit to about billion euros down more than from the same period last year the bank said million euros in write downs came from loans and loan commitments of the sort typically made to buyout firms an additional billion euros came from complex securities many of them backed by mortgage loans and bad trades in stocks and bonds "it was about transparency " said chief executive josef ackermann "we did it and several others ubs citibank did it as well it was important to re establish peoples trust in the products and in the markets " mr ackermann wouldnt say whether the write down was a complete accounting of the damage or whether additional moves would follow despite the size of the loss deutsche banks stock rose in european trading to euros repeating a pattern that followed large write downs by ubs ag and citigroup inc in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange deutsche banks american depositary shares were up &# or to &# "theres now more clarity and people seem to be taking the view that this is the bottom of the bad news for now " said matthew clark london based banking analyst at keefe bruyette &amp woods ltd when valuing securities that have all but stopped trading clarity is relative some investors say they fully expect banks and brokers to take the maximum possible losses while investors are in a mood to accept them a practice known as the "big bath" or "kitchen sink" approach later the logic goes they can mark the value of securities back up and recognize profits "if youre a smart ceo youre going to write off everything and then some maybe even to below market prices because youre going to be hidden in the woodshed with everybody else " says daniel genter chief executive and chief investment officer of rnc genter capital management a los angeles based investment firm that manages about &# billion in bonds and stocks mostly for high net worth individuals "theyll make it look a lot worse than it is but thats the smart move because youve got little to lose and you might get some of it back in a quarter or two " analysts also expect banks to err on the side of taking as big a hit as possible only an "unwise" banker would do anything "other than take as much pain as possible " chris wheeler european banks and specialty finance analyst with bear stearns told investors yesterday during a conference call that is a big change from the dark days of august when investors were worried that banks and brokers might try to avoid admitting losses there were fears for example that some institutions might try to reclassify certain securities on their trading books to a category known as "held to maturity " in which the assets would be valued at cost and would no longer have to reflect market prices those worries have abated as banks and brokers have taken their lumps some more candidly than others aside from deutsche ubs and citigroup credit suisse group announced this week that its income from continuing operations in the third quarter would be somewhere near billion swiss francs or about &# billion in a research note citigroup said the credit suisse statement in effect amounted to a "profit warning " since the guidance of billion swiss francs profit is less than the billion franc consensus of analysts who have revised their numbers since second quarter earnings were announced but given that citigroups own forecast for credit suisse is billion swiss francs and that ubs warned of making a loss in the quarter the credit suisse result is "rather reassuring " while there is no evidence to suggest the banks are doing anything wrong numerous academic studies show that discretionary valuations related to possible losses which are often based on estimates are an area of financial statements that has in the past been manipulated by executives to manage earnings deutsche bank said it "continues to apply accounting and valuation principles consistently with prior periods " a ubs spokesman said the banks markdowns "are appropriate and follow established accounting principles and industry standards " a citigroup spokesman said the bank "has taken impairments in the third quarter based on a rigorous process applying appropriate accounting principles " banks and brokers face significant pressure from regulators auditors and investors not to play games with their valuations david viniar chief financial officer at goldman sachs group inc said last month that the investment bank had been in constant contact over the summer with the securities and exchange commission to discuss the way it was pricing tough to value securities additionally an auditing industry group recently put out a paper after consulting with the sec warning companies and auditors that they couldnt ignore market prices investors will get a better idea of how well all this oversight has worked when banks and brokers release more detailed figures on their financial results in coming weeks cecilie rohwedder contributed to this article
