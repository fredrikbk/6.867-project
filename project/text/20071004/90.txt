real time a baseball fan goes abroad a met fan tries to keep up with his team despite distance technology and time changes online edition for years baseball has dictated the rhythms of my daily life to an extent most people would find unhealthy in the winter if i notice its in the afternoon or at night ill involuntarily look for a tv or radio before remembering sadly that theres no game the lights in our backyard click on at just in case im pottering around out there and lose track of time i got married in september instead of october because i didnt want my anniversary to conflict with a playoff game when my then fiancee pointed out that the new york mets were no threat to make the playoffs i responded that i certainly hoped our marriage would last long enough that they would be a while back i was tapped to be part of a dow jones team visiting newspaper operations in a number of european cities id barely been to europe so i was excited to see the likes of london and vienna but then my excitement was eclipsed by dread when are we going mid september for nine days during the pennant race oh no but then i steeled myself neither oceans nor foreign sports nor the vagaries of travel were going to keep me from my appointed pennant race rounds technology would come to my rescue by bringing the game to me for most of my life following a baseball team religiously and for me there is no other way demanded that you live within that teams cable tv range or at least its radio footprint at times those rules have shaped my life i went to college in connecticut instead of massachusetts because in the late s you couldnt get the mets radio broadcasts that far north i invented other reasons for parental consumption but that was it working in new orleans and fresno calif during college summers i yearned for those rare occasions when the mets would be on national tv and friends learned to count me out when they were in my post college years id cut short cross country drives when it was clear that another few miles would drown the mets radio carrier wfan entirely in static on the flip side id often keep driving despite exhaustion if i thought another hour or so would bring in a reliable signal in the early s after college i wound up in washington d c just on the outer edge of wfans radio range standing in my room id piece together games from whatever blips of dialogue would emerge from the static and became a master at divining events from the tone of bob murphy and gary cohens voices often while holding boombox antennas or quack science signal boosters in unlikely positions i was thrilled when a fellow member of america onlines mets discussion board tipped me off to an odd bit of physics the potomac river amplified radio signals sufficiently to bring in wfan i have no idea why this is true but it is after that discovery i spent many a saturday and sunday afternoon parked by the river trying to find a comfortable position in the front seat of my tiny honda crazy behavior and eventually the march of technology would make it seem even crazier than it did at the time the dictates of distance started to crumble in the late s when wfan started streaming the radio feed of mets games oddly the feed would continue during commercial breaks letting you eavesdrop on the announcers by then however id moved to new york city the mets were on basic cable easily heard on am radio and if i wished i could get on the subway and see them with my own eyes over the next decade the likes of gameday audio mlb tv and satellite radio would conspire to let you follow your team from most anywhere but i no longer needed them until this trip that is i decided to bring my laptop along and signed up for mlb tv giving it its first shakedown in a big barn of a london hotel slingbox would also have worked but that seemed a technological bridge too far to solve this particular problem the service worked though every minutes or so it would fall victim to some bandwidth malady and begin buffering or freeze up entirely this inevitably seemed to happen during a crucial pitch forcing me to restart and wait irritably for the game to come back on oh how i came to hate the at&amp t "preroll" ad i was also struck by the difference between digital and analog failures with a regular radio or tv you can still glean some information through static but theres no equivalent of digital static things are either working or theyre not happily mlb tv had no problem divining that i was indeed far from home and thus exempt from major league baseballs blackout rules on viewing local teams telecasts when i was apparently blacked out in vienna and made a panicky cellphone call to customer service the representative said shed call me at the hotel to verify i was indeed in the city of mozart and wiener schnitzel while we struggled to figure out how she could call vienna from the u s i realized the problem i was logged into my company vpn and so looked to mlb tv like i was somewhere in new jersey when all was well technologically watching on my laptop in my hotel room was certainly no worse than watching a small somewhat blurry tv for someone whod driven through the georgia night in august with the air conditioner off the windows up and the radio on full blast to maximize the chances of hearing every th word this was no hardship i was able to pore over the latest news and rumors and pull my weight on faith and fear in flushing the mets blog i co write about which more here and win or lose looking up from a baseball game to see the lights of france twinkling across the darkness of lake geneva was a memory worth keeping in finally making use of mlb tv on my laptop i was coming in at the end of a technological chapter several of my traveling companions were also big baseball fans and they all carried blackberrys something ive stubbornly resisted they couldnt watch the game live but they could get play by play updates and they delighted in pointing out that their blackberrys let them follow the fortunes of the mets and their pursuers the philadelphia phillies without shutting themselves away in a hotel room the night we left london the mets lost an aggravating affair to the washington nationals after which i found myself walking the endless corridors of heathrow while a greek chorus of blackberry wielding phillie fans kept me abreast of their teams comeback thank you gentlemen if theres a similar trip a couple of septembers from now i have no doubt theyll be watching live video in milan my technological luck deserted me you could only get online by buying a prepaid card which required you to scratch off an area on the back to find your user id then send an sms message including that id somewhere which would result in your password being texted back sheesh why not take it a step forward and divine the password from tea leaves or the entrails of a spring lamb in any event neither i nor the unhappy front desk clerk could get it to work some combination of digits had to be either added to or subtracted from the phone number of my temporary u k cellphone which nobody to seem to call me on though that was kind of nice my fellow travelers in milan were nice enough not to mind that i could barely greet them in the morning without anxiously demanding "what happened in the game " of course no technological marvel could fix a more fundamental problem night games started at a m or a m that let me see plenty of europe but exhaustion and work meant the mets had to play on without me some nights there is no good answer for an expatriate fan who thinks as i do that not watching live bleeds a game of its drama even if you dont know the outcome ahead of time i also missed the osmosis of life near my team in new york city you can learn all you need to know about the mets and yankees fortunes by paying attention on the subway the back pages shout out the latest news and there are always fans wearing team gear and loudly debating celebrating or decrying the latest doings walking around london around midday on a sunday i kept seeing knots of men standing outside pubs in fan regalia talking halfheartedly while staring into space they were concerned with soccer and rugby but the excited anxious wait for the game to hurry up and begin was instantly recognizable i was used to the mets being part of daily conversation and fashion but in europe the mets were nonexistent with the lone exception of a young woman wearing a david wright shirt in trafalgar square yankee hats were in evidence here and there though and i was appalled to flip through british channels and find derek jeter the yankees are baseballs death and taxes then there was another problem one that overshadowed whatever joy i might have derived from managing to stay more or less in touch the mets stumbled through my time in europe struggling to avoid a frightful collapse as a crazy fan i of course wondered if this was all my fault late last week i found myself in a provo utah hotel room on another business trip and dialed into mlb tv to watch my team try to escape its death spiral when mlb tv conked out i switched irritably to the radio feed thinking that maybe that had been the jinx all along nope the mets lost i shut down the media player in dismay and was left alone in the utah dark alas there are no technological fixes for bad baseball or shattered hopes how do you keep tabs on your team from far away how has technology changed your life as a sports fan join me and other
