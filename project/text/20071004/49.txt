grease monks racing has a haven in belmont abbey new motorsports program adds oomph to curriculum interning at the speedway belmont n c roman catholics regard benedict an italian monk who died around as the patron saint of europe kidney disease victims nettle rash sufferers spelunkers and servants who have broken their masters belongings nowhere in st benedicts rule will one find guidance on anything related to driving into a wall at miles per hour but a college founded by his disciples and still influenced by the monks on its campus has decided to create what it says is the worlds first motorsports business degree at first blush that may seem odd for a school dedicated to a year old philosophy of understated service in gods name living in the on campus monastery eating breakfast and dinner largely without speaking the monks have not changed much abbot placid solari the chancellor of belmont abbey college points out that they are still wearing the black robes of their order "this was all the rage in the eighth century theyre fine for us " but the school needed a new direction to stay viable financially "it was in tough times real tough times basically the monks were keeping it going and it badly needed a savior " says school trustee and racing elder statesman h a "humpy" wheeler president and general manager of nearby lowes motor speedway it was his idea to establish a motorsports management program since its founding as a monastery and school by benedictine monks in belmont abbey has been an anomaly representing an island of catholicism in a protestant state while earning some regional regard u s news and world report ranked it th among baccalaureate colleges in the south belmont abbey is hardly a household name outside north carolina earlier this decade enrollment was sagging and with it the funds needed to keep the school going then along came its current president william thierfelder a man with a wife children and minimal academic work experience before he arrived here three years ago he was president of the york barbell co in pennsylvania when he applied for the job the work he had done stabilizing that companys finances played a role in his hiring mr wheeler says the board recognized that the school needed a savvy business mind more than an academician dr thierfelder has a solid sports background having earned an education doctorate in sports psychology and having run an agency with national football league players as clients when dr thierfelder who is arrived in north carolina he decided belmont abbey should boost enrollment with a program no other school had he immediately warmed to mr wheelers suggestion that motorsports management become an area of concentration in belmont abbeys business degree curriculum mr wheeler saw the program as a godsend to belmont abbey which he attended when it was also a prep school in the s and where his father served as athletic director for years he inherited the nickname "humpy" from his father who was known for his love of camel cigarettes by the spring of this year the motorsports management programs first class had started with students hailing from california nebraska ohio and alabama several schools including many in north carolina nascars unofficial capital have programs that cater to motorsports engineering side others teach broader sports management courses but with nascar now a mature national sports organization mr wheeler saw the need to get a more regionally and culturally diverse group of people involved in teams and tracks operations dr thierfelder admits the idea sounds "faddish " and he expected some pushback within the school but after hearing details abbot solari endorsed the idea he recognized that given north carolinas industrial decline racing has been a boon to the state asked why the world needs such a specific area of study the programs instructor tracy rishel replies "sponsors are paying &# million to &# million a year at the top nascar level for top teams to put their name on the car its worth nearly &# billion to the north carolina economy " sponsors she says "expect professionalism and worldly talented people to deal with " still the idea raised eyebrows one monk father john oetgen an year old former belmont abbey president and english professor first arrived as a student here in and calls himself "a contemporary with chaucer " he confesses the word "rednecks" first popped into his head when he heard of the program though he quickly recognized that as an old stereotype he was glad to learn that the motorsports program was not about learning to change tires this semesters course racing management or ms aims to steer students through all the details of running a racing team or facility from budgets to ticket sales to supplies to parking to scheduling to legal matters theres nothing in the syllabus about oil stained pit crews and burned rubber father oetgen now argues for the program saying benedictine monasteries exist specifically to cater to the needs of surrounding communities "now this is a very minor need perhaps but the impulse was along those lines " he says in his soft georgia bass still while he doesnt expect it to happen he adds that he would hate to see his school thought of first as a center of motorsports development both he and abbot solari rejected the idea of posing for a photo dr thierfelder playfully proposed in which the schools men of god would be the pit crew around a black stock car with the words "got monks " across the hood "i hope hes joking if thats a dream of his it wont be realized " father oetgen says with a smile but both abbot solari and father oetgen also credit dr thierfelders leadership in righting the schools ship enrollment in the liberal arts school stands at an all time high of about business is the most popular major other area schools are following with similar racing related programs the university of north carolina at charlotte has a racing themed concentration within its mba while winston salem state university has launched its own undergraduate motorsports management degree early reviews from belmont abbeys first students in motorsports management are largely positive working as an intern at mr wheelers speedway from march through june year old tom vesey of deltona fla says he learned about the three ts of managing a racing venue tickets traffic and toilets the program does often require explaining though when discussing schoolwork with friends back home in ellicottville n y liza barrett says any jokes she hears are not as striking as the looks on peoples faces "theyre like youre interested in motorsports why would you do that " abbot solari gave the invocation at a nascar race and says being there opened his eyes to a world he had known little about still its not as if racing is a hot topic among the monks during lunch the one meal at which they chat with one another says father oetgen he says he has no plans to attend any races "we had an alumnus who thought he was doing me a great favor " he recalls "we were going to go down into the pits i said thank you but no "
