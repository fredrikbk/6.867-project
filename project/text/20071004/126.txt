weekend with bernie for todays recommended reading allow us to suggest the letter from vermont senator bernie sanders on the preceding page its as pure a distillation of the case for protectionism as youll find anywhere outside the pages of nation magazine and its a notable sign of the times on capitol hill were happy to give the senator his say against open markets but the purpose of his weekend trip to san jose costa rica two weeks ago is another matter he says it wasnt to lobby against sundays referendum that will decide whether that country joins the central american free trade agreement cafta but why else go to the tropics in the middle of the rainy season and what about his press conference with the local leader of the anti cafta movement during which he told costa ricans that they could kill cafta and it wouldnt affect u s market access for costa rican goods dont worry about opening your markets the senator said ours will remain open to you we doubt u s exporters appreciate that argument but in any case mr sanders doesnt have the authority to make that promise under u s trade law the president must certify that caribbean and central american countries that already have unilateral preferential access to the u s are making a good faith effort toward reciprocity that would be a hard case to make about a country that had rejected a free trade agreement costa rica might very well lose its access to the u s market if costa ricans kill cafta this weekend it will harm those who make and sell things to the u s americans seeking new markets for their goods and consumers in both countries it will mean more poverty in central america not less see related letter "letters to the editor free trade treaties mean impoverishment" wsj oct
