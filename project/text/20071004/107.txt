curb the continental currency as expected the european central bank left interest rates alone keeping its key policy rate unchanged at earlier the bank of england made its own non move leaving its benchmark interest rate steady at which most analysts had also predicted "indeed a cutting of interest rates at this stage could have been seen as a panic move and risked damaging the banks anti

claude trichet chatted about the broad economy and stressed the sound economic fundamentals of the eurozone despite recent turmoil in global credit markets he also told a vienna press gaggle that the bank still fretted about price instability and was "ready to counter" inflation risks including higher energy prices mr trichets comments suggested that the ecb finds itself in the age old central

fielded fungoes from the press about the relative value of major currencies he said central banks pay "great attention" to exchange rate movements as swings in currencies can have important effects on fundamentals such as cross border demand but mr mishkin added "it is not a good idea to focus on asset prices like the exchange rate over and above the effect it has on the things we should care about
