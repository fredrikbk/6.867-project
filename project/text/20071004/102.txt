style on style paris surprise wearable as well as wild designers balance drama practicality at spring shows looking past models swords paris famous for pushing the creative envelope when it comes to fashion design produced some surprisingly wearable clothes and accessories during runway shows this week never fear there were still plenty of the runway theatrics this city is known for jean paul gaultier sent pipe smoking models brandishing swords down the catwalk and designers viktor &amp rolf attached a foot long pink violin to the neckline of a quilted dress but as many famously artistic designers expand their businesses in the current luxury boom they are salting in sunglasses handbags and other merchandise thats likely to have broad appeal as well as high profit margins martin margiela is so anti commercial that his clothes bear no discernable labels just a white tag and perhaps a number yet he sent each model down his catwalk on monday in sunglasses that he will introduce in february in the darkest of the four shades that will be available the glasses called "incognito " mimic the black strip that mr margiela places across his models eyes in photographs suggesting that we should be looking at the clothes rather than the model the shades were a neat insiders reference to mr margielas reticence about publicity but theyre also likely to generate sales just as maison martin margiela expands its own stores all over the world the italian made sunglasses consist of a swath of uv protecting lightweight "injected polycarbonate " they are way cool looking and they are not nearly as avant garde as margielas jackets whose pointy shoulders are perfectly constructed and as identifiable as a logo but strange enough that many department stores choose to abandon margiela to gutsy independent shops while the sunglasses look is extreme statement sunglasses sell far better than statement clothes despite a cutting edge reputation lately margiela has been producing "very merchandisable" off runway collections with plenty of salable accessories says robert burke a former bergdorf executive who now frequently advises private equity investors shopping for fashion brands paris is where store directors and fashion magazine editors come to see a dramatic display of the clothes theyll soon splash on their pages or buy for their stores so of course designers are expected to display extreme creativity and skill its a daunting task to excite hundreds of weary journalists and retail executives who think they have seen it all something like completing a masters thesis every few months little wonder that some designers resent being asked by the sales guys to include more mundane high profit margin items in their collections when i questioned sidney toledano chief executive of dior about whether he asked designer john galliano to include more of the brands handbags for next spring mr toledanos eyes widened in horror he chastened me "oh no no no no no no no " nevertheless mr galliano planted a few lucrative items in a dramatic collection of clothes that seemed plucked from diors historical archives the elaborate delicate flapper dresses and prewar gowns swayed me but caused a young colleague to comment that the collection was something her grandmother would wear that may not be a good omen for dior but an elated mr toledano was eyeing something else on the runway "fifteen handbags " he crowed right after the show "hats glasses seven or eight watches " mr toledano boasted that the brands store on pariss avenue montaigne is experiencing record sales viktor &amp rolf the dutch designer duo produced a legendarily surreal show in february when they sent models bearing lighting systems down the runways this season after designing a collection for h&amp m they were notably more down to earth they sent out a series of white suits and silk dresses several of which could be worn to the office the wide legged pants were so voluminous and richly constructed that they would hide any flaw of the lower half of the body one gown half black half white would be eye catching without drawing shock or disapproval at an awards banquet for physicians or accountants the designers saved the wild pink violin number for the end even gaultier with his pirates of the caribbean themed show had wearable clothes in the mix mr gaultier is known for colorful complex hard to make designs but if you looked beyond the swords and long fringed scarves you could see finely tailored cropped jackets gracefully pleated at the small of the back those will sell despite the easy profits lure of accessories its possible to build a successful collection and brand without them consider akris which doesnt produce accessories at all designer albert kriemler whose family owns akris created a spring collection of dresses suits and wide legged pants that looked rich comfortable and just sexy enough to be attractive without being inappropriate for a chairwoman of the board little wonder condoleezza rice wears akris along with many investment bankers and hedge fund managers akris is the new armani selling clothes that are very very expensive and powerful yet feminine unlike chanel these days akris steadfastly avoids the lure of mass logo item sales it also has been stealing market share from armani at some u s department stores according to people familiar with the sales of those brands ann stordahl head of womens fashion at neiman marcus declined to make any such comparisons but said akris is a big seller "he does very well for us " she said firmly of mr kriemler representatives for giorgio armani couldnt be reached "i think women need modern clothes " said mr kriemler after his show he is swiss and an architecture buff this shows in his precise designs in which he is a stickler for not only the look but also the feel "you wear fabric on your skin " he said explaining why he chooses textiles like light wools that are as soft as cotton mr kriemler will not be bending to the lure of high margin items anytime soon "there are so many people doing accessories " he said "we know how to do clothes " email christina binkley wsj com
