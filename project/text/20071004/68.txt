modern heroes im weary of seeing news stories about wounded soldiers and assertions of "support" for the troops mixed with suggestions of the futility of our military efforts in iraq why arent there more accounts of what the troops actually do how about narrations of individual battles and skirmishes of their ever evolving interactions with iraqi troops and locals in baghdad and anbar province and of increasingly resourceful "patterning" of terrorist networks that goes on daily in tactical operations centers the sad and often unspoken truth of the matter is this americans have been conditioned less to understand iraqs complex military reality than to feel sorry for those who are part of it the media struggles in good faith to respect our troops but too often it merely pities them i am generalizing of course indeed there are regular stellar exceptions quite often in the most prominent liberal publications from our best military correspondents but exceptions dont quite cut it amidst the barrage of "news " which too often descends into therapy for those who are not fighting rather than matter of fact stories related by those who are as one battalion commander complained to me in words repeated by other soldiers and marines "has anyone noticed that we now have a volunteer army im a warrior its my job to fight " every journalist has a different network of military contacts mine come at me with the following theme we want to be admired for our technical proficiency for what we do not for what we suffer we are not victims we are privileged the cult of victimhood in american history first flourished in the aftermath of the s youth rebellion in which as university of chicago prof peter novick writes women blacks jews native americans and others fortified their identities with public references to past oppressions the process was tied to vietnam a war in which the photographs of civilian victims "displaced traditional images of heroism " it appears that our troops have been made into the latest victims heroes according to the ancients are those who do great deeds that have a lasting claim to our respect to suffer is not necessarily to be heroic obviously we have such heroes who are too often ignored witness the low key coverage accorded to winners of the medal of honor and of lesser decorations the first medal of honor in the global war on terror was awarded posthumously to army sgt st class paul ray smith of tampa fla who was killed under withering gunfire protecting his wounded comrades outside baghdad airport in april according to lexisnexis by june two months after his posthumous award his stirring story had drawn only media mentions compared to for the supposed quran abuse at guantanamo bay and for the court martialed abu ghraib guard lynndie england while the exposure of wrongdoing by american troops is of the highest importance it can become a tyranny of its own when taken to an extreme media frenzies are ignited when american troops are either the perpetrators of acts resulting in victimhood or are victims themselves meanwhile individual soldiers daily performing complicated and heroic deeds barely fit within the strictures of news stories as they are presently defined this is why the sporadic network and cable news features on heroic soldiers in iraq and afghanistan comes across as so hokey after all the last time such reports were considered "news" was during world war ii and the korean war in particular there is fox newss occasional series on war heroes whose apparent strangeness is a manifestation of the distance the media has traveled away from the nation state in the intervening decades foxs war coverage is less right wing than it is simply old fashioned antediluvian almost foxs commercial success may be less a factor of its ideological base than of something more primal a yearning among a large segment of the public for a real national media once again as opposed to an international one nationalism means patriotism and patriotism requires heroes not victims lets review some recent history from sept until the middle of when events in afghanistan and iraq appeared to be going well the media portrayed the troops in an uncomplicated positive light young reporters who embedded early on became acquainted with men and women in uniform by whom they were frankly impressed but their older editors children of the s often were skeptical once these wars started going badly skepticism turned to a feeling of having been duped a sentiment amplified by the abu ghraib prison scandal that led to a different news cycle this time with the troops as war criminals but that cycle could not be sustained by the facts beyond the specific scandal so by the end of yet another news cycle set in the one that is still with us the troops as victims of an incompetent and evil administration the irony is that the daily actions of the troops now living among iraqis applying the doctrines of counterinsurgency and engaged regularly in close quarters combat are likely more heroic than in the period immediately following objectively speaking the troops can be both victims and heroes that is if the current phase of the war does indeed turn out to be futile my point is only to note how the media has embraced the former theme and downplayed the latter the lexisnexis statistics reveal the extent to which the media is uncomfortable with traditional heroism of the kind celebrated from herodotus through world war ii if thats not the case then why dont we read more accounts about the battlefield actions of silver star winners bronze star winners and the like feeling comfortable with heroes requires a lack of cynicism toward the cause for which they fight in the s when exporting democracy and militarily responding to ethnic and religious carnage were looked up upon u s army engineering units in bosnia were lionized merely for laying bridges across rivers those soldiers did not need to risk their lives or win medals in order to be glorified by the media indeed the media afforded them more stature than it does todays medal of honor winners when a war becomes unpopular the troops are in a sense deserted in the eyes of professional warriors pity can be a form of debasement rather than hated like during vietnam now the troops are "loved " but the best units dont want love they want respect the dilemma is that the safer the administration keeps us at home the more disconnected the citizenry is from its own military posted abroad an army at war and a nation at the mall do not encounter each other except through the refractive medium of news and entertainment that medium is refractive because while the u s still has a national military it no longer has a national media to quite the same extent the media is increasingly representative of an international society whose loyalty to a particular territory is more and more diluted that international society has ideas to defend ideas of universal justice but little actual ground and without ground to defend it has little need of heroes thus future news cycles will also be dominated by victims the media is but one example of the slow crumbling of the nation state at the upper layers of the social crust a process that because it is so gradual is also deniable by those in the midst of it it will take another event on the order of or greater to change the direction we are headed contrary to popular belief the events of which are perceived as an isolated incident did not fundamentally change our nation they merely interrupted an ongoing trend toward the decay of nationalism and the devaluation of heroism mr kaplan a correspondent for the atlantic and a visiting professor at the u s naval academy is the
