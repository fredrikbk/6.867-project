international tort crisis most commentators who talk about the "special relationship" the united states has with the united kingdom focus on military diplomatic and intelligence cooperation between our countries but in many ways the foundation of that relationship is economic and unfortunately that foundation is now in jeopardy because of securities litigation in the u s and in particular one case stoneridge v scientific atlanta that will be heard by the u s supreme court on oct it is difficult to overstate how extensively our economies are intertwined in u s assets in the u k and u k assets in the u s each exceeded &# trillion in each country roughly one million jobs were attributable to investment from the other more than american companies have offices in britain more than british companies have offices in the u s most striking is the integration of our financial communities anyone surveying operations in london and in new york will find the same names and a shared culture these economic sinews bind the rest of our affairs a relationship that existed solely at a political level would not survive political squalls that arise from time to time economic ties align our interests they facilitate a commonality of perspectives that is essential to other forms of cooperation anyone who considers as do i the anglo american alliance essential to both countries must take seriously policies and practices that would put these ties at risk the securities litigation system in the u s is creating such risk a risk that soon could metastasize from british companies facing the well known albeit unwelcome hazards that flow from being listed in the u s to potentially any british or european company doing business with any u s listed company in the u s in the u k or indeed anywhere else in the world stoneridge could exponentially increase the u s litigation exposure of non u s companies in it the petitioners want the court to allow private securities lawsuits against companies that have done business with firms listed on american exchanges the only requirement would be that their u s listed partners be accused of misreporting transactions in which they participated whether as buyers sellers or advisers there is not a single country in europe or elsewhere in the world that allows such sweeping and uncontrollable litigation exposure a report produced earlier this year at mckinsey &amp co for new york city mayor michael bloomberg and sen charles schumer d n y found that "the legal environments in other nations including great britain far more effectively discourage frivolous litigation " currently in the u s a company must actually make statements that are fraudulent to be the target of a private securities fraud lawsuit this is a clear line that discourages the kind of speculative even predatory litigation that has become a feature of american law should the plaintiffs in stoneridge prevail any non u s business whether it be a law firm accounting firm banker buyer or seller that has u s listed companies as customers suppliers or clients will risk being sucked into americas securities litigation vortex as former u s attorney general dick thornburgh wrote recently what the supreme court "must decide is whether class action lawyers should be allowed to game the legal system to extort exorbitant settlements " every business dealing with u s listed companies would have to examine the possibility of fraudulent bookkeeping in every transaction an utterly impractical proposition in essence u k companies would either end up paying protection money to do business in the u s and with u s listed companies or decide the cost was not worth it it is a frightening prospect contrary to global standards of justice both trial and appeal have been all but written out of this branch of american law because of the magnitude of financial market valuations these suits routinely involve potential damages of hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars faced with even a remote risk of an erratic verdict companies are under pressure to settle quickly and because restrictions on bank credit and other capital access follow large judgments the appeal process is merely a theoretical remedy virtually every case that survives a motion to dismiss is settled the rights and wrongs of americas system of class action which gives new meaning to the term extractive industry are properly matters for the u s courts and legislators but the systems extension into the bloodstream of global finance and commerce is a matter of legitimate international concern as alan greenspan has noted our recent prosperity is a result of the broadening of global markets and the deepening of economic specialization reversing a process that is growing our economies will likely have far reaching and devastating consequences who can believe that vastly expanding the reach of u s class actions into the u k would leave the economic and financial ties between our countries undisturbed every company around the world will have to reconsider its contracts and business relationships with u s listed firms in the u k this will inevitably lead to the curtailing of close economic and investment ties with america that would be bad for america and for britain indeed for the entire world mr lamont was britains chancellor of the exchequer
