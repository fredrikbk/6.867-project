the daily fix an early exit for zambrano puts piniella on the defensive online edition did lou piniellas worries about game of the national league division series cost the chicago cubs game the cubs manager pulled ace carlos zambrano after six innings and pitches with the cubs and the arizona diamondbacks tied cub reliever carlos marmol promptly surrendered a home run to mark reynolds and arizona walked away with a win as brandon webb was ably backed up by brandon lyon and jose valverde "lou piniella picked a very bad time to develop a gambling problem " rick morrissey writes in the chicago tribune "the specific problem was he gambled wrong wednesday night very wrong he pulled the ace of his staff carlos zambrano after just pitches hoping he could bring back a rested zambrano if theres a game rule no you win the game thats in front of you rule no there is no rule no piniella played his hunches and his hunches cackled at him " in the chicago sun times jay mariotti offers perspective which is to say he distills years of cubbie gloom and doom into a head shaking column "welcome to cubdom lou piniella " he writes "welcome to a fickle place where honeymoons are fleeting one postseason loss is considered a death sentence and a failed gamble in october causes mass amnesia about the regular season " between the cubs bad century and the white sox and red sox casting off the shackles of world series futility in recent years the diamondbacks know that their opponents are the story with few outside of arizona are rooting for a d back advance and it might be worse than that mesa is the cubs spring training home and there were plenty of cub loyalists on hand at chase field last night but so far the d backs have confounded the script and are built to keep doing so in the arizona republic dan bickley writes that "this officially marks a wonderful new beginning not only of a winnable playoff series in but of what should be an extended run from a team built for the present and the future and from the celebratory first pitch jerry colangelo to randy johnson it was quite a coming out party " two days after beating the san diego padres to claim the national leagues wild card the colorado rockies and ace jeff francis topped the philadelphia phillies and their ace young fireballer cole hamels key to the game the phils chase utley and ryan howard went for with seven strikeouts on yahoo sports dan wetzel praises a strong performance by mr francis "everything about francis was calming his pace his confidence his ability to throw fastballs in the mid s and curveballs in the low s his teammates wouldnt say they had any concerns but francis had gotten wrecked by the phillies this season posting an ugly era less than a month ago he gave up runs in innings that game featured howard reaching base twice and utley three times including a two run homer his teammates had to be holding their breath " if theres pressure to rebound the phillies are used to it "of course it cant be easy for the phillies " writes bob ford in the philadelphia inquirer "what sense would that make this is the same team that had a losing record on july the same team that trailed the mets by seven games on sept the same team that won a division title by going through the looking glass of baseball logic needing to outscore what the pitching staff allowed on most nights compared to all that winning three out of four from the colorado rockies is merely the latest unlikely assignment the phils have given themselves " mr ford reminds readers that losing game isnt fatal but follows that up with a warning "after just one game of a playoff series even if it is the hurry up world of baseballs division series there are no absolutes or musts or gottas there is only the need to do a better job to scratch and claw to do what got them here at the same hour today however if the first loss is followed by a second the mood and the language of the locker room will change lose two games at home in a best of five series and brave talk is just a mealy substitute for dead air " sticking with the inquirer daniel rubin interviews a man whose greatest desire is that his work not be noticed mike boekholder the head groundskeeper at citizens bank park baseball traditionalists mr boekholder is your man as evidenced by his opinion of fancy mow patterns "i hate them when i interviewed at the phillies i told them if you are looking for someone who will put in a lot of fancy mow patterns you might want to look somewhere else " finishing the baseball slate josh beckett had no problems with the anaheim angels throwing a four hit shutout as the boston red sox claimed game "how good was josh beckett last night " asks bob ryan in the boston globe "depending on your depth of red sox postseason knowledge it was either the best postseason pitching performance since luis tiant in jim lonborg in boo ferriss in or perhaps even babe ruth in either take your pick six hit shutout in game or the inning conquest of the dodgers but why stop there you can throw in smoky joe wood in and big bill dinneen in its right up there somewhere " in the boston herald tony massarotti calls the win "controlled convincing and systematic" and looks back at the teams summer swoon now all but forgotten "along the way much of new england obsessed over the state of the red sox " he writes "the team seemed to sleepwalk through much of the summer in the end maybe we were lulled into thinking that there was something terribly wrong with this team when there really was not when all the sox were waiting for was their return trip to that time of year when the games truly matter " on the angels blog halos heaven blogger retire takes pessimistic angels fans to task "step away from the ledge pull the knife away from your throat take a few deep breaths and relax stop yelling at your wife stop kicking your dog and stop cussing at your kids its one stupid game that the angels werent supposed to win anyway sure id have loved to see the halos steal that game but i also know that there could be up to four more games in this series i didnt root for this team for nearly forty years or a the very least for this entire season just to throw in the towel and give up all hope after game of the alds the angels went to boston needing to win one of two ballgames nothing has changed that plan and
