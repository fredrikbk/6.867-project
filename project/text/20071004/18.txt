calling riceville how guys iowa connection took big telecoms for a ride calls sent to their area piled up access fees until fcc interceded riceville iowa two and a half years ago ron laudner was the anxious owner of a rural phone company serving this tiny town where main street was emptying out as restaurants and other businesses disconnected their phones and moved to busier commercial districts more than miles away david erickson was running a web based conference calling business in long beach calif shopping around for phone companies to be his partners in mid summer this unlikely duo struck a deal they routed millions of minutes of mr ericksons conference calls through the switches of mr laudners farmers telephone of riceville to do it they used outdated federal regulations to charge telecom companies such as at&amp t inc and verizon communications inc steep rates and collected huge profits at their expense together the two made hundreds of thousands of dollars soon mr laudner cut other deals to generate even more traffic at the peak his little telephone company was facilitating conversations among everybody from mary kay cosmetics employees to customers of male box an "all male all gay" chat line "im not going to argue i didnt think it was amazing " mr laudner says but the big phone companies had another term for it "verizon is not going to stand by while irresponsible companies use this traffic pumping scheme to overcharge our company " says tom tauke vice president of public affairs policy and communications for verizon the deal between messrs laudner and erickson illustrates how tumult in the telecom industry has given rise to opportunities and headaches as entrepreneurs exploit outdated regulation their arrangement and deals like it spawned lawsuits blocked phone calls and triggered an investigation by the u s federal communications commission into the high fees some rural carriers charged to the bells late tuesday the fcc proposed rules that if approved are likely to prevent such deals in the future "we got smacked and smacked hard " mr laudner says the partnerships benefited from the confluence of hot demand for conference calling and a proliferation of cheap long distance plans but the key was federal rules drafted during the break up of ma bell that required big telecom companies to pay hefty fees to small carriers to compensate for the high cost of providing service across miles of sparse farmland today because of new technology hundreds of callers can be linked at very little cost no matter their location the iowa plan worked like this mr ericksons freeconferencecall com assigned a local iowa telephone number to a group offering a conference call when customers dialed the number they went through their own carriers say at&amp t to be routed to farmers telephone in iowa farmers telephone then linked the callers to each other farmers charged the bells steep rates to transmit their customers calls and split the proceeds with freeconferencecall com mr erickson is a year old high school graduate from long beach calif who gave up a childhood dream of becoming an architect to instead run construction companies that built machines for designing curbs and gutters he dabbled in running insurance companies briefly before getting interested in telecom by going to a trade show with a friend and being wowed by a device that allows videoconferencing between pcs mr erickson formed freeconferencecall com in october working with a boston phone company he handled the marketing to attract customers to the service while the phone company provided the phone numbers and transmitted the calls mr ericksons business plan was to give away free conference calling and sell businesses other things like a service that would allow users in multiple locations to work on spreadsheets simultaneously other startups were doing the same thing many of them depending on customers looking for sex chats these customers have flocked to the free conference call startups rather than pay costly fees associated with the number sex industry which has shrunk dramatically with the advent of inexpensive internet calling options and internet based pornography mr erickson says he doesnt market to sex chat groups but concedes he cant control who uses his free calling service mr erickson realized early on there was money to be made from sharing the revenue that his phone company partners were able to collect from the major carriers back in he started researching the fees and not long after recognized that rural phone companies which could charge the bells significantly higher fees than those in urban areas presented an opportunity mr laudner a robust year old who has spiky gray hair a goatee and an earring was born in an apartment over a phone office his father managed in nearby rudd iowa one of his first jobs was driving through the cornfield lined countryside in the for a local phone company replacing customers rotary dial phones with more modern touch tone phones in he took over farmers telephone and two other rural phone companies all created in the early s when isolated farmers strung wires along fences to get phone service in recent years mr laudner has been eager to find ways to compensate for his shrinking core business landline phones he created a slogan "lets talk " and participated in a dozen parades through neighboring towns decorating his companys float to resemble an ipod to reflect new consumer technologies he dreamed of rallying his iowa phone company friends to help build a wireless business in rural iraq but decided the country became too violent to safely set up shop in the spring of mr laudner bought gear to help him market new internet based phone services such as internet calling video services conference calling and other services to businesses outside ricevilles shrinking main street a consultant darin rohead who helped sell him the equipment put mr erickson and mr laudner in touch over a phone call they soon struck a deal with mr erickson mailing him gear to install that would enable the calls "ill make you as successful as you want to be " mr laudner remembers mr erickson telling him mr laudner offered the firm phone numbers with the local area code to use to market free conference calls and other services callers who dialed the number would pay the long distance charge which is now close to free in many plans they would then be linked to one another through telecom gear in mr laudners phone switching center mr laudner agreed to give freeconferencecall com a "marketing fee" based on phone traffic which amounted to splitting the per minute access fees roughly for each call in the summer of mr laudner filed standard paperwork with regulators to justify his cents a minute rate by presenting evidence of his past history of handling very little phone traffic at the time it was unclear how dramatically the traffic would jump the fcc as well as at&amp t reviewed his filing and didnt protest "we were taking the rules the way the rules were intended " says mr laudner "i didnt know how much traffic i was going to get " several weeks later after a few technical hiccups mr laudner got the system up and running at full speed calls to his exchanges were slowly escalating as word spread online about the services the big phone companies didnt initially notice the impact of mr laudners and mr ericksons deal mr erickson traveled to a barbecue in iowa to meet mr laudner face to face and to try to pick up more recruits the two men ate ribs and played a round of golf during this period mr laudner struck partnerships with three other conference calling firms suddenly farmers telephone of riceville was processing millions of minutes of phone calls a month earning mr laudner and the free calling service companies hundreds of thousands of dollars in new revenue in november mr laudners company handled million minutes of calls more than double the number he had processed in an entire year before he partnered with the internet companies at&amp t traffic alone on farmers network spiked to million minutes in december from minutes in january of the previous year the same thing was happening at nearly a dozen other small iowa phone companies that were partnering with freeconferencecall com and other companies processing calls for everything from an amish conference calling service to "free phone chat " a place where callers could "meet new friends and lovers " about the same time in denver at the corporate headquarters of qwest communications international inc the companys analysts began to notice a spike in the bills owed to iowa companies qwests lisa hensley eckert who reviews traffic between phone carriers received call records from the iowa phone companies so she could examine the jump in volume she started plugging popular iowa phone numbers into a search engine tracking several to web sites such as hotlivesexchat com allfreecalls net freecallstheworld com "they all used the same three iowa area codes " says ms hensley eckert "to see millions of dollars going out the door it was much larger than anything wed seen before " at&amp t verizon sprint and other phone companies were also taking note in late qwest and at&amp t disputed their unusually high monthly bills and stopped paying mr laudner on jan at&amp t sued farmers and three other iowa companies in u s district court there qwest and sprint nextel corp soon followed with similar lawsuits and filings to the fcc in one filing at&amp t complained that the iowa companies "make a mockery" of the system designed to compensate carriers for providing phone service in rural areas the charges to iowa companies including farmers telephone affected qwests fourth quarter earnings and cost the company roughly &# million to &# million out of total profits for that quarter of &# million according to phone company records riceville handled nearly million minutes in january alone of calls to male box as well as five million from the chicago blade and chicago alibi which offer adult chat and a "live personals" service where callers record and select personal ads mr laudner says sex calls made up a sliver of his business most of the traffic farmers telephone handled came from sports chat clubs businesses and charities including a domestic violence prevention group he says still word got around about the sex related traffic it didnt go over well in riceville population which touts its "safe environment for children" on its web site a resident stopped one of mr laudners workers early this year to ask whether his company was involved in the sex call business in march mr laudner received a call from freeconferencecall com saying customers calls werent going through freeconferencecall com initially blamed mr laudner for the problems and he checked his equipment which he found to be working properly quickly mr erickson learned the problem was more widespread than farmers telephone qwest had suddenly stopped routing some iowa traffic through its network and at&amp t started blocking calls to numbers it tied to "unscrupulous carriers " the company says the tactics in some cases affected regular phone traffic to iowa the iowa carriers say angry freeconferencecall com customers who couldnt dial into their conference calls complained to mr erickson and some of them never returned to the site he said "it was like stepping on somebodys oxygen hose " says mr erickson who thinks the blocking was "criminal " mr laudner and other iowa carriers were outraged in april he and mr erickson and other iowa phone executives traveled to washington d c to complain about the blocking to officials at the fcc which has in the past levied fines for similar acts the fcc didnt fine the phone companies but staffers phoned at&amp t qwest sprint nextel corp verizon and embarq corp formerly the local phone division of sprint nextel to warn them that blocking was unacceptable according to fcc and phone company officials in june the agency formally barred the big phone companies from blocking the calls for now despite the fccs proposed rules which say some of the carriers are "engaging in an unreasonable practice " the calls continue to flow to iowa but at&amp t verizon and sprint arent paying the fees to mr laudner for the disputed calls mr laudner says he is owed at least &# million by various carriers mr laudner couldnt pay the free calling service companies their share farmers telephone and freeconferencecall com ended their relationship in late june when the companies two year contract expired "ron had been a good guy " mr erickson said "he wasnt going to go further with it and i wasnt going to try " he says hes since found other companies in nearby states to handle the calls noting "i dont need iowa to do this "
