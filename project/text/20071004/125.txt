voice mail gets a lot more fun with free services the days of "leave a message after the beep" could soon be a thing of the past new web services are giving cellphone voice mail a fresh sound with features that let users personalize outgoing messages for individual callers and eschew unwanted calls ive been testing two such free services youmail and grandcentral that let you customize phone mail features through wireless internet communication theyre like your voice mail service on steroids overall i found the services fun and easy to use there is no limit to how many personalized voice mails you can record so everyone on your contact list can hear a greeting just for them its labor intensive to set up but online forms are easy to navigate the services make money by selling ads on their sites in addition to tailored greetings youmail lets you save your voice mail messages email your saved messages via audio files share messages using a url link retrieve deleted messages and see who called you and when and whether they listened to your message you can do all this online or from your phone if it has internet service you check your voice mail by phone or over the internet as with your carriers voice mail service you can simply dial an access number and listen to messages i logged into my account at youmail com and clicked on "my voicemail " the sound quality was superb as it was when i listened to the audio files that were sent to my yahoo inbox i gave my email address when i signed up i also checked messages from other phones by dialing the access number the service doesnt interfere with voice mails already saved on your regular carriers system youmail gives you the option of keeping your voice mails indefinitely messages are stored in your online account and offer you an email audio file as backup one fun feature in youmail is ditchmail which blocks messages from certain callers they dont even get a chance to leave a message you ditch a caller by double clicking on their names in your online phonebook and checking the ditchmail option or by pressing on your phone after hearing a message from a person you dont want to hear from again when dumpees call your number theyll hear either a standard message "this number has been disconnected" or one you record users can record special greetings or upload ones online if their computers have microphones otherwise they just press on their phone keypad to record signing up on youmail com is simple you just register your mobile number and email address and receive a confirmation code via text message on your cellphone switching from your main carriers voice mail to youmail takes a few minutes and switching back is just as simple instructions are available on the site youmail has its drawbacks the access number you use to retrieve messages is long distance so it can get costly with some plans and depending on your text messaging plan youll likely be charged for the alerts you get whenever someone leaves a message but you can turn off the text message option grandcentral is even easier to use when it comes to recording multiple greetings and dumping unwanted callers one caveat grandcentral is in a beta or testing phase you must be invited by a member to sign up the service gives users another phone number based on their zip code to which they can link their cellphone office and home numbers you can hand out grandcentrals one unified number and check just one mailbox i like grandcentrals web interface better than you mails the features are very simple to use you start by adding contact numbers online and recording greetings for individuals when people call your unified number all the phones you linked ring so you can pick up any of them when you answer you hear a recorded message telling who is calling and giving you options of how to handle that call meanwhile the caller hears only the phone ringing the service recognizes each caller in your address book new callers have to say their names the first time they call and from then on the service recognizes them too i like the feature that lets you screen calls when someone calls your grandcentral number your phone displays caller id information when you pick up a recorded message states the callers name and offers fours ways to handle the call to answer to send the caller to voice mail to listen in while a message is being recorded or to accept and record the call if you press and then decide you want to answer a call you can press the star key to pick up blocking a caller is similar to that youmail feature the callers cant leave a message and they hear a prerecorded message that your number is no longer in service but unlike with youmail your phone wont ring and you cant leave the blocked caller a customized message both services spice up your voice mail and considering theyre free theyre worth a try email me at sarmad ali wsj com walt mossberg is on vacation
