why its the worst of times in tale of one deal alcatel lucents goals prove elusive as margins shrink can ceo russo hang on the rationale was simple for the &# billion marriage between alcatel sa and lucent corp create a global giant in telecommunications equipment that could slash costs and keep profit margins comfortable ten months later the opposite has happened the savings alcatel lucent wrung from the merger have largely gone toward lowering prices to keep customers amid intense competition in the rapidly consolidating telecom industry and the company worried about alienating customers has been unable to rapidly realize all the savings it had hoped for from shedding duplicative products "we dont know when the margins of the combined company will be better than the ones before the merger " said paul sagawa a sanford c bernstein &amp co analyst now the question is whether alcatel lucent chief executive officer patricia russo will be around long enough to see if the mergers promise can be realized last month the company issued its third consecutive warning on quarterly profit and revenues alcatel lucents share price is down since the beginning of the year since the merger was announced about &# billion in market capitalization has evaporated an amount roughly akin to lucents value before the deal some analysts have called for ms russo to resign and for the company to consider selling off assets to stanch the bleeding after speculation in the french media that ms russos departure was imminent the board released a statement tuesday saying it "supports pat russo and the leadership team " however the board has asked ms russo to detail her turnaround plans at a meeting on oct the day before the firm releases its third quarter financial results two thirds of the directors must vote to oust ms russo as ceo or serge tchuruk as chairman ms russo would have to lose the support of at least two of lucents six appointees on top of all of alcatels six appointees and the two independents to lose her job ms russo years old was head of murray hill n j based lucent at the time of the merger she wouldnt discuss her job status in an interview yesterday but conceded that marrying the french and u s companies has been challenging "we set out with a three year plan to merge these two companies and were nine months into it " she said "its not been an easy journey but i think were going to get there in time " minneapolis based thrivent asset management which held million alcatel lucent shares valued at about &# million at the end of june sold all of them after the latest warning john krause a senior equity research analyst there said he thought ms russos departure would be a "catalyst" for the stock but wouldnt solve the companys problems "its going to be a tough task whoevers managing the company " he said the merger was a response to a spate of deals among the telecom operators such as verizon communications inc s acquisition of mci inc and sbc communications inc s purchase of at&amp t corp those deals had handed equipment buyers more leverage in their dealings with suppliers in addition new asian telecom equipment makers including chinas huawei technologies ltd were driving down prices by consolidating alcatel and lucent were supposed to gain scale that would allow the new company to claw back pricing power in addition it could also cut costs to achieve higher margins than either company could have managed individually investors sent alcatel shares up the day the plan was announced many investors seemed mostly concerned about potential cultural clashes between french and american executives others in the industry followed suit in june nokia corp and siemens ag agreed to combine their telecom equipment units into a joint venture the deals closing was delayed because of a bribery scandal that is still roiling siemens and the new firm has reported only one quarter of results at alcatel lucent little has gone as planned by slimming down the two companies product portfolios alcatel lucent was supposed to reap massive cost savings both alcatel and lucent made equipment for "third generation" high speed cellphone networks for example so the merged company could choose the stronger product and discontinue the other allowing it to reduce research and development costs and lay off workers but such product phaseouts have cost the company dearly orange in france and at&amp t in the u s had each installed versions of third generation cellphone equipment that were being discontinued "you have to spend to support both new and old product lines and also give incentives to customers not to leave " said ms russo "its basically as if we have the worst of all worlds in year one " they expect to have to support both lines until and ms russo also made a decision "not to let customers to get taken away from us during this early period " she said but that bold position in hindsight may have undercut the goal of regaining pricing power with clients particularly in wireless in order to hold on to clients and win new ones alcatel lucent has sometimes agreed to bargain basement prices in may it signed a &# million contract to expand china mobile ltd s wireless network in five cities in india it signed a &# million deal with reliance telecom to expand its wireless network ms russo says it makes sense for alcatel lucent to get a foothold in these rapidly emerging markets even if it isnt on the ideal terms at the outset because of their huge opportunity for growth but she also concedes "that had an impact on our gross margins " in a july conference call announcing a loss for the second quarter ms russo told analysts that profit margins were down nearly compared with a year earlier and revenues were slumping even though laying off thousands of workers and trimming the companys product portfolio were projected to help save million euros about &# million in the first year alcatel lucents biggest rival swedens telefon ab l m ericsson took advantage of the upheaval to go on the attack already the top player ericsson made an aggressive bid dubbed internally as "project stealth" to increase its global market share in wireless to more than "we knew their management would be distracted and preoccupied " said bert nordberg ericssons executive vice president of sales and marketing in an interview "we decided to use the merger to improve our position in the new competitive landscape " alcatels sales of wireless telephone equipment have been hit hard revenues were down in the first quarter and in the second quarter compared with a year earlier tony despirito portfolio manager at pzena investment management llc the third largest holder of alcatel shares thinks the market is being far too hard on alcatel lucent overlooking the value implied by its tax credits and overfunded pension plan since april when the deal was announced pzena has bought million shares of paris based alcatels american depositary receipts which allow investors to trade in the company on u s exchanges "the market price is sufficiently pessimistic that it is discounting a merged company that is less successful than the two companies were independently and thats not right " said mr despirito "while there may be bumps in the road longer term the merged company has bigger scale and should be more efficient and a better competitor " ms russo steadfastly believes in the strategic rationale for the merger and that if given enough time she will be able to deliver she points out that the firm has maintained its leading position in areas like broadband and internet tv and cites a &# billion three year contract signed with verizon as an important early win she said "i spent enough time with customers that i know what its going to take to be successful over time "
