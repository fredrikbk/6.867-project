the case for knowing your funds directors boards draw greater scrutiny as studies link performance with overseers independence investors typically dont pay much attention to the directors who oversee mutual funds but as fund boards come under increased scrutiny they probably should thats because while fund managers do the high profile work of choosing investments a funds board of directors is responsible for such matters as hiring and firing investment advisers negotiating fees that the fund pays the management company and deciding when its time for an ailing fund to call it quits every mutual fund is governed by a board but the same board can oversee dozens or even hundreds of funds within a fund family a board dominated by directors who have close ties to the fund company may have a tough time negotiating for lower fees that would crimp the fund companys profits or ditching a money manager for poor fund performance according to investment research firm morningstar inc and recent academic research suggests that funds with a greater number of independent directors tend to have lower fees and are more likely to take actions that are beneficial for investors the securities and exchange commission is considering how to proceed with a controversial rule that would effectively require that a fund board chairman and at least of the directors be independent of the fund management company the rule previously issued by the sec was twice rejected by a federal court meanwhile morningstar recently revised its system for grading mutual funds governance placing more emphasis on such factors as directors ties to the management company some big investors also are casting a critical eye on fund directors among these the florida state board of administration a pension fund last year declined to cast votes for fund board chairmen at t rowe price group inc and fidelity investments because they were also executives at the fund companies "its very important that you have a board that is independent " says david smith executive vice president and general counsel of the mutual fund directors forum an organization of directors "effective boards really do provide significant benefits for shareholders in terms of managing conflicts and overseeing fees " a recent study by researchers at binghamton university and cornell university found that funds that received good morningstar governance grades outperformed those with bad grades by to percentage points a year between late and the end of last year another study indicated that more independent boards have less patience with poorly performing funds and are more likely to merge them with other funds however critics of efforts to increase regulation of board independence say such studies dont conclusively prove a link between independence and fund performance "there is not a universally optimal governance structure independent chairmen are better for some funds and interested chairmen are better for other funds " sec commissioner paul atkins said in a speech earlier this year in determining a directors independence the sec looks at factors including whether the director has worked for the fund management firm in the previous two years but even the investment company institute the mutual fund trade group believes the sec definition doesnt go far enough the ici recommends that any former officer or director of a management company shouldnt be considered "independent" for that companys funds still the ici opposes the sec rule partly because it requires a fund board chairman to be independent limiting directors options amid the debate board independence is spreading about of board chairmen were independent in an april survey by consulting firm management practice inc up from a year earlier and more than of fund boards meet the independent standard up from in according to the ici but even so called independent directors can have past ties to the fund management company at alliancebernstein holding lps mutual funds for example david dievler former senior vice president of alliance capital management a predecessor of alliancebernstein and john dobkin a former alliance capital director are legally considered independent directors each oversees over of the firms portfolios an alliancebernstein spokesman declined to comment fund directors oversee several operations that have come under recent regulatory scrutiny they approve b fees which are supposed to cover the costs of distributing a fund but which the sec has said should be reconsidered directors also decide how a fund should value hard to price securities such as subprime related debt a matter the sec raised concerns about during recent credit market turmoil investors can find information about directors in a funds statement of additional information including any connections to the fund company roughly how much they have invested in the fund and the number of funds they oversee the sec also has begun requiring boards to explain in shareholder reports their reasons for hiring a particular manager and approving the managers advisory fee at morningstar com the investment firms governance ratings or "stewardship grades " are available for users who pay &# per month or &# per year providing information like directors past ties to fund companies investors should also look at whether directors invest in the funds they oversee in recent years many boards have adopted guidelines encouraging directors to do this "that puts them clearly on the same side of the table as the shareholders " says john a hill independent chairman of putnam investments mutual funds another consideration how well does a board explain its decisions in the most recent semiannual report for the federated kaufmann fund for example the board notes that the midcap growth funds fees are higher than the median for its peer group but simply states that the board "was satisfied that the overall expense structure of the fund remained competitive " a federated investors inc spokeswoman says the fund is a top performer and investors "see the additional value in the performance " mutual aid mutual fund directors can be key allies for investors especially if the board is independent analysts say a strong board can negotiate lower fees for shareholders as a funds assets grow directors can decide to merge a chronically underperforming fund into another fund for information on directors check out a funds statement of additional information
