immigration phonies when not fielding questions from democratic moles at last weeks gop presidential debate anderson cooper and cnn had a grand time portraying republican voters as bible thumping gun wielding confederacy hold outs on immigration however the candidates didnt need any media help as they continued their descent into self parody mitt romney persisted in attacking rudy giuliani for turning new york into a "sanctuary city " an accusation that even the restrictionist editors at national review have come around to dismissing as "spurious " mr giuliani shot back that mr romney ran a "sanctuary mansion" as governor of massachusetts because the landscaping company that maintained the grounds of his home employed illegals mr romney replied that he couldnt be expected to verify the immigration status of everyone with a "funny accent " normally youd have to seek out a high school cafeteria to hear such repartee well done gentlemen the gop exception continues to be john mccain who is calling for reform that balances stepped up border enforcement with a guest worker program for future labor flows and mike huckabee whos been rising in the polls at least tried to explain to mr romney why its inhumane to punish the children of illegal immigrants "for what their parents did " unfortunately fred thompson continues to channel tom tancredo the nuisance candidate who blames every problem in america on the illegal immigrants who constitute roughly of the u s labor force mr thompson promised to "punish employers" for failing to detect illegal alien workers who have already slipped by the feds he also wants to "cut off federal funding" to cities that refuse to turn local cops into appendages of the border patrol as if those cops dont have far worse offenders to pursue this is reactionary populism masquerading as conservatism and its even more disappointing to hear it coming from messrs romney giuliani and thompson because all three have political histories that reveal more sensible immigration views as a senator from tennessee mr thompson voted for making more visas available for foreign agricultural workers he also favored expanding the h b visa program for high skilled immigrants to meet labor market demand regarding the illegal aliens already here mr thompson in the past has leaned toward a comprehensive approach "youre going to have to in some way work out a deal where they can have some aspirations of citizenship but not make it so easy that its unfair to the people waiting in line and abiding by the law " he told sean hannity in a fox news interview last year "its just not realistic that were going to round up million people and ship them all out of the country " mr romney has also sung a different tune on immigration as on many subjects in a interview with the boston globe he spoke approvingly of proposals like mr mccains to put undocumented workers on a path to citizenship if they can pass a criminal background check and meet other requirements mr romney said this approach was "reasonable" and "very different than amnesty " why because "its saying you can work your way into becoming a legal resident of the country " mr romney maintained that it is not "practical or economic for the country" to deport million illegals going so far as to say these workers "contribute in many cases to our economy and our society " but the biggest transformation in the field has come from hizzoner who only last year was telling audiences that we should give illegals "a way to earn citizenship" and "recognize the economic forces" that lure them here in the first place as mayor of new york mr giuliani regularly touted the benefits of these newcomers papers or no papers "forward looking and enlightened americans joined together to stop the know nothings of the mid nineteenth century " he said in a speech "this allowed for an incredible expansion in the twentieth century now we must do the same and stand up to todays isolationist movement to ensure that americas next century is as prosperous as the last " candidates are entitled to change their minds though at the cost of making voters wonder what they really believe the scale of this gop flip flop suggests they all know better and are posturing merely to appease the loudest restrictionist voices to win the nomination our view is that theyre underestimating their would be supporters and harming their prospects next year if they do get the party nod if trashing immigration was such a political winner tom tancredo wouldnt be polling nationally at see related letter "letters to the editor the real question to ask" wsj dec
