stanford mystery whos the old guy in the white nikes this is the stuff of novels by hemingway maybe a big man on campus palo alto calif late one spring afternoon last year a mystery man sat in the back of a creative writing seminar at stanford evidently a student he was much older than anyone else in the room he was wearing a black blazer and white nikes he said his name was phil as the days passed the mans identity gradually came into focus the instructor "made several vague allusions to phil taking off in his private jet " recalls andre lyon an english major enrolled in the class and tales about michael jordan found their way into the mans literary discourse after a couple of weeks a rumor began to circulate that the old dude in the nikes was philip h knight the billionaire founder of the worlds largest sportswear company the rumor was true for four decades mr knight who is now years old built the beaverton ore company into the industry titan while maintaining a personal reputation for seclusion and secrecy as chief executive he received visitors in a small conference room only rarely allowing executives into his inner sanctum since leaving the top job in to be company chairman mr knight has lowered his profile further stepping into the public spotlight only when one of his ceo successors was ousted in early but it was around that time that mr knight was surfacing anew in the classroom though not registered as a student mr knight has periodically taken classes with stanford undergraduates over the past three years swapping homework assignments and even going out with fellow students for a few beers at palo alto bars he has told fellow students that he is writing a novel mr knight turned down several interview requests for this story but a former classmate ben stillman described his presence in class as hemingwayesque mr knight "doesnt tell long yarns and long stories " says mr stillman "he doesnt reveal too much about himself but you understand something more is going on underneath " mr knights access to classes may have something to do with his pocketbook last year mr knight announced a &# million donation to the stanford graduate school of business from which he graduated in his previous stanford donations include a professorship at the business school a graduate school building and gifts to the athletic department according to a university spokeswoman mr knight got his bachelors degree from the university of oregon in and he makes big donations to oregon too mr knights late career academic journey began a few years ago after he visited the campus office of tobias wolff a novelist and stanford english professor mr knight "said he wanted to do some writing " and was looking for advice about where to begin mr wolff says "i suggested he start somewhere at his level of ability " mr wolff says he welcomed mr knight to an entry level creative writing class but in a low profile manner "lets say there was an effort to make sure students didnt know his identity " mr wolff recalls as mr knight became a regular in various english classes he rarely tipped his hand during the spring of for example mr knight could be found on campus most wednesday evenings for "english form and theory of the novel" a "seminar for creative writers" that was known in the department as "the novel salon " the class was taught by a department lecturer named adam johnson who declined to comment for this story a photo taken during what appears to be the classs opening session shows a packed basement classroom with students while others smile with notebooks at the ready mr knight looks away mr knight was however a full participant in the class his homework assignments circulated to classmates show a candid passion for words "write sensuously words have feeling " he advised in a short essay dated april "the simplest use of words can often have the greatest power " students in the weekly sessions remember debating mr knight about themes and characters in novels like "kiss of the spider woman" by manuel puig and edward schwarzschilds "responsible men " though notably older than his fellow students mr knight soon became a popular fixture on the stanford campus known for hosting after class gatherings at palo alto bars with his wife penny before taking a private jet back to his home outside portland ore "hed always pay " recalls mr stillman the festivities some attended by senior professors in the english department included little trips to the stanford park hotel and blue chalk a lounge whose web site invites guests to "kick back and enjoy a cold beer or one of the signature margaritas " mr knight even found his way onto online social networking site facebook he appears in a photo posted there his arms around two undergraduates with a third student holding what appears to be a drained margarita in class mr knights fellow students say he was studious and intense "i was struck by how confidently he spoke " says former classmate amelia ashton who said as a student mr knight maintained the "conviction of a ceo " "he liked books with strong male protagonists " recalls jasmine hanifi who was a junior one of mr knights homework assignments suggested he had a penchant for ernest hemingways novel "the sun also rises " about american expatriates known for its thrilling bullfighting scenes set in spain "writing drafts and discussing them with scott fitzgerald did not hurt this book " wrote mr knight "love stories are what the public wants more than any other type of story but they are the most difficult to write even for hemingway " but mr knight took exception to the books unadorned dialogue prose that he says might have used a bit more narration from mr hemingways pen mr knight also seems to disdain brett ashley the books femme fatale who is "central to everything " but "had nothing endearing about her except her beauty " it was during a discussion of "so long see you tomorrow " the midwest murder mystery by william maxwell that mr stillman says he learned that mr knight was no beginner to the art of fiction writing mr knights wife "started talking about phils own constant struggle to get a novel of his own finished it had maybe been years " mr stillman says at another time when mr stillman asked mr knight about the book he says the chairman said it existed but wouldnt give any details he was "very secret about it " recalls mr stillman mr knight hasnt been seen on campus during the current term which started in september says mr wolff though he didnt rule out the possibility that mr knight would return later in the year a short walk from the english classrooms ground will be broken next year for mr knights latest development on campus the knight management center it will include new classrooms dining facilities and a seat auditorium at the final session of the stanford writing seminar mr knight gave each student a &# nike gift certificate say those who were there the novelist mr schwarzschild who visited one of mr knights classes says he is still struck by mr knights unassuming approach to learning the craft "he could easily import someone fly them up in a helicopter but he wanted to be part of a true workshop as an equal he didnt want to be ceo he wanted to be phil knight the student "
