the meaning of fiscal conservatism with economic uncertainty weighing on the minds of many americans congress is preparing to recess after another year of profligate spending protectionist talk and promises of higher taxes no wonder some people feel like were moving in the wrong direction but im optimistic as i look to the future its not our country thats moving in the wrong direction its congress and washingtons culture of wasteful spending over the last decade nondefense spending has increased by the federal government currently spends &# per household while the number of earmarked pork projects rocketed from close to to a height of nearly this year with only one appropriations bill enacted earmarks already number a return to fiscal conservative principles can put america back on the right track while giving washington a much needed dose of discipline fiscal conservatism is based on two fundamental principles cutting taxes and controlling spending in recent years the republican party has successfully cut taxes but we have fallen short when it comes to controlling spending the next president will need to strengthen both sides of the fiscal conservative equation while reforming the culture of wasteful government spending with transparency and accountability i believe i can do it because ive done it and in a place that might even be more difficult than washington we need to keep taxes low for our economy to grow its not just a theory for me i cut taxes times as mayor of new york city with a democratic city council and state assembly and saw that lower taxes can result in higher revenue amid fears of an economic slowdown now is the time to cut taxes not raise them but the democratic presidential candidates all seem determined to impose an unprecedented &# trillion tax hike on the american people republicans have a clearer understanding of how our economy works this summer i unveiled my tax plan which committed to making the and tax cuts permanent while aiming for still lower marginal rates well give the death tax the death penalty index the alternative minimum tax for inflation as a step toward eliminating it entirely expand tax free savings accounts and expand health care choice through tax reform we also need to reduce the corporate tax rate which is currently the second highest in the industrialized world behind japan to at least the average of the other organization for economic cooperation and development nations or these actions will protect american jobs empowering us to compete and win in the global economy controlling spending must be a chief executives priority or it doesnt get done thats a lesson i learned from ronald reagan and put into action when i was mayor real per capita spending actually fell during my administration we cut the city bureaucracy by excluding cops on the street and teachers in the classroom we can do the same thing in washington over the course of the next two terms of the federal civilian workforce is due to retire well only hire back half taking the opportunity to right size government by taking advantage of technology like the private sector did in recent years and ultimately save taxpayers &# billion annually we also need to return to spending controls and caps a proven way to make washington set priorities as president i will direct all federal agency heads to find to efficiency savings if they come back to me and say its impossible to find savings in a &# billion agency ill call on the office of management and budget to identify the cuts its time to put the "m" back in omb reforming a culture of wasteful spending requires standing up to special interests and insisting on transparency and accountability congress spent &# billion on earmarks last year alone earmarks are the broken windows of the federal budget signs of dysfunction and distress recent examples range from the absurd &# million in for researching baby food made from salmon to the self congratulatory &# million for the charles b rangel center for public service the american people want us to end earmarks once and for all but more needs to be done we need to root out wasteful spending and fraud in benefit payments and contracts by convening a government waste commission such as the one that closed military bases it can require congress to vote up or down on a whole package of recommended cuts beginning by considering the of programs currently rated "ineffective" by the federal government itself finally we can both save money and provide better services by consolidating duplicative programs we dont need economic development programs or programs serving at risk youth or federal programs dedicated to ensuring safe water according to a report no doubt many of these programs are worthy but citizens shouldnt have to navigate a maze of overlapping bureaucracies digital one stop shop centers will provide better citizen service at lower cost while transforming industrial age bureaucracies to fit the information age citizen returning to principles of fiscal conservatism is not an end to itself we believe these ideas ultimately help government work better for all americans cutting taxes and controlling spending creates a government that is smaller and smarter more efficient and more effective it can help balance the budget and reduce the deficit most of all a healthy combination of pro growth policies and fiscal discipline unleashes the genius of americas free market economy empowering not government but the citizens it exists to serve mr giuliani is the former mayor of new york and a republican presidential candidate
