the oprah factor its tempting to write off the celebrity endorsement bout between the obama and clinton campaigns with oprah winfrey in barack obamas corner and barbra streisand in hillary clintons as just another episode of the democratic partys long running series of superstar superficiality but theres actually a meaningful and telling metaphor wrapped up in this fleeting game of dueling divas one that helps explain why sen obamas much hyped yet largely unfulfilling candidacy is finally breaking through and why the clinton juggernaut appears at least for the moment to be breaking down indeed after spending much of this year struggling to escape the experience box that the clinton campaign had so adroitly stuffed him into sen obama could not have asked for a better more striking contrast of surrogate symbols to draw out his major differences with the front runner and to drive home his increasingly trenchant argument that mrs clinton is the candidate of the status quo lets start with the "o factor " oprah is the swiss army knife of political validators a spectacularly accomplished black woman who is admired by americans across every demographic and would thus be a boon to any candidate but her particular potency for sen obama in this contest is not her race or gender or even the sum of her many parts but what she is perceived to be lacking a political agenda more than anything oprah is a uniquely transcendent figure in our public life engaged in serious debates and willing to put her money where her mouth is yet unsullied by the ugly political and culture wars of the past two decades and independent in her thinking and affiliations in this she personifies the new post bush post partisan post boomer politics sen obama is preaching she is the way we want things to be at least those of us outside the narrow margins of the ideological extremes genuine unifying trustworthy aspirational so how did the clinton campaign respond to the news that oprah would be stumping for sen obama this coming weekend instead of sticking to their core message and showing the confidence of a true front runner they fell into the tit for tat trap of countering with the endorsement of the polarizing s studded streisand in essence the anti oprah in doing so the clinton camp did not just fail to blunt or dilute the o factor they managed to accentuate it by unwittingly suggesting mrs clinton stands for like the streisand anthem the way we were to many democrats that brings back broadly positive feelings of peace and prosperity but for hard core activists that could also mean the misty waffle colored memories of triangulation corporate friendliness and job killing trade pacts among other liberal gripes about bill clinton and for less partisan primary voters it could be the scattered pictures of equivocation whitewater lewinsky and a continuation of the petty divisive politics that have come to define the bush clinton years for voters across the political spectrum this points to one of the least discussed wildcards in this most unusual of races and arguably the most dangerous for mrs clinton in the primaries how will democratic primary voters weigh the relative benefits and baggage of a clinton restoration will they see hillary as the best way to fix the awful mess president bush has created or will they conclude that she is more part of the problem than the solution incapable of delivering the fresh start democrats are desperately seeking for the country not least of all how many democrats will pull back from mrs clinton simply because they are afraid that her problematic past could doom the party in the general election for the first months of the year the clinton team did a brilliant job of taking this variable out of play and avoiding reminders of those memories that as the streisand song suggests would be too painful to remember they resisted the temptation to shove the clinton administrations record of results in voters faces and instead subtly used it and him to credential hillary and buttress her argument that she has the strength and experience to make change happen just as importantly bill stayed on message on the stump fully leveraging his undeniable popularity and charm and made it easy for voters to latch onto what they liked best about the s then something changed over the last month team hillary moved from dominating the conversation and diminishing her rivals to a defensive crouch the strong and clear statements gave way to fuzzy and evasive starting with mrs clintons famously fudgy answer to a debate question on drivers licenses for illegal immigrants she went from making a substantive presidential sounding case for her experience advantage to taking what many viewed as a petty potshot at sen obamas childhood years overseas and her husband slipped from world leader to weasel wording this past week when he claimed he opposed the iraq war from the beginning dredging up the worst impressions of the way they were to its credit the obama campaign moved quickly and deftly in the last few weeks to exploit this opening and recast the race not just as choice between the past and the future but zeroing in on the issue of trust and character and how that relates to change like the o factor this argument played to sen obamas strengths and reinforced his core message and not surprisingly its gotten the kind of traction his attacks on iraq and other issues could not most democratic voters in iowa say theyre more interested in a "new direction and new ideas " indeed the most recent des moines register poll out yesterday shows sen obama as the new front runner in iowa among likely caucusgoers while mrs clinton still leads on more personal attributes than any of her competitors according to the latest abc news washington post poll just half of iowa democrats believe shes willing to say what she really thinks sen obama beats her by as the most honest and trustworthy candidate moreover her advantage on experience while substantial has softened since the summer she has notably less support in iowa than nationally in trust to handle a variety of specific issues on iraq for example sen obama now runs evenly with her the key to getting the clinton machine back on track is ironically enough to go back to the way things were not for bill in the s but for hillary earlier this year she was in charge of the campaign when she was in charge of the campaign taking forceful stands on issues and even more importantly against the bush administration big footing the other candidates with big ideas and policy proposals on health care for example that forced them to react to her and talking straight about votes that may be unpopular with elements of the base something she failed to do on the lieberman kyl resolution urging the state department to designate irans islamic revolutionary guard corps as a terrorist organization thats how she thrived as a restoration candidate in a change election going forward one of the best moves mrs clinton could make to refocus the conversation on her strengths is to give a major speech about her time as first lady and why that makes her more prepared to be leader of the free world than her rivals sen obama has given her a perfect opening to do so by not just questioning but belittling her experience in her husbands administration nows the time to get past the health care bugaboo of and spell out in detail what else she did which few americans actually know how she learned from it and why the gamut of her experiences in the white house will make her a more effective change agent than any of her competitors which is to say forget about oprah and barbra and the celebrity sideshows if hillary is as her campaign once argued the most famous woman you dont really know her surest hope of holding her lead is taking the lead in showing voters just who she is mr gerstein a senior adviser on sen joe
