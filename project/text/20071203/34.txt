investing in funds a monthly analysis fundamentals of investing revolution on hold an effort by a high profile group of academics and professionals to overhaul fund indexing strategy is stalled the self proclaimed revolutionaries of the investing world have lost some of their momentum the band of academics and investment professionals who aim no less than to upend the way millions of individuals invest their savings sparked controversy and grabbed headlines last year by contending in conference halls on financial television shows and in the op ed pages of this newspaper that they had come up with a better way to run the core index funds at the heart of many investors portfolios they maintain that mutual funds and exchange traded funds tracking the standard &amp poors stock index are flawed their argument the s&amp p can become top heavy with pricey shares by virtue of using companies market value as a basis for weighting stocks they say this creates portfolios with too many overvalued stocks and not enough undervalued ones meaning the millions of investors who have embraced index investing as a way to capture the markets return without the fees associated with active management may not be getting as much bang for their buck as they could the revolutionaries say they have a better way build an index heavier in cheaper stocks by using computers to weight companies on the basis of fundamentals such as book value and earnings this strategy results in better returns they say while there is academic research underpinning the argument that over long periods similar "value" oriented approaches deliver higher returns than funds that track the s&amp p the crusaders at wisdomtree investments inc of new york and research affiliates llc of pasadena calif have run into a headwind after a seven year stretch of outperformance the value stocks heavily represented in their etfs often dividend paying companies without much flash are no longer the stars of the u s stock market this spring growth stocks stocks of rapidly expanding companies with high p e ratios began delivering better results in what many professionals described as a long overdue reversal of fortunes exactly why the reversal occurred is debated and how much longer it will continue is anybodys guess investing shifts happen periodically in the markets driven by changes in the overall economy technology stocks a favorite of the growth crowd have been some of this years strongest performers boosted by demand for technology products outside the u s although they lost some ground in novembers market tumult the upshot the ishares russell growth index fund a proxy for the universe of u s stocks with the fastest earnings expansion prospects has returned this year through nov while value counterpart ishares russell value index fund has lost "its been tough " says wisdomtree adviser and wharton school professor jeremy siegel who has compared skeptics of the new indexing approach to those who refused to believe the sun was at the center of the universe "this is the best year for growth stocks since the tech stock bubble" of the late s he says wisdomtree notes that many of its international funds continue to outperform overseas benchmarks research affiliates chairman robert arnott says he hopes investors will stick it out to see how the new indexes perform in both bear and bull markets and he thinks a continued worsening of the u s economy could reverse the tides again "growth rarely outperforms in a weak market " he says research affiliates has designed a series of fundamental indexes that use cash flow sales book value and dividends to weight stocks some &# billion is invested in mutual funds and etfs based on these so called rafi products the flagship etf powershares ftse rafi us portfolio run by invesco plcs powershares capital management unit has returned this year through nov while the s&amp p has a total return of launched in december the etf beat the s&amp p by about three percentage points in its first full year on the market wisdomtree meanwhile has &# billion in its etfs the firms largecap dividend fund etf launched in june has returned about this year through nov the two etfs tend to have big helpings of utility shares and relatively small software holdings wisdomtrees dividend bent results in a bias toward financial services stocks which represent about a quarter of the etf with subprime mortgage default worries and a credit crunch roiling mortgage lenders and wall street securities firms that has been a disadvantage financial stocks represent about a fifth of the powershares etf the same as the s&amp p the weak returns have given critics who depict the value oriented approach to investing as a passing fad new ammunition they say any return advantages for value stocks are temporary ones that an efficient market will arbitrage away in as highflying tech stocks were about to collapse value stocks were set to begin their long stretch of dominance john bogle founder of vanguard group inc which helped popularize s&amp p index funds with small investors beginning more than years ago says the launch of the various value weighted index funds deep into that winning streak was symptomatic of a fund industry that encourages investors to chase after hot returns "the time to launch a value fund is when value is at the bottom the perfect time was " says mr bogle who rejects the idea that the wisdomtree and research affiliates approaches represent a new paradigm for index fund investing wisdomtree dismisses mr bogles criticism saying its indexing strategies had been under development for years mr arnott says his firms fundamental indexes are more complicated than critics make them sound and that the etf introductions werent about chasing a hot market some academic luminaries including dartmouth professor ken french and university of chicagos eugene fama have produced work supporting the notion that value stocks especially those of smaller companies prevail over very long periods several theories aim to explain why one is that value stocks carry a risk premium to reflect that they arent as immediately desirable as those of faster expanding companies another suggests value stocks are frequently "mispriced " perhaps because the market has overreacted to bad news in any case the higher returns can take decades to show up according to data compiled by messrs french and fama value stocks led growth stocks in of the years between and though growth stocks finished first in four out of the five years between and and four out of the six years between and the two professors have been putting their theories to work for more than two decades quietly helped by strong investment performance dimensional fund advisors inc where they are board members boasts more than &# billion under management in strategies that use computers to screen for value stocks though it largely has shunned the spotlight santa monica calif based dfa has grown to become one of the countrys biggest mutual fund firms its origins were humble its first fund launched in registered strong returns for a few years then small stocks went through the worst seven year period since dfa vice president weston wellington says investors may have afforded dfa extra time to prove its case because its founders had stressed that outperformance of the small value stocks would occur over the long term not year in year out dfas focus on low cost long term investing continues today it even requires professionals who sell its funds to attend a "boot camp" that schools them in the benefits of staying the course keeping investors from getting spooked could be trickier with etfs which owe a great deal of their popularity to the fact that they can be bought and sold throughout the day on stock exchanges the etf firms "run the risk of people getting itchy " mr wellington says one bright spot for wisdomtree has been overseas where a number of its funds have outperformed broad benchmark indexes even though growth stocks abroad generally also have fared better than value counterparts wisdomtrees defa etf
