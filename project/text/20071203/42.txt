investing in funds a monthly analysis squaring off arguing over advice a new law lets sellers of k funds provide guidance to investors and thats raising all sorts of concerns across the u s workers have been grappling with an assignment handed to them by their bosses with little if any instruction investment management as more companies eliminate or scale back traditional pension plans many have been unwilling to teach employees how to take on the task of running their own retirement accounts scared of liability for potentially bad advice and studies show that individuals generally do a poor job managing their k s but help is on the way the pension protection act of gives employers a green light to provide extensive guidance to workers the changes which some companies are putting in place now are expected to increase the range of investment advice available to k participants the advice must be offered through a "fiduciary" arrangement in which fees and commissions wouldnt vary depending on the investment choice thus removing an incentive for the adviser to peddle funds that pay bigger commissions it also could be provided through a computer model that has been certified and audited by an independent third party a fiduciary relationship means that the adviser must consider the investors interests first and foremost so can workers breathe a big sigh of relief not so fast it turns out that many financial advisers and other investment professionals say the new approach may give rise to conflicts of interest including instances where a mutual fund or insurance company might provide advice to participants in plans where its own products are investment options the department of labor has offered "interpretive" guidance on the changes and is working on regulations for how the provisions will be put into practice which it plans to propose in the next several months we asked two experts to debate the pros and cons of the pension protection act although nicholas a nicolette president of the financial planning association which represents independent broker dealers and registered investment advisers has concerns about the legislation he does see a lot of positive attributes so he took the "pro" position david kudla chief investment strategist at mainstay capital a grand blanc mich financial advisory firm took the other side here are edited excerpts from their conversation benefits and risks the wall street journal no one disputes that k investors generally arent saving enough and could use more advice how well does the ppa fill this void mr nicolette there is an advice "gap" that needs to be closed and as quickly as possible the pension protection act could help close that gap over time in a number of important ways and its critical that the new fiduciary adviser provision truly works to the benefit of the k investor and not the advisory firm mr kudla access to investment advice for the employees k has only grown in importance the ppa encourages investment advice for participants by creating an exemption from certain parts of erisa the employee retirement income security act of and the internal revenue code that have been perceived by some people as an impediment to providing such advice the rules within the ppa to accomplish this are as elaborate as they are ambiguous additionally in an effort to provide easier access to investment advice legislators have penned into law inherent conflicts of interest in that advice my point is this fee only independent third party advisers have been providing k investment advice on a discretionary basis long before the ppa because their compensation was never driven by the investments they were recommending they never ran afoul of erisa unfortunately what the ppa has done is open the door to potentially conflicted advice for plan participants thus eliminating the protections erisa had put in place mr nicolette i agree with david that there are added risks now that the whole financial services industry is being allowed to give customized advice the financial planning association did not embrace this concept we supported an alternative provision limiting the advice to registered investment advisers but were willing to see if the last minute changes by congress will serve to protect the public for example the changes are designed to reduce the conflicts involved in selling proprietary funds which means an adviser who works for abc funds would not have an incentive to recommend abc funds that are more profitable to the firm but not in the best interest of the client the protections envisioned by congress require disclosure of these conflicts to workers and payment of level fees to the adviser so that the employee is alert to the conflicts and the incentives to push less suitable investments by the adviser are removed in addition the firm offering investment advice has to keep in mind its potential liability for acting in a fiduciary capacity the best way to reduce this risk is through clear disclosure of the conflicts to plan participants not simply by handing them a piece of paper listing the conflicts secondly in order for the many thousands of insurance and stock brokers to become true fiduciaries to their clients conflicted firms should train their captive agents on what it means to represent the client and not just the firm or themselves all of this starts at the top senior management should look not only at the marketing opportunities presented by the safe harbor granted by congress but the top brass should also be held accountable for any systemic problems that surface congress failed to address one key problem in the act and that is the absence of any disclosure requirement for a fiduciary adviser who wants to sell investment or insurance products to employees in addition to giving them k advice i dont think consumers will understand that their adviser may no longer be legally required to act in their best interest once they stop giving them advice on their qualified plan mr kudla the ppa provision requiring that advice be based on a computer model all sounds good but who pays the provider of the computer model and who certifies the model is unbiased who monitors all of this on a continuing basis hopefully not the same people that made sure there was a chinese wall between the investment banking arm and stock rating arm of the wall street securities brokers in the late s as a result &# billion in fines were levied against various brokerage firms because of conflicts of interest in stock recommendations stemming from financial incentives that wall street analysts had to give positive ratings to stocks of their firms investment banking clients a mutual fund or insurance company providing investment advice for participants within a k plan they administer that may even have that companys proprietary products as investment options in the plan is very problematic how can that not present a potential conflict of interest under the pension protection act such an arrangement may exist relying on disclosure of conflicts to participants as protection against them is a naive safeguard just because someone discloses to you that they are stealing your wallet doesnt make it ok quality not quantity wsj how will such ambiguities affect the willingness of fund companies to provide advice under terms of this act mr nicolette i dont think this will deter many insurance or mutual fund companies from stepping forward and offering advice the most important question in my view from a quality of advice perspective is can you give customized advice to a large number of employees get a modest return for your effort and still do a thorough job on the other hand even if some of it is cookie cutter advice as long as it is unbiased it is better than no advice at all most k studies show that workers tend to be risk averse yet they sometimes do just the opposite taking on inflation risk by putting their contributions in money market funds or market risk by keeping too much of their money in a single company stock by generally requiring advisers and computer programs to recommend diversified investments the plan participants will be better off than they were before mr kudla the notion that so called cookie cutter advice or potentially conflicted advice is "better than no advice at all" presumes there is no better alternative in fact customized advice can be delivered to a very large number of employees and it can and should be done in a thorough manner by independent fee only advisers since they have no formal ties to the plan sponsor they are oriented to work in the best interests of their clients and not in the best interests of a financial institution after more than years of k investing the first piece of legislation addressing k advice should do better than provide for cookie cutter potentially conflicted advice the opportunity for cross selling and other additional revenue streams for some plan sponsors is just too great to pass up and i agree with nicholas i dont think consumers will understand that plan sponsors may no longer be legally required to act in their best interest once they stop giving them advice on their qualified plan making it better wsj what other steps should be taken to enhance savings in k plans mr nicolette i see at least two important additions that are needed one involves the certified computer model the labor department is wrestling with that mandate from congress and whether it can approve a computer software program that provides unbiased investment advice in lieu of a human adviser i think it can be done as were talking plain vanilla index and basic asset diversification over a fairly long period of time and there are already plenty of proven computer programs in the marketplace the second step that i would take is enhancing the section of the law that allows companies to automatically deduct contributions from an employees paycheck and to step up the increase over time to from the current ceiling of mr kudla automatic enrollment company matching contributions and other initiatives help enhance savings in k plans in our experience however companies that have gone beyond these measures to educate employees on plan provisions and benefits through seminars workshops and other methods are among the companies with the highest k savings rates employees will simply be more willing to utilize a plan if they understand it and recognize the long term benefits
