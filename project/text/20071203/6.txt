citi of arabia no magic carpet ride but a cautionary tale of errors yes the abu dhabi bailout of citigroup "citi of arabia " review &amp outlook nov is deplorable it is the result of the bad business practices of citi and other banks in the subprime mess i am glad to see that in this editorial you acknowledge the banks responsibilities as well i disagree with the analysis that attributes part of the blame for subprime to the federal reserve the feds action in no way induced banks to lend at teaser rates well below prime our goal should be to keep american business strong with no bad laws and no undesirable bailouts and that means good business practices and not enron type manipulations william thayer san diego there are some interesting inconvenient truths concerning the abu dhabi investment in citigroup that are being overlooked in both abu dhabi and the united states first it is strictly prohibited by the quran and under islamic law to charge interest on a loan apparently however receiving interest is not a problem since abu dhabi will be paid from citigroup the other inconvenient truth is the connection of the petrodollar loan at citigroup and the american environmentalist movement the senseless blocking by environmentalists to drilling in the arctic sanctuaries and other locations has increased the amount of oil america is forced to purchase in the middle east even the most rabid environmentalist must realize that every action has a consequence it is an inconvenient truth that it would be better to displace a few caribou than to endanger our national sovereignty by creating wealth with nations that do not share our values or our belief in democracy joel a robinson new york say it aint so when i read the editorial on "citi of arabia " i had to turn the page to see if i picked up one of those other new york based papers surely the paper that touts open markets capitalism and democracy couldnt have written this article its amazing that any investor would want to invest in the u s markets with the burden of sarbanes oxley and the litigious nature of our society the fact that abu dhabi investment authority adia did not take voting rights or a board seat is an astonishing example of restraint i wonder what u s institution including uncle sam would turn around an investment of that size in short order without major guarantees other than a risk premium we should be preparing to welcome the uae and gulf cooperation council as major players in this globally connected interdependent economy if we want access to their markets and their products we need to be prepared to accept responsible investment barry w smith rumson n j your opinion on the bad management and blundering u s monetary policy that created "citi of arabia" was riveting but still an understatement you assert that "arab interests will now have inordinate sway over americas largest bank" when the real problem is that robert rubin citigroups acting ceo is actually risking americas sovereignty by accepting the additional &# billion from the arab world how could sen chuck schumer d n y support this cash infusion from abu dhabi without asking "how much of americas influence is citi selling to arab interests to save its neck this time " this is the second time the petrodollars of arab oil rescued citigroup from poor management and abhorrent business practices so it was surprising that your assessment politely cites citis "mistakes in the mortgage and siv markets" as the root of its recent challenges citi employees pooled the bad debt and credit issues of their shoddy dodgy subprime deals to hide the risk and then intentionally sold the mortgages to unsuspecting investors and institutions across the globe these acts were not "mistakes " to operate with integrity is a "choice" citi associates get to make every single day while i agree that democrats and republicans have lost the resolve to cut spending target corruption or fix u s policies that could have helped citigroup the situation is far more than the "sad day" robert morgenthau so eloquently described when it takes a village of powerful arabs to save americas largest bank from itself it becomes a tragic wake up call for the entire world tish ferguson point pleasant n j thank you for your clear headed assessment of abu dhabis cash injection into citigroup the problem with this investment is not that it is from a state controlled fund calpers has been investing all over the world for years or that it is funded by oil revenues norway has the second largest sovereign wealth funds but that abu dhabi is an undemocratic state and that adia is an opaque organization visit their web site http www adia ae and you will see what i mean our government should take action to limit the acquisition of stakes in u s companies by undemocratic states mijka samora reality journal new york in fretting over abu dhabis bailout of citigroup the journals editors say that "in certain corners of the world large investments come with political expectations " wow stop the presses is there a corner of the world where this is not true do the billions of dollars we regularly pour into iraq egypt israel and so many other countries not come with "political expectations " the journals angst is rooted in the reality that abu dhabi and its petroneighbors are to paraphrase willie sutton where the money is the journal doesnt offer any alternative solutions so its editorial may be viewed as kvetching for the sake of kvetching one should always beware when a writer says "no one favors open capital markets more than we do but " open means open frederick van veen kennebunkport maine
