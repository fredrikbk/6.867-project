is night shift tied to cancer research finds rate of disease is higher for late workers associated press like uv rays and diesel exhaust fumes working the graveyard shift will soon be listed as a "probable" cause of cancer this month the international agency for research on cancer the cancer arm of the world health organization will add overnight shift work as a probable carcinogen it is a step validating a concept once considered wacky and it is based on research that finds higher rates of breast and prostate cancer among women and men whose work day starts after dark the higher cancer rates dont prove that working overnight can cause cancer there may be other factors common among graveyard shift workers that raise their risk for cancer however scientists suspect that overnight work poses a risk because it disrupts the circadian rhythm the bodys biological clock the hormone melatonin which can suppress tumor development is normally produced at night experts estimate that nearly of the working population in developed countries work night shifts among the first to spot the night shift cancer connection was richard stevens a cancer epidemiologist and professor at the university of connecticut health center in prof stevens published a paper suggesting a link between light at night and breast cancer back then he was trying to figure out why breast cancer incidence suddenly shot up starting in the s in industrialized societies where nighttime work was considered a hallmark of progress most scientists were bewildered by his proposal but in recent years several studies have found that women working at night over many years were more prone to breast cancer also animals that have their light dark schedules switched develop more cancerous tumors and die earlier some research also suggests that men working at night may have a higher rate of prostate cancer because these studies mostly focused on nurses and airline crews bigger studies in different populations are needed to confirm or disprove the findings there are still plenty of skeptics and to put the risk in perspective the "probable carcinogen" tag means that the link between overnight work and cancer is merely plausible among the long list of agents that are listed as "known" carcinogens are alcoholic beverages and birth control pills such lists say nothing about exposure amount or length of time or how likely they are to cause cancer the american cancer society web site notes that carcinogens dont always cause cancer the cancer society doesnt make its own assessments of possible cancer causing agents but relies on analyses by the iarc and a u s agency the iarcs analysis is to be published in the december issue of the journal lancet oncology "there was enough of a pattern in people who do shift work to recognize that theres an increase in cancer but we cant rule out the possibility of other factors " said vincent cogliano who heads up the agencys carcinogen classifications unit scientists believe having lower melatonin levels can raise the risk of developing cancer light shuts down melatonin production so people working in artificial light at night may have lower melatonin levels melatonin can be taken as a supplement but experts dont recommend it long term since that could ruin the bodys ability to produce it naturally sleep deprivation may be another factor in cancer risk people who work at night arent usually able to completely reverse their day and night cycles not getting enough sleep makes your immune system vulnerable to attack and less able to fight off potentially cancerous cells even worse than working an overnight shift is flipping between daytime and overnight work "the problem is re setting your bodys clock " said aaron blair of the u s s national cancer institute who chaired iarcs recent meeting on shift work "if you worked at night and stayed on it that would be less disruptive than constantly changing shifts " anyone whose light and dark schedule is often disrupted including frequent long haul travelers or insomniacs could theoretically face the same increased cancer risk mr stevens said
