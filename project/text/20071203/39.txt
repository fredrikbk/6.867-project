investing in funds a monthly analysis lessons learned from a wild year what should investors take away from and how should they apply it in heres what a dozen pros say the year is destined to be memorable for investors the dow jones industrial average has hit a record high times two closing milestones and have been notched but it has been anything but a comfortable ride the dow is now off points from its record close of on oct since this summer volatility has been a regular part of the picture triggered by fears of huge waves of mortgage defaults banks wall street firms insurance companies and other institutional investors from around the world have tallied up tens of billions of dollars in losses from bad bets on complicated mortgage securities packaged by wall street with acronyms cdos in sivs for instance now familiar from negative headlines so far this year the u s stock market has seen daily swings bigger than far above the three to four typical of the past few years with the end of this roller coaster year in sight we invited a dozen prominent figures in the investment fund arena to answer a simple question what is the most important lesson that individual investors should take from this wild ride and how can they apply that lesson next year here are edited excerpts of their responses dan fuss vice chairman co portfolio manager loomis sayles &amp co the lesson you have to carry forward is that about the worst thing you can do is get into frequent asset reallocations theres a financial cost going from fund a to fund b the more important cost is that it messes up your thinking about what it is you want to accomplish with these funds you should make asset reallocations only if your goal changes or in the extreme case you have one major asset class that goes bananas one way or the other an example would be stocks in when you got precipitous change in the price level a decline in the dow thats so extreme i would sell half of my bond portfolio and allocate part of those funds to stocks what we had so far is not extreme there are some headlines that do scare there are scary things going on this involves the banks and every time banks are included you really do have to worry but i would not react to those sharp ups and downs here i would just look at your goals and have your money in the right place in regard to your goals well run bond funds try to maintain a balance between current yield and preservation of capital my preference is a bond fund with flexibility to be in each of the markets treasurys high yield mortgages etc you want the manager within reason to be able to adjust in this changing environment bill gross chief investment officer founder pacific investment management co what began on a high note of global growth and euphoric optimism for risk markets is ending with fear of hidden subprimes and the loss of aaa ratings galore was the year when our modern day shadow banking system lost its innocence "too securitized to fail" was exposed for what it always was "garbage in garbage out " hundreds of billions in losses await those that took the aaa kool aid and a frozen "deer in the highlights" investment community stands by in hopes of central bank salvation the rate cuts will come but salvation will dangle tantalizingly out of reach but to think that our sivs or our cdos or even our supposedly impregnable trillion dollar asset backed commercial paper market will revive anytime soon is a stretch of the imagination if they dont all of the assets they supported in years past will suffer downside potential home prices of course as well as financial and then consumer based stocks importantly add to the list of victims the strength and viability of our national currency a run on george washington into emerging market currencies is under way expect it to continue your portfolio in should reflect a global bias with non dollar denominated assets harry lange portfolio manager fidelity magellan fund the key lesson that fund investors should learn from and apply to and beyond is the importance of portfolio diversification in a volatile market there have been broad disparities in the performance of various equity markets and market sectors in in spite of the large swings up and down however many diversified fund investors who stayed the course were able to achieve positive returns it would have been a mistake to trade in and out of funds based on short term market moves or daily changes in the news recent volatility notwithstanding the s&amp p returned year to date through nov but the msci eafe index of overseas developed market stocks returned that meant that if investors didnt have a meaningful position in international funds they missed an opportunity for strong gains within the u s s&amp p sector returns varied from for energy to negative for financials through nov after long periods of outperformance by small cap stocks over large cap stocks and value stocks over growth stocks new leaders emerged this year across all styles value blend and growth large cap funds have outperformed small cap funds on average as a result investors with portfolios heavily tilted toward value and small cap funds coming into underperformed due to their lack of appropriate diversification what markets sectors or styles will outperform in tough to say the markets are notoriously difficult to predict over short periods which makes portfolio diversification critical for every fund investor who is focused on reaching his or her financial goals peter g crane president and publisher crane data llc the circumstances change but the lessons are almost always the same "dont get greedy and "dont get excited" are my two favorites from investors were protected in money market funds but suffered damages in a lot of investments that claimed to yield more than "cash" with no additional risk some ultrashort bond funds stable value funds bank loan funds and "enhanced cash" funds suffered losses in the asset backed securities and mortgage market meltdowns many investors who likely shouldnt have been in these less liquid vehicles in the first place fled at the first sign of losses compounding the problems for those left behind investors should ignore market movements and match their investments to their current and future needs if there is any chance you might need the cash in the next year or two money market funds should be your only option if you have time for income or growth invest long term in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds with money market funds some investors made the mistake of fleeing to treasury funds which offered pitiful yields they were in effect shooting themselves in the foot losing two percentage points of yield in order to avoid the remote possibility of losing perhaps one percentage point of yield should their adviser not "bail out" their prime money fund to make up for losses on subprime mortgage securities prime funds the main class of money market funds yield and treasury funds yield all of the money market fund firms have absorbed the financial losses so youre handing yourself a loss to avoid the possibility of a loss the reaction far outweighed the risk john bogle founder vanguard group i have to tell you i am concerned the volatility is enormous i think a very important lesson is dont let your emotions drive your investment program because you will be thinking of getting in and out for investors the best rule by and large is to ignore the daily moves of the stock market the stock market is a giant distraction for the business of investing buy and hold a very diversified portfolio u s and global minimize trading fees mutual fund management fees and sales loads and investment bank fees another important lesson always hold some bonds i happen to like short term bonds better than money markets because they yield a bit more and they dont fluctuate very much more high quality short term bonds to of your portfolio if you are older a lot more than that another very clear lesson this year for investors is avoid complexity if you dont know what the fund is investing in dont buy it wall street has created those derivatives and those collateralized debt obligations of very uncertain problems with very high risk just to earn a little more return another lesson is that if you think you are getting a premium yield assume that you are taking a premium risk looking ahead to the next year be risk averse i would never tell anybody to get out of the stock market you want to think of how your account is balanced for example if you normally want to be in stocks id rather be than i believe its a good time to be a little more cautious mark mobius managing director franklin templeton investments in we learned a number of things but perhaps a better way of putting it is we confirmed a number of things that we have noticed for a few years now first i confirmed that the increasingly complex and opaque accounting of public companies leaves investors lenders and the public more and more confused therefore we are faced with a situation where massive liabilities are not decipherable from company or bank reports the accounting bodies establish rules that result in a additional complexity and opacity as well as b extensive discretionary power put in the hands of the auditors enabling them to present accounts in a variety of ways suitable to management second i confirmed that poor corporate governance is not a monopoly of emerging markets but is alive and well in all major markets around the world finally i confirmed that we are living in a wonderful period of mankinds history where the life of individuals around the world has improved dramatically and continues to improve as the worlds two most populous countries india and china attain the worlds fastest economic growth rates emerging markets around the world are doing very well with their economies and stock markets booming however investors must remind themselves that economies and stock markets are constantly changing it has been proved time and time again that most of the time forecasts of these evolving phenomena cannot be accurate investors should thus ensure they are diversified across many markets the coming year promises to be an exciting one with high volatility ken gregory partner litman gregory asset management llc this year has served as a reminder that making decisions in an uncertain world is difficult economic forecasts are not consistently accurate enough to serve as a basis for investment decisions they also say nothing about the degree to which risks are already reflected in financial asset prices while the economy is very likely to weaken the magnitude of any slowdown will only be known after the fact it is even possible that the u s economy will surprise on the upside relative to expectations with the aid of the fed easing a weak dollar that stimulates exports and global growth driven by emerging markets getting excessively defensive could result in missing out on returns that could be captured during a few more years of economic growth on the other hand stocks could drop as much as or even more in a cyclical bear market so depending on how things play out could range from a very rough year to a good year except for those who are lucky making big bets based on a specific view of how the big picture will play out in the near term is speculating not investing so rather than bet on a single outcome e g recession and a bear market investors should consider looking past and focus on the long term with a portfolio that is consistent with their long term investment objectives but it should also be one they can live with in shorter term market dislocations such as a cyclical bear market for investors who have sensitivity to short term risk this means owning some investment grade bonds probably through a bond fund additional benefits could come from some non dollar bond exposure if the dollar continues to weaken equities should be diversified globally to broaden the investment universe allow for participation in faster growing economies and for currency diversification we favor larger cap stocks over smaller caps because we believe larger caps currently offer better value and because they usually perform better late in the economic cycle generally they also have more exposure to the faster growth occurring outside the u s some commodity exposure via a mutual fund that invests in commodity futures provides a low correlation asset some inflation hedge and additional dollar hedge these asset classes can be mixed in different proportions depending on a given investors risk and return objectives andrew clark head of research u s canada and latin america lipper inc other than the obvious truths of not putting your eggs in one basket and not chasing returns i would say the most important lesson investors can learn is when to sell for reasons of ego more than anything else investors can often be found holding on to their former darlings well past their season of bloom now if you really think the current market is wrong and you are sure a particular security you have is going to come back why not peel some of it off in case you are wrong give yourself some odds here youre certain a stock will turn around so sell of it risk management is a key part of successful investing look at your investments with a sliver of ice in your heart the same way graham greene used to revise his novels ego is not your friend and it can definitely be your enemy if thats what you really have invested in your losing positions jean marie eveillard portfolio manager first eagle funds we had a financial crisis in august the sixth in years investors seem to believe maybe they are right the odds are good that the crisis will be handled successfully at least in the short term the odds may be pretty good that crisis no within the next three to six months will be gone but individual investors should remember one thing sometimes what matters is not how low the odds are that something totally negative might happen sometimes what matters more is what the consequences would be if that something truly negative happens unless we are talking about play money or money that otherwise will be spent in las vegas caution is always in order caution is more in order in value investors in a way are always on the side of caution if you are a value investor you are a long term investor so by definition you dont try to keep up in the short term with your peers and with the benchmark pick a good value mutual fund read benjamin grahams "the intelligent investor" first then read fund prospectuses and annual reports to see whether the manager is a "genuine" value investor or not here are a few things to look at long term track record portfolio turnover ratio anybody who has a ratio of a year is not a value investor managers who pick stocks based on intrinsic value rather than chasing market psychologies daniel rice managing director blackrock inc portfolio manager blackrock global resources fund natural resources energy is one sector where one has to adopt a long term perspective given the huge day to day volatility as the market is not efficient in catching up to the sea change in world commodity prices leaving the commodity stocks very undervalued relative to reasonable commodity price expectations investors who are unable to distance themselves mentally from the periodic sharp downturns and who sell or who believe the stocks are reflective of current prices and try to call a top in current prices and who sell as a result wind up missing out on the subsequent outperformance this sector has had a really good run for seven years so a number of people have been recommending all along the way to get off the train we came into the year with market expectations for longer term oil prices averaging about &# a barrel now weve got the futures market saying that oil prices will be &# beyond months and the stock market saying &# deduced from prices of oil stocks it takes longer for the stock market to catch up our assessment is somewhere north of &# if you are short term oriented you will get shaken out during real sharp downturns and you will be drawn in by real sharp upturns one should have to of assets in something that does not correlate with the market either a gold fund or natural resources fund in general the natural resources sector does have some correlation to the overall global economy if the subprime lending mess takes down world growth rates it will have a relatively small but some effect on the stocks in this sector jeremy siegel professor of finance wharton school of business senior investment adviser wisdomtree investments a lot of people are scared away when they hear the headlines of big declines in the market its very important not to be caught up in the prevailing sentiment because usually those are not good times to sell when the market is going down in fact this is really an illustration of the importance of what we call dollar cost averaging basically you have an automatic deduction program where you buy &# of mutual funds when the market goes down that &# buys you more shares and when the market goes up it buys you less shares this is an approach which has been known for years in these volatile times it gains the most kenneth heebner portfolio manager cgm realty fund the lesson is that valuation is critical when valuations become high relative to historical norms it is time to sell in the first quarter of cgm realty fund sold most of its real estate investment trusts we believed that after many years of appreciation the valuation on these stocks had reached extreme levels since reaching a peak in february real estate investment trusts have declined substantially and we believe their values are becoming more reasonable we have begun a process of moving back into real estate investment trusts the areas where we find opportunity are retail reits we dont believe a wavering of consumer confidence on account of the current housing problem or any hesitation in retail sales will hurt the growth in funds from operations from these reits the principal driver of growth in retail reits is the rolling over of five and year old leases to substantially higher rent levels reflecting the increase in rental rates over these time periods we continue to invest in the strength of the global economy within the real estate investment trust universe we also find industrial reits that focus on activity at port levels particularly those with significant foreign operations to be very attractive ms cui is a reporter for the wall street journal in new york she can be reached at carolyn cui wsj com
