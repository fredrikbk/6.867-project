when health insurance does you no good lyle kurtz letters nov deserves a response dr kurtz says insurance companies have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders but whether you have insurance or not there is no one looking out for you in i lost my job and was unable to pay the &# a month premium for cobra later i discovered that my company charged that much to discourage people from getting the insurance i found myself in need of medical attention for an infection i went to the emergency room and when i told them i had no insurance and was unemployed they showed me the door and told me to come back when i could pay this happened six times while i lived in michigan no hospital would see me they did not care all they would do is give me a prescription for medication that i am allergic to i finally got a job but then had to wait six months because of my pre existing condition even though i had never been treated after months i finally was able to see a doctor who immediately had me brought over to the emergency room he said the infection had probably spread due to lack of medical attention he performed surgery to drain the infected area unfortunately because of the length of time it has caused many other health problems for this reason the insurance company has denied all claims that have arisen out of this they say no hospital would have shoved me out but that is what happened even though i am employed i have no health insurance because the company said that all of my health problems resulting from the delay in care are pre existing and will be denied that is the state of health care and the insurance companies fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders but what about the customers they are killing marshall goldsmith las vegas
