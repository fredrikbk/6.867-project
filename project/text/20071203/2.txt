la renta is having a growth spurt his gowns which sell for up to &# and his luncheon suits at up to &# now have a following among wealthy women of all ages his designer line which includes knit tops and silk pants for the younger set is sold at chains such as saks fifth avenue and neiman marcus in the u s and at stores overseas up from seven a year and a half ago next year he will increase the number of free standing boutiques he operates to around from seven in all oscar de la renta brand clothing perfume and other products generate about &# million in annual retail sales not counting o oscar a middle market line produced under license by kellwood co the year old design house is a family business son in law alexander bolen a year old private equity veteran is chief executive stepdaughter eliza reed bolen oversees licensing son moises has designed casual clothes while preparing for todays manhattan showing of his "pre fall" collection the dominican republic native discussed his work excerpts wsj what accounts for your recent renaissance mr de la renta probably it has to do with the fact that i seriously address today a consumer who loves clothes the most important consumer is the professional woman and today a professional woman can buy really beautiful clothes no longer she has to go to a husband and say can i buy this dress she can do it on her own there has never been in the history of fashion a time more exciting to be a designer because there has never been a woman as in control of her destiny i have always done very feminine clothes so this is my time the time for women to really be proud to be women wsj other mature fashion brands lost their core audiences how do you keep yours while reaching younger women too mr de la renta sometimes you will get a designer that so strongly marks a period of fashion that neither he nor his customer can get out of that i like to think myself in the second category the designer who sees the changes in a woman and tries to keep pace we do a secondary line o oscar for the woman who cannot afford my clothes but who one day might be able to wsj how is your o oscar line doing mr de la renta mid tier apparel is a business that across the board has been very very difficult your margins are so small and there is a wide range of competition as a whole that business has been very flat we just keep trying to make it work i am sure that we will succeed wsj you are often compared to your longtime friend valentino garavani are you thinking of retiring soon too mr de la renta certainly not when i come to work every day i have a lot of very young talented assistants most of all alex is sort of running the company as long as i have the passion for what i do and as long as there is an acceptance for what i am doing i am going to keep doing it i am going to see valentino in a couple of days he sold his business a long time ago which is something i am not contemplating myself we have very different consumers valentino will hate me to say this but oscar has a little younger attitude but listen he was a great designer i miss that he is no longer doing what he is doing what keeps us going is the competition wsj what was your most challenging period as a designer mr de la renta i felt like a fish out of the water back when women were wearing minimalistic clothes in the s and s we went through womens lib and had women hesitantly getting into the workplace dressing in a manner that would not get too much notice to become part of what was then a mans world today a woman knows that putting on lipstick looking great putting on a beautiful dress is wonderful she can express who she is in a much stronger way exercising a sense of femininity wsj most designers today are part of a fashion conglomerate or brands with buzz that are still independent what do you tell potential investors who call to inquire about oscar de la renta mr de la renta obviously this is a family controlled business i have to tell you that before my family came to work in the business i thought that perhaps it would be a good idea to sell my business today when i have members of my family so deeply involved in the business i think differently there is a lot that we can do on our own to grow the business five years ago my international business was practically nonexistent soon we will be opening a freestanding store in london and in moscow i have resisted the idea of selling just because i see the business now going in a different manner wsj you were treated for cancer last year how is your health mr de la renta my health is good i just had a hip replacement six weeks ago last year i had something a little bit more serious but i am totally well now wsj whats it like working so closely with family members mr de la renta heaven hell no extremely wonderful sometimes alex gets on my nerves it took me a very long time to convince him to work with me his business was a very different business now when he comes to see me in the studio and starts to express his ideas i always tell him "parsons the new school for design is right up the street and they have night classes " eliza i have been working with for such a long time she is a great image for the company she represents the young consumer moises is trying to learn the craft and i hope he will he has a sense of style he is shy sometimes in expressing himself especially in front of alex but he has an eye no question about it wsj are there conflicts between the oscar de la renta boutiques and the department stores that also carry the clothes mr de la renta operating boutiques is a very different kind of business certainly it involves more risk when you own the store you own the merchandise until you sell it but at the same time the margins are so much bigger we have been extremely successful at it yesterday we were doing a trunk show in our store on madison avenue for the first time in our store we did over &# million in one day we were always very worried that our business with the big stores would shrink but it is a very different consumer who goes to a boutique than goes to a department store wsj you increased your advertising recently is it paying off mr de la renta the increased awareness of the brand i certainly hope was because of the money that was spent on advertising in the past our advertising was minimal we were much more reliant on the advertising done by the stores for the image of the brand and the strength of our image it is better we do it ourselves wsj hillary clinton and laura bush both wore your gowns on vogue covers and you dressed them as well as former first lady nancy reagan for inaugural balls what accounts for your popularity among these first ladies mr de la renta i think first ladies identify with the kind of clothes that i do because they feel that i represent them well fashion is nonpolitical so i have been lucky enough that a lot of first ladies have chosen me to design clothes for them with sen clinton with whom i have a very close relationship i always tease her saying "my big dream is one day to see you in a strapless dress " wsj is that because she has good shoulders mr de la renta she has great shoulders
