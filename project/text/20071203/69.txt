politics &amp economics will the security improvements in iraq endure u s presses baghdad for progress in aiding once restive areas jurf as sakr iraq sheikh sabah al janabi led the sunni tribal fighters that helped u s forces reclaim this one time militant stronghold which has been violence free for weeks but over tea with a visiting u s military delegation mr janabi made clear he was in no mood to celebrate mr janabi told the americans that his towns revival was being threatened by the iraqi central governments failure to allocate money for new hospitals schools and other reconstruction projects here jurf as sakrs security gains he warned would quickly disappear without sustained help from baghdad top u s officials say that to keep the support of sunni tribal leaders who have turned against extremists the shiite central government needs to show it will treat ordinary sunnis equitably after the americans are gone "we need a lot im going to give you a headache if i tell you everything we need " he told the u s officers "but we get nothing from baghdad right now if it wasnt for the american forces here we wouldnt be able to hold the line against al qaeda " mr janabis complaint highlights the biggest question hanging over the bush administrations "surge" strategy will the current security gains endure after the u s troops begin leaving iraq deputy secretary of state john negroponte ending a six day visit yesterday said he was encouraged by advancements made in security and called on iraqi leaders to consolidate the gains by passing political reconciliation legislation passage of a law structuring iraqs oil industry is also necessary for progress he said u s and iraqi officials say they believe they have finally found an effective strategy the influx of the surge forces has allowed u s commanders to extend their reach to areas once under insurgent control sunni tribal leaders like mr janabi have been working with the u s against al qaeda in iraq and other islamist extremists and the u s has been able to effectively buy the allegiance of onetime insurgents including many of the sunni tribal fighters with security and construction contracts the approach has at least for the moment contributed to a marked improvement in iraqs security situation the u s military said last week that major attacks across iraq had dropped since june iraqi civilian casualties fell over the same time period and u s military fatalities declined to their lowest levels in more than months "its been like the stock market a bear market ticking down " adm william fallon the top u s commander in the middle east said in an interview adm fallon said he believed that iraqs security situation had fundamentally changed for the better but it is too soon to conclude that recent gains would endure after u s troops begin departing the country in large numbers the troops deployed to iraq as part of the surge are scheduled to return home by next august "two years ago things were snowballing in the wrong direction and now theyre spiraling in the right direction " adm fallon said "but whether its going to be fully self sustaining is still an issue frankly " u s and iraqi officials stress that extremist groups remain dangerous on nov suspected sunni militants detonated a car bomb near the health ministry in central baghdad killing at least nine people mr janabis hometown of jurf as sakr illustrates just how far u s forces and their allies have come in defusing iraqs insurgency and how much more has to happen to cement those gains and prevent them from evaporating for the past four years jurf as sakr was a battleground militants tied to al qaeda in iraq ambushed u s patrols and killed dozens of iraqi soldiers and police there were no businesses open along the towns dusty main street and few residents felt safe leaving their homes after dark in late september a massive car bomb flattened the towns police station killing two iraqi officers and wounding several u s military advisors "every time i walked to the patrol base i got shot at and every time i got to the patrol base i had hand grenades thrown at me " maj gen rick lynch the commander of the armys third infantry division said during a walking tour here last week gen lynch pointed to a newly opened copy shop and a string of stores selling fruit vegetables and other food "now weve got this " he said american officers give most credit for the turnaround to mr janabi a scion of the areas largest sunni tribe the americans say that mr janabi approached them in august about joining forces against al qaeda in iraq the u s had formed similar alliances in many sunni areas notably the once restive anbar province mr janabi mustered hundreds of trained fighters to combat al qaeda in iraq and he and his men succeeded in largely pushing the group out of the village u s commanders say in exchange the u s blessed mr janabis appointment as the towns mayor and gave his tribe contracts to man a string of checkpoints and build a new police station for the village during his meeting with the visiting u s military delegation mr janabi said he wished the iraqi government was as supportive of his efforts in the city as the americans had been "we need hospitals we need schools we need water pumps im the mayor and i dont even have an office " he says at a meeting in september mr janabi presented iraqi deputy prime minister barham salih with a list of reconstruction projects for the town that needed iraqi central government funding he says mr salih promised to bring mr janabi to baghdad to brief prime minister nouri al maliki on the plan but never did mr janabi says no senior iraqi officials have visited jurf as sakr u s officials say that baghdad has sent almost no money to the town for reconstruction or infrastructure projects the problem isnt limited to jurf as sakr the central government has been struggling to disburse funds for infrastructure improvements a government spokesman couldnt address jurf as sakrs demands specifically but said red tape lack of trained technocrats and corruption are among the obstacles to the governments efforts to distribute funds the government hopes to make improvements next year he said adm fallon said he sympathizes with mr janabis predicament but offered no specific promises of aid
