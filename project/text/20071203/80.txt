the afternoon report adjusting to change online edition with rates on more than two million adjustable mortgages ready to jump over the next two years the bush administration and major financial institutions are working on a plan to help borrowers stay in their homes but which borrowers exactly treasury secretary henry paulson offered some clues today in a speech to the office of thrift supervisions housing forum "first we are increasing efforts to reach able homeowners who are struggling with their mortgages second we are working to increase the availability of affordable mortgage solutions for these borrowers third we are leading the industry to develop a systematic means of efficiently moving able homeowners into sustainable mortgages " mr paulson said outlining the goals of the plan he also broke down four categories of subprime borrowers the first and second groups are respectively those who can afford the adjusted rate and those who cant afford their lower starter rates these borrowers shouldnt expect to be included in the plan mr paulson said the third group represents homeowners who might be able to refinance their mortgages while the fourth are borrowers "with steady incomes and relatively clean payment histories who could afford the lower introductory mortgage rate but cannot afford the higher adjusted rate " the final group is the focus of the government backed plan but how many subprime borrowers fall into this group in all likelihood a minority in a speech today delivered in boston at a breakfast sponsored by the massachusetts institute for a new commonwealth boston fed president eric rosengren echoed figures presented in an article in todays wall street journal which show some of subprime borrowers have credit scores that would have qualified them for traditional mortgages these people are likely to fit into the first or third categories outlined by mr paulson some analysts estimate that of subprime borrowers have been able to keep payments current which indicates that some could fall into mr paulsons second category that leaves the fourth category decidedly in the minority meanwhile of the institutions holding subprime mortgages arent even working with the government on this plan when news of the plan surfaced last week there were cries of "bail out" from many critics but as more details become available the
