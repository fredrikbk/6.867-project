co has been moving his clients into higher quality investments lately over the past couple of years mr altfest has cut back on riskier investments like small company stocks and junk bonds feeling that investors werent getting enough returns for the extra risk that accompanies these investments his bet has paid off during the recent credit market turmoil as investors have gravitated to large companies and bonds with higher credit quality "high quality is king right now " he says in this column we feature model portfolios from prominent financial advisers who invest in mutual funds and exchange traded funds mr altfest also uses privately managed funds for exposure to alternative asset classes or to gain the benefit of their internal research prior to founding l j altfest in mr

his firm manages &# million in assets about two thirds of which is in a "moderate risk" portfolio divided into stocks and bonds "were unusually well diversified " he says generally "theres no more than of any clients portfolio in any one investment that we make " the portfolio has returned about a year over the past five years through he says here are details of the portfolio u s stocks the portfolio has about allocated to u s shares and most of that is in large company stocks mr altfest typically likes to buy value stocks those deemed cheap on the basis of measures like price earnings ratio or stock price to book value per share however given the strong returns that value stocks have delivered in recent years he thinks there is more potential upside in some growth stocks those that have rapidly expanding earnings and typically carry higher p e ratios than value stocks to reflect their robust prospects he favors growth stocks selling at what he considers a reasonable price the moderate portfolio has a combination of both types of stocks in the small stock universe the portfolio allocates each to baron small cap fund which invests in reasonably priced growth stocks and royce opportunity fund which buys cheap small company stocks in the past two years mr altfest has cut back on small company exposure because of the categorys strong run for most of this decade among funds focused on bigger stocks he favors yacktman focused fund which typically holds or fewer value stocks longleaf partners fund which looks for dirt cheap stocks and selected american shares fund which holds shares of many fast growing companies those total he also puts of the portfolio into lsv value equity fund which uses computer models to identify cheap stocks in recent months the fund has faltered with a negative return of about this year through nov still he is sticking with the fund because it has "outperformed the market for many many years " it has returned about a year on average over the past five years nearly four percentage points a year ahead of the standard &amp poors stock index and in the top of its morningstar "large value" category josef lakonishok the funds manager attributes the recent performance downturn partly to value stocks losing ground to growth stocks in the overall stock market "people that stay with us for a long time are doing exceptionally well " he says two years ago mr altfest started investing in t rowe price growth stock fund which focuses on the most reasonably priced growth stocks three percent of the portfolio is in this fund to further emphasize the focus on growth at reasonable price stocks he and his team started a proprietary stock portfolio this year it holds about stocks selected from the s&amp p index by a computer model in an exception to mr altfests rule of the portfolio is allocated to this pool international stocks over the past three years mr altfest has increased the allocation to international stocks it now stands at he says some overseas stocks particularly those of european companies arent as cheap as before but he thinks they will continue to generate good returns given the declining dollar he uses harbor international longleaf partners international tweedy browne global value and artisan international funds which mostly invest in large companies of developed countries he has two funds at apiece focused on japanese stocks sparx japan smaller companies and japan smaller companies funds japanese stocks have been laggards this year mr altfest says earnings have room to grow and that while large export oriented japanese companies will be hurt by the rising yen investors will turn their attention to smaller firms special equity like many advisers mr altfest in recent years has sought out funds that aim to get returns that arent correlated with the s&amp p stock index the moderate risk portfolio invests of its money in merger fund which trades in companies that are in the midst of mergers and acquisitions and another in wintergreen fund a go anywhere fund that invests in stocks and other assets world wide selling at relatively cheap prices he also uses franklin utilities fund which invests in utility shares mainly to benefit from the healthy yields paid out by these companies however he has reduced exposure to this fund to currently as these stocks have had a good run over the past few years bonds and cash bonds provide stability and reduce the portfolios risk about of the portfolio is invested in money market funds this summer mr altfest was unnerved to learn that some money market funds were holding investments backed by risky mortgages and were at risk of losing value so he shifted his clients assets to money funds focused on u s government securities to protect against any losses so far no money market funds have lost money from mortgage related investments largely because mutual fund companies are saying they will make the funds whole on any money losing holdings mr altfest believes inflation will pick up in the next year or so to guard against the harm from that he has increased the portfolios allocation to pimco real return fund which invests in treasury inflation protected securities it now stands at "were always going to have to have some of that fund as sort of an insurance policy " he says among other bond holdings at is yieldquest total

roam across many bond market sectors at of the portfolio is pimco developing local markets fund which invests in money market and very short term bonds of developing countries mr altfest hopes to get a healthy yield from the securities and enjoy the benefits of a declining dollar so far "its been a gangbusters fund " he says the portfolio has a allocation to municipal bonds mr altfest likes these
