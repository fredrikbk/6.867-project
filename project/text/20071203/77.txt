seeking the green in clean tech focused venture capitalists plunge into risky field of alternative energy bill wiberg a telecom expert who worked for years at at&amp t and lucent technologies became a venture capitalist a few years ago to scout out promising wireless technology start ups so what was he doing recently strolling around a coal fired power plant outside baltimore wearing a hard hat and watching giant bulldozers push around piles of black rock he was doing research into a start up that plans to convert coal into natural gas the morning after his visit mr wiberg dug coal dust out of his ears with a q tip he says because "it permeates everything " mr wiberg is one of many tech focused venture capitalists now getting their hands dirty in a risky and growing industry alternative energy other investors involved include former kleiner perkins caufield &amp byers star vinod khosla and current kleiner partners john doerr and ray lane prodded by high oil prices and growing environmental concerns as well as a tougher market for traditional tech investing these investors are switching from telecom and software deals to focus on solar thermal energy processes biofuels and eco friendly building materials yet some in silicon valley are wondering if the learning curve for so called clean energy may be too steep for most venture investors while many of todays internet start ups can be formed with fewer than five staffers and several hundred thousand dollars outfits like solar and biofuels companies often require large staffs and enormous capital investments to get off the ground companies like these can take years to actually start producing anything to sell they also have customers distribution networks and regulatory restrictions different from those of say a software company already there have been stumbles miasole inc formed in and based in santa clara calif has delayed rolling out its solar panels and in september replaced its chief executive venture firms including kleiner perkins have pumped millions of dollars into the company which so far remains private miasole and kleiner perkins declined to comment shares of many publicly traded ethanol companies such as pacific ethanol inc and aventine renewable energy holdings inc which make the gasoline substitute have tanked over the past year amid a glut in the fuel which has reduced ethanol prices and a run up in corn prices which has increased costs most ethanol in the u s is made from corn its causing headaches for some investors "last year you saw a little bit of well invest in corn well pay any price " mr khosla said overall in clean energy "i think theres a lot of investment on little information " he said his company khosla ventures along with kleiner perkins have invested in ethanol start up altrabiofuels inc which has shifted its business model to make ethanol from other substances in addition to corn says kleiners mr lane altrabiofuels says corn "remains quite attractive " however nonetheless investment remains on a tear in the first nine months of u s venture investors poured &# billion into clean tech firms more than the &# billion invested in all of according to data released last week by the national venture capital association and thomson financial that dwarfs investments in so called web companies including social networking start ups such as facebook inc which have received lots of publicity and have been the focus of a separate venture capital frenzy lately venture capitalists pumped &# million into such web outfits in this years first half up from the year ago period according to data company ventureone ventureone is owned by dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal the clean tech hype has grabbed established firms such as kleiner perkins kleiners mr lane a former top executive at software maker oracle corp confirms an incident last year where he chased after a car being driven away by one of the founders of greatpoint energy inc outside of kleiners offices the chase began after a meeting between the two companies ended at an impasse mr lane says he reconsidered his position once the meeting ended and didnt want the entrepreneurs to leave without striking a financing deal "we shook hands on the deal in the parking lot " said andrew perlman greatpoints chief executive and one of the passengers in the car mr lane who says kleiner invested more than &# million in greatpoint which is developing a technology for converting coal into natural gas says his venture capital firm has hired chemistry and physics experts and convenes a greentech innovation network of scientific and policy experts twice a year to keep up with clean energy trends last month kleiner snagged environmental star al gore as a partner for many smaller venture firms boning up on clean energy is tougher mr wiberg a partner with advanced technology ventures in waltham mass says he has attended conferences and read journal articles to get up to speed when looking at tech deals "its all essentially computer hardware and software " he said so his company can rely upon the same experts and set of experiences to evaluate deals with clean energy partners might need to delve into photovoltaic cell technology or microbiology and "those are all very specialized fields " some clean energy technologies are so specialized that entrepreneurs pursuing them are wary of dealing with generalist venture investors at all several months ago veteran greenpeace solar activist danny kennedy quit the environmental group to head a start up called sungevity inc he and his partners quickly spurned offers from silicon valley venture firms that wanted to back the company instead sungevity raised &# million mainly from private investors and established solar companies in germany which has one of the worlds biggest solar markets "we didnt take money from silicon valley because we thought it was too hot " mr kennedy said "we just wanted to go with mature long term players " when they do get into clean tech deals u s venture investors often are faced with companies with big capital requirements mr perlmans coal gasification company greatpoint has raised more than &# million in financing but he says it will need about &# billion just to build a commercial grade plant the company wont produce gas until or in many respects "its not venture capital " said alain harrus a partner with crosslink capital in san francisco "its project finance " investments in clean energy have gotten riskier lately as the sector has gotten hotter the median value of clean tech companies backed by venture money has more than doubled in the past two years according to ventureone many investors arent doing original research in clean tech and are simply following bigger investors into deals at later stages when prices are higher investors say thats dangerous given the modest "hit" rate for venture backed deals
