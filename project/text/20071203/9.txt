americas if a democracy falls in the andes all eyes in venezuela were on the polls yesterday as the electorate went to a referendum on constitutional reforms if approved the amendments will give president hugo chavez dictatorial power and formalize the end of venezuelan democracy but further south in bolivia where chavez ally president evo morales has been trying to consolidate power in a similar fashion democracy took an even more direct hit last week as we went to press last night the outcome of the venezuelan referendum was unknown yet either way mr chavezs authoritarianism and his practice of using the states vast economic power to retaliate against his opponents are not likely to let up any time soon if anything venezuelan repression can be expected to increase since it has no doubt become clear to the once popular mr chavez that the population is increasingly skeptical of his ways and less compliant if venezuelans want to know how the story unfolds once national cooperation with a strongman ends they need only to look to bolivia earlier this year on bolivian radio mr morales said that he was taking fidel castros advice to avoid an armed uprising and instead "make transformations democratic revolutions what chavez is doing " but mr morales has met substantial civic resistance to his power grab so last week his government moved to resolve the problem by employing the military the national police and paramilitaries to physically block elected members of the opposition from entering the constituent assembly in sucre and the national legislature in la paz so that it could push through its centralizing agenda these events didnt get much international attention but they signal that the government has decided to accelerate its accumulation of power in la paz through the use of force it is said that mr moraless vice president alvaro garcia linera is heading up this project and this doesnt bode well for democracy the upper middle class marxist of european extraction from cochabamba has a record of leading "armed struggle" in indigenous communities that goes back decades all indications are that the tiger has not lost his taste for brute force why remote bolivia should be important to washington may not be any more apparent at this time than afghanistan was prior to but there is a reason that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad visited la paz at the end of september bolivia matters to hemispheric stability in che guevara recognized that bolivias borders with peru brazil paraguay argentina and chile gave it enormous strategic value so did the anticommunist government which killed him there that year thirty years later bolivias potential to destabilize remains the u s ought to also be concerned about the tinder box issue of poverty mr morales has used this misery and his indigenous background to rally support for his socialism but if living standards are to improve bolivia needs property rights investment and trade not only is mr moraless left wing populism an improbable model for growth but sadly it is the indigenous poor who are likely to suffer the most from his retrograde experiment in collectivism the bolivian president assumed that consolidating power would be a cakewalk he had planned to follow in the footsteps of mr chavez slowly closing the noose around the bolivian democracy while using his popularity as a shield step one was to call for the election of an assembly to rewrite the countrys constitution but the opposition forced him to accept the stipulation that each article be ratified by a two thirds vote unfortunately for mr morales his movimiento al socialismo mas party only won just over half of the delegates not enough to get its version of the constitution rubber stamped the public has yet to see the proposed document but among the most contentious aspects is the question of decentralization of the nine states aka "departments" in the country the prefects of six are now openly opposed to the mas agenda which seeks to consolidate its power in la paz by depriving the states of authority over their own revenues the state of chuquisaca has a special reason for joining the rebellion against the morales machine its mas representatives in the assembly want the seat of the executive and national legislature to be returned from la paz to the state capital of sucre where it was before when the rest of the presidents backers in the assembly refused to allow the subject on the agenda massive street protests erupted in sucre which also happens to be where the national constituent assembly has been meeting three people have been killed in clashes with police and more than have been injured last week the government unilaterally relocated the assembly to a military installation outside the city and used force to keep assembly representatives who oppose it from attending the pro morales quorum then held a vote and "passed" its version of the new constitution in the same week a meeting of the national legislature in la paz was similarly closed to all but pro morales forces it voted to seize provincial hydrocarbon revenues to pay for an expanded old age pension program liberal bolivians are now worried that similar lockout tactics will be used to get the constitution approved article by article bulldozer tactics are consistent with the politics of mr garcia linera whose resume includes a stint in the tupac katari guerrilla army and who did time in prison on terrorism charges last week members of the red ponchos one of mr garcia lineras favorite militant groups amassed in sucre to threaten mas opponents a youtube video shows them hanging small dogs on a clothesline and then slitting their throats the incident conjured up memories of perus bloodthirsty shining path which also mistreated dogs as a warning to the uncooperative this then is the "democracy" of mr morales and mr garcia linera its hardly surprising their power came about illegitimately with dynamite and road blocks that brought down two elected governments in the short run bolivians may have no recourse but a good first step from the international community would be a recognition that the democracy has been struck down even if no one heard it fall
