how new mpg standards could crimp your ride the vehicles americans drive got steadily bigger faster and less fuel efficient for more than two decades thanks to cheap oil and washingtons hands off approach to regulation if congress passes the energy bill it is now considering that trend would be jammed into reverse the deal brokered by top democrats late friday to boost average new vehicle fuel economy to miles per gallon by means that american cars will get smaller and possibly more expensive the proposed bill would compel detroits auto makers to push into production advanced fuel saving technologies such as gas electric hybrids diesels and gasoline direct injection systems that boost the efficiency of internal combustion motors one way to look at it is that american cars will become over time more like the cars general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler llc sell in europe where high gas prices and tougher fuel economy rules have long forced auto makers to invest in smaller vehicles with more advanced fuel saving technology however sport utility vehicle lovers and pickup truck loyalists wont necessarily have to squeeze themselves into subcompacts auto state law makers led by house energy and commerce chairman john dingell a powerful michigan democrat have seen to it that car makers will have regulatory maneuvering room to continue offering larger vehicles and potentially some federal subsidies to offset the costs of overhauling their factories and fleets to get a sense of what a mpg standard would mean if applied to todays cars consider the honda fit a japanese made subcompact hatchback thats one of the smallest cars sold in america its tiny four cylinder gasoline engine averages about mpg in government tests for combined city and highway driving not good enough to beat the proposed mpg a toyota prius gas electric hybrid beats the standard with a current city highway mileage rating of mpg but that comes at a premium price the prius hybrid costs about &# more than a mpg toyota corolla and about &# more than a base toyota camry which like the prius is classified as a midsize car according to edmunds com an auto research firm the auto industrys acquiescence to the proposed mpg target signals that auto makers whove long warned of economic doom from stricter mileage regulations believe they have the flexibility to meet the challenge moreover the persistence of &# and up gasoline prices and popular concern about climate change and energy security have begun to shift consumers buying patterns toward more fuel efficient models anyway "there are tough new standards contained in the energy bill before congress that pose a significant technical and economic challenge to the industry " said general motors chief executive rick wagoner "but its a challenge that gm is prepared to put forth its best effort to meet with an array of engineering research and development resources " theres no question auto makers fleets will change from the current sales mix offered today fuel thirsty trucks made up of octobers light vehicle sales manufacturers will face pressure over time to decrease vehicle size without sacrificing safety and invest in expensive technologies as manufacturers go about their product plans the thinking will be "all mileage all the time " says an official with one major auto maker emphasis on to performance big engines and large horsepower numbers will decrease the balance will tilt toward improving mileage this person said powerful sports cars like fords popular mustang could become endangered economic forecasting firm global insight says though exactly how auto makers will recalibrate their product mix remained unclear for starters that likely means more gasoline electric hybrids in dealer showrooms hybrids garner only of the u s light vehicle market today but the broad effect of the mileage deal reached on capitol hill late last week could push that market share to by according to global insight diesel engines about more efficient than their gasoline powered counterparts and increasingly cleaner could also jump in share during that time frame from a minuscule slice of the market to about global insight predicts the u s expects diesel filling stations to become more prevalent over the coming years auto makers also plan to use direct injection technology a more efficient way of burning fuel to boost power to smaller more efficient internal combustion engines ford is eyeing turbocharged direct injection engines as a "high volume" fuel efficiency solution assuming a mpg target average consumers could expect to save nearly &# billion a year in gasoline costs assuming a price at the pump of &# according to the union of concerned scientists but the introduction of advanced technologies by auto makers to meet that target wont come without costs price premiums for advanced technology autos could exceed &# on average car makers say a big challenge for detroits big three will be managing the likely decline in sales of large suvs and pickups ford has grown accustomed to selling more than pickups annually for instance gms full size pickups and suvs account for a third of its capacity in seven assembly plants global insight says while more than of fords capacity consists of its f series trucks and large expedition and navigator suvs those volumes will be hard to sustain as tougher mileage standards are phased in but the auto lobby won an important concession separate treatment for passenger cars and light duty trucks regulators will likely set lower mileage targets for trucks and suvs allowing auto makers to maintain sales to some extent another provision easing the burden for car companies the fuel economy compromise would set up a system under which regulators would assign mileage targets to specific vehicle classes likely based on size for example a large bmw series would count toward a mileage average for its size class instead of all passenger cars this potentially allows auto makers to keep selling larger vehicles without heavily discounting sales of efficient but less profitable small cars to meet the targeted fuel economy average the mileage measure under consideration does require auto makers to meet a minimum fleetwide average to prevent them from simply building nothing but large thirsty vehicles auto makers got another break with the extension of the so called flex fuel credit which encourages companies to build vehicles capable of running on biofuels such as e an blend of ethanol and gasoline the credit would eventually phase out under the proposal but congress has a history of renewing such industry friendly breaks the question remains whether consumers will pay for the higher ethanol blends currently the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline is about &# whereas a gallon of e on an energy equivalent basis is &# according to the daily fuel gauge report a fuel information web site sponsored by the american automobile association the proposed deal also offers auto makers a hand with the costs of overhauling their product lines and factories to build more efficient vehicles domestic companies and foreign manufacturers could shell out more than &# billion to retool factories and implement new fuel efficient technologies according to some estimates detroits auto makers would bear the bulk of that upwards of &# billion to ease this pain mr dingell says the government would likely use money from fines paid by auto makers who fail to meet mileage standards to finance subsidies for manufacturers trying to meet the new regulations lauren etter contributed to this article
