an inconvenient reduction thousands of government officials diplomats ngo folks and journalists are in bali this week for the united nations global warming powwow while they try to outline an even tougher set of restrictions on so called greenhouse gases to succeed the kyoto protocol well venture that little will be said about americas record on curbing emissions without such caps its too big an embarrassment to the assembled worthies the bush administration announced last week that u s emissions of carbon dioxide fell by from to output of all greenhouse gases was down last year all this while the american economy grew by its the first time since when the u n began counting these things that the u s has reduced emissions without also suffering a recession critics immediately pointed to the energy departments acknowledgment that the reductions were in part due to higher energy prices and favorable weather but greater use of lower carbon energy sources including natural gas also played a big role the u s reduction also suggests that letting markets work through higher prices will reduce carbon emissions more than the cap and trade mandates favored by environmental lobbies and most democrats the eu hasnt yet released figures for but from to the u s outperformed western europe carbon emissions were up in the so called eu during those years versus in the u s over the same period there has been virtually no difference between the increase in all greenhouse emissions in the u s and eu we refer back to instead of because the real agenda of those who blame americas role in global warming seems to be to blame president bush for not signing kyoto its true that u s emissions have grown more than europes since but how can this administration be held responsible for what happened on al gores watch for all the unproven claims about mankinds contribution to global warming heres something that can be said with authority if curbing emissions really is the goal then the heavy handed approach promoted by the u n and europe isnt the best way to do so
