how investors might ride out market malaise recent financial crisis mimics those of past three hints offer tips financial crises often have been marked by false dawns and punishing rude awakenings so is the stock market now taking a turn toward recovery or is it repeating that history stocks surged last week in an apparent bet that more federal reserve interest rate cuts would be just the ticket to solving the credit crisis it wasnt the first time after credit worries hurt stocks in july and august stocks rallied on rate cut hopes in september only to plunge again when the credit crunch refused to die that isnt the only way this financial crisis mimics those of the past in fact financial debacles which are almost as old as finance itself and are magnified by the ebbs and flows of human emotion unfold in at least partially predictable ways charles kindleberger the late massachusetts institute of technology professor and author of the book "manias panics and crashes " found common threads of euphoria revulsion and swindles in cycles of the past that means investors may find some hints of whats to come hint one there will be more write downs maybe a lot investors rushing into beaten down financial stocks should be wary of being sucker punched by fresh write downs says bob bruner dean of the university of virginias darden school of business and co author of a new book "the panic of lessons learned from the markets perfect storm " a financial crisis is a discovery process he argues in which the depth of everyones exposure to market risk is bared he estimates that process takes one to two years on average and he figures the current unveiling began this june japans banks took the better part of the s to dump all of their trash even relatively small financial pratfalls take awhile to unfold during swedens financial crisis in the early s which was triggered by a real estate bubble and had a clean up cost of only about &# billion in todays money it still took about two years for all the muck to be hosed away according to gerard caprio economics professor at williams college williamstown mass and a former world bank official the technology bust played out similarly the technology heavy nasdaq composite index peaked in march and didnt hit bottom until october the depth of the current fiasco may take an unusually long time to plumb because it involves murky hard to price debt instruments for which there is little or no demand "theres liquidity and buyers but the complexity of what theyre buying is so massive the derivatives so complex and since no regulatory intervention is telling banks to dump it and clean up their balance sheets that you have serious indigestion " says thomas j barrack jr chairman and chief executive officer of colony capital bottom line if you think it is time to start bottom fishing be prepared to ride it to deeper bottoms hint two cheap does not equal value financial crises inevitably claim victims and this one has been no different more than mortgage lenders have filed for bankruptcy closed their doors or surrendered to an acquirer some banking titans have purged their leaders such carnage is manna from heaven for some investors distressed asset investor marty whitman chairman of third avenue funds has repeatedly cashed in on crises he has recently invested more than &# billion in companies in financial distress including mortgage and bond insurers in the current crisis there are more available buyers than ever including massive sovereign wealth funds in the middle east investors that specialize in betting on companies in distress and private equity stockpiles they are starting to jump in but not everything these so called vulture investors buy will pay off "you have to differentiate between what is a real value and what is simply a stock thats down a lot " says solaris group co founder timothy ghriskey who headed value investing at dreyfus in the asian financial crisis of the late s easier said than done a financial stock with a price to book ratio of less than two historically has been considered a value but even that isnt a sure thing citigroup inc s ratio is a wafer thin but mr whitman hasnt touched it preferring firms that dont have question marks about their capital levels many value investors today are looking for financial companies built to ride out the crunch with little or no exposure to subprime and healthy stores of operating capital hint three watch lawmakers and enforcers for opportunities and bottoms the worst crises have brought about regulatory changes the popping of the dot com bubble and subsequent corporate scandals led to the sarbanes oxley law that rewrote corporate governance oversight with the latest crisis occurring in the middle of a heated presidential campaign the urge to regulate the problem will be irresistible already treasury secretary henry paulson is pushing for a plan to freeze interest rates on some loans and lawmakers have their own growing wish lists new regulations are often unpopular on wall street but they can unwittingly create swinging investment playgrounds and astute money managers will be looking for ways to profit from any new laws mr barrack of colony capital reaped a small fortune in the s&amp l crisis buying low priced debt for his then employer texas tycoon robert bass he couldnt have done it if congress hadnt forced the s&amp l industry to mark down the value of its bad assets and hadnt created the resolution trust corp to package and sell those assets when the thrifts inevitably went under that helped spawn the modern asset backed securities market which has since been a profit center for wall street "what made that crisis work out with market clearing prices was regulatory intervention " mr barrack says but regulators often show up late in the game making them a potential guidepost to bottoms the sarbanes oxley law for instance was passed just a few months before the nasdaqs october bottom and prosecutors were just getting to work on the swindles mr kindleberger documented while there is no statistical basis for the view in the past the first big indictments have meant a bottom is very near andrew fastow enron corp s former chief financial officer was charged with fraud and conspiracy on october the nasdaq hit its bottom about a week later carolyn cui
