venezuela vote tight outcome unclear caracas venezuela hugo chavez venezuelas virulently anti u s leader was awaiting results late last night on by far the tightest election contest of his presidency after failing to win the wide margin he expected in a constitutional referendum to expand executive powers and allow him to stand for election indefinitely mr chavez had predicted the constitutional overhaul would pass by at least percentage points but senior government officials said the election was "tight " officials delayed the announcement of results and mr chavez suspended an evening press conference opponents of the referendum demanded that election officials release results either side will likely challenge a close outcome mr chavez had turned the referendum into a plebiscite telling venezuelans that a "no" vote was tantamount to treason a loss would be a humiliating defeat for a leader who has won every political contest by landslide margins but he has faced growing displeasure over food shortages mr chavez was seeking an affirmation of his quest to build a st century socialist state and hoping for a kind of coronation as its long term leader chavez detractors charge that the referendum is part of a strategy to use elections to dismantle venezuelas democracy and replace it with a cuba style dictatorship "venezuelans have never voted so often as during these nine years of peaceful and democratic revolution " mr chavez said after voting the referendum lays the groundwork for mr chavez to remain in office for many years if not for life if it fails mr chavez wouldnt be eligible to run for re election in the constitutional changes would also give the year old former military officer power to create new states and appoint governors to run them as well as powers to spend central bank reserves mr chavez is accustomed to trouncing opponents by percentage points or more the tight race suggests some supporters have soured on his policies amid rising crime and scarcities of basic goods high on the list of complaints is food shortages mr chavezs decision to fix prices has resulted in acute scarcities of many staples last week the government owned luxury hotel the alba was refusing to serve customers cafe con leche a venezuelan breakfast standard "in all my life i never would have thought there would be no milk in caracas " said luis morillo a year old bodyguard who was standing in line to vote in caracass working class catia district a traditional chavez stronghold mr morillo said he planned to vote against the changes to be sure mr chavez retains a deep reservoir of support among venezuelas majority poor and working class riding a global oil boom mr chavez has boosted spending on health care food subsidies and work programs government spending was rising at an annual rate of in late although the rate has since slowed to about that helps explain why mr chavez can count on voters such as marisol herredia a year old hairdresser she said she was unnerved by the how much power the constitutional changes would give mr chavez but she voted for it anyway she said the changes also guarantee her a fixed monthly salary and health insurance benefits too good to pass up mounting student protests against the changes in recent weeks raised fears of violence during yesterdays vote but balloting was mostly peaceful around midday celebrating bands of pro chavez motorcyclists began buzzing the streets waving flags and launching bottle rockets such celebrations began to wane as the night grew long and election authorities declined to release results chavez opponents mainly students held raucous rallies filled with optimism that they might have beaten the odds and eked out an unlikely victory voter abstentions were high a trend seen as favoring mr chavez before the vote many middle class opponents split over whether participating in elections is worthwhile some suspect they are rigged if history is any guide mr chavez would move quickly to exercise his new powers if he wins mr chavez who has stood for a series of re elections since winning the presidency in has tended to use the afterglow of election victories to introduce radical policy initiatives such as nationalizing industries
