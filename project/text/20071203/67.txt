politics &amp economics germany takes tougher tone merkel upsets some at home with push for freedom abroad berlin german leader angela merkel is toughening her countrys approach to authoritarian regimes in china russia and iran but the switch hasnt delivered the kinds of policy changes that might help rein them in by challenging china over its control of tibet and russia over democracy the chancellor who grew up in germanys former communist east is making a clear break with western german diplomatic tradition which for decades favored quiet dialogue over public criticism her views including strong backing for israel and suspicion of iran have moved germany closer to the u s on some of the wests most important foreign policy challenges her experience in east germany where opponents of the regime valued public support from the west on human rights shapes her outlook say people familiar with her thinking "quiet diplomacy doesnt work if youre not prepared to stand up for your beliefs in public " says eckart von klaeden foreign affairs spokesman for ms merkels conservative christian democrats he wrote the partys new asia strategy which said germany should assert its democratic values more strongly that view worries many german foreign policy specialists and at times pits ms merkel against her foreign ministry "the idea that western democracies can write the rules for successful autocracies is fanciful " says eberhard sandschneider director of the german council on foreign relations ms merkels ability to pursue her convictions is limited by domestic politics and economics germanys business lobbies fear losing contracts abroad they have called on ms merkel to repair relations with beijing which turned acrimonious when the chancellor received the dalai lama tibets exiled buddhist leader in her berlin office two months ago exports make up of the german economy compared with for the u s ms merkel lacks domestic support for policies that would move beyond highlighting human rights abuses to u s levels of diplomatic and military confrontation her coalition partners the left leaning social democrats fear she is damaging relations with some of the rising powers of the global economy german voters are wary of too close an alignment with the u s unpopular here since the iraq war began "i dont think she can deliver very much " says john kornblum former u s ambassador to berlin and head of investment bank lazard in germany "germans underlying fears and hesitations havent changed and she has to live within that framework " the chancellor recently urged german companies not to seek new contracts in iran so long as it resists international efforts to rein in its nuclear program hardening german policy german officials say her government plans further measures to scale down trade with iran but she hasnt joined the u s france and britain in proposing unilateral sanctions should russia and china block the united nations security council from taking tougher action germany racked up about &# billion of trade with iran last year a local industry lobby warned that the loss of all trade with iran would jeopardize german jobs on afghanistan where germany has troops in the north of the country ms merkel is resisting calls in germany for withdrawal but she hasnt pushed to lift the so called caveats that stop german troops from being sent south where most of the combat is ms merkel has made a point of visiting russian president vladimir putins political opponents and highlighting human rights failures in russia a big change from her predecessor chancellor gerhard schroeder who once called mr putin a "flawless democrat " her blunt demands for greater democracy in russia have prompted sharp retorts from mr putin but havent visibly disrupted germanys soaring exports to russia "she has a profound understanding of the historical dimension she knows that russia can misbehave but in the end it has no alternative to good economic relations with europe " says gary smith director of the american academy in berlin however ms merkel has stopped short of changing germanys core relationship with russia on energy she backs the construction of a natural gas pipeline from russia to germany that mr schroeder arranged as chancellor before he went to work for the pipeline consortium poland and other countries bypassed by the planned pipeline say germany is undermining a common european union front in dealing with russia over gas supplies german voters overwhelmingly approved of ms merkels decision to meet the dalai lama but beijing was outraged and canceled a string of official and business meetings ms merkels political rivals attacked her mr schroeder said she was too "emotional" about human rights her foreign minister a social democrat attacked her policy as populist posturing that undermined more discreet contacts over human rights and the rule of law the chancellor has stuck to her guns "human rights policy and representing economic interests are two sides of a coin " she told germanys parliament last week a spokesman for ms merkel added that she believes foreign policy "shouldnt be a purely opportunistic pursuit of geostrategic interests in which the ends justify the means "
