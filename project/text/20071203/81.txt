the evening wrap muffling the alarm online edition irans nuclear weapons program may not be all it was cracked up to be tehran stopped its active nuclear weapons program in fall according to a new national intelligence estimate issued today iran still enriches uranium the material needed to build a nuclear bomb but uranium enrichment for peaceful purposes is allowed under the nuclear non proliferation treaty the nie whose report is current through june of this year concludes that the soonest iran could develop a nuclear weapon is between and should tehran reverse course and pursue one the report strikes a clear blow to those who said that iran was on the cusp of nuclear weapons capability and posed an imminent threat said christopher preble director of foreign policy studies at the cato institute for six years the u s government has stressed that iran intends to have a nuke and was working flat out to build one added jon wolfsthal senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in october president bush said denying tehran a nuclear capability was a necessary part of international action to forestall "world war iii " but the nie now depicts a much less urgent situation mr wolfsthal said and "will require a dramatic reassessment of policy " national security adviser stephen hadley said that the acquisition of a nuclear weapon by iran remains a threat but that the nie "offers grounds for hope that the problem can be solved diplomatically without the use of force as the administration has been trying to do " the report says iran shuttered its weapons program "primarily in response to international pressure " and that the decision suggests iran may be more vulnerable to foreign influence than had been assumed it implies tehran decided not to pursue a nuclear weapon as the result of some kind of cost benefit analysis while the presumption in some corners has been that iran was bound and determined to develop a nuke regardless of the downside analysts suggest that the nie findings represent a victory for those who advocate pressure and diplomacy as means of clamping down on irans nuclear ambitions "i think the basic implication is that the kind of pressure were trying to apply can make a difference with a more moderate leadership " said michael ohanlon senior fellow at the brookings institution "but you also have to show that youre willing to interact with such a leader " to be sure the report also says that iran is keeping its options open and implies that convincing tehran to indefinitely forgo development of a nuclear weapon is a tall order the change of tune may also point to a prudent desire to avoid the weapons of mass destruction debacle that led the u s into iraq senior u s officials said the nie could undercut calls from hawks inside the administration for the use of military strikes to combat the perceived threat from irans program "in the iraq run up the cia wasnt as careful as it could have been about the weakness of some of its sourcing " mr ohanlon said he said that the nie perhaps reflected the cias attempt to avoid another mistake "this is an independent agency and it takes a lot of pride in trying to be accurate " stocks sag stocks were dragged down monday by the financial and auto sector amid continued worries about fallout from the credit crunch the dow jones industrial average was

chimp a group of japanese researchers recently pitted young chimpanzees against human adults in two tests of short term memory and the chimps won overall challenging a widely held belief that "humans are superior to chimpanzees in all cognitive functions " said researcher tetsuro matsuzawa of kyoto university one memory test included three five year old chimps who had learned arabic numerals through and a dozen human volunteers who presumably knew them also they saw nine numbers on a computer screen and when they touched the first number the others turned into white squares the test was to touch the squares in the order the numbers used to be there and the chimps could do this faster if not more accurately one chimp ayumu beat a number of college students in a later test where five numbers flashed on the screen for a much shorter period mr matsuzawa cites evolutionary reasons and the youth of the chimps as factors the associated press contributed to this report
