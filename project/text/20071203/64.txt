politics &amp economics republican regular guy rises fast huckabees populist message resonates with conservatives concerned about the economy manchester n h mike huckabee the little known fast surging former governor from arkansas is throwing another curve into the tumultuous race for the republican presidential nomination touting an economic populism more common to democrats mr huckabee a former baptist pastor has climbed to the top of the polls in iowa and improved his standing elsewhere largely on his socially conservative message but his campaign also features a strikingly populist economic message calling attention to people who feel strapped and are barely making it "we ought to have to look in the eye of some man whos not sure how hes going to take care of his family and hear what he has to say about the next election " he said friday in a speech to the chamber of commerce in concord n h he frequently says he seeks to represent main street "im not the fair haired boy from wall street im not even on their list " he told a packed gathering at a chinese restaurant in bow n h in a string of campaign events this weekend in new hampshire mr huckabee only mentioned abortion gay marriage or religion if asked about them but the economic message was front and center he is critical of free trade saying its often not fair trade he supports subsidies for health care and backs college aid to children of illegal immigrants relating their experience trying to climb out of poverty to his own its hardly stuff from the traditional republican playbook indeed its possible that once these views are more widely known it will hurt mr huckabee among the party faithful already he is under fierce attack from the club for growth a washington based antitax group and some of his rivals for supporting various tax increases in arkansas but another possibility is that the republican populist will reshape his party just as former new york mayor rudy giuliani is testing the partys long time stance on social issues leading most national polls despite his tolerance of abortion rights gay rights and gun control while mr giuliani has won friends and enemies as a social liberal and economic conservative mr huckabee is rising as just the reverse a des moines register poll released yesterday was the second in a week to put mr huckabee on top showing he had support from of likely caucus goers against for former massachusetts gov mitt romney who has spent millions of dollars and had been leading in iowa for months mr huckabees five percentage point lead is just outside the polls margin of error of plus or minus percentage points many of mr huckabees supporters say his populism is what attracts them to him "im very much a free market person but i also like that the governor is concerned with dispersion of opportunity " said stuart arnett an economic development consultant from concord n h who has been volunteering for mr huckabee since spring "you typically would hear democrats say we need to address inequity of income for a conservative republican to say it people take notice " "hes the guy who will stand up for the working man " said bob tingle a casino pit boss who describes himself as a "reagan republican" and drove from his home in westerly r i to hear mr huckabee speak in new hampshire "im just a regular average guy he represents me " implicitly mr huckabees populist message amounts to a swipe at mr romney a multimillionaire asked about the comparison in an interview mr huckabee said "im stating a fact that a lot of people in this country relate to and they want i think to know that a president understands what struggle means " to be sure mr huckabees platform includes a large dose of conservative thought he promotes the "fair tax " which would replace the federal income tax with a hefty national sales tax and talks about abolishing the internal revenue service altogether he supports president bushs tax cuts rejecting critics complaints that most of the benefit went to the rich asked what government can do to help the middle class worker feeling strapped he says government needs to get out of their way its unclear how much of his recent surge in the polls can be credited to the populist message but it could be a winning strategy even for a republican the republican party is no longer as dominated by big business as it once was with new converts including lower income voters particularly in the south who might have been democrats in the past mr huckabees message may resonate at a time when economic anxiety and economic inequality are powerful worries those that republicans have never been very good at addressing a wall street journal nbc news poll last month found that for a third of republican primary voters the economy and health care were more important than terrorism and social issues in the interview mr huckabee said the rest of the party must wake up to the problems of the working class or be prepared to serve in the minority "the republican party really has had a lot more people in it who are ordinary working class people than i think it ever understood and if its not careful its going to lose that group completely if it hasnt already " he said on health care mr huckabee appears more open than his opponents to expansion of the state childrens health insurance program and thinks president bush should have negotiated a compromise with democrats by now he also favors government subsidies for working class or middle class families for health insurance he says he thinks that might best be given in form of assistance to buy private insurance thats a position not that far from some leading democrats mr huckabee tells audiences that on his mothers side hes just one generation from dirt floors and outdoor plumbing on his fathers side hes the first male to graduate from high school "i understand the american dream because ive lived it " he told a crowd of more than people jammed into a suburban home in bedford n h on saturday
