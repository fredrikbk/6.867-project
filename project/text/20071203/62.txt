politics &amp economics blackwater assailed on tax policy firm calls iraq guards independent contractors waxman seeks review blackwater worldwide is fending off a new line of attack from critics in congress this one focused not on its tactics protecting u s diplomats abroad but on the tax status of the guards it employs rep henry waxman has been looking at blackwaters classification of security guards as independent contractors for whom the company doesnt withhold taxes mr waxman the california democrat who chairs the house oversight and government reform committee wrote in an oct letter to blackwater founder erik prince that he believes "blackwater may have avoided paying millions of dollars in social security medicare unemployment and related taxes for which it is legally responsible " mr waxmans staff estimated that the companys tally for unpaid federal taxes could reach almost &# million for its state department guards between may and september the state department pays blackwater more than &# million a year for security work around the world in a page rebuttal to mr waxman detailing the companys defense blackwater said its company policy abides by the law blackwater faces a number of investigations stemming from a sept shooting incident in baghdad that involved a blackwater protected state department convoy and left iraqis dead mr waxman and other critics of the company have largely been focused on the conduct of blackwaters guards in iraq mr waxman a critic of the u s war in iraq has pursued other perceived abuses there including waste and fraud involving money spent on reconstruction the tax issue is significant because the companys business model revolves around the classification of guards as freelance contractors not employees blackwaters full time employees in moyock n c arent at issue it is the more than individuals who work in iraq and elsewhere in shifts measured in months that are the focus mr waxmans case against blackwater relies on a march internal revenue service letter involving one of the companys security guards who requested clarification of his work status from an irs office in vermont and had been seeking back pay from the company the irs agent reviewing his case ruled that the guard who had worked in afghanistan in was an employee of the company not an independent contractor this determination is tied to the one employee and not to the entire company the irs declined to comment on the case a company must withhold federal taxes if a worker is an employee but independent contractors are expected to withhold taxes themselves in its response to mr waxman blackwater said that the irs letter was flawed the company said its tax policy abides by the law a position it said is bolstered by an accounting firm and a law firm that have advised the company on the issue blackwater also said it wasnt given enough of a chance to address the employees case with the irs before the letter was sent blackwater said its accounting firm assured it that tax law allows it to employ independent contractors and not withhold taxes blackwater said in the statement it "has no underpaid employment taxes and it may continue to classify its security workers as independent contractors " the company said that the irs evaluation didnt take into account that the specific terms of its government contract protecting american officials are set by the state department not blackwater itself blackwater said it informs its guards from the beginning that they are independent contractors and gives them tax training typically from an attorney an accountant and an investment adviser blackwaters ability to handle big government security and training contracts is linked to easily hiring people with specific skills for short term work it is also known within the security industry for being very aggressive on its bidding the company says its workers like the ability to come and go between assignments which this arrangement makes easier a spokeswoman said a change in the tax status wouldnt affect blackwaters bottom line but full time guards would lose flexibility on when they work and probably would be paid less because blackwater would use some of the money it now pays them to cover any increase in related costs blackwater is not alone in the private security industry in classifying its workers as independent contractors though some of blackwaters closest competitors consider their security guards employees
