wondered whether safeway could find new ways to exploit its assets he decided to hire a veteran entrepreneur to help him find out the result mr burd and his entrepreneur in residence former toy and videogame executive don kingsborough have built a small but thriving gift card company inside safeway called blackhawk network inc the unit sells gift cards at stores owned by safeway and other retailers the cards are good for purchases at companies such as home depot inc and amr corp s american airlines while shopping for food customers can grab a gift for a friend or relative saving them an extra shopping trip the cards can be found at the checkout line or increasingly with their own dedicated racks among the other merchandise blackhawk earns a commission from the card issuers on each

it has expanded the racks and kiosks it calls "malls" inside more than safeway owned stores placing racks of cards at the end of two aisles as it seeks to woo more customers and limit crowding on hectic shopping days safeway also plans to soon expand sales of its gift cards online with blackhawk the pleasanton calif chain is capitalizing on one of its biggest assets the roughly million shoppers who walk through its stores each week blackhawk also has leveraged safeways expertise in the grocery industry to sign up other major grocers as distribution partners including rivals kroger co and supervalu inc "the beauty of what blackhawk has done is picked up on a very powerful trend early " says mr burd safeways ceo since "and safeway represents a constant test site for virtually all new products " analysts expect healthy growth for blackhawk this holiday season typically the busiest for gift cards but they say economic pressures on consumers including high fuel and food prices might cause some to purchase cards in lower denominations than they have in the past "you could see huge amounts of gift cards sold but maybe people trade down to the lower priced cards " says scott mushkin a food retail analyst with bank of america corp s banc of america securities blackhawk named after the california town where mr kingsborough lives is an important growth engine for safeway which faces brutal competition in its main business battling everyone from discounter costco wholesale corp to upscale chain whole foods market inc the company also recently opened a restaurant in the san francisco bay area and is expected to announce other nontraditional ventures safeway barely spoke about blackhawk founded in until last winter when it divulged some financial projections to investors the company nurtured the business quietly in part to limit competition "the beauty of being inside safeway " says mr kingsborough blackhawks ceo "is that as an entrepreneur i didnt have to go out and raise money and have a lot of publicity early on we said lets make this into a great company at a pace that makes sense " mr kingsboroughs resume includes founding toy maker worlds of wonder inc and launching videogame giant nintendo co s u s business although safeway doesnt disclose blackhawks revenue sales this year will be about &# million estimates chuck cerankosky an analyst

to &# million blackhawk has more than employees but because of the electronic nature of the business its overhead is relatively low blackhawk faces competition in the so called third party prepaid card market primarily from a closely held company incomm holdings inc but consumer demand is growing so fast that each is increasing revenue rapidly analysts say "its way early in this market " says tim sloane an analyst with mercator advisory group a payments industry market research firm "blackhawk is clearly executing extremely well but i dont think the real battle has started yet " blackhawk sells cards for a wide range of issuers including best buy co starbucks corp and baseballs chicago white sox some carry the names of major credit cards and can be used for purchases anywhere many issuers have agreed to exclusive deals to have only blackhawk distribute cards for them blackhawk has signed agreements with retail partners to sell cards in more than locations in the u s canada and overseas safeway officials decline to discuss commission rates mercator advisorys mr sloane says rates can vary widely a little known card issuer such as a small phone company might have to pay or of the face value of a card to a company like blackhawk bigger card issuers may pay about he says when blackhawk distributes cards at partners stores such as drugstore chain cvs caremark corp it shares the commission while blackhawk dominates sales of third party prepaid cards in grocery stores incomm based in atlanta has a strong presence in convenience stores and sells cards at retail behemoth wal mart stores inc "they put together a more comprehensive program more quickly than anybody because they controlled stores themselves " incomm chief executive brooks smith says of blackhawk analysts say
