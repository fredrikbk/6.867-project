musharraf could win if his rivals cant make peace opposition impaired by failure of sharif and bhutto to unite islamabad pakistan even after shedding his military uniform last week pakistans president pervez musharraf retains formidable powers how much longer he will continue to do so depends largely on whether his two main civilian opponents detest the former general more than they loathe each other the two former prime ministers benazir bhutto and nawaz sharif have returned to pakistan in recent weeks after years abroad and they have re entered the political fray at the helm of two well organized political parties with millions of supporters together ms bhutto and mr sharif could have the popular support to force mr musharraf into redrawing his blueprint for a transition to democracy a plan that leaves the former army chief propped up by a judiciary packed with loyalists and empowered to dismiss the next elected government and the legislature so far however ms bhutto and mr sharif bitter rivals who served as prime ministers before mr musharraf seized power in a military coup have shown little inclination for such unity raising the chances that pakistans political future will accord with mr musharrafs vision for now the two politicians disagree even about whether to participate in the january parliamentary elections that are intended to vote in the next prime minister "both the prime ministers want full power for themselves they cannot share " said farooq leghari who served as pakistans president alongside ms bhutto and mr sharif from to "theres intense political rivalry between the two i dont think they are compatible with each other " thats good news for mr musharraf who is hoping that squabbles among civilian politicians will weaken the groundswell of opposition that has been building for most of this year against his rule and against his declaration of a state of emergency nov when he replaced the supreme court with loyalists and suspended the constitution he has since said he intends to lift emergency rule dec the question of whether to participate in the parliamentary elections mr musharraf has called for jan has emerged as a crucial fault line between ms bhutto who is seen as relatively pro western and mr sharif who is more conservative and enjoys saudi arabias support arguing that an election would be a farce as long as the top judiciary remains biased toward mr musharraf mr sharif has called for a boycott by the entire opposition ms bhutto however has consistently declined to join such a boycott and she has already kicked off her campaign with a large rally in the city of rawalpindi near islamabad ms bhuttos position is critical as long as her pakistan peoples party participates in the january vote mr sharifs muslim league can hardly afford to make good on its threat to boycott the elections this split runs not only between ms bhutto and mr sharif both of whom have aspirations and realistic chances to emerge as the countrys next prime minister the powerful five party islamist alliance that has governed two of pakistans four provinces since muttahida majlis e amal has also split one of its two main components jamiat ulema e islam announced it will participate in the elections no matter what while the remainder sided with calls for a boycott "theres general confusion in the opposition and this is what musharraf may have banked on " said marvin weinbaum a scholar in residence at the middle east institute in washington who served as pakistan analyst at the u s state department bureau of intelligence research from to "they may have unity in wanting to get rid of him but they cannot agree on anything else and this includes simple tactics " amid this political maneuvering the lawyers and pro democracy activists who have been on the front lines of popular protests in pakistan are increasingly finding themselves pushed to the sidelines of whats shaping up as a raw contest for power among politicians who share few of their democratic ideals these idealistic activists remain vigorously opposed to any election until the supreme court judges ousted by mr musharraf are reinstated "the judges have been stabbed in the back " said sajjad ali shah pakistans supreme court chief justice in the s "the politicians are aiming for one and only thing a share of power even if it means sharing it with the army "every leader of a political party thinks of their personal interest not the interest of the institutions or the country they dont want the supremacy of the constitution or the rule of the law " similar feelings pervade the small but vocal demonstrations by lawyers and pro democracy activists that still occur almost daily in islamabad and other major cities "we are angry and disappointed " said high court advocate riasat ali azad as he paused between shouting "boycott " and "go musharraf go " at a recent demonstration "it is unfair we started this action but now the political parties want to get the fruits of it and to increase their vote bank the parties should stay with the lawyers with the judiciary with the civil society instead of rushing to elections " there are complicated calculations both political and personal behind the opposition parties approach ms bhuttos return to pakistan from self imposed exile for example was facilitated in october by mr musharrafs national reconciliation ordinance a widely criticized piece of legislation that dropped pending corruption charges that relate to her period as prime minister in the s the ordinance did not grant similar amnesty to mr sharif who also is accused of corruption a truly independent judiciary may not agree with this ordinance reopening the charges against ms bhutto mr sharif for his part is an unlikely paladin of judicial freedom considering he had sent his own partys thugs to the supreme court building in ousting the then chief justice the former premier is expected to try to make a last ditch appeal for ms bhuttos cooperation when they meet in islamabad today in an attempt to work out a joint strategy "musharraf has lost his political and moral credibility " said khurshid ahmad director of the institute of policy studies in islamabad and an islamist senator who supports the boycott "if benazir bhutto would share power with him shell lose ultimately the choice is hers between a short term gain or a long term benefit " any election boycott however is fraught with unpredictable consequences as it would test the oppositions ability to rally supporters onto the streets and the armys continued backing of mr musharraf despite promises of displays of people power none of the opposition parties managed to organize a massive protest after the state of emergency was imposed mr musharraf meanwhile has declared that the elections will happen on jan "come hell or high water " adding that he will deal decisively with anyone who tries to subvert the voting by force this means that despite all the talk of vote boycotts the transition so far appears likely to proceed according to mr musharrafs scenario "if youre not going to participate in the election youve got to try to bring down the whole system " mr weinbaum said "there is nothing in between many people dont have the stomach for this "
