deal journal breaking insight from wsj com vivendi activision was a game in itself complex deal involved letting some shareholders cash out but who won and who lost forget world of warcraft the most interesting thing about the vivendi activision deal might be the financial wizardry that went in to putting it together instead of just buying activision inc outright vivendi is combining its games business with activisions and pumping in as much as &# billion to help fund a tender offer that would allow about half of activisions old shareholders to cash out the complicated structure raises a simple question who benefits most its clearly a sweet deal for vivendi in return for control of whats being advertised as a &# billion market cap entity the most it will likely have to put up is &# billion thats &# billion to buy million newly issued activision shares and if necessary a further &# million to help fund the &# billion tender activision will contribute a bit more than &# billion from its balance sheet for the tender and borrow the rest if necessary the french company also wins an attractive home for its isolated games business and inherits a strong management team at activision it is worth noting that when vivendi tried to auction this unit a few years ago it couldnt fetch even &# million and ended up taking the unit off the table says one person familiar with the matter but is it a good deal for activisions shareholders if the planned &# billion tender is fully subscribed then only about half of activisions existing shares can be exchanged for the premium based on fridays close whats more mergers of near equals tend not to work out very well especially in industries with strong cultures such as gaming its important to remember that activisions management and not vivendis proposed this transaction and it is activision management that keeps hold of the reins of the combined company then theres the cross border element remember that other franco american marriage of "equals " alcatel lucent that hasnt fared too well still consider the following vivendis gaming masterminds arent based in france but in california that could help free the new company from some of the culture clashes that have plagued other deals more important the &# billion value vivendi put on its games business suggests a earnings before interest and taxes multiple of the deal values activision at times ebit a similar multiple to industry leader electronic arts that implies that vivendi gave something up to do the deal ultimately the deals merits rest on whether the strategic logic underpinning the transaction is as compelling as both sides claim if shareholders decide it isnt activision may wish it had invited more players
