the morning brief finding a successor to the kyoto protocol online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here in his first official act as a new prime minister kevin rudd today signed paperwork that will lead to australias ratification of the kyoto protocol further isolating the u s on climate issues just as negotiators are meeting in bali to start work on kyotos successor mr rudds signature would seem to bolster the united nations sponsored bali conferences momentum already building since the nobel peace prize was co awarded to the intergovernmental panel on climate change and its work documenting human induced global warming the latest scientific warning came just yesterday in a study published by peer review journal nature geoscience which found the earths tropical zones have begun to spread toward the poles while some of the earliest signs of climate change came through melting ice in the arctic the study reports evidence of tropical expansion that could threaten subtropical societies "poleward movement of large scale atmospheric circulation systems such as jet streams and storm tracks could result in shifts in precipitation patterns affecting natural ecosystems agriculture and water resources " it says but cautions that the implications still arent well understood and yet despite the warnings and burgeoning political consensus theres also little certainty about what the bali talks will produce while the u s delegation declared it wont be a "roadblock" to a new agreement the bush administration remains opposed to mandatory emission caps for greenhouse gases and some other steps many of u s allies support china which has seen billions of dollars in crops destroyed by the pollutants of its coal burning power plants and india threatened by melting glaciers and devastating droughts have both said they wont sign a treaty that slows their pace of economic development as the associated press reports both countries are allowed to keep polluting under the kyoto treaty which itself has led to little actual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions the product of much geopolitical wrangling it required only countries to limit pollution and just over of third of those countries were former soviet bloc countries the los angeles times notes the likes of russia latvia and romania have sharply lowered their carbon dioxide emissions since but thats more due to how the collapse of the soviet union shut down smoke belching factories the times says and the kyoto emissions were set far above the countries actual emissions under kyoto industrialized countries that ratified the treaty were charged with lowering their emissions by from s levels requirements that expire in but in many big industrialized countries emissions have continued to increase thats part of why regimes were created to allow countries to trade carbon credits buying for example eastern europeans permission to pollute in order to emit more in western europe it was a way as the wall street journal says of harnessing market forces to deal with global warming but the trading "hasnt yet ignited the green energy revolution its architects were expecting " the journal says "the cap and trade system has brought about useful projects targeting a few especially potent greenhouse gases it hasnt however forced the industrialized world to meaningfully curb what scientists say is the biggest problem of all the growing consumption of fossil fuels " the bali talks are aimed at going a lot farther looking at proposals from the attending governments like britains idea of limiting global aviation and shipping emissions as the guardian reports and working off the ipcc recommendations but as the new york times notes few participants expect the current talks to produce a breakthrough iranian intransigence jars china irans blatant dismissal of past talks on its nuclear program and refusal to discuss its uranium enrichment any further seems to have alienated ally china beijing for the first time suggested it would support a new package of sanctions to be considered by the united nations the financial times reports and its willingness to do so could jumpstart action by the long divided security council the chinese government "signaled over the weekend that it was prepared to back measures that will hit irans banking and business sector while also prohibiting more senior iranians from traveling abroad " the ft says the new york times reported over the weekend that the new iranian nuclear negotiator saeed jalili a close ally of president mahmoud ahmadinejad told a european negotiator representing major powers on the council that all talks with his predecessor were irrelevant and that "there is no longer an iranian nuclear problem " the only interlocutor iran will now recognize he added was the international atomic energy agency "the first hour and a half of the meeting on friday was described as a monologue with mr jalili speaking about the will of the iranian people to support uranium enrichment theology god even his doctoral thesis " several officials told the times a french official called the meeting a disaster adding "we have in front of us the real iran " but he stressed that currently there was no security council agreement on how to proceed and even if china joins western attempts to punish iran any effort will have to win the approval of russia as well the subprime fallout just keeps growing a key misconception about the subprime mortgage crisis is that its only about riskier borrowers and not those with good credit the wall street journal reports a journal analysis of "more than &# trillion in subprime loans made since shows that as the number of subprime loans mushroomed an increasing proportion of them went to people with credit scores high enough to often qualify for conventional loans with far better terms " the paper reports and "the numbers could have dramatic implications for how banks and u s regulators address the meltdown in subprime loans " as the subprime mortgage loans have increasingly gone into default with hundreds of thousands expected to follow bush administration and the major financial institutions reeling from the fallout have been working on a plan to freeze interest rates of such loans many of which are set to rise high and risk more defaults in what the journal sees as "a sign that the housing crunch is increasingly resonating on the campaign trail " democratic presidential candidate sen hillary clinton is expected today to call for a day moratorium on home foreclosures which is among the ideas the bush administration is considering meanwhile the related credit crunch has produced so severe a bout of illiquidity that euro zone government bonds have been affected "threatening to impair the ability of some governments and other borrowers to meet their funding needs in coming months " the financial times reports on another subprime front the ft reports that british chancellor of the exchequer alistair darling hopes to settle the future of troubled u k mortgage giant northern rock before christmas and that his team is encouraging the lender to look at rival offers beyond that of preferred bidder virgin shares in northern rock fell today following a report in the sunday telegraph that virgins bid was in trouble after ally deutsche bank threatened to walk away from the deal how low can markets go and how should investors make decisions in light of all the subprime related uncertainty the journal says the nature of the securitized bad mortgages and their proliferation across global finances "murky hard to price debt instruments for which there is little or no demand" make it hard to figure out how deep the problems go "theres liquidity and buyers but the complexity of what theyre buying is so massive the derivatives so complex and since no regulatory intervention is telling banks to dump it and clean up their balance sheets that you have serious indigestion " thomas j barrack jr chairman and chief executive officer of colony capital tells the journal the bottom line the paper says is that "if you think it is time to start bottom fishing be prepared to ride it to deeper bottoms " also of note new york times deputy secretary of state john negroponte in baghdad after a week of meetings with iraqi provincial leaders said iraqi lawmakers must take advantage of the decline in daily violence in recent months to pass crucial legislation and improve basic government services and that if iraqs sharply divided parliament doesnt reach a consensus "in the near future" on matters that would improve the lives of iraqis it risked losing the gains in security that had come in part because of the increased number of american combat troops wall street journal a month before iowa holds the first contest of the presidential campaign a newly energized sen barack obama has opened a narrow lead there but many iowans in both parties say they could change their minds in the next days about which candidate to support mr obamas rising popularity was fueled by a fiery speech three weeks ago in which he vowed to turn away from the partisan battles of the clinton bush years that plus the
