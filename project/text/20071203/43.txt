investing in funds a monthly analysis winning funds share traits but the trick is finding them small investors have heard this advice over and over dont chase past returns but its hard not to partly because its unclear what else might predict success we decided to approach the problem from a different angle we analyzed some top performing funds just before they started a red hot run and figured out what they had in common that way investors could look for current funds that have those same traits to spot potential market beaters in the making we started by identifying a group of mutual funds with the longest winning streak against a well known measure eight straight years of beating the standard &amp poors stock index only u s stock funds made the cut out of eligible funds tracked by morningstar inc then we asked morningstar to crunch the funds data from as the streaks were set to begin finally we zeroed in on two subsets of funds first were seven large cap funds the ones most directly comparable with the s&amp p itself and the type typically at the core of an investors portfolio we also looked closely at the eight funds that had been started in nearly half of these specialize in midcap shares an increasingly popular category so what did those funds have in common many of them have benefited from broad investment mandates their managers have been able to move among different types of stocks including overseas holdings so theyve been able to weather ups and downs in any one category in addition many of the managers have brought deep experience to the table and for the most part they havent been out there alone many of the top funds have teams of managers instead of individuals which allows for specialization by the stock pickers along the way we also noticed something interesting about the sector funds on our list five of the seven focused on natural resources such as oil that were beaten down in but have boomed since the lesson be willing to invest in categories that have been out of favor since they may be due for a resurgence here then are the two subsets of funds we focused on the seven large caps american funds fundamental investors cambiar opportunity goldman sachs growth strategy hartford capital appreciation manning &amp napier pro blend maximum term series prudential financial inc s target growth allocation and t rowe price spectrum growth the class of comprises the cambiar goldman sachs and prudential funds as well as columbia acorn select z schneider small cap value j p morgan chase &amp co s undiscovered managers behavioral value valic ii mid cap value and wells fargo advantage mid cap disciplined now lets take a closer look at the common threads that tie those funds together roaming ability the seven large cap funds all gave managers lots of flexibility in choosing stocks which often provided a cushion against downturns in any one segment of the market for one thing all of the seven funds are classified by morningstar as "large blend " which means they can own various kinds of big stocks from companies with rapidly expanding earnings to beaten down diamonds in the rough these seven funds also tend to have "the latitude to delve into small and midcap stocks " says christine benz director of mutual fund analysis at morningstar this at times has been a big advantage because small and midsize stocks have outperformed bigger shares for much of this decade ms benz notes that some of the funds also have been big overseas shoppers so they have participated in heady foreign stock market rallies american funds fundamental for example recently had nearly of its money in overseas stocks another advantage several of the seven large blends are "funds of funds " meaning they invest in a range of mutual funds rather than individual securities managers of such funds can tilt their portfolio toward the most promising sectors by adjusting the allocations to the different funds "its sort of like a free asset allocation process " says edmund notzon chairman of the t rowe price asset allocation committee "our fund is probably more diversified than the equity funds most people would invest in " for instance the t rowe price fund was recently invested in nine company funds of widely varying type including an emerging markets fund the goldman sachs vehicle recently held in house funds including various bond offerings some financial advisers arent keen on funds that have wide mandates to move across stocks of different sizes because it can play havoc with their detailed asset allocation plans but for many do it yourself investors particularly those starting out and looking for diversification handing over this authority works out just fine experienced skippers most of the eight class of funds had managers who were senior executives at the firm running the portfolio rather than lower level managers getting their first taste of responsibility the managers didnt necessarily have long tenures at their fund firms but they had deep experience they also tended to have at least one manager with the chartered financial analyst designation a top level certification that focuses on investment research and analysis goldman sachs hired mark carhart away from the university of southern california where he was a finance professor and put him at the helm of the goldman fund when it started in shortly after he published an influential paper in the journal of finance moreover arnold c schneider iii manager of schneider small cap value was a standout at wellington management co before founding schneider capital management in he was a respected stock picker by the funds inception in although his portfolio suffered this year when some mortgage company bets soured you can find out about a managers experience in the funds prospectus and sometimes on the fund companys web site small size in general fund analysts and financial advisers say smaller funds tend to have an advantage over bigger ones because they require fewer winning stock picks to show outperformance in addition fund skippers have an easier time building up or exiting relatively large positions without affecting share prices adversely large blend funds had an average of &# billion in assets in just two of the large blend funds on our list were bigger one huge exception american funds fundamental investors of our funds it was the only one that topped &# billion of assets back in weighing in at nearly &# billion according to morningstar partly because of their top performance these funds today are generally all above average in size the american funds portfolio is now at &# billion the funds deal with their newfound girth in different ways american funds manages the fundamental investors fund in six pieces five are handled by portfolio "counselors" and the sixth by a group of about analysts the strategy minimizes the assets any one stock picker is responsible for still focusing on smaller funds poses a problem it can be harder to find investment commentary about them as analysts tend to focus on more widely held offerings some web sites such as yahoo finance let investors look up whos covering a fund others such as zacks investment research provide raw data about some funds low expenses think of an expense ratio as a hurdle that a manager has to clear each year before you earn anything on your investment most of the large blend funds had below average expense ratios in though many were close to the then average of of assets now up to and consider this at least two funds would have broken their winning streaks and missed our list if their annual expenses had been at the category average or higher buy and hold approach rapid fire trading of stocks can drive up transaction costs in a stock fund which can lead to higher capital gains tax bills for fund shareholders in the average large blend fund in morningstars overall database turned over of its stocks each year several of the large blend funds on our list came in comfortably under that level currently the average fund in morningstars large blend database turns over of its shares annually most of the seven large blend funds on our list continue to trade less frequently than their peers american funds fundamental for example turns over barely one in five stocks a year and the goldman sachs and manning &amp napier portfolios turn over just over half of theirs a focus on stocks fundamentals "allows us to maintain consistency over time " says michael magiera co manager of manning &amp napier pro blend max out of favor investments finally a piece of advice for sector fund investors people interested in these vehicles should consider looking at the funds track records but rather than hunting for funds that posted the best returns investors might be better off screening for those that did the worst buying into a sector fund that has had a run of bad years might provide better odds that the securities in the fund are undervalued for instance back in technology sector stocks were soaring and the s&amp p s total return of that year came on the back of tech era stars like dell inc tech stocks of course were poised to collapse not long afterward one of the worst categories of funds to own at the time was natural resources the average fund finished the year with a negative total return according to morningstar percentage points below the s&amp p yet natural resources funds were set to take off as a price war ended among some oil producers and asian economies recovered from a financial crisis these specialty funds are disproportionately represented on the list of because their run has been so spectacular if an investor wants to be contrarian today financial stocks may be the way to go some investment pros say joanna l ossinger contributed to this article ms badal is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in south
