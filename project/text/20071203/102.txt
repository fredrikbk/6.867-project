why dollar may be set for a rebound beating down the dollar has become a popular sport lately but the greenback may be about to get off the mat the dollars decline this year has been unrelenting it has fallen against the pound against the yen against the euro and against the canadian dollar against the federal reserves trade weighted basket of currencies the dollar has dropped for years most economists have viewed the dollar as an accident waiting to happen to finance its huge trade deficit the u s has been borrowing heavily from the rest of the world the thinking was that overseas savers eventually would tire of holding ever greater quantities of dollar based assets when theyd had enough the dollar would fall and so it has many economists think the dollar will weaken further maurice obstfeld of the university of california at berkeley and kenneth rogoff of harvard university calculated in that with the broadest measure of the u s trade deficit the current account running at more than of the nations economic output the dollar needed to fall as much as against the feds currency basket to bring the trade deficit back into balance a weaker dollar makes u s exports cheaper to foreigners and makes imports costlier for americans shrinking the trade gap as has been happening lately by that reckoning the dollar needs to drop an additional and the feds new openness to cutting interest rates if the textbooks are right should further weaken the currency as global investors flock to places with higher returns but currency markets are hard to forecast and there is a case to be made that the dollar could be near a bottom one argument comparing what a dollar now buys in the u s at u s prices and abroad at foreign prices suggests that the dollar is undervalued "you cant go to europe and not think its really expensive and a european cant come to the u s and not think its for sale " says brad setser an economist at the council on foreign relations the organization for economic cooperation and development calculates that &# converted into euros could buy a basket of goods and services in france that would cost only cents in the u s a dollar converted to yen would buy things that would cost cents in the u s over time markets are expected to narrow such gaps by pushing up the dollar and pulling down the euro and yen goldman sachs economist jim oneill says that by this measure the dollar hasnt been so undervalued against major currencies since "you dont get these degrees of misalignment for long " he says whats more the dollars weakness largely reflects forecasts the u s economy will slow substantially while the rest of the world perks up such divergence tends to weaken the dollar by making the u s a less attractive destination for investors it also raises expectations for lower u s interest rates thats one reason u s stocks have been among the worlds worst performers this year in october the international monetary fund predicted the u s economy would grow in while all "advanced economies" would grow that would make this the first year the u s economy has grown more slowly than its peers since since then the economic head winds have gotten stronger but global investors remain remarkably sanguine about the global outlook believing that other countries economic dependence on the u s has diminished a theory yet to be tested "to say that the rest of the world is immune to the u s slowdown is premature " says robert sinche head of global foreign exchange strategy at bank of america the euros strength against the dollar is in itself hurting european exporters ability to compete globally and that is an impediment to european growth says mr sinche in november the chief executive of european aircraft maker airbus tom enders called the dollars decline "life threatening " there are plenty of signs that the u s wont go down alone the british economy has slowed so much that the bank of england is at least thinking about cutting rates retail sales in japan are soft and the canadian dollar slipped for a while below parity with the u s on friday amid falling oil prices and talk of cut in canadian interest rates the u s dollar ended up buying canadian cents if economies outside the u s slow the u s may no longer seem like such a bad place for foreign investors to put their money especially given how much further a euro or yen will go in the u s than they do at home that could restrain the dollars fall more immediately troubled u s financial firms may need to sell foreign currency denominated assets to shore up their balance sheets before they close their books at year end repatriating that money will mean buying dollars and that could boost the currency meantime hedge funds and other speculative investors have placed heavy bets on the dollar continuing to lose ground against other currencies if the dollar starts to rise they will be forced to unwind those bets and the dollars rebound could be fierce see
