boss talk a special report advice to the boss on boards a corporate governance expert discusses how far directors have come and how far they still have to go when it comes to corporate governance richard koppes has seen the issue from all sides the year old earned a reputation as a shareholder activist during the late s and early s when he served as general counsel to the california public employees retirement system the biggest public pension fund in the u s mr koppes helped the fund push for more independence on boards more respect for shareholders and curbs on executive pay at one time publishing a "target list" of overpaid underperforming chief executives after leaving calpers in he got a look at the challenges of good governance from the inside as a director at apria healthcare group inc and valeant pharmaceuticals international at valeant formerly icn pharmaceuticals mr koppes and fellow directors took former ceo milan panic to court in to recoup a &# million bonus hed paid himself after spinning off a unit they won the suit last year now as a lawyer and governance specialist at jones day in san francisco mr koppes helps boards and management of companies like pfizer inc eastman kodak co mcdonalds corp and international business machines corp navigate a complex thicket of shareholder rights issues some recent ones "say on pay " where shareholders get an advisory vote on executive pay "majority voting " where directors are elected by a majority of votes cast rather than a plurality and "proxy access " which would let shareholders put their own director candidates on the proxy ballot mr koppes talked to the wall street journal about what boards are doing right what they still need work on and the hot button issue of executive pay some excerpts follow the wall street journal where are we now in the struggle to make boards more responsive to shareholders mr koppes the good news is that weve made a lot of progress in the years that ive been involved with this boards have become quite empowered in the past few years by and large directors understand their roles and are trying to do the right thing i think u s boards are in some regards ahead of many other boards in the world but as far as best practices in corporate governance were beginning to slip behind some european countries the corporate governance triangle is basically the board at the top management on one side and shareholders on the other for many years the relationship was lopsided ten years ago management had pretty much all the power the dramatic change has been the empowerment of the board but as far as giving equal power or weight or respect to the third part of the triangle which is the shareholders we still have a ways to go were still defining what the role and power of the shareholder will be particularly the large long term owners wsj why have boards become empowered mr koppes i think its a variety of factors our country expects directors to do a better job at the same time people who are on boards today understand that this is a job its more than an honor thats why boards have complained about finding directors because people say "well it takes time i want to do a good job my reputations at stake " you get a lot more "nos " but frankly its a good challenge boards have to broaden their net for candidates one thing that has kept a lot of people out of boards including women and minorities is prior board service its a term i hate "does the person have prior board service have they been through the club " well the club needs to be expanded wsj can a board get too independent mr koppes i think that it could go off on its own im not a fan of boards with large independent staff i think that creates another bureaucracy that might war with the management bureaucracy but you should have good independent advisers and maybe some independent consultants "too independent" might also mean that boards wander into micromanagement they start doing the job of management the audit committee chair starts doing the cfos work wsj it sounds like a tough balancing act directors have to be more independent and assertive but shouldnt interfere with management of the company mr koppes the strong independent board how it operates and how it functions is a fairly recent phenomenon that all sides are still wrestling with meanwhile youve got the shareholders out there they want to run their own candidates they want to have their own views they want to meet with the directors and the directors are going "oh my god " wsj do you think the chairman of the board should be separate from the ceo mr koppes im a strong supporter of independent chairs but more and more today with the independence of boards and their empowerent it almost doesnt make a difference one of the most powerful reforms has been the executive session where independent directors meet without the ceo the conversations are so different wsj what are the burning governance issues mr koppes executive pay its the biggest issue for boards right now how to get ahold of it properly and how to deal with it in a responsible manner i also think that more and more boards and management understand that if they dont get ahold of this then congress will step in and no one wants that wsj what makes executive pay so hard to deal with mr koppes one to get your arms around it in a responsible manner and then to bring it under control if it needs to be brought under control and to say "no" sometimes the boards im aware of are beginning to get their arms around it the new sec disclosure rule is helping because its about laying out a tally sheet that shows total compensation its allowing boards to say "we cant be embarrassed " theres nothing like a little sunshine but as for saying "no" id say the jurys out its so hard to withdraw certain things you can certainly prune back some of the perks and some of the things that are added its hard because boards dont want to screw it up if theyre too strict on pay they may have people leave and what happens if good managers leave and a company goes down that doesnt excuse directors from not acting but they want to do the right thing to retain to recruit to motivate because in the end youve got to have good management to run these companies the other thing is frankly were still dealing with the old culture of not asking critical questions of being too nice in the boardroom that is fading fairly fast but its still there wsj what do you think of the move to let shareholders have an advisory vote on executive pay mr koppes the issue is how do shareholders responsibly vote on that thats the key question and thats what troubles me i know "say on pay" is very fashionable i know the u k does it i know a lot of my shareholder friends are in love with it but it makes me pause because im not sure what kind of information and resources shareholders have the big shareholders like calpers will have people that will study companies pay policies but there are a whole lot of institutions that just dont want to spend the money so they will default to proxy advisers or the smaller shareholders will just vote "no" because they dont like big salaries people say "well its only advisory " but any board that gets over a "no" vote on their pay proposals itd be very difficult for them to ignore that wsj so what is the appropriate role of shareholders in executive pay mr koppes electing good independent directors and having an input in that i do support some kind of proxy access for shareholders in nominating directors or consultation with the shareholders on who should be on the board but beyond that i think they ought to get out of the way there can be shareholder proposals saying "we want pay to have a performance link " thats fair but if shareholders start drawing up the plans or start indicating specific plans im not sure thats their role if they dont like whats going on they should change the board in the u k and a number of countries overseas a minority of shareholders can call a special meeting to throw the board out or throw certain board members off thats a right that ought to exist here wsj do you think shareholders should push boards on social responsibility issues mr koppes yes environmental issues affect the bottom line and how youre perceived as an employer youre going to see more and more boards moving into that area there are already companies that have public policy committees or corporate responsibility committees i see that as a growing role for the board to hear the concerns of the shareholders and then to work with management on these issues from the outside wsj how can the board work better with shareholders on these things mr koppes by not treating them as your enemy by talking to them treating them as equals theres this view that anyone that asks a question or challenges is a bad guy there are a fair number of advisers to boards and management that are either the "lets go to war " type or the chicken littles "the world is coming to an end if we let those people in " wsj what would you advise boards to do to reach out to shareholders mr koppes ask the larger shareholders "do you have any issues that you would like to talk to the board about " stop hiding the director wsj any other advice mr koppes boards need to get comfortable on accepting differences of opinion in the boardroom everything doesnt have to be a consensus sometimes youll have one or two votes against the majority and theres nothing wrong with that obviously if youve got a large minority of "no" votes youve got to think about what youre doing wsj how will boards know when theyve gotten governance right mr koppes when will this issue go away laughs im sure many of my friends in corporate america think that theyve had enough and they want a breather its a little pollyannaish but maybe when all three sides of the corporate governance triangle are truly equal i think the boards there managements really never had that problem of power im not sure were there yet with the shareholders theres still work to be done ms dvorak is a staff reporter in the wall street journals san francisco bureau she can be reached at phred dvorak wsj com
