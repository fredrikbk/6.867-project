microsoft adobe set a collision course on web microsoft corp and adobe inc are on a collision course as they seek to dominate a new kind of software that will change how personal computers and the web work together the companies have been partners in the past and adobe is one of the largest makers of software for computers running microsofts windows operating system the companies have also tussled before but they have generally stayed in their corners of the tech arena today though each company plans to introduce software that falls squarely on the others turf and sets the stage for a broader battle over how internet services and software will be built in the future both want to be the key supplier of cutting edge software that handles functions like video and animation on the web microsoft today plans to roll out a test version of its silverlight software that can be used to build advanced programs that run on the web thats an area adobe has dominated with products like its flash software for web animation and video adobe meanwhile plans to preview new software called the adobe media player a free program that will let people play videos on their personal computers which is the domain of microsofts windows media player among others adobe is also readying technology code named apollo that will enable companies to build flash programs that will be installed on a pc but pull information from the web the two companies new programs will help web sites handle video animation and other features more dynamically than they can today major league baseball for instance plans to use microsofts silverlight to add real time scoring statistics and other interactive features to the or so live baseball games it streams over the internet daily company executives say online auctioneer ebay inc is working on a program based on adobes apollo that will let users buy and sell items more efficiently the program expected within a few weeks will be connected to the web so that it can constantly update data it will also let users store several weeks of search results on their pc hard drives and quickly thumb through items for sale in one window without having to page back and forth in a web browser "the future battle lines are going to be drawn between microsoft and adobe in this space " says chris swenson an analyst at npd group a research firm the market for this kind of "digital content creation" technology grew to &# billion in from &# billion the previous year according to research firm jon peddie research adobes new software gives the company a chance to bring in new revenue while computer users can download adobes flash player free of charge adobe sells the software used to build the online services and software that are based on flash microsofts move is a new chapter in a long history of defending the companys crown jewels the operating systems that have been the foundations for other programs to run on windows has long been microsofts largest source of revenue and profit and the cornerstone of most of its other software over the years when any company challenged microsofts operating system the software giant threw its full weight into fending off the interloper ten years ago that rival was sun microsystems inc with java a programming language for writing software that could run outside of windows another rival was netscape whose web browser presented a threat that microsoft eventually batted down with its own browser now adobes flash is becoming a foundation for internet applications that wont necessarily work only with windows pcs microsoft is "afraid that adobe is going to start convincing corporate developers to use flash to start developing web applications " says greg demichillie an analyst at the research firm directions on microsoft "its the java threat but with better technology " microsoft will still promote online services that are tightly tied to the windows operating system but increasingly the company realizes that it has to build software thats compatible with other operating systems too says microsoft senior vice president bob muglia "if we dont come out there and provide innovation for customers somebody else will " at the center of the battle is an evolution in how software interacts with the internet historically software developers built programs installed on computers while web designers created web sites adobes flash was first rolled out in but it posed little threat to microsoft because web designers mostly used it to display crude video and animation in recent years however the line between software and the web has blurred with the emergence of internet services like video site youtube these services accomplish software like tasks online using flash and other new tools including adobes flex and they work through back and forth communication between the users pc and a server a remote computer that stores data from the web site when a user interacts with these online services software on the server handles most of the work while the pc software does very little now thats changing as a new crop of programs including the ones to be previewed today by microsoft and adobe act as a hybrid of traditional software and online services they can be installed on a computer and tap its resources such as graphics or video acceleration chips giving them more advanced features or improving their performance but they also constantly pull data from the internet the new apollo technology will let makers of software and online services use flash to build other computer based programs that pull information from the internet one example the adobe media player built using apollo which will let users view their favorite online videos alongside those already stored on their computers people will also be able to rate and comment on videos inside the player and tv studios and others will be able to embed advertisements in the videos and change the way the player looks to reflect their own brand microsofts silverlight meanwhile is similar to flash its a piece of software that when downloaded onto a computer lets people view web sites with advanced features microsoft executives tout such silverlight features similar to those already available from adobe as the ability to add overlays like ads and other visuals to videos major league baseball for instance may use that function to add features to streaming videos of its live games that create the feeling of actually being in the stadium says justin schaffer senior vice president of new media at major league baseball advanced media to help companies build such features microsoft has also built a set of software tools called expression studio designed to compete with adobes recently launched creative suite microsoft is also trying to match another flash advantage by allowing silverlight to work with apple computers and non microsoft browsers such as safari and firefox flash programs already run on both apple and windows operating systems and multiple browsers microsoft faces an uphill battle flash is already standard technology on millions of web sites and as adobe improves its flash related software using technology like apollo it could pull software developers attention and budgets away from windows related software "my perception is that adobes ahead here theyve had flash out theyve had flex out theyve had the tools to support rich internet development " says max mancini senior director of platform and innovation at ebay "im sure microsoft will catch up and when it does well look at it "
