boss talk a special report and theyre off the ceo of churchill downs is betting that horse racing can pull out of its slump its just a question of packaging a year ago the typical morning for robert l evans included jeans and a work shirt which he wore outside on his acre commercial horse breeding farm in versailles ky as he counted the foals and figured out if any horses were born during the night now the year old mr evans hops into his white pickup truck for the hourlong drive to louisville where he is in his ninth month as president and chief executive of churchill downs inc the owner of four horse racing tracks across the u s its famous twin spired namesake will hold the rd kentucky derby on may but the real drama is whether mr evans can find a way to pull horse racing out of its long slump last year total wagering on thoroughbred races in the u s rose just to &# billion according to the national thoroughbred racing association and equibase co gamblers are abandoning racetracks for lotteries casinos and increasingly internet wagering services that are based offshore so they can avoid u s and state regulation "someones got to change things in a big way " mr evans says drawing on a career that includes top jobs in heavy equipment and auto manufacturing business consulting and private equity mr evans is pushing churchill downs to embrace technology and repackage its core product of horse racing but strong traditions will endure he insists including the frilly hats worn by women on derby day "we spent a day in new orleans this past weekend looking for hats " mr evans says of his wife "and she is in dallas right now at our place there looking for hats so there is a huge amount of pressure on this hat thing " here are excerpts from a recent conversation with mr evans at his office at the churchill downs racetrack wsj as you spent your first few months here getting to know churchill downs is there anything that you learned that you had not expected mr evans the thing that has struck me about the company and the industry is that it sees its future in a very limited sense maybe ill see it that way too five or years hence well try to make progress maybe we wont but it seems like the perspective on the future was very limiting almost not a lot of growth opportunities left for the company or the industry a lot of external pressures on this business that are mostly unfavorable not a great sense of optimism about where it could go wsj why has growth been so hard to come by in recent years in the horse racing business mr evans weve become increasingly less interesting to customers weve stayed the same and they have a whole bunch of additional things that they can spend their money on thats one way to look at it or we can just say weve let our product slowly deteriorate clearly we are less interesting than we were years ago wsj youve noted that poker blackjack and even ballroom dancing have found new life on television and the internet are there analogous sparks for a horse racing renaissance mr evans i think so and ive been meeting with a lot of television production companies kind of saying what could you do for horse racing i think the core dimension in all of that is they play the game differently with ballroom dancing someone said lets make it a story about the people and lets make it competitive lets bring very different types of competitors to it people who are kind of everyday people but people that you know the celebrity side of it lets score them and let the public participate in evaluating their performance lets let them look stupid sometimes poker has been around forever but theyve repackaged the way the game is played i think weve got to do that weve got to find a way to make horse racing a different game to play the outcome still is based on which horse goes around the track the fastest i dont think we want to change that piece but there are lots of different ways we could play that game the way you play today is you make a parimutuel wager and if you win you get some money are there other ways we can play that game if you look outside the u s you see people doing it wsj like what mr evans theres a game in europe called v its a lottery in effect but its based on the outcome of seven horse races in sweden theres a huge hit game called harry boy with a little animated character now starring in his own commercials but its a game that gets played based upon the outcome of a horse race with some of the dimensions of a lottery the prize size is exceptionally large sort of a life changing prize if you win it its something you can chitchat about once in a while if you dont have anything else to talk about its still horse racing but theyve repackaged it and remarketed it in a different way and its become quite popular and successful wsj are there other things that need to be done to lure younger consumers mr evans we want to explore all the other ways you might be able to use technology in addition to taking wagers to make it more interesting to people a couple of ideas a much higher degree of personalization a much higher degree of social networking if you go out here and watch people in person what youll see is a couple of buddies talking theyre picking some horses they like for this bet its a &# bet a pick six bet we split it why cant i let that same type of transaction take place online wsj horse racing on your hand held device your cellphone interactive games the technology is there can all those things be accomplished easily with the right vision and execution mr evans i dont know were kind of moving on all different fronts will they all pan out not a chance the ones that get more traction well feed more people and money to the ones that arent succeeding lets pull back a little bit and redeploy those resources somewhere else wsj how do you trigger a cultural shift mr evans in some cases you have to just tell people its ok to fail with no growth and a tough business to make a profit in you arent going to find a whole bunch of folks who want to take chances in that environment and part of succeeding is you have to go do enough things to fail a few times it helps to get some outside perspective so weve added some people who arent horse racing types wsj how important is the addition of slot machines at horse racing tracks to the industrys future mr evans ive got two answers to this one answer is that if we cant make horse racing interesting and a profitable viable growing business then we should stop racing regardless of whether we can subsidize it with slot machines the other part of it is that we are in the business of entertaining customers and one of the things people like to do is gamble so if im going to compete against someone who is going after that same consumer dollar i want to have the same chance to compete who could argue with that other than someone trying to protect their position and keep others away artificially with legislation regulation or whatever wsj one challenge you have to deal with is traditionalists who complain that everything were talking about slot machines sponsorships simulcasts new ideas somehow ruins horse racing what do you say to that mr evans let the customer decide there are tracks keeneland is one another is saratoga that attract customers because of this unbelievable sense of tradition and history and beauty of their facilities and the whole environment that they create if theres a market for that then great but i think theres also a market for when you come here on derby day and its a raucous party happening thing obviously a bunch of people show up for that too we may get to a world where there are different types of racing experiences for different types of people wsj since late the company has sold three of its seven tracks why mr evans if youre going to be successful youve got to make your product unique as we sit here right now we put on about races a year and thats with four tracks so figure another races if we had three more tracks theres just no way to make that special on the betting side we have to figure out ways to make our products stand out were going to struggle to do it for races my view is there isnt a market for races a year so we have to figure out how to do some triage on our find the ones that are the most important and make those really pop in the market so that people that are betting electronically at in the afternoon will choose us its a much different form of competition than what people have been used to wsj how do you expect your new tv deal to be better for churchill downs over time mr evans in the longer run i think its a vehicle we can use to try different things with television let me give you one simple illustration theres some technology today that in effect embeds radio frequency identification or rfid technology in the saddle blanket of a horse and therefore i can track a horses position all the way around a track during the race or during training i can then use that tracking data to compute various forms of information like how fast did the horse accelerate coming out of the turn where was the horse positioned and so on in the last winter olympics the first skier in the downhill would go and then theyd compare it on the screen to the second skier so you could see who was doing better imagine a digitized representation of a race where instead of looking at paper past performances i could actually compare two horses digitally based upon their previous performances maybe i can do that with my races but other people cant wsj what is it about horses that captivates you or interests you mr evans if im just walking around the farm i pay attention to these silly horses that are running around out there in the fields and i like them but i dont have a reason why and ive noticed other people even kids who have never seen a horse except maybe on television theyre captivated by them too horses seem to have a level of connection with people maybe because they were our servants for so many years and a form of transportation for whatever reason theres magic between humans and horses mr brooks
