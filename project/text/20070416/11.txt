boss talk a special report hot kohls ceo larry montgomery sees the middle market as a retailing sweet spot in retailing much of the buzz has been about stores on the high and low ends of the market tony department stores like saks inc have been sharing the spotlight with target corp which has garnered attention by offering designer items at bargain prices but larry montgomery chairman and chief executive officer of kohls corp sits in the middle and sees a big opportunity to snag more customers the chain has long held solid appeal to the soccer mom seeking midtier brands such as vf corp s lee and liz claiborne inc s villager label at a bargain now mr montgomery is focusing on broadening his stores appeal by signing trendy or fashion forward names such as vera wang elle magazine skateboard icon tony hawk and the food network to design exclusive lines for kohls mr montgomery credits lines such as these with giving a significant boost to profits in its latest fiscal year ended feb kohls net income jumped to &# billion the year old mr montgomery who joined kohls in as a senior vice president after stints at traditional department stores discussed the growth potential he sees in the middle market and what retailers need to do to attract shoppers excerpts follow the wall street journal why go after the middle market customer now mr montgomery on the lower end target has done a great job of owning that discount business meanwhile a lot of the traditional department stores have spent the last five or six years in a consolidation mode and the better guys like nordstrom and neiman marcus group have just done a great job with content on a much higher level it has created a huge opportunity for us our locations have made us the neighborhood guy being located in strip centers and power centers shopping hubs that have a grocery store and national retailers it is much more convenient for the customer to come and shop for their family and their home with us than ever before wsj who is this new customer that you are going after mr montgomery we still appeal to a family oriented soccer mom the two income family with kids at home but now with the likes of trendy shoe line candies and what is happening with elle and some of that stuff we are appealing to a younger customer professionals before they become soccer moms with the likes of chaps by ralph lauren and vera wang we are appealing to a customer that is probably post soccer mom wsj how do you go after the new customer without alienating your core customer mr montgomery we have had absolutely no resistance to "better" and "best" price points the customer wants the quality wants the fashion and wants the contemporary and updated styling but they want to make sure that we are keeping the value equation there by keeping prices below typical department store levels wsj youve done well so far in this competitive middle ground what are some of the factors that you feel brought out this result mr montgomery we are getting a much bigger punch out of our inventory by stocking items that appeal to a range of customers who have different priorities in terms of style and price every time we introduce a new line or every time we try a new advertising campaign we go out and we talk to the customer what was the awareness of that line or that campaign how did they respond to it what did they think about it and more importantly how did they buy it wsj how important has it become for stores like yours to have labels like vera wang mr montgomery whether it is chaps or elle or vera these are national brands that have a lot of recognition and the only place that you can find them is at kohls so i think the credibility is built in there target has done a great job with some of these designers they bring in for a season we are focused a couple of ticks above target and we are going after that traditional department store person our research tells us they are interested in fashion they are interested in better quality but they really enjoy the value that they get when they come to our stores and they really enjoy the convenience wsj would you ever decide to go up market mr montgomery if you look at whats going on with just the introduction of vera you can construe that as going up market the price points are going to be the highest we have had the fashion ability is going to be as high as it has ever been and she is working with our people to personally design this stuff we are pretty excited about it wsj along with the up market merchandise youve also focused on improving the shopping experience how important is that mr montgomery the convenience aspect of our content is a key piece in october we opened up a number of "innovation" stores we started with the whole look of the building we put some windows up front created a bigger opening and brought more light in we have seating outside we have music coming outside when you come in to the store we created a merchandising area for lines like candies and chaps and tony hawk the feedback on that since the stores have opened in october has been tremendous from a fixture point of view we are much more upscale than we have been in the past the lighting is a little different weve created a bank of fitting rooms that probably is as nice as you are going to find certainly in any moderate department store wsj what is your strategy of getting designers in the future are you planning to do more deals like the one you have with vera wang mr montgomery yes i think we have a pretty good track record with that as we see what the receptivity is to vera over the next several seasons it will give us encouragement to try and complement that it may be an updated or another classic brand instead of another contemporary brand wsj how important is the online customer for you mr montgomery our online business is running a huge increase and one of the things that we found is that people that shop online actually buy more in the store too our original reason for establishing our internet business was with the circulation of newspapers that we advertise in going down there are a lot of people getting their information on the internet we are going to have the full store online this fall we have a new platform coming up to make shopping and browsing and checking out easier and thats all going to be in place by this fall wsj do you intend to continue to build stores at the same rate mr montgomery our game plan was to have stores by thats averaging about a year for five years we have going up this year next year the number is going to be about by we are going to be at about &# billion to &# billion with net income approaching &# billion wsj would you go overseas mr montgomery we are looking beyond the u s but i cant comment on that it is going to be a few years we have got three to four strong years of building stores a year in the u s we are very focused on what is going on
