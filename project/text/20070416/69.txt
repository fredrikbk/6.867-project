sec reviews fund governance fees washington mutual fund fees and disclosure will get close scrutiny this year by the securities and exchange commission which also plans to finalize a longstanding plan to require mutual funds to have independent chairmen the regulators chairman said in an address friday to a mutual fund directors forum meeting sec chairman christopher cox said the agency intends to reissue and finalize a fund governance rule this year paying close heed to federal administrative procedures he said the agency is analyzing public comments on its proposal to require of fund directors including the chairman to be free from any ties to the fund management company the fund governance rule first floated by the sec under then chairman william donaldson in was twice challenged by the u s chamber of commerce and twice rejected by a federal appeals court which faulted the sec for failing to seek public comment on the rules cost and benefits the sec released cost benefit studies in december and now is sifting through comments it received mr cox said another priority for the sec is the re examination of so called b fees which mutual funds may charge to cover fund marketing and distribution expenses the sec gave the green light to such fees in when the fund industry was in danger of shrinking with the expectation that they would be used temporarily to attract new investors thus helping to spread costs among a larger pool of fund investors "the original premise of b seems highly suspect in todays world " mr cox told fund directors the booming fund industry doesnt appear to be in danger of contracting and some funds may have gotten so big that theyve lost the ability to be nimble he noted many funds continue to levy b fees even after closing to new customers "everythings on the table " including a possible repeal of such fees mr cox told reporters after his prepared remarks the sec also will hold public meetings and suggest ways on how to clearly spell out fund fees investment objectives and risks he said the push to improve disclosure will include funds offered through employer sponsored retirement savings plans including k plans which likely will require tandem action by the u s labor department he said changes should "purge all of the legalese" and "gobbledygook" from mutual fund documents and replace them with plain english
