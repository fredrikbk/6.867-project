viral marketing questions on efficacy cloud a cancer vaccine merck predicts big fall in cervical lesions but data are complex when merck &amp co introduced its new vaccine against cervical cancer last june it gave it one of the biggest pushes any new medicine has received the company lobbied dozens of states to make the vaccine mandatory for and year old girls it aired tv ads featuring young girls skipping rope while reciting the slogan "i want to be one less" woman to battle the disease the campaign scored some big victories the centers for disease control and prevention declared all women age to should get the vaccine called gardasil texas and virginia passed mandatory vaccination laws for girls entering the sixth grade even after merck halted its lobbying in february amid criticism an organization backed by the company continues to push for similar laws and about states are considering them the vaccine costs &# for a three shot regimen but behind the scenes gardasil has been dogged by uncertainty about how effective it really is merck won approval for the vaccine based on research that showed it protected against two strains of the human papillomavirus known as hpv and that are thought to cause of cervical cancer cases the food and drug administration didnt ask its panel of experts advising on gardasil to rule on whether the vaccine specifically prevented the cancer itself in clinical trials of women who received at least one shot of gardasil went on to develop precancerous lesions on their cervixes within three years of vaccination just fewer than in a placebo control group scott emerson a professor of biostatistics at the university of washington who sat on the fda advisory committee says hes not persuaded the vaccine is worth the billions of dollars likely to be spent on it in coming years "i do believe that gardasil protects against hpv and but the effect it will have on cervical cancer rates in this country is another question entirely " says dr emerson "there is a leap of faith involved " merck says the figure is misleading because more than a quarter of the women in the study were already infected with hpv before receiving the vaccine blunting its effect gardasil isnt designed to treat those with pre existing infection the company prefers to point to a subset of trial participants who were mostly free of hpv when they were vaccinated only of these women went on to develop precancerous lesions on their cervixes over the next three years fewer than among the placebo group merck says this smaller group of women is the one most representative of the and year old girls for whom texas and virginia have required vaccination safety is another issue merck tested the vaccine in only a few hundred and year old girls some doctors consider that number too small to declare the vaccine safe for preteen girls given the big changes their bodies undergo in its approval letter the fda ordered merck to follow "a sufficient number of children years of age" in a large postmarketing study to further establish the vaccines safety that study wont be completed until norman baylor the director of the office of vaccines research and review at the fda says its common for the agency to recommend postmarketing studies for vaccines and the fda considers gardasil safe the company says it complied with the fdas request that the clinical trials include more than to year olds it adds that it didnt test gardasil more widely on girls because it wanted to focus on sexually active women to demonstrate the vaccines efficacy so far merck has distributed more than four million doses of the vaccine in the u s and the cdc says adverse events have been mostly minor and within the normal range eliav barr the head of mercks hpv vaccine program says gardasil is a "lifesaving" vaccine and its widespread adoption will result in "a substantial decline in the rate of cervical cancer " dr barr says merck provided "an extremely strong dossier" on gardasil that both the fda and the cdc have deemed satisfactory merck has a lot riding on gardasil it faces patent expirations on other best sellers and legal costs related to vioxx the withdrawn painkiller linked to heart attacks and strokes some analysts believe gardasils annual sales could reach &# billion or more by work on a cervical cancer vaccine goes back nearly two decades after scientists discovered that hpv infection can trigger lesions of the cervix that eventually turn into cancer in the early to mid s merck licensed patents held by the national cancer institute and csl ltd of australia and began work on commercializing the vaccine from the start merck faced a challenge in winning acceptance of the vaccine as a universal necessity for american women though common in developing nations cervical cancer is a relatively rare disease in the u s accounting for about of cancer diagnoses and deaths each year women already have a highly effective method of prevention visiting a gynecologist for regular pap tests the low tech exam has contributed to an reduction in cervical cancer deaths in the u s over the past years human studies of the present version of the vaccine which also targets two hpv strains that cause genital warts began in the vaccine was administered to more than women it is delivered in three injections over six months merck submitted gardasil to the fda for approval in a meeting of the fda advisory panel that reviewed gardasil in may gave the first hint of mercks troubles in persuading doctors of gardasils real world efficacy in its presentation merck stressed the vaccines nearly effectiveness in blocking infection by hpv and and in preventing precancerous lesions caused by those two strains but a document prepared for the committee by an fda reviewer noted the vaccines limited overall efficacy against precancerous lesions in the broader group of nearly trial participants dr emerson the university of washington professor expressed concern that merck wasnt putting enough emphasis on the question of whether the vaccine prevented cervical cancer "its almost the treating the symptom but not the disease sort of idea " he said according to a transcript of the meeting merck pointed to the confounding factors behind the lower efficacy rates including the problem of women who came into the trial already infected in an interview mercks dr barr says gardasils true efficacy will become more apparent with time particularly in the group that includes women with a pre existing infection while merck often states that gardasil prevents infection with viruses that account for of cervical cancer cases dr barr concedes that the vaccine is less than effective against precancerous lesions merck says this is because the hpv strains not covered by gardasil cause disproportionately more precancerous lesions that dont end up turning into cancer efficacy against lesions is a significant issue because after a pap test doctors generally remove any lesions that reach a certain grade of seriousness even though some might not turn into cancer the surgery involves cutting out part of the cervix and can cost several hundred to several thousand dollars dr barr predicts gardasil will eventually be shown to prevent nearly of precancerous lesions that doctors would want to remove among women who were free of hpv infection when they were vaccinated ultimately gardasil received the panels unanimous approval and the fda approved the vaccine in june the agency reasoned that waiting for more data would prevent some women who needed the vaccine from getting it with the fdas approval merck faced a new challenge persuading the public to take its vaccine it got a quick boost from the cdc which issued guidance in late june recommending that all girls receive the vaccine at age or the cdc said women age to should also get the vaccine gardasil was also endorsed by the american academy of pediatrics merck crafted its advertising and public relations to avoid some of the less favorable numbers surrounding gardasil the tv commercial says the vaccine "may help protect you" from hpv strains "that may cause of cervical cancer " the company doesnt often discuss the lower efficacy against precancerous lesions or in populations where some women are already infected the "one less" slogan avoids the question of how many lives will be saved some gardasil supporters funded by merck are less careful about qualifying their claims at the fda advisory committee hearing martha nolan vice president of a womens health group that receives funds from merck said that by approving gardasil the agency had "the opportunity to eradicate this terrible disease " after the fda approval a group of female state legislators called women in government started a campaign to get states to mandate vaccinations the group receives money from merck but wont say how much many of the pending bills would allow parents to keep their children out of the vaccination program but only after submitting proof that they have received information about cervical cancer and the vaccine in early january women in government held a conference for some state legislators in marco island fla paying for their airfare and hotel rooms one of the speakers was christine baze a pop singer and cervical cancer survivor as she performed songs on the piano ms baze told the story of her battle with the disease and said she wished a vaccine had been available to her ms baze says women in government paid her a &# fee and covered her travel and lodging she says she didnt receive any money from merck for the appearance but the company has paid her &# to speak at three other events marilyn canavan a representative in the maine assembly who attended the conference says she was bothered by the large number of drug industry lobbyists she saw a list of conference participants shows that pharmaceutical industry representatives were present one for every two state legislators merck had two representatives there ms canavan has since resigned her post as women in governments director in maine over concerns that the groups agenda is being dictated by drug companies susan crosby women in governments president says those concerns are unfounded other state lawmakers came away from the conference inspired upon returning home jessica sibley upshaw a representative in the mississippi assembly drafted a bill that would make vaccination a school requirement "for me its a common sense thing to do if we can eradicate a disease " she says ms upshaws bill has since died but she plans to reintroduce it in february texas gov rick perry bypassed the state legislature and issued an executive order mandating that all girls entering the sixth grade be vaccinated as of september one of mercks lobbyists in texas is mike toomey gov perrys former chief of staff and merck contributed &# to the governors re election campaign mr toomey didnt return calls and emails seeking comment a spokeswoman for the governor says he acted to protect the publics health not because of the contribution or the lobbying of his former aide gov perrys order sparked an uproar among the opponents are religious conservatives who say receiving the vaccine conflicts with their message of abstinence other opponents say gardasil isnt worth the cost which includes &# for the vaccine and up to several hundred dollars more for three doctors appointments to get the shots the money would be better spent these people say in pushing pap tests for women who arent getting them now john schiller one of the national cancer institute scientists whose vaccine work was licensed by merck believes gardasil is an important advance that should receive wide use but he has mixed feelings about the way the company has promoted it he hopes it wont divert public health dollars away from regular pap screening which he says remains the most important weapon against cervical cancer merck "is a heavy handed company " dr schiller says "when they do something they spare no energy its the merck way or the highway " merck says cost effectiveness studies suggest the vaccine could deliver its life saving benefits at a reasonable cost in part by reducing the need for frequent pap tests most of these studies have been funded by merck and glaxosmithkline plc maker of another hpv vaccine cervarix glaxo applied for fda approval of cervarix last month one skeptic is diane harper a longtime hpv researcher and professor at dartmouth medical school who was involved in gardasils clinical trials and has received speaker and consulting fees from merck and glaxo she says as many as of and year old girls may already have hpv either from sexual activity sexual abuse or transmission through nonsexual skin to skin contact that could reduce the vaccines efficacy she says dr harper also suspects the vaccine may require booster shots after years merck says its not sure how long the vaccines protection will last and is monitoring women over the long term to find out the american cancer society while agreeing with the cdc that girls should be vaccinated said in january there is "insufficient evidence" that women age to will benefit from the vaccine because many have already been exposed to hpv worried about the backlash that emerged in february in texas and other states merck shifted into damage control richard haupt mercks executive director of medical affairs placed calls to respected figures in the vaccine field including jon abramson the chairman of the cdcs advisory committee on immunization practices and joseph bocchini chairman of the committee on infectious diseases at the american academy of pediatrics both men and others told dr haupt they supported the vaccine but it was too early and counterproductive to push for school requirements on feb merck announced that it was suspending its lobbying push but women in government continues to lobby for school requirements virginias mandate became law two weeks ago
