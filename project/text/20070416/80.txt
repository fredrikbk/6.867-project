sign up for the e mail here moqtada al sadr the anti u s iraqi cleric whose bluster sometimes outstrips his bite has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the iraqi government the six cabinet ministers he controls today the head of mr sadrs parliamentary caucus said they will actually quit mr sadr claims the allegiance of members in the seat parliament who have no plans to leave and the importance of his support for the government of prime minister nouri al maliki was underlined by his control of six out of cabinet posts including influence over key ministries while mr sadrs own whereabouts havent been publicly known since the latest u s iraqi crackdown in baghdad began in february those who speak for the shiite leader have been increasingly vocal in their calls for a u s withdrawal and a government break with the "u s occupiers " last week tens of thousands of iraqis demonstrated against the u s on the fourth anniversary of baghdads fall and nassar al rubaie the head of mr sadrs parliamentary bloc told reporters in the green zone today that the cabinet ministers withdrawal came because mr maliki didnt respond to the demands made at those demonstrations the associated press reports at the same time the militia controlled by mr sadr the mahdi army has shown a renewed willingness to fight though it yielded control of most shiite territory in baghdad to the new u s iraqi security effort mahdi militiamen clashed with u s and iraqi troops for more than a week this month in the southern city of diwaniya prompting the american military to move a stryker unit there from baghdad the new york times reported over the weekend when u s forces arrested three of mr sadrs followers there his supporters blocked the american vehicles from leaving and the three men were released witnesses told the times this happened at roughly the same time an essentially sunni umbrella insurgent group that includes al qaeda in iraq was claiming responsibility for last weeks suicide bombings at the iraqi parliament timing that highlights how the u s has faced militant opposition on at least two fronts since mr sadrs followers first staged an uprising nearly three years ago while the u s iraqi security operation in baghdad has been picking up steam sectarian strife seems to be increasing elsewhere in the country as the wall street journal reports the crackdown has forced some militants both sunnis and shiites to flee the capital and "stir up trouble in other places where they can operate undisturbed " the journal says still the violence in baghdad continues to rage at horrifying levels at least people were killed in car bombings suicide vest attacks and other assaults in the capital yesterday the times reports including a twin bombing in a predominately shiite district that killed at least people half of whom were women and children also yesterday the u s military announced the deaths of two soldiers and a marine who were killed in separate incidents bush administration officials and supporters of the "surge" plan now underway stress that the increased u s military presence in iraq is aimed at tamping down the violence enough to let political reconciliation build momentum as newsweek reports mr sadrs presence in the government and his opposition to a proposed relaxation of de baathification laws seemed to work against reconciliation and the u s may welcome the departure of his followers from the cabinet if it does indeed take place but mr sadrs past actions however principled in theme have often seemed calculated toward increasing his influence both in the green zone and on iraqi streets todays news suggests mr maliki the face of white house aspirations in baghdad will either lose all backing from a man who holds more street credibility than he does or become more beholden to him sallie mae under fire agrees to a sale sallie mae the embattled u s education loan leader formally known as slm has agreed to be sold to j p morgan chase bank of america and two private investment funds for &# billion people familiar with the matter tell the wall street journal people involved in the negotiations tell the new york times the two private buyers are jc flowers and friedman fleischer &amp lowe which will control of sallie mae with the banks taking the rest though leveraged buyout firms have generally avoided such big investments in financial services companies because of the weaker tolerance they bring for debt levels jc flowers "has chipped away at this problem for years first buying banks in japan and germany and now the year old sallie mae " the journal notes the deal comes at an increasingly troubled time for the education loan sector "democratic lawmakers and president bush are threatening to cut the federal subsidies and guarantees that have allowed sallie maes core loan business to thrive for years " the times notes "investigations and media scrutiny over deceptive sales practices are casting a harsh light on its newest and most lucrative business high interest private loans that bridge the gap between tuition costs and federal aid and a deteriorating credit environment for all financial institutions could soon put pressure on the companys bottom line " all of this has caused sallie mae shares to fall more than in the past year which made it a more attractive takeover target turning
