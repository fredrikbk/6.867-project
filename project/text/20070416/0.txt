americas a crude power grab in two weeks time exxon mobil will complete the transfer of operations at its cerro negro facilities in venezuela to the state owned oil company petroleos de venezuela known by its spanish initials as pdvsa pronounced pay day vey sah the dallas based company isnt voluntarily relinquishing control nor is it alone in doing so president hugo chavez has decreed that all six u s and european oil companies running exploration and upgrading facilities in the country must turn over operations to pdvsa by may and that they must surrender majority ownership of their projects as well as to the compensation that venezuela will pay for these expropriations negotiations are still under way mr chavez has been brimming with bravado as he has shredded these oil contracts and told foreigners to step aside because hes in charge now but hed better relish the thrill while it lasts the move is not good for venezuela and it will probably end up hitting the commandante of the revolution in the pocketbook corruption incompetence and mismanagement have already taken a big bite out of pdvsas productivity since mr chavez began politicizing the company in high oil prices have mitigated the damage to his balance sheet up to now but they wont protect him forever meanwhile this latest assault on property rights threatens to accelerate the steady deterioration of the venezuelan oil sector and the broader economy which remains heavily dependent on oil income venezuela nationalized its oil industry in but in the s the government decided to sign year contracts with foreign oil companies to form "strategic associations" with pdvsa for the purpose of exploiting the rich reserves of tar like heavy crude in the orinoco belt in the past decade exxon mobil bp conoco phillips norways statoil frances total and chevron all have set up shop in the oil rich region extracting the thick black gold sending it by pipeline to the caribbean coast and "upgrading" it to make it lighter and therefore useful u s companies send their upgraded orinoco crude to gulf coast refineries specially designed to transform it into gasoline the foreign oil companies sank some &# billion into the strategic associations with mutually beneficial results the four projects together produce roughly barrels a day from a region that while rich in reserves offered venezuela little income potential before upgrading processes were mastered with sophisticated financing expertise and foreign technology the chavez government says that it doesnt anticipate any production problems stemming from the change in operatorship or ownership from a strictly technical point of view that forecast may be defensible it is certainly true that both oil extraction and the upgrading processes could be run by any oil company still given the performance of pdvsa under mr chavez it is highly unlikely that productivity investment and income wont suffer one problem already looming is labor last month dow jones newswires peter millard reported that though pdvsa has said that it will retain the employees who staff the strategic associations for the foreign companies union leaders are warning that many of the chemical engineers and processing managers are unhappy about proposed pay cuts and are launching job searches a shortage of human capital is already pinching pdvsa in mr chavez fired workers many of them skilled because he didnt like their politics those employees were replaced with politically compliant candidates and production never recovered opec says that venezuela now produces million barrels a day one million barrels less than in the pre chavez era according to mr millard this year nigeria replaced venezuela as the fourth largest oil supplier to the u s declining production at pdvsa may also be tied to a politicized management environment that takes it cues from the state the chavez government is notorious for graft and low standards and it would not be surprising to find that similar business practices had crept or rushed into the state owned oil company nor would it be surprising to see those practices migrate to the strategic associations that will now be run by pdvsa the expropriation also threatens to destroy a business model that provides more than the pumping processing and refining of oil the marketing divisions of these companies play a crucial role in placing product and keeping transaction costs low the loss of these networks will also harm venezuelan competitiveness finally and perhaps most important there is the damage to venezuelas investment profile pdvsa is already hurting for cash because profits that would otherwise be plowed back into exploration and development are being siphoned off by the government to advance political and social causes in a robust investment climate this misallocation of capital might be compensated for by the private sector but so far investors have had a predictably bad reaction to their loss of property at the hands of mr chavez mr millard reports that output has fallen an estimated barrels a day to at the fields "as the companies affected by pdvsas takeover halted new investments " mr chavez seems to think he can solve this by inviting china national petroleum corp into venezuela but as mr millard reported from caracas last week cnpc has a dismal track record in the venezuelan oil fields in it committed to two oil field blocks with a plan to raise production to barrels a day in each field by march one field was yielding barrels a day while the other was still running at its production rate of barrels daily even though cnpc had doubled the number of active wells to one former pdvsa project manager said that in cnpc drilled six dry wells at caracoles a field with million barrels of proven reserves exxon mobil ceo rex tillerson said last month that if the terms of compensation offered by venezuela are not acceptable to the company it would leave cerro negro entirely that would mean eating a loss but with mr chavez pulling stunts like he did in january when he slashed production quotas for the foreign companies so that he could meet opec cuts without hampering pdvsa sales the risks of walking away may be lower than perceived in the end an exxon exit would probably end up costing venezuela even more
