finding a replacement for imus wont be easy the demise of disgraced radio host don imus would appear to create a prime opportunity for some other eager talent to rise up and claim his microphone but in the troubled radio industry finding popular new voices to fill the airwaves and attract advertisers in multiple markets has become a tough challenge cbs corp s cbs radio where mr imus was based before his firing last week was already struggling to fill the void left by howard stern the controversial host who left last year for a lucrative new gig at sirius satellite radio inc even with more than a year to prepare for mr sterns departure cbss attempts to develop hit shows in his old time slot have fallen so flat that some of his replacements have already been replaced meanwhile the airwaves are filled with hosts who have made outrageous comments paid for them with suspensions or firings and then returned after a suitable cooling off period take bob lonsberry a rochester n y based host who in compared the citys african american mayor to a monkey and an orangutan station manager clear channel quickly fired him but after months of lackluster ratings the company thought better of the move and brought him back in new york morning show host miss jones landed a suspension after airing a song mocking tsunami victims but was soon back in her perch at her emmis communications corp owned station in another instance controversial hosts opie and anthony were fired from a boston radio station in rehired at cbs radio in new york but again fired for airing a stunt involving a couple having sex in st patricks cathedral they eventually won a gig on then fledgling xm satellite radio holdings inc which later made a deal to return them to the cbs broadcast airwaves they had been banished from the shortage of bankable hosts couldnt come at a worse time for the radio industry which is fighting to beef up the &# billion or so in advertising revenue the industry garners each year which has been flat in recent years broadcasters face competition that didnt exist a few years ago from the internet to satellite radio and some ad dollars are being drained away by old media that have suddenly become more attractive like outdoor advertising one problem is radio remains a largely local medium in the eyes of advertisers who often place their commercials on radio to reach specific groups of people in a single location "there are thousands of radio stations across the country hundreds if not thousands of people who are on air talent as well as dozens and dozens of formats " says sue johenning executive vice president and director of local broadcast at initiative a media buying firm owned by interpublic group of cos "its very difficult to find anybody thats going to cut across all of that spectrum " she says one exception public radio programming which has found success selling underwriting to some of the countrys biggest companies radio also seems limited compared with glitzier rivals creating a powerful media property "is easier to do when you have sight sound and motion working for you" as is the case with web video and other emerging media formats says chris boothe a president at publicis groupe sas starcom usa a media buying firm "when you have just one of these sound its a much more challenging proposition to build a personality " radio has tried to combat that problem recently by becoming more multimedia with live web simulcasts of their shows and video clips that can be played online many popular radio shows run on cable television as well as on radio video podcasts of shows are increasingly commonplace regardless the hosts who usually prove the biggest draws are often the ones who are most controversial "if you are vanilla youre not going to get ratings so youve got to push the envelope " says ira berger director of national broadcast at the richards group an independent dallas agency but such personalities often attract only "the smaller entrepreneurial kind of companies that couldnt care less if cards and letters come in " he says vermont teddy bear co for example has advertised on mr sterns show for years "i like the loyal audience " says gerry howatt the companys media manager still amid the dearth of radio stars some marketers have found big names among niche audiences to reach more african american consumers procter &amp gamble co three years ago began sponsoring host tom joyners nationally syndicated show which draws approximately eight million listeners every week in markets according to a spokesman for mr joyners media company reach media inc his show features pg rated humor r&amp b music and socially conscious feature stories hes an ardent supporter of african american causes p&amp g also has sponsored many of mr joyners philanthropic efforts including "take a loved one to the doctor day " college scholarships and "tom joyners family reunion " an annual three day weekend of entertainment and seminars on health and business p&amp g has used mr joyners morning show programming to promote several of its brands including covergirls queen collection which targets women with dark skin tones the makeup line was written into the script of the shows mini soap opera dubbed "its your world " whether mr imus will get his return ticket punched is hard to say xm and sirius which are in the midst of an attempted merger that faces a difficult regulatory path are unlikely to court him before government regulators rule on their proposed combination but some believe a more sensitive mr imus is likely to resurface says tom taylor editor of inside radio perhaps on cable television perhaps on another radio network or perhaps on video on demand "the sinners are always more interesting than the saints " says mr taylor "america is a place of redemption " suzanne vranica and ellen byron contributed to this article
