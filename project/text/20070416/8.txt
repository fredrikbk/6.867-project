boss talk a special report editors note i remember the first time i interviewed the ceo of a company i dont recall a lot of the details but i remember being struck by one thing as i left this guy really did think more broadly than anybody else i had talked to at the company it was a cliche but he saw the big picture the same thought struck me as i read the interviews in this journal report whether it was steve bennett talking about how he did and didnt apply his ge experience to intuit or robert evans of churchill downs discussing how to save horse racing in an internet age or ed zore explaining northwestern mutual life insurances approach to globalization or dominos pizzas david brandon describing how a national brand can sell what is essentially a local product they all faced different problems in different industries but they were all trying to figure out how the world was changing and how their companies had to change with it their visions of course may be flawed as i recall that first ceo i interviewed left the company not long after i met him amid poor results but he was replaced by somebody who shared one quality he saw the big picture
