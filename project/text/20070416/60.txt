politics &amp economics kremlins fears fuel brutal crackdown clash may crush or galvanize putin foes ahead of election more street protests planned moscow russias brutal crackdown on protesters this weekend highlights a rising fear in the kremlin that it could lose control of its tightly managed political system when president vladimir putin steps down next year the question now though is whether police clubs have crushed the kremlins critics or galvanized an opposition that has so far been splintered and ignored by the russian public thousands of riot police beat peaceful antigovernment demonstrators in moscow and st petersburg over the weekend detaining opposition leaders for hours in the harshest official response to protests in russias two biggest cities in years the demonstrations called by a loose coalition of groups ranging from pro western liberals to communists attracted a few thousand participants the demonstrators defied official bans on marches clashing with riot police who came out in force to block their way the governments opponents are hoping the blunt use of force could stir sympathy among a russian public that has so far been indifferent to the consolidation of kremlin power under mr putin organizers are promising more street protests in the coming months in the run up to elections next year when mr putin says he will submit to a constitutional requirement that he step down police detained most of the organizers of an opposition rally in st petersburg yesterday beating and arresting more than people as they left the event opposition leaders said on saturday police turned out in moscow to hem in and then break up a protest of a few thousand protesters many of whom were beaten and of whom were arrested two major squares in central moscow were all but sealed off by riot police many brought in from nearby provinces "this was a turning point " said vladimir ryzhkov a lawmaker and critic of mr putin whose republican party of russia was dissolved last month under new laws restricting political parties "people will now feel its shameful not to support the opposition when police are beating innocent bystanders " but state run television barely covered the protests focusing instead on a much larger state supported youth rally in support of mr putin in moscow city officials insisted they were just enforcing the law ensuring demonstrators stayed in the areas where they had been granted permits to protest mr putin enjoys plus approval ratings thanks largely to his tight control of the media and to the economic boom he has presided over since he took office in mr putin who was in st petersburg over the weekend to observe a kick boxing tournament with martial arts movie star jean claude van damme and italian conservative leader silvio berlusconi didnt comment on the events mr berlusconi told italian news agencies he thought reports of the opposition protests had inflated the numbers of people involved the associated press reported the crackdowns came as the kremlin has voiced increased hostility toward criticism of its internal politics as it prepares for next years transition last week both houses of parliament and the foreign ministry reacted angrily to an annual u s state department report that criticized the kremlins undermining of democratic institutions kremlin officials argue the west is using nongovernment groups to foment rebellion within the former soviet union moscow has also accused the west of harboring political opponents who are working to displace mr putin indeed organizers of the weekend demonstrations say the police crackdown this weekend might have been more severe because one of the kremlins chief opponents fugitive oligarch boris berezovsky told a british newspaper last week he favored a forceful change of power in the kremlin russia later said it was asking britain to review mr berezovskys status as a political refugee with russias media under firm government control and opposition parties shunted aside by prohibitive regulations mr putins anointed successor is virtually assured victory in the march elections but with western style street protest movements sweeping the former soviet union in recent years kremlin officials have watched the approaching election with unease since rigged elections in the former soviet states of georgia ukraine and kyrgyzstan sparked massive western style demonstrations that eventually toppled governments moscow has warned that it wouldnt tolerate any similar demonstrations in russia and state controlled media branded the protesters who rallied over the weekend as radicals and western funded stooges "russia is now a semiauthoritarian country " says alexei makarkin an analyst at the center for political technologies a moscow political consultant "that means it can suppress the opposition but not destroy it and when it does crack down it only helps them " the demonstrations were organized by other russia a loose coalition of opposition groups whose platforms have little in common beyond a call for a more open political system garry kasparov the former world chess champion who heads the group said it had decided "the time had come" to hold demonstrations in moscow and st petersburg to ratchet up support for an open presidential contest in moscow protesters tried to rally at a central square but were stopped by thousands of helmeted riot police during a scuffle with police mr kasparov retreated to a cafe near the square where he was arrested he was later released protesters who tried to break through to the square were beaten and dragged to police vans mr kasparov said the police crackdown in st petersburg was more severe and that a number of protesters suffered concussions and broken bones police chased down small groups of demonstrators beating some on the ground and hauling them into police buses mr kasparov a contributing editor to the opinion pages of the wall street journal said the police reaction to the protests marked "a new dimension" because they beat protesters in full view of western television crews the kremlin he said cares little about western reaction to its severity and is willing to risk being politically isolated in order to hold power "they have shown that the law is no longer relevant " he said he said there will be more rallies but coalition leaders will first have to meet to "assess the damage and analyze the situation " the rallies showed the other russia reaching a level of sophistication and maturity unseen at its inception two years ago the movement has broadened its appeal by adopting patriotic and left wing slogans and populist rhetoric whereas two years ago a few hundred people would turn up to its rallies now they attract several thousand though the group hasnt yet agreed upon a presidential candidate mr kasparov said leaders hope to hammer out a political platform by july the group has benefited from the kremlins hollowing out of russias democratic institutions politicians who once would have found a place in government are so marginalized their only refuge is groups like the other russia the arrival of prominent kremlin critics such as mr ryzhkov and andrei illarionov a former economic aide to mr putin have lent it a political gravitas one of its leaders mikhail kasyanov formerly served as mr putins prime minister
