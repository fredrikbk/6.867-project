metal components used on oil rigs and in other energy operations mr mittal also said his company plans to expand its stainless steel making operations mittal steel aims to finalize its merger with arcelor sa in the summer these moves underscore a shift in the competitive landscape for specialty steel producers which face competition from these deep pocketed rivals and could themselves become takeover targets that could have implications for other industries including oil and gas producers which face spiraling oil field equipment costs as they search deeper and farther for new supplies the smaller players such as illinois plate and pipe maker ipsco inc argentinas tenaris sa the worlds largest producer by revenue of steel pipes for oil and gas and finlands stainless steel maker outokumpu oyj have been pushing to dominate their niches and many assumed they were somewhat insulated from takeovers by industry giants mittal and its competitors have been focused on buying up other large producers of basic steel as part of an effort to expand and solidify their global reach essar global of mumbai india said yesterday it agreed to acquire canadian steelmaker algoma steel inc in an all cash deal valued at billion canadian dollars us&# billion or c&# a share many analysts until recently speculated mittal would get out of stainless steel entirely similarly u s steel was expected to eventually sell off its division making steel products for the oil industry to a specialist such as lone star ipsco or the vallourec and mannesmann tubes division of vallourec group of france instead u s steel now has the largest tubular capacity in north america with the ability to churn out million short tons a year and is pushing further expansion chairman and chief executive john surma formerly an executive in the oil industry said the lone star acquisition would help u s steel expand production and selection of welded and seamless pipe as well as "service and innovation" to the oil and natural gas industry u s steel has been focused on seamless pipe production which is more common in offshore drilling while the lone star deal adds welded pipe production to its portfolio welded pipes are used in land based drilling the deal also gives u s steel greater access to overseas markets as lone star has developed joint ventures in india and indonesia john carter vice president of sales and business development at houston steel pipe distributor sooner pipe lp which buys tube products from tenaris u s steel and lone star said he supports tie ups in steel pipe production as the

president at devon energy corp oklahoma city said his company buys a bulk of product from lone star and is "keeping an eye on that merger" in hopes supply and pricing arent disrupted devon which explores for oil and natural gas could import product from abroad but worries about disruptions associated with foreign purchasing "you would prefer obviously to have your supply source closer to where demand is in the u s " he said the steel industry for decades appeared headed toward greater specialization which favored the emergence of strong niche players but there appears to be a recognition that the large commodity producers also need to expand into specialties where profit margins are fatter "it will be more difficult to sustain a pure niche business than it was historically " said tony taccone of first river a steel consulting firm in pittsburgh "you are going to continue to find the big global consolidators that are generating lots of cash will look at niche players the better you build a niche business the more attractive and interesting it might be " eero mustala a spokesman at outokumpu said his company isnt worried about the larger companies tenaris couldnt be reached to comment the company is managed and controlled by the argentine italian rocca familys techint group making it a difficult takeover target as the demand for oil and natural gas has soared so has the need for related equipment and while the price of steel and many other commodities has been high in recent years because of strong global demand seamless tubular products have been stronger selling for about &# a metric ton at least triple the price per ton of many other steel products the tube makers have been getting bigger through consolidation in june tenaris agreed to buy maverick tube corp of chesterfield mo for &# billion since then ipsco has acquired ns group inc newport ky for &# billion to gain seamless tube making capacity russian steelmaker evraz group sa bought oregon steel mills which makes wide diameter line pipe used in constructing pipelines to transport natural gas over long distances ipsco on thursday confirmed it is in possible takeover discussions the lisle ill company didnt disclose which companies are interested u s steel tenaris and other big companies selling steel tubes face their own challenges as the price of these products has stopped escalating and exports from china have increased into some markets such as north america they also face challenges as they attempt to add more value to tubular products and to control more of the distribution to oil industry customers some say focusing on a niche helps companies concentrate on their customers and services for end markets tenaris for example has developed engineering and technology services to help build more efficient and less polluting oil rigs moreover they are selling steel products directly to oil companies with just in time delivery reducing the need for middlemen buyers and sellers
