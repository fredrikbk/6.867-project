its a good thing a kenyan runner is fast on his feet he competed for bahrain but then raced in israel passport problems galore manama bahrain leonard mucheru a world class long distance runner from kenya agreed four years ago to change his name and his nationality in order to take a prized job a place on the national athletics squad of this tiny gulf kingdom a churchgoing roman catholic he began competing under a new arab islamic identity as mushir salim jawher to "improve my career " he says at the asian games in december the year old won a silver medal for his new country in the meter race he finished just ahead of a burundi born athlete running for qatar and behind a fellow kenyan who won gold for qatar which hosted the event the unusual trifecta for a region not generally known for its sporting prowess highlighted a quirky feature of the global economy wealthy gulf states long conspicuous consumers of fast cars have become a big market for another status symbol africans who run fast but winning isnt everything as mr mucheru has discovered he has spent the past three months on the run from accusations of betraying both arab solidarity and african pride "im not a criminal i didnt kill anyone or steal anything " he says "all i did was run " his ordeal began in early january after he added what he thought would be another feather in bahrains sporting cap he won an international marathon a first by an athlete representing bahrain he beat out a kenyan in a sprint finish the catch is that the race took place in israel which the arab kingdom shuns bahrain went ballistic the bahrain athletics association headed by a member of the royal family issued an angry statement saying mr mucheru would be kicked off the team and stripped of bahraini nationality bahrains society for resisting normalization with the zionist enemy denounced mr mucheru as a national disgrace "we are in this business to give bahrain a good name not a bad name " said sheik talal al khalifa president of the bahrain athletics association mr mucherus trip to israel said the sheik "was a big embarrassment for us and we are not going to take that " the furor flowed from an increasingly common dynamic in this part of the world the tension between the grand global ambitions of gulf kingdoms and their conservative local moorings eager to shake off their image as rich but sleepy backwaters they have poured money into expensive status enhancing ventures that has led to creative and sometimes uneasy juggling bahrain has a state of the art racetrack to host formula one auto racing but in deference to islam sprays the winner with rose water instead of champagne abu dhabi the richest part of the united arab emirates this year signed a deal with the louvre in paris to rent art treasures for a new museum the arrangement raised a ticklish question will abu dhabi a devout muslim land hang paintings that feature nudes or christian motifs the louvre contract stipulates that works of art wont be banished on "unreasonable" grounds before the african runners the biggest sporting imports to the gulf were camel jockeys mostly impoverished children from the indian subcontinent this trade has waned since qatar and the u a e raised the minimum age for camel jockeys to under pressure from the u s and human rights groups countries from the u s to europe to japan lure foreign athletes but the deep pockets of gulf nations have turbocharged the market mr mucheru who was put on the payroll of bahrains military declined to discuss his salary saying only that he earned more than he did in kenya more than kenyan athletes have decamped in recent years many to bahrain and qatar but kenya still has plenty of talent in todays boston marathon seven of the top seeded male runners are kenyans who havent swapped citizenship alarmed by a rash of defections the international association of athletics federations the monaco based governing body for track and field tightened its rules two years ago to require those who switch countries to sit out competition for their new nation for three years "we have to avoid a situation where athletes are being bought like mercenaries " says nick davies an iaaf official mr mucheru made the switch before the new rules took effect though lagging far behind sporting powers like china which has more than a billion people qatar and bahrain ranked ninth and th respectively out of nations in the december asian games not bad for countries with a combined population of barely million to celebrate bahrains crown prince invited mr mucheru and his fellow medal winning runners more than half of them from africa to his palace so when mr mucheru went to israel and beat other competitors in the tiberias marathon around the sea of galilee he figured that would only win kudos in bahrain after the race he told the jerusalem post that he was "very proud" to be the first arab national to compete in the event and hoped "to come back and compete next year " elated he flew back to kenya to be with his family he first realized there was a problem when he started getting calls on his mobile phone during a church service kenyan journalists wanted to get his reaction to bahrains decision to revoke his passport "i had no idea israel was such a big deal " he says he turned off his phone and went into hiding his german manager and coach dorothee paulmann called the athletic governing body in monaco for help but was told there was not much it could do she appealed for mercy to officials in bahrain they gave her the brush off kenya offered little sympathy "he abandoned his country so he is on his own " said isaiah kiplagat chairman of athletics kenya a body responsible for developing kenyas deep pool of great runners "for us he is a nonperson " as the storm rumbled on mr mucheru got word from bahrain that officials would like to talk to him he hesitated at first "i was scared i didnt know what would happen " but he finally decided to go and plead for a reprieve after a series of abject apologies and promises not to run in israel again he awaited news of his fate "i now know i made a big mistake " he said in an interview at a small apartment where he had taken refuge in late january not far from a big u s naval base here he kept the curtains drawn and rarely ventured outside in late january bahrain partially relented he could keep his passport sports officials told him but his banishment from the national squad stood mr mucheru then flew back to africa where he and other defector athletes still do much of their training its way too hot in the gulf for running in nairobi the runner ran into a new crisis kenyan authorities confiscated his bahrain passport saying they couldnt figure out what his nationality was and demanding back his old kenyan documents early this month mr mucheru finally got his passport back he left kenya to return to bahrain yet more squabbling ensued over whether his soon to expire bahrain passport would be renewed the issue he says has now been solved and he hopes to run in hamburg at the end of the month his coach ms paulmann isnt amused gulf countries she says "have money and oil but they have no idea about sport "
