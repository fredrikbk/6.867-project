student suicides privacy rules must be tempered by common sense your moving article about the college students suicide "after a suicide privacy on trial " page one march underlines central dilemmas in working with young adults in crisis the pressures faced by clinicians working with such promising young people at risk are enormous privacy is very important for adolescents who are trying to become independent yet while the rigid legal line around confidentiality and adult status preserves this privacy and protects clinicians working with older adolescents it may bypass the developmental crises faced by these young people and the social and interpersonal context in which these crises arise confidentiality is a real right of our patients but clinicians have the authority to break it in a crisis whats at stake is the potential ending of a treatment relationship either because of the clinicians overriding the patients right to confidentiality in a way that ruins the treatment alliance or because of the patients death the clinicians commitment is to a workable treatment edward r shapiro m d medical director ceo austen riggs center associate clinical professor of psychiatry harvard medical school stockbridge mass the main message of this tragic episode isnt about privacy but about alerting and instructing the people who have the natural responsibility to take care of those who are acting strangely family members and good friends stop worrying about being overprotective it is much worse to be underprotective dave m oneill adjunct professor of economics baruch college the city university of new york new york depressed and suicidal students often feel so because they think that they didnt live up to their familys expectations for their school performance others become depressed when they arent able to negotiate a critical transition from an interdependent home environment whether warm or conflicted to an independent but sometimes lonely and pressure ridden life in college in either case treating suicidal students without family involvement is nonsensical since such treatment purposefully excludes people who are at the core of the issues causing the students depression these are usually the same people who are essential for the treatment success new family oriented treatments for mood disorders such as family focused treatment and family inclusive treatment help both the patients and the families given the high stakes in cases of suicidal students contacting families during their treatment should be either mandatory or at minimum at the discretion of the treating mental health professional possible family contacts under exceptional circumstances should be discussed and agreed upon with all student patients at the beginning of their treatment this way well save a lot of student lives and a lot of families igor galynker m d ph d director bipolar family treatment center associate chairman for research department of psychiatry beth israel medical center new york the therapists should have alerted the parents to their childs danger if they felt the boy presented a significant suicide risk but they either underestimated that risk or more likely they were more concerned about protecting his privacy and the integrity of the therapeutic environment than protecting him from the risk of killing himself in part this attitude finds its origin in the confidential nature of the psychotherapeutic situation however it is also an extension of the attitude of many college administrations regarding their responsibilities to students and their parents wherein the students rights always trump the parents need to know about their children it is difficult to accept the school presidents statement that they "looked at every single thing you can imagine" and concluded that the college was doing all it could to protect its students perhaps college presidents and their fellow administrators should begin to understand that to year olds arent necessarily adults in spite of what the law says some of them are in need of more adult guidance and supervision in college than before there is an arrogance on the part of many college administrators that they arent accountable to parents who have the financial responsibility for their children but not the need to know what they are paying for in the form of transcripts and direct information about their sons and daughters this sad sequence of events highlights the tendency in our society to focus upon the need for greater protection of our rights without recognizing that with all rights come responsibilities and the common sense to realize that laws need to be applied to real life situations from where i sit chuck mahoney would have been better served by a school that recognized that simple fact raymond liggio m d swampscott mass
