in business books she also led a related reader discussion forum on which business books have helped readers in their careers here is an edited selection of reader comments in the forum i am a management consultant and i read a lot of business books for the top manager i would recommend "blue ocean strategy " which redelivers the old message of differentiation in a very appropriate new format i found "mavericks at work" to be an extremely interesting read it is replete with real life examples of people and businesses who have bucked the trend lastly the book by ram charan "know how " has been a real good book in terms of putting it all together his eight skills are practical down to earth you can only take away so much from a book what is important is to adapt the situations to the local milieu and then apply it there is one book i have referred to since "up the organization how to stop management from stifling people and strangling productivity " by robert townsend it was updated in but is now out of print although available from used booksellers this book is a quick read but its a classic having stood the test of time here is a sample "thanks a really neglected form of compensation " i consider "the starfish and the spider" along with "the halo effect" to be the most usefully informative business books ive read in quite sometime the first promotes the idea of distributed decision powers over hierarchically organized authority while the second does a credible job of downgrading the business book genre at large because according to the author most business books are falsely premised they look at performance then draw broad inferences as to reasons for results which more often than not are more coincidental than causative online today read more comments
