the taxpaying minority if the tax forms youre filing this year show uncle sam entitled to any income tax you increasingly stand alone the income tax system is so bad and increasingly reliant on a shrinking number of americans to pay the nations bills that of the countrys households more than million adults pay no income taxes at all not a penny think of it this way after dropping off your tax forms at the post office you find people standing on the sidewalk forty of them will be excused from paying income taxes thanks to congress twenty of them the middle class will pay barely a thing the people who remain the upper middle class and the wealthy will pay nearly all of the income taxes look at that crowd again and find the richest person there that individual will pay of all the income taxes owed by those people the richest people in the crowd will pay of the income tax bill the most successful people will pay of everyones income taxes yet for some lawmakers in washington these taxpayers arent paying enough our tax system comes up short in a lot of areas it doesnt foster economic growth it isnt very simple and it certainly isnt fair the one place where it does excel is at redistributing income according to a recent study by the nonpartisan congressional budget office those who make more than &# the top pay of all income taxes the taxes that support our troops in iraq and afghanistan and for example fund the federal portion of transportation education environmental and welfare spending those who made more than &# in the top paid of all income taxes an increase from their share of in think about it ten percent pay seven out of every dollars and their share of the burden is rising and those super rich one percenters their share of the nations income has risen but their tax burden has risen even faster in the first year of the study these affluent individuals made of the nations income and they paid of the countrys income tax in these fortunate few made of the nations income but their share of the income tax burden leaped to think about that one percent take in less than of the countrys income but pay almost of the countrys income tax as for the middle class cbo reports they make of the nations income and their share of the nations income tax dropped to in they made of the nations income and paid of the nations income tax the combination of across the board marginal income tax rate cuts and repeated expansions of the earned income tax credit eitc for lower income americans has created this situation in which fewer people are responsible for paying more and more of the income tax when president bush in cut the lowest tax rate to from several million additional workers were excused from paying any income tax raising top rates as presidents george h w bush and bill clinton did in and also shifted the burden to a smaller group of americans the eitc program redistributes money from those who pay income taxes to million families and individuals with incomes less than &# these workers not only dont have to pay any income tax theyre given a government check as a subsidy to help make ends meet the eitc is also designed to relieve them of the cost of paying for their share of social security and medicare if republicans including their presidential candidates wonder why their calls for tax relief dont resonate like they used to its because there arent that many income taxpayers left theyve been taken off the rolls as for the democrats they historically have raised taxes and redistributed income as a core philosophy it doesnt matter to them how much money some people pay the argument is that the wealthy can always pay more according to this point of view its immaterial that the tax code is highly progressive it can always be made more progressive while raising taxes on the few to benefit the many might be a political winner its an increasingly risky policy to pursue if as now happens of the people in our democracy can force to pay the bills whats to stop from making pay it all since no one wants to pay taxes whats to stop of people in a democracy from making pay it all or why not let of the country off the hook as long as the remaining picks up the tab the problem is that there is a tipping point after which piling taxes onto the rich will leave the government unable to meet its obligations and perhaps were already reaching that point where most people wont have a serious stake in what the government does because they dont pay for it they want services and benefits but they dont pay the price thats a formula for runaway spending and no accountability in other words a system that looks a lot like the one we already have this cant last forever when government revenues derive mostly from the wealthy the fortunes of a few determine the fate of us all surpluses and deficits will be driven less by the economic strength of the country and more by the gains made by the rich in hedge funds mutual funds equities and stock options like a spinning top that twirls on a narrow point the top will stay up so long as it continues to go round once it slows down it falls and the governments main source of tax revenue will plunge with it what a catch members of congress who want to fund antipoverty programs will have to hope the rich get richer because the wealthy will need to make more to pay for all the federal programs the usual rebuttal made by those who support raising top rates is that lower income americans pay social security and medicare taxes and therefore need "relief " of course they pay these taxes but then they alone get a good return on their money top earners on the other hand pay payroll taxes so their money can be redistributed to others according to the cbo study the top of workers those with incomes over &# pay of the payroll tax while the bottom those who make less than &# pay in return when its time to retire lower income workers typically receive more in social security benefits than they paid in while the wealthy who paid the most in taxes simply cant live long enough to get back what they paid for much of the middle class and the wealthy social security isnt a retirement program its another program that redistributes their income as for medicare it doesnt matter that the rich paid far more in taxes all recipients receive the same benefits think of it this way if medicare were a car its price for a low income worker would be &# and its price for a millionaire would be &# even though its the very same car heres why a taxpayer who makes &# million a year pays &# in medicare taxes while a worker who makes &# a year pays &# but when they retire and visit their doctors or go to the hospital medicare reimburses both an equal amount of money thats a pretty big redistribution of income and a pretty good deal for the low income worker at the end of the day everyone in this county is in it together we have an obligation to help the neediest among us and the wealthy should pay more but a system in which almost half the country pays no income taxes and pay all the income tax has gone too far instead of raising taxes and punishing the successful by making them pay even more its time to junk the current system and start anew with a code that fosters economic growth for all not increased redistribution of income for some mr fleischer a former
