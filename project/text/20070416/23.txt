equal rights amendment is still needed in "equal rights time warp" editorial page april christina hoff sommers makes the misguided argument that an equal rights amendment is not necessary because federal statutes such as the civil rights act ban discrimination and the constitution already provides equal protection to women first the constitution has been interpreted to provide women with only "middle tier " rather than "top tier " protection from government discrimination on the basis of sex thats hardly good enough for this nations daughters and sons and as to the federal statutes banning sex discrimination the laws on the books were passed only after major opposition from many of the same people who oppose the era and they are far from comprehensive for example to this day we do not have a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in health care even when funded with federal tax dollars the landmark civil rights act of has not been extended to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex except in the area of employment further were constantly fighting battles to stop courts state legislatures and unfriendly administrations from weakening the laws we do have the constant effort needed to keep title ix strong the law prohibiting sex discrimination in schools receiving federal funds is proof that progress cannot be taken for granted the era is necessary to ensure that women and girls have a permanent place in the constitution and that their rights will be protected over time marcia d greenberger co president national womens law center washington
