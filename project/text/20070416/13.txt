boss talk a special report the value of pie dominos david brandon talks about the challenge of running a national brand that depends on a local decision eight years ago david a brandon had big shoes to fill when he became chief executive of dominos pizza inc replacing the companys legendary founder tom monaghan since then mr brandon has tried to reinvigorate the pizza chains culture and given workers more incentives to achieve better results that has helped transform the ann arbor mich chain from a slow grower into a publicly traded company with more new products and higher quality pizzas dominos sales fell last year amid a slowdown in consumer spending but the chain is fighting to win back customers by luring them from local pizza joints mr brandon sat down with the wall street journal to talk about how he motivates workers why the company is taking some pizza orders in call centers and how playing football in college made him a better ceo here are excerpts the wall street journal what prepared you for this job mr brandon i have said many times that the best leadership training i received was when i played football at the university of michigan my coach bo schembechler passed away late last year i had dinner with him the night before he died i spent three and a half hours with him at the chop house in ann arbor it was terrific because i knew he wasnt feeling well and i really had a chance to thank him we talked about all the different ways that he helped me i know he was very proud of that and very grateful and then the next day he passed away what i told him is for a kid who was in the school of education planning on being a teacher and a coach i was glued to his every move in terms of how he was so successful competing and winning at such a high level so i saw how he recruited talent it was more about getting people with the right attitude and the right character qualities he was never going to bring a kid on the team that had great skills and a bad attitude wsj why do you think attitude is important mr brandon every company has a culture and a chemistry that makes that company go someone has to buy into the values and the philosophy and the environment that youve created and if you get somebody whos uncomfortable and critical they sap the positive energy out of the organization so we work really hard to make sure that when people come to work for dominos they know right up front what is expected and i learned that from bo wsj you took over the company when the founder had just left how did you avoid being compared to him mr brandon i didnt for one minute try to be like him in fact i openly admitted to and pointed out differences in philosophy and direction because i wanted people to know i had my own view of the world i also made it really clear that change was not a criticism of the past that it just simply meant the future was going to be different i thought that was really important because you have this proud company and this organization that had built and accomplished a lot and the last thing you need is somebody coming in from the outside and saying "ok all that stuff you were doing is flawed and is wrong " wsj dominos was growing slowly when you took over how did you change the culture to make it grow faster and achieve better results mr brandon i tried to implement what i call the wall street mentality the wall street mentality to me is that you benchmark against the very best in class and aspire to be as good as them or better the company was privately held the founder had become over the years very much focused on his philanthropy and other interests and so there was a bit of a mentality in place that said "gee if we just do a little bit better this week this year than we did last year everybody will be happy " there were no stock options the bonus plan was only reserved for the very senior management so you had an organization that wasnt highly incentivized to create shareholder value truthfully at the end of the year it didnt really matter if sales were up a lot or a little or profits were up a lot or a little as long as they were up enough for the owner to be happy life goes on so i came in and said "listen were going to pretend like were a fortune company on the new york stock exchange " even though for a while we werent wsj did that make people uncomfortable mr brandon some because change is hard there were a lot of people obviously very excited by it because they knew there was all this locked up potential and they wanted to be a part of that there were also some people who you could tell by looking in their eyes that they didnt believe some of those people had to leave wsj dominos big distinguisher before you took over was its speed of service how did you get the company to build a reputation for quality products mr brandon the first thing we had to do was step up to the fact that we had to invest more in our product we said we have to put more dough weight in our pizza in other words provide bigger dough balls to the stores that would create a heavier crust which research told us customers liked we needed to put more toppings on the pizza more generous toppings and thicker toppings we implemented our "heat wave" technology to keep the pizza hot longer because all the research said that one of the ways that pizza was perceived as high quality was if it was served hot its helped us enormously because we did for a while become known as a pizza company that got it to you fast but the product was pretty mediocre wsj what have you done to blunt increases in the minimum wage mr brandon theres not a whole lot you can do to blunt the cost other than create automation that affords you the ability to employ less of those people so to the extent we can automate something that was previously manual to the extent we can look at call center type operations across the board as opposed to hiring people at the store level to answer phones those are all the kind of tactical things you can do to try to maintain reasonable margins in the face of an artificial increase in your labor cost but ultimately youre just going to have to increase your prices because that labor has got to be dealt with in some fashion wsj have you moved any order taking to call centers mr brandon we have were going to test and learn a lot about call centers and that may very well be something that we utilize in the future more than we have in the past wsj what countries have you tried them in mr brandon weve used call centers very effectively in iceland weve used call centers very effectively in asian countries we have call center technologies that are being tested in a number of different countries around the world and were certainly testing them here it saddens me because a lot of the people who perform the job of customer service rep in our stores theyre all part time many of them are students or seniors who are supplementing their income i love the fact that we can help a lot of people out by providing them with those opportunities and when the politicians start doing what they do they start imposing these kinds of rules in some cases i think its counterproductive because theyre almost incentivizing businesses to come up with ways to eliminate those jobs i cant for the life of me understand how thats good for the economy wsj last year was a tough year for dominos as pressures on consumer spending prompted people to cut back on things like ordering pizza what are you doing to win back pizza market share mr brandon one of the realizations that weve come to in is you cant lose track of the fact that pizza is local people decide at the local level what pizza shop they want to favor with their business that local connection is extremely important wsj how do you run a national brand while making it local mr brandon its a big challenge because we need to have national television we need to have national print we need to have national brand identity i think youre seeing a shift with us where were trying to emphasize more of the marketing activities at the local level if we want to grow our market share thats where were going to get it done wsj do you think athletes make better ceos mr brandon well im biased but i do think having that in your background is a huge help one of the things i made clear to bo is that business is all about preparation its getting ready to go out and execute at a high level thats what football teams do and thats what he did very effectively the whole idea of practicing and then going out and winning is a real transferable skill to business ms adamy is a staff reporter in the wall street journals chicago bureau she can be reached at janet adamy wsj com
