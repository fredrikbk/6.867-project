the fiscal bottom line just because something is simple and makes sense does not mean it isnt true even in washington consider the proposition that tax cuts are good and tax increases are bad tax cuts are good because they stimulate economic growth making people better off by several multiples of the amount of revenue the government loses a good rule of thumb is that a &# tax cut induces &# to &# of additional economic growth conversely tax increases are bad because they impair economic growth making people worse off by several multiples of the extra amount of tax revenue the government collects generally speaking each additional &# of tax revenue costs the economy not only the &# of tax but an additional &# to &# in lost income so why not cut taxes and spending there is plenty of room for reducing the nearly &# trillion federal budget without cutting anything even resembling muscle and sinew another good rule of thumb attributed to milton friedman is that the government usually spends &# to do a &# job imagine if all tax increases became the last instead of the first resort to be used only after every ounce of political spoils patronage waste and just plain silliness had been squeezed out of the federal budget and imagine if you can a government that keeps its hand out of your pocket its nose out of your business and does its own assigned tasks with cost effective competence nevertheless just because something makes sense does not mean it will carry the day especially not in washington consider the two versions of the truth that may be drawn from a recent study by gregory mankiw an economist at harvard reduced to its essence mr mankiw concluded that a &# tax cut on dividends would reduce government revenue collections by about cents after taking into account taxes on &# of additional economic growth induced by the tax cut a &# tax cut from an across the board rate reduction would cost the irs about cents after taking into account taxes on the cents of additional economic growth induced by the tax cut to the champions of bigger government the important truth of the mankiw study was that the amount of tax on induced economic growth was insufficient to make up for all of the revenues lost to the treasury from the original tax cut ergo the government has less money to spend ergo tax cuts are bad to those of us who prefer economic growth over government growth the mankiw study confirmed a different truth if congress is willing to forego cents of revenue the economy would grow and people would have &# more income if given the choice most people would take the &# now apply the conclusions of the mankiw study in reverse to tax increases the results illuminate the high costs of providing the government with an additional &# to spend a purported &# tax increase on dividends only nets the treasury cents but costs americans &# in lost income plus cents in tax when a higher rate is levied on all forms of income an attempted &# tax increase yields only cents but costs americans cents in lost income plus cents in tax if the government were to kick up the tax increases enough to collect a full additional &# the cost to the public would be between &# and &# counting both tax paid and income lost a may study by harvards martin feldstein "the effect of taxes on efficiency and growth " confirms the disproportionately large economic losses associated with tax increases the economic losses that result from increased taxes fall mainly on low and middle income earners in the form of salary increases not obtained and jobs not gotten or lost and this burden applies irrespective of whether those who lose out pay or do not pay income taxes the regressive nature of the adverse economic fallout from high taxes cannot be avoided by concentrating those taxes on ostensibly rich capitalists in fact mr mankiws study confirms that concentrating taxes on capital exacerbates the damage to the economy unfortunately the new party in power in congress has threatened to impose higher tax rates on dividends capital gains and the incomes of upper bracket taxpayers in general they will tell the public that they are raising &# billion of revenue from the malefactors of great wealth and that they will spend this money wisely a decent respect for the truth would however require them to warn the american people about the most likely results of the tax increase the higher tax rates will cost them about &# billion in lost incomes and jobs because of that economic damage the revenue yield from the tax increase will be only about &# billion not &# billion and at the margin the entire &# billion will be spent on perks pork patronage and other waste mr christian an attorney was a deputy assistant secretary of treasury in the ford administration mr frenzel is a former republican congressman from minnesota who served on the ways and means and budget committees
