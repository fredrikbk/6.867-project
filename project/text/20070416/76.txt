breaking baseballs color barrier more celebrations are to come rain washed away five games out of the slate of in the los angeles times bill plaschke celebrates robinsons achievement not at dodger stadium but in crenshaw at jackie robinson sports stadium "you want to celebrate the no " he asks "on this weekday evening there are at last sprinters and joggers and walkers filling the track there are perhaps different shades of skin color among the soccer players filling the field there are at least children laughing and jumping and celebrating the freedom to play whatever sport they want from cheerleading to rope jumping to javelin throwing and every one of those children answers my question correctly who was jackie robinson " sticking with the times j a adande notes the figure thats been on everybodys list the percentage of african americans on baseballs opening day rosters a far cry from years ago but mr adande strikes the right note in considering what that means "it isnt a crisis for black people its a problem for baseball african americans have a wider variety of athletic options available to them than ever before thanks to the momentum still carried forward from robinsons first push in almost of the players are african american in the nations most popular sport the nfl the nba the league with the highest average salary &# million is african american african americans have risen to the top in golf and tennis previously considered the exclusive provinces of the country club set there are more choices and theyre being exercised the door to baseball isnt locked it just isnt being used as often " baseball he writes "doesnt need any more versions of jackie robinson the pioneer it needs the latest incarnations of jackie robinson the player baseballs risk in losing its connection to african americans is that its missing out on the next aaron or robinson &lt mdash&gt or for that matter the next version of reigning national league most valuable player ryan howard " in the new york daily news wayne coffey recreates robinsons first day in the major leagues a chronicle made especially vivid by rachel robinsons struggles getting a cab and her worries about jackie jr the robinsons baby son that day and the rest of robinsons first year are also the subject of our print colleague jonathan eigs new book "opening day" excerpted here and if youll allow the fix an indulgence years ago jason fry looked back at robinsons accomplishments mythmaking and all how would robinson do today impossible to say but not to simulate on espn com charles wolfson and luke kraemer of diamond mind simulate what robinson would have meant to the and dodgers one of the first teammates to shake robinsons hand on opening day was gene hermanski who should get an odd sort of credit for sundays tribute as jill painter notes in the los angeles daily news in snipers and the fbi surrounded crosley field after robinson received a frightening death threat in an attempt to lighten the mood mr hermanski joked that perhaps the dodgers could confuse the gunman if they all took the field wearing fifty six years later a joke made under grim circumstances is the stuff of triumph will shields a year veteran of the kansas city chiefs has retired the right guard was selected for pro bowls and racked up consecutive starts trailing only brett favre among active nfl players in a nice tribute the kansas city stars joe posnanski writes about a day six years ago one in which injuries to the chiefs left mr shields playing left tackle for the first time since high school against the likes of jay williams and reggie white "they couldnt beat him " mr posnanski recalls "they tried to go around him they tried to cut inside him they spun and slapped and tried to slip up and under they even tried to go through him a pointless move they pushed him after the whistle blew and talked to him between plays they couldnt beat him he allowed one tackle he gave up no sacks it was as inspiring as anything ive ever seen on a football field will shields playing out of position in a pointless game on a freezing day in front of a nothing crowd would not let himself get beat this wasnt about locker room speeches or big contracts or the roar of the crowd no this was about the same challenge every one of us faces every day this was about doing something as well as you can because well what else is there " the boston celtics will have at least the second highest number of ping pong balls in the nbas may draft lottery after a long period in which theyre widely suspected of tanking games to get more chances at drafting college stars greg oden and kevin durant on espn com bill simmons has a fantasy if coach doc rivers gets a contract extension why not thank him for the tank job thats the start of an impassioned screed about mr rivers the boston media and the celtics decline and fall "just last weekend nba tv showed john havliceks final game the one during which boston fans gave hondo an minute standing ovation before the opening tip " he writes "think about how long minutes is thats two music videos thats an entire segment of lost thats a par at the masters i cant imagine anything like that happening with the celtics again regardless of the player involved and i think thats been the saddest thing about the past few seasons not the losing itself but that the celtics dont matter like they once did theyre just another nba franchise in a league with too many of them " while youre reading dont miss the sidebar as mr simmons takes an ax to the conventional wisdom that "the young guys have really improved" under mr rivers in the new york sun last week john hollinger explored tanking and other "perverse incentives" coming to the fore in the nba seasons final days a new racing surface called polytrack could its hoped cut down on dreadful injuries to racehorses such as the broken leg that ultimately doomed barbaro in last years preakness but it will also change horse racing as ted mcclelland notes in slate "for one thing polytrack affects a horses gait " he writes "unlike dirt the plastic stuff has no kickback giving it a solid footing similar to grass turf horses thrive on the new surface and polytrack races often resemble turf races the horses jog in slow motion until the final turn when they unleash their finishing kicks earlier this year i watched a polytrack race and a dirt race side by side at a las vegas sports book they looked like they had been beamed from different planets at aqueduct a queens n y racetrack that has so far refused to go plastic the deep brown dirt was scored with long hoof divots the turfway surface by contrast looked as sterile as sawdust on the dirt freewheeling frontrunners could not be caught in the stretch turfways plasticized races were still up for grabs an eighth of a mile from the wire dirt races are won with speed from the gate polytrack seems to reward stamina " found a good column from the world
