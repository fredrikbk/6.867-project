politics &amp economics gonzales deputy in crossfire looks for quiet exit mcnulty seeks job in private sector scrutiny intensifies washington with attorney general alberto gonzales on the ropes over the firings of eight u s attorneys his deputy paul j mcnulty is quietly testing the waters for a new job he may need one if critics have their way some democrats and conservative republicans argue that the deputy attorney general who so far has been relatively unscathed should shoulder more responsibility for the mishandling of the firings which has devastated morale at the justice department and embarrassed the bush administration at a judiciary committee hearing in february mr mcnulty said the bush appointed prosecutors were dismissed for "performance related" reasons when the fired prosecutors spoke out in defense of their reputations it triggered widespread media coverage and fueled a new round of congressional questions mr mcnulty also said bud cummins a u s attorney in little rock ark was fired to make way for a former aide to presidential adviser karl rove still the focus remains mr mcnultys boss mr gonzales who is to testify before the senate judiciary committee tomorrow mr gonzales in prepared remarks he plans to deliver to the panel says of the eight fired prosecutors "i apologize to them and to their families for allowing this matter to become an unfortunate and undignified public spectacle and i am sorry for my missteps that have helped to fuel the controversy " if the political and public pressure on mr gonzales leads to his resignation mr mcnulty could be first in line to assume his duties until a successor is appointed even before the controversy erupted mr mcnulty years old had been making plans to join the private sector after years in government which included a term as u s attorney in virginias eastern district people familiar with his plans said knowing he would like to take a higher paying job partly to cover tuition for his four college age children well before the end of the administration his friends recently have sent out feelers on his behalf for possible corporate and law firm jobs the people said mr mcnulty says future plans arent his focus now "i am fully focused on doing my job and havent given much thought to what comes next " he said friday "to be honest there hasnt been much time for that " mr mcnultys supporters say he doesnt deserve any more blame than he already has received william barr general counsel at verizon communications inc served as u s attorney under the first president bush and chose mr mcnulty to work as a close aide at the justice department "this doesnt seem to be a stink bomb of his making " mr barr said " id hate to see him made the scapegoat the main screwups were not his " some critics argue the deputy attorney general should get more of the blame "what got the justice department in trouble was this hatchet job and trashing of the reputations of these people " said mark carollo who ran the justice departments public affairs office under john ashcroft and now works as a consultant in washington "paul mcnulty does have to take some responsibility for that " sen dianne feinstein a california democrat said in a senate speech last month that she felt misled by mr gonzales jan testimony to the senate judiciary committee and by a private briefing by mr mcnulty to some members of the panel a week after his feb public testimony "it turned out that the performance reports of the very people he mr mcnulty was saying were being terminated on the basis of performance were all excellent " she said mr gonzaless supporters at the justice department say mr mcnulty went off script during the congressional hearing when he cited performance as a reason for the dismissals in mr mcnultys defense people close to him said that in a feb preparatory session before his testimony it was agreed that if pressed he would have to cite "performance " mr gonzales had made a passing reference to performance as a factor in his own senate testimony in january another reason some conservatives believe mr mcnulty deserves more scrutiny is that he has been spared much public criticism from sen charles schumer the new york democrat who has led the investigation of the firings people close to the two men said they have a warm relationship that dates to when they both worked on the house judiciary committees crime subcommittee in the early s with mr schumer chairing the panel and mr mcnulty serving as a counsel for the republican minority sen schumer says he isnt sparing mr mcnulty of scrutiny but he notes "no one has said mcnulty was at the center of this " sen schumer says he credits mr mcnulty for being "the first to come forward he said he knew nothing about it he said he was misled by others what you logically do is ask questions of those others and then come back to mcnulty " at the private briefing for some judiciary panel members on feb people familiar with the meeting said mr schumer peppered mr mcnulty with questions interrupting him frequently mr mcnultys return to the hot seat may come soon congressional aides say following a week of interviews of justice staffers by the committee congressional staff expect to interview mr mcnulty perhaps as early as friday corrections &amp amplifications william barr served as u s attorney general under the first president bush a politics &amp economics article yesterday incorrectly referred to mr barrs previous title as u s attorney wsj april
