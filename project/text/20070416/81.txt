the wolfowitz files the world bank released its files in the case of president paul wolfowitzs ethics on friday and what a revealing download it is on the evidence in these pages it is clearer than ever that this flap is a political hit based on highly selective leaks to a willfully gullible press corps mr wolfowitz asked the world bank board to release the documents after it became possible the executive directors would adjourn early friday morning without taking any action in the case this would have allowed mr wolfowitzs anonymous bank enemies to further spin their narrative that he had taken it upon himself to work out a sweetheart deal for his girlfriend and hide it from everyone the documents tell a very different story one that makes us wonder if some bank officials werent trying to ambush mr wolfowitz from the start bear with us as we report the details because this is a case study in the lack of accountability at these international satrapies the paper trail shows that mr wolfowitz had asked to recuse himself from matters related to his girlfriend a long time world bank employee before he signed his own employment contract the banks general counsel at the time roberto danino wrote in a may letter to mr wolfowitzs lawyers "first i would like to acknowledge that mr wolfowitz has disclosed to the board through you that he has a pre existing relationship with a bank staff member and that he proposes to resolve the conflict of interest in relation to staff rule paragraph by recusing himself from all personnel matters and professional contact related to the staff member " our emphasis here and elsewhere that would have settled the matter at any rational institution given that his girlfriend shaha riza worked four reporting layers below the president in the bank hierarchy but the bank board composed of representatives from donor nations decided to set up an ethics committee to investigate and it was the ethics committee that concluded that ms rizas job entailed a "de facto conflict of interest" that could only be resolved by her leaving the bank ms riza was on a promotion list at the time and so the banks ethicists also proposed that she be compensated for this blow to her career in a july ethics committee discussion memo mr danino noted that "there would be two avenues here for promotion an in situ promotion to grade gh for the staff member" and promotion through competitive selection to another position " or as an alternative "the bank can also decide as part of settlement of claims to offer an ad hoc salary increase " five days later on july ethics committee chairman ad melkert formally advised mr wolfowitz in a memo that "the potential disruption of the staff members career prospect will be recognized by an in situ promotion on the basis of her qualifying record " in the same memo mr melkert recommends "that the president with the general counsel communicates this advice" to the vice president for human resources "so as to implement" it immediately and in an august letter mr melkert advised that the president get this done pronto "the ec ethics committee cannot interact directly with staff member situations hence xavier coll the human resources vice president should act upon your instruction " only then did mr wolfowitz instruct mr coll on the details of ms rizas new job and pay raise needless to say none of this context has appeared in the media smears suggesting that mr wolfowitz pulled a fast one to pad the pay of ms riza yet the record clearly shows he acted only after he had tried to recuse himself but then wasnt allowed to do so by the ethics committee and he acted only after that same committee advised him to compensate ms riza for the damage to her career from a "conflict of interest" that was no fault of her own based on this paper trail mr wolfowitzs only real mistake was in assuming that everyone else was acting in good faith yet when some of these details leaked to the media nearly everyone else at the bank dodged responsibility and let mr wolfowitz twist in the wind mr melkert a dutch politician now at the u n seems to have played an especially cowardly role in an october letter to mr wolfowitz he averred that "because the outcome is consistent with the committees findings and advice above the committee concurs with your view that this matter can be treated as closed " a month later on november mr melkert even sent mr wolfowitz a personal hand written note saying "i would like to thank you for the very open and constructive spirit of our discussions knowing in particular the sensitivity to shaha who i hope will be happy in her new assignment " and when anonymous world bank staffers began to circulate emails making nasty allegations about ms shahas job transfer and pay in early mr melkert dismissed them in a letter to mr wolfowitz on february because they "did not contain new information warranting any further review by the committee " yet amid the recent media smears mr melkert has minimized his own crucial role all of this is so unfair that mr wolfowitz could be forgiven for concluding that bank officials insisted he play a role in raising ms rizas pay precisely so they could use it against him later even if that isnt true its clear that his enemies especially europeans who want the bank presidency to go to one of their own are now using this to force him out of the bank they especially dislike his anticorruption campaign as do his opponents in the staff union and such elites of the global poverty industry as nancy birdsall of the center for global development they prefer the status quo that holds them accountable only for how much money they lend not how much they actually help the poor equally cynical has been the press corps which slurred mr wolfowitz with selective reporting and now says in straight faced solemnity that the president must leave the bank because his "credibility" has been damaged paul wolfowitz meet the duke lacrosse team the only way this fiasco could get any worse would be for mr wolfowitz to resign in the teeth of so much dishonesty and cravenness were glad the bush administration isnt falling for this euro bureaucracy media putsch mr wolfowitz has apologized for any mistakes hes made though were not sure why hes the one who deserves an apology see related letter
