boss talk a special report home sweet home why the ceo of northwestern mutual life insurance isnt trying to sell outside the u s you could call edward zore a worldly homebody as chief executive of northwestern mutual life insurance co and its former chief investment officer mr zore has seen the percentage of the companys foreign investments rise over the years but the year old milwaukee based firm one of the nations largest life insurers doesnt sell life insurance outside the united states while the u s is considered a mature market mr zore says he still sees opportunity at home mr zore joined northwesterns investment division in and he has led the company since june he says that northwestern has more of its investments in stocks than many other insurers and that the returns this helps generate are crucial to the companys overall strategy the investment strategy he says is aided in turn by northwestern being a mutual insurance company that is owned by policyholders not a publicly traded firm that has to file quarterly earnings reports the company also sells insurance only through exclusive agents while many other insurers sell policies through a variety of distribution channels in an interview mr zore explained northwesterns approach to globalization and the challenges and opportunities it presents following are excerpts the wall street journal a number of life insurance companies see big opportunities abroad northwestern doesnt sell life insurance outside the u s why has the company made that strategic decision mr zore we see a lot of opportunity here in the u s and based on what we do and how we do it we think we can exploit that opportunity what we do is not necessarily transferable to other places in the world we did dabble with some joint ventures in looking at insurance opportunities around the globe and back in the mid s we did hire somebody to specifically look at opportunities around the world and see if there was someplace where we could do business and as we were kind of looking at an opportunity in chile it dawned on us that if we were just able to increase our market penetration in los angeles as an example by as opposed to going to chile it was worth more than anything we could do in chile wsj theres also a great deal of competition in los angeles is getting market share that easy mr zore no its not that easy getting market share is difficult we have to have people out there that are representing us and that are finding prospects and identifying needs and delivering the solutions that we provide one of the most difficult parts of this model is to find the people who can do this they have to be good people they have to be well trained they have to be aligned they have to be productive and they have to be entrepreneurial unlike most other companies we dont use brokers most of the other companies are using multiple distribution channels theyre selling over bank counters theyre selling through investment broker dealers theyre selling through independent investment advisers theyre selling through insurance brokers plus they might have some of their own career representatives we only sell our insurance products through our own career representatives and that makes it a little more difficult for us to quickly ramp up and get more volume but the flip side is it works very well for us because theyre in alignment with us wsj from the standpoint of the company as an investor returning to the overseas picture whats your reaction to the recent market jitters mr zore most insurance companies because of the guarantees we have to provide and because they cant afford any volatility have mostly fixed income investments and we are a little different in that we have about equity investments in our general account i think of our investments now would be global investments and we like this diversification we like this balance because while theres always something thats going wrong theres always something thats offsetting it going right for example during the global market hiccup in equities recently all the markets went down but it didnt really have any effect on bonds the bond market actually went up we probably made some money because we have all these fixed income investments last year the flip side our bond returns were about whatever the market index was but we had equities that had phenomenal results our private equity portfolio last year was up i think wsj is the percentage of your international investments a significant change from what it was five or years ago mr zore it keeps going up and it has to do with opportunities in the investment arena money is sloshing around globally these days and we have to participate looking for attractive opportunities and attractive investment deals globally if we want to be successful and so weve been ramping up as long as i can remember weve had our toe in the water internationally even though we dont sell insurance internationally wsj do you think that trajectory will continue will you be at in international investments in the foreseeable future mr zore i wouldnt put a number on it but i think the path is to increase international activity now one of the limitations on that has to do with how many international investments the various insurance regulators would allow us to have and i think were well below whatever the limits are right now globalization in investments is just a fact of life wsj why is the percentage of northwesterns investments in stocks as opposed to bonds higher than many other insurers mr zore were in the long term relationship business and were a mutual company and that allows us to ignore the quarterly volatility that equities would produce on the financial statements of a stock company working on a thinner sliver of equity our financial strength is an important ingredient to our value proposition we have a substantial amount of surplus funds or capital available to support bad circumstances that might occur in the business our whole role is to pay claims when we have to and that means we have to be there when people need us so that also gives us a cushion to absorb volatility in more equities in the investment portfolio wsj northwestern mutual is also a significant player in private equity investments why is that an area that you invested significantly in and what do you think of the recent activity in private equity deals mr zore there have always been opportunities in the private market that arent available in the public market that provide a little different risk profile and a little different return we expect in the private market were going to get a little higher returns because we have less liquidity these days the markets are so competitive weve got to try to do as much as we can to keep visible and to keep active and to keep the phone ringing weve got people out on the street looking for deals its been good to us its a way of diversifying the portfolio we expect returns on private equities are going to come down having said that last year our private equity portfolio not our funds but our own private equity portfolio had a return of if youd have asked me early in the year what we expected out of that it would have been nowhere close to that if somebody would have said we would have said wow youre dreaming it was it cant keep up there arent that many opportunities out there wsj northwestern has a committee of policyholders who evaluate the company annually interviewing top company officials and issuing an annual report whats the purpose of having that committee mr zore first of all its the only thing like it in corporate america to my knowledge and it has been a practice that weve been following for about years every year we bring in four or five policy owners and we open up our books to them we provide them with an education of what we do and why we do it i spend a lot of time with them they meet with senior management they can dig down and they do dig down in the organization they can talk to anybody they want whats really fun is they have dinners and meetings with some mid management people and they ask them what do you like about northwestern what dont you like what do you think of the bosses what do you think of ed zore at the end of the day they come up with ideas for us that are usually pretty helpful on how we can improve the business they opine on whether or not they think were doing as good a job as we can it keeps us on our toes because we know every year were going to have some new people that come in and weve got to explain to them all we do and how we do it so it makes us ask ourselves well does this all make sense wsj can you give me an example of a suggestion that has come out of the policyholders committee mr zore for a number of years they kept impressing on us that we ought to do a little more in the marketing area now were doing that were showing people what we are they advised us to be more aggressive in promoting the fact that we are a mutual and taking advantage of it and trying to figure out how to leverage that they always challenge us and always spend a lot of time taking a look at how we attract how we train how we motivate how we compensate how we interact with our field force they try to understand it because they all have representatives themselves and their representatives by the way are telling them as their clients whats wrong with us so they come in loaded for bear saying well you guys ought to do this you ought to do that wsj do they ever tell you to do things that you say no im not going to do that mr zore they come up with ideas sometimes that dont make as much sense to us as it might make to them because they dont have the intimate knowledge of the business that we have but that doesnt mean that its wrong it just means that they dont have the background and they didnt have the exposure that we have for years of knowledge in the industry and the company mr pleven is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau he can be reached at liam pleven wsj com
