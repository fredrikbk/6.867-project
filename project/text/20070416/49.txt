munich res new road map could reawaken sleepy shares cautious reinsurer aims to boost agility unleash horsepower giant german reinsurer munich re group is starting to roll out a string of new initiatives to insure new risks sharpen its marketing and make the company more nimble the moves could be a catalyst for munich res sleepy cheap shares despite a rally for insurance stocks thanks largely to last years benign hurricane season munich res shares are under water so far this year and trade at a lower price than those of its peers on a range of yardsticks the companys stock which trades in germany but is owned by north american investors closed up slightly friday at euros &# its shares are down about so far this year compared with a rise of more than for the average reinsurance stock and the stock looks inexpensive by various measures its shares trade at a little more than nine times analysts forecasts for profits for this year about a discount to the average for european insurers and reinsurers the year old company is the worlds second largest reinsurer behind swiss reinsurance co by premiums collected reinsurers sell insurance to insurance companies primarily backstopping insurers biggest risks thanks to sharpened risk controls and tighter monitoring of underwriters munich re which has a market value of billion euros &# billion has earned higher profits despite flat or falling premiums in recent years but its share price has lagged behind that of swiss re and several other large insurers partly because the company has been less aggressive in taking on debt and pursuing new business the companys board mapped out a series of new efforts from selling new types of coverage to cutting down paperwork and redrawing pay incentives at a meeting in the bavarian alps last month the steps incorporate ideas gleaned from shareholders clients and analysts the company says "we want to stick to our policies that led to better results but also do more now " torsten jeworrek the munich re board member who oversees reinsurance operations said in the firms first public comments on the new plan "we need to make more entrepreneurial room in our company to bring all our horsepower on the road not just have it but use it " headed by chief executive nikolaus von bomhard munich re is testing new coverage lines tied to climate change including writing various kinds of coverage for green projects like those funded by environmental standards like the kyoto protocols levies for carbon dioxide emissions the firm is also looking at writing technology coverage for damages caused by viruses an area many have seen as uninsurable so far meantime it is weighing new marketing approaches including selling directly to companies through trade associations and building deeper relationships with small fast growing insurers internally the company is looking to cut layers of bureaucracy rather than staff mostly at underwriting units it also is considering changes to pay and bonus structures that reward creativity rather than simply precision "over the next six to nine months i think you will see some changes in how we behave " mr jeworrek said "you will see new products and lighter processes this year " there are of course risks to banking on significant investor response to the new plans the company hasnt posted multiyear profit goals like its peers have and isnt attaching financial targets to these new efforts so it might be tricky for analysts to cobble together new estimates of the companys value last years hurricane free profits make for tough comparisons and broadly speaking insurance premiums are slipping historically falling premiums have presaged losses by some insurers when catastrophes hit and catastrophes are a perennial risk to insurers mr jeworrek notes that munich re has stepped back from markets with particularly soft rates like aviation as well as car insurance in france and germany looking ahead to the companys annual meeting on april investors would likely respond positively to drastic demonstrative measures a sale of the companys ergo primary insurance unit would be a bombshell but the company has long said that ergo which collects about of the companys premiums is a core unit and not for sale a big share buyback like one recently announced by swiss re would be a more likely move says jaime ramos martin investment director covering european insurers for standard life investments in edinburgh scotland the firm owns a small stake in munich re "munich re is definitely not expensive " mr ramos martin says "when i look across the financial services sector it is hard to find a company with so much potential upside in the managements hands " the stock trades at just times its book value or the difference between a companys assets and liabilities that is often seen as a hypothetical estimate of what the companys value would be if it closed down such a low valuation has led some analysts to speculate that the company might be a potential target for bargain hunting activist investors who would buy shares and then push for changes that would get the stock price higher in addition to its low price munich re has built up the amounts of money backing its policies in recent years and offers a dividend yield after boosting its payout "the bull case is simply that this stock is too cheap " says william hawkins an insurance stock analyst with keefe bruyette &amp woods in london "its trading near book value so it doesnt take much of an optimist to see value in the shares " mr hawkins rates the stock the equivalent of a "buy " and has a euros price target he owns shares of the company and his firm expects to seek or receive compensation for investment banking work in the next three months
