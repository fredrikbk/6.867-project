boss talk a special report after ge intuits steve bennett on why some general electric alumni succeed and some dont industrial giant general electric co is known for spawning ceos whats less well known is what makes some ge veterans successful at their new companies while others flounder among the most unusual success stories steve bennett years old who had spent years at ge when he was recruited to become ceo of intuit inc a silicon valley software maker with a folksy laid back culture mr bennett was and is an avid golfer with a tendency to throw out phrases like "performance management " in silicon valley whose well known executives include counterculture college dropouts like apple inc s steve jobs and oracle corp s larry ellison mr bennett is far from home but since he joined intuit in mr bennett has more than doubled the companys revenue to &# billion in from &# million in his trick apply the tried and true ge principles that make sense here at a young but maturing software company and throw out the ones that are he says "really dumb " when he arrived mr bennett quickly got rid of intuits weakest businesses and focused on the fastest growing ones turbotax which helps people file taxes and quickbooks which helps small businesses manage accounting tasks then he used new methods to better measure reward and improve his employees performance to boost growth in the key businesses now as intuits old model of selling shrink wrapped software faces pressure from the internet mr bennett has his eye on two new growth engines in february he made intuits largest ever acquisition buying a company called digital insight corp for &# billion digital insight sells technology that helps banks give online banking services to their own customers by buying the company intuit intends to co opt the online banks that could steal business from intuits quickbooks customers by providing similar services online the company also plans this year to launch a new product quicken health meant to help people manage their medical bills insurance claims and other health care spending we talked to mr bennett about how he has propelled intuits growth over the past seven years and about what comes next here are excerpts from that conversation the wall street journal your background as a ge veteran is somewhat unusual among silicon valley ceos how does it make you different from an executive who has grown up in silicon valley mr bennett i think companies to be durable and great have to be great at innovation and they also have to be great at execution what i found when i came is that intuit was great at innovation frankly intuit founder scott cook showed me notes of some of the ideas from that he had that were really good ideas that for some reason we were never able to execute on we were a little less than a &# billion company that was run like a small company at the beginning there was always this paradigm you can be innovative or you can be rigorous and its a false paradigm you can be rigorous and innovative what ive found here is that weve in the past few years launched more new products than ever in our history weve had better reception in the marketplace so actually the rigor has made our innovation more successful because we can execute against the great ideas i think actually its been a great marriage of innovation which is what silicon valley is all about and strategic and operational rigor there are companies that are innovative and good at execution in silicon valley and those are the companies that tend to be durable apple obviously executes well so does intel wsj why was the company having trouble pushing past &# billion in sales in mr bennett the company was growing its just that the company was not growing as fast as it could it wasnt able to have the processes and the rigor and it was spending resources for instance on a bunch of businesses we shouldnt have been in back then there was a big vision of intuits role in the quicken world and there was a lot of energy and attention on that i believed that intuit didnt have a durable advantage long term in that space because quicken was being disrupted by online banking if you want to make money in consumer financial services generally people who own the assets who have your deposits will give free services and its hard to compete with that at the same time i thought we were underinvesting in small business and consumer tax wsj how would you define the "ge way " and how you do apply it outside of general electric mr bennett i think what you learn at ge isnt a lot different from what you learn in college the key is to apply what you learn to the situation that youre in i saw a harvard paper on this that was really thoughtful they talked about the match of the ge executives skills and experience to what the company needed where the match was good it was successful and where the match was bad it was not for example if there was a ge manager that was a finance driven cost cutter and they put that person in a job that was about growth the results werent good but in this case we were cited as a success because they took somebody who actually had more of a growth background at ge me and put him in a company that was a growth company wsj how did you apply the skills you learned at ge to intuit mr bennett ge had a big focus on growing talent and all the process and rigor around that we didnt really have any of that when i came to intuit we have a pay for performance system now we used to have what i called socialist compensation plans that means everybody gets the same raise its not pay for performance its a philosophy the opposite of mine which is pay for performance ge is a very pay for performance company wsj which approaches didnt work at intuit mr bennett ge did forced ranking of its employees i think thats really dumb i would never do forced ranking we do performance and theres a bell shaped curve but i think it would be very hard for me to say if you had people on your team who was no and who was no we could say who are the top performers and who are the strong performers and who are the lowest performers and put people in those buckets wsj as you started measuring more things how did you sell people on the idea mr bennett i dont think command and control works i think employees have a vested stake in the companys success and they want to understand what were doing to get better the issue is to communicate what youre doing and why with employees and if you get good at that youre all on one team wsj what would have happened if you had taken jack welchs approach at ge and applied it at intuit mr bennett i would have gotten voted off the island ultimately that is the consequence of taking these rote things that you learn at ge or any other company and misapplying them wsj in silicon valley theres this conception that what one might describe as an east coast way of doing business are things that slow down innovation how did you bring both business rigor and innovation together mr bennett when i got here intuit had "operating values " operating value no was "think fast move fast " i changed only one word in the operating values i changed "think fast move fast" to "think smart move fast " because doing dumb things faster doesnt get you anywhere making dumb decisions quickly is the path to destruction its not about speed its about doing the right stuff if you dont solve an important problem for customers better than anybody else youre not going to grow i think that we lost a little focus during the internet era we got a bit enamored of the internet we didnt create a lot of new products and businesses in that period that are around today and we bought a lot of companies that arent around today wsj jack welch says in his autobiography that he asks himself "what are you most afraid your competitors are going to do in the next two years to change the landscape and what are you going to do in the next two years to leapfrog any of their moves " how would you answer that question mr bennett id say its a great question that applied great at ge but our biggest competition at intuit is substitute methods or nonconsumption the reason thats different for us is that we grow the category to grow the business we could focus on beating our competitors and grow the category or we could focus on addressing customer needs and grow the category we have to do both ge has to focus on "what do we have to do to beat the competitors " but if you think about quickbooks weve got market share whats more important beating someone that has market share or converting million people that arent using accounting software who would you focus on ge is in sustaining businesses were in emerging businesses our strategy is to grow the business thats because we have such high share wsj so how do you keep intuit growing besides by taking market share mr bennett at the beginning we were very focused on the quicken businesses the consumer businesses they were losing money we exited a lot of businesses like quicken mortgage quicken loans and quicken insurance then we bought some companies some of which were good and some of which werent some we improved then exited then about four years ago we focused on growing our core businesses growing tax and small business that produced good results then we had the capacity to broaden our business portfolio thats when we entered online banking and health care now the strategy is to get bigger in each of those four our new health care product quicken health will come this summer that to me is a white space where there are a lot of problems and we are starting from scratch trying to build a brand new business that really doesnt exist today helping consumers manage financial aspects of their health care this is an industry thats ripe for simplification wsj eric schmidt recently said he expects the companys new google apps service to become one of its next big growth drivers what do you expect google to do and how do you expect to compete mr bennett googles not competing with us we dont have online word processing and spreadsheets does that mean they couldnt go out and build accounting software if they wanted to they could but look in the world that were in today you can be a competitor and a partner i can tell you were not going to get in the search business well see what they do at the end of the day if google decided to get into our business the answer would be whoever did a better job of building products to meet customer need would win just like our competition with microsoft wsj nick carr recently suggested in his blog that it would make sense for google to buy a company like intuit as it starts to sell more services to small businesses what do you think of that idea mr bennett there are a lot of similarities between the companies and a lot of differences we are a shrink wrapped software and an emerging service business and theyre a service business were neighbors and we have a lot of close ties were partners they could afford us can they run the company better to create synergies and where would the synergies come from theyd have to think about that i think there are a bunch of synergies between the companies but the nature of intuit would change quite dramatically and the question would be could google acquire intuit and get the value from the assets intuit has and better monetize them than we can theyd have to figure that out but we do have a lot of assets so gee if they called us and they havent but if they did wed talk about it but generally we dont speculate on what might happen wsj do you apply your approach to business to your personal life mr bennett sure the one thing i wasnt happy with is i was spotty in my workouts so this year i said well bull ive been doing rounds of golf a year now im going to have rounds of golf and workouts its march and ive had so far so its the same thing set a goal and reach it through personal discipline and accountability to yourself now im saying "ok whats my next goal " ms vara is a staff reporter in the wall
