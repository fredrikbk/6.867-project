animals who was pressing the operator of chilis and macaroni grill for a report on suppliers slaughter methods as shareholder activists turn up the heat on corporate officials at annual meetings officials seek inventive ways to stage manage the events and defuse potential controversies some tactics assign minders to activists require questions to be submitted in writing enforce time limits on speakers and use stationary rather than roving microphones creating a more orderly atmosphere annual meetings can become a "circus environment " says ron culp of public relations firm ketchum which advises companies on conducting the meetings he says many chief executive officers would "rather be in a dentists chair " companies must be deft in their stage management lest the efforts backfire wal mart stores inc this month apologized to some shareholders after a report that the company had sought to investigate the sponsors of shareholder resolutions public relations advisers say its normal for companies to do some premeeting research often using the google search engine or conducting newspaper clip searches on shareholder sponsors in the wal mart case however new york citys comptroller has asked government officials to investigate outside directors of home depot inc faced stinging criticism last year after they skipped the retailers annual meeting in a statement at the time the company said "many" directors were at headquarters "on company business " this year shareholder activists plan to confront executives and directors where they believe executives are overpaid one

executives "golden parachutes " ceo ivan seidenberg "is the poster child for pay for failure this year " says dan pedrotty director of the afl cios office of investment a verizon spokesman says mr seidenberg is fairly paid and declines to comment on how the company plans to conduct the meeting corporate efforts to damp such protests start long before the actual meetings companies often ask the securities and exchange commission to agree that they may exclude resolutions proposed by shareholders because they are misleading or arent appropriate matters for shareholder votes among other

pension investment policy at the american federation of state county and municipal employees sponsors of shareholder resolutions were allocated three minutes to speak other items were limited to one minute mr ferlauto rose at one point to object to directors absence when his one minute was up a pair of greeters took positions on either side of him at the microphone "they were intimidating enough that when they said your time is over i stopped talking " mr ferlauto remembers "it was definitely an orchestrated attempt to manage the meeting with big guys " home depot declined to comment on mr ferlautos experience and referred to a statement issued last year in which the company pledged to return "to our traditional format" and that directors would attend this years meeting scheduled for

comment mr prescott says he faced different tactics at the meeting in february of jack in the box inc another restaurant operator the company requested that shareholders submit written questions which were then read by a company official brian luscomb a company spokesman says the policy is "a way to keep the meeting focused on the agenda " mr prescott submitted a question about suppliers treatment of animals that included a graphic description of slaughter methods when the question was read aloud the speaker phrased it as a generic question about animal welfare mr prescott says mr luscomb says a senior vice president fully answered the question mr prescott disagrees other companies hold their meetings in unconventional locations which some shareholders suspect but the companies deny is an
