record the broad standard &amp poors stock index meanwhile has recovered all of its loss on feb investors arent just dipping their toes in the water theyre diving in head first making high stakes bets on everything from stocks to bonds to currencies investors seem to have decided that the federal reserves policy statement last month after it left interest rates unchanged wasnt as bad as they initially thought although many had been hoping for an interest rate cut later this year which would help stocks by reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers they now believe that steady rates mean the economy isnt so weakened that the fed feels it has to step in to spur growth meanwhile the shakeout in subprime mortgage lending or loans to the riskiest borrowers led to the bankruptcy

overseas markets such as china and india which have massive populations representing an untapped pool of consumers "this idea has been around for a while but its so seductive " says mr levkovich "when you have the market wobble like it did recently that mentality gets shaken a little but then it just reasserts itself " it was an drop in the shanghai composite that sparked the late february declines
