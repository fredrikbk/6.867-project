german for chutzpah call it a humanitarian offensive or call it historical revisionism but germany is on the march again seventeen years after german reunification and after top nazis were condemned at the nuremberg trials berlin is taking a newly assertive role in attempting to define permissible international conduct although german chancellor angela merkel claims that there is no effort to "reinterpret" germanys checkered history the evidence suggests a determined campaign at rehabilitation the premise seems to be that all states are capable of serious international offenses and that all states especially the united states must be subject to constant international correction the german experience in other words is not quite so unique and germany therefore not quite so culpable germany has become one of the worlds most vocal champions of both international legal institutions and "universal jurisdiction" under which one state claims the right to prosecute foreign officials and nationals for alleged "international" offenses germany is a particularly enthusiastic proponent of the hague based international criminal court icc and has declared icc "universality" to be one of its pre eminent foreign policy goals germany was also a leading member of the "like minded" group of states including most of the then european union members that successfully frustrated the clinton administrations plan to subject the icc to supervision by the u n security council president clinton had hoped to limit the courts obvious potential for transnational mischief making through ideologically motivated prosecutions meanwhile germany is using its term as president of the eus governing body to promote a new version of its own highly restrictive "holocaust denial" laws across europe at first glance in a europe beset with a rising tide of anti semitism and increasingly afflicted with historical amnesia about much of its th century history reminding the world about the evil of the holocaust seems a worthwhile undertaking but the new german offensive actually trivializes the countrys own crimes against the jews although a number of european states already have criminalized speech denying the holocaust the new german proposal would encompass the whole eu and add a highly significant feature henceforth it would also be a crime to deny or grossly minimize whatever that may mean any finding of genocide crimes against humanity or war crimes by the icc as justification german justice minister brigitte zypries recently stated "historically proven facts must not be denied when an international court determines that such crimes have taken place then you should no longer be able to say youre making that all up " yet berlin has little problem "engaging" the regime of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad a true holocaust denier who has pointedly threatened a renewed genocide against israel the german led eus failure to take any substantive action when iran recently seized as hostages british sailors and marines highlights this double standard at any rate criminalizing criticism of judicial rulings is unusual to say the least it strongly suggests an effort at what might be called holocaust normalization despite german claims that this is all a part of germanys "historic responsibility to fight racism and xenophobia " expanding holocaust denial type legislation to other instances of genocide or internationally recognized offenses does have the convenient effect of making germanys experience a bit less unique on the legal front germany has also adopted a broad "universal jurisdiction" law that will permit german prosecutors to run their own mini nuremberg trials against individuals alleged to have violated international criminal norms anywhere in the world it was under this law the code of crimes against international law that the leftist center for constitutional rights ccr has filed papers demanding the prosecution of former secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and several other u s civilian and military officials for alleged "war crimes" in iraq and the war on terror a similar case promoted by the new york based ccr in was dismissed but only after bringing postwar german american relations to a new low although the ccrs purpose here appears to be largely legal harassment its president was reported to have stated that the group hopes to ensure bush administration officials can never again travel abroad without legal hassles it remains to be seen whether german prosecutors will participate in such a mean spirited game of political gotcha germanys law certainly lends itself to these types of efforts then theres the case filed by german prosecutors in munich against cia agents believed to have been involved in the detention of a german national on suspicion of terrorist ties the man khaled el masri was in fact arrested in macedonia by local authorities there he claims to have been transferred to cia custody taken to afghanistan for interrogation and then released in albania as a victim of mistaken identification el masris civil damages suit filed in u s federal court in alexandria virginia was recently dismissed the munich prosecutors however have issued arrest warrants for individuals they believe to be cia agents and are now attempting to identify these men finally germanys leading political parties have for some time been quietly talking about a new museum or center in berlin to commemorate the ethnic germans driven out of poland after world war ii having seized much of eastern poland for soviet russia stalin compensated the poles with a slice of eastern germany from which much of the native population was expelled the u s never accepted these annexations until germany and poland did themselves and the german suffering was real enough the museum plan however along with efforts by private german groups such as the prussian claims society to obtain compensation from poland for confiscated land has the poles understandably suspicious it also is very much of a piece with other efforts by germany to obtain a measure of the victim status that in the modern world has become a necessary badge of moral authority that of course is how rehabilitation works messrs rivkin and casey served in the u s justice department under presidents reagan and
