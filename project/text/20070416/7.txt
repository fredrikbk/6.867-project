boss talk a special report beyond tech the chief information officers job isnt what it used to be just ask hewlett packards randy mott these days many chief information officers have bigger roles than just maintaining their companys technology systems many cios are increasingly being called upon to help hone corporate strategy meet customers design products and spur revenue growth thats because technology is being recognized as a tool to help companies deliver products and reach new customers rather than as just a cost item more companies are realizing that they can use their web site as more than a marketing device for instance and turn it into a huge direct sales channel randy mott is one example of this new breed of cio mr mott years old was previously cio at wal mart stores inc and dell inc before joining hewlett packard co in mid he was recruited to h p just as the computer and printer maker embarked on a new chapter under a new chief executive mark hurd at h p mr mott is revamping the palo alto calif companys vast tech systems which were burdened with a sprawl of old machines because of multiple acquisitions and world wide operations mr mott must among other initiatives whittle down h ps data centers world wide to six create a central repository of information on h p known as an "enterprise data warehouse " meet customers and keep tech costs under control he is being richly rewarded for his efforts mr mott gets an annual base salary of &# a hefty package of stock options and restricted stock and a &# million signing bonus according to h ps public filings he also will pocket at least another &# million under a long term performance bonus plan mr mott recently spoke about the challenges of managing and wielding technology in a large corporation today here are excerpts the wall street journal youve been a cio at three huge companies wal mart dell and h p how have technology demands in companies changed over the years mr mott tech is becoming more and more a part of every business process so its now part of any business conversation heres one example the back room delivery and inventory management is very technology rich now with rfid radio frequency identification which helps track goods and hand held scanners and in store processors if youd have looked at the back room years ago you might have said "theres no place for tech here " wsj has the challenge of managing so much technology in a big corporation grown mr mott its become a bigger challenge and more complex to manage managing tech has evolved to really reflect the complexity in the business world today with globalization and greater competition the consumer is more sophisticated in his or her expectations of technology and theres a faster rate of change the challenge for business is how to simplify processes and simplify it a basic example might be taking an order from a business customer to refresh their pcs some servers and upgrade storage in three different geographies think about all of the steps involved from actually taking the order to having that order arrive on time at all of the right locations with all of the right components included and then promptly follow up with accurate line item billing taxes shipping costs etc we have to align it with business strategy we have to make sure to absorb unexpected events like an acquisition and you want to be able to turn that around on a dime were trying to reduce cost while still consistently trying to deliver more in terms of capability wsj has the challenge of managing the modern office worker grown many office workers today are more tech savvy and often bring in their own technology to work like hand held computers and the latest cellphones without the sanction of an it department and h p has a huge employee population of around people mr mott employees do have much higher expectations in terms of realizing what it can do for them and they bring that expectation to the business climate they have higher expectations of mobility too when theyre out of the office they want to be able to connect to all the things they connected to in the office and you see that in the growth of mobility products like notebook computers and hand helds being able to support that is a really important thing my advice is that an it organization needs to recognize worker demand and try to run ahead of it ill give you an old example here a lot of it departments didnt consider the pc a part of it before believe it or not if you go back a ways it departments left the pc out there and treated it like an office chair yet people bought pcs into the office even if their it departments didnt connect them to the network or support them then it became a big deal in companies to get control of the pc wsj so what are some of the technologies that workers are adopting now mr mott its a more pervasive use of mobility in terms of notebooks they want hand helds that work well with existing office technology from a knowledge worker standpoint people really expect good information that they can pull together to make decisions in a meaningful way they want internal and external information from applications and tools that give them more complete information theyre not happy anymore just to take spreadsheets or small parts of data but are driving toward information that is spread throughout or readily available and accessible for us that means putting together our enterprise data warehouse that gets at all the information in the company in a complete way and in detail to help us understand how to better serve customers we intersect that with industry research to get a complete view wsj how much do ceos understand the role of cios these days mr mott i think it varies a lot were a little overdue in terms of ceos really needing to understand it and how it can be used within companies because its pervasive in everything they do it often gets treated as something that happens within a business as opposed to a strategic part of the business some ceos understand how to use it just like other levers inside the company others bury it and dont use it as a competitive advantage it just depends on their frame of reference and what their experiences have been at wal mart for example it was seen as a corporate asset much like capital capital is something you make strategic decisions with it wasnt seen as something you just automate things with wsj you often meet with customers is that unusual mr mott its not unusual ive had discussions with peers and in this industry today having a lot of best practice sharing is pretty common because of how fast things are changing the it community is keen to share information with a lot of peers i learn a lot from other cios and their business challenges wsj youre trying to make big tech changes at h p what are they mr mott there are five key initiatives theres the data center consolidation which is a physical data center change and a refresh and standardization of the technology theres the enterprise data warehouse which is all about getting better and faster information for our businesses and doing that in a comprehensive way and on a global basis theres work force effectiveness which for us is to get people to spend their time right including how they work and what tools they have to work with then theres trying to be world class with it in terms of how we manage it the procurement process and looking at overall cost structure and the last is around how we manage our portfolio of it projects and prioritize to make sure were doing the best for our business wsj how much time do you have to make all these changes mr mott its over a three year time frame were five quarters in and have seven quarters left wsj how much progress have you made mr mott weve named all the data centers in terms of location and have three out of six up and working by mid summer well have the other three up and running we also have detailed plans around transitions and retiring of old systems and were on target with that the enterprise data warehouse is up and running and were rolling out usage of that in the businesses and were on target in terms of cost which isnt something we talk about in detail so were well under way but we do have a lot of work left to do wsj how often do you meet and talk with h p ceo mark hurd mr mott were usually in communication on a weekly basis we get together once a month as an overall executive council we do operations reviews on a quarterly basis and these typically are a four hour deep dive we also do a number of checkpoints on the portfolio through the year wsj was there resistance to making so many tech changes mr mott one of the good things in our environment is that as a whole the company is engaged in big transformation not just it but from how complex it is and how much change it requires well change is never easy the other part of it is the speed getting people to quickly understand where were headed and to get them to grow in that direction and facilitate the change its been a lot of hard work and its ongoing wsj h p has been known for its liberal telecommuting policies which have now changed what have you done with telecommuting mr mott we made some early changes in that looking at who could and who couldnt telecommute and which jobs could and which jobs couldnt we now have telecommuters in the it organization today which is probably consistent with other it organizations thats down from before i joined telecommuting was pretty wide open before that was just some of the history of the company and it had gotten applied more broadly than really made sense now people who are proficient and whove shown they can perform over time qualify while those who didnt dont theres also the kind of job where it makes sense for the job to be done remotely where telecommuting will be considered if it doesnt make sense for the job to be done remotely then it doesnt qualify so its just common sense guidelines wsj how are the telecommuting changes working out mr mott its working out well now like any change there was some amount of noise in the beginning but its now very well understood ms tam is deputy bureau chief for the wall street journal in san francisco she can be reached at pui wing tam wsj com
