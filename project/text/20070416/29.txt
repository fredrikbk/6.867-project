ethanol boom gives cover for raising food prices americans face sizable increases in their grocery bills this year as a boom in ethanol production diverts more corn from the nations dinner table to its gas tank indeed their pocketbooks could feel the pinch for years to come high corn prices bad weather and steep energy costs have combined to make food a bigger potential contributor to inflation this year than it has been at least since when a cutback in dairy production boosted dairy prices and beef prices rose as mad cow disease disrupted trade the agriculture department says that retail food prices are likely to climb by to in fueled in part by strong demand for corn derived ethanol but michael swanson an agricultural economist at wells fargo &amp co thinks the rise could be an even sharper food prices are volatile by nature and economists generally shrug off such jumps because they tend to be offset over time by equally abrupt price declines but kenneth beauchemin a u s economist with consulting firm global insight says that the difference now is that the governments push to promote ethanol unlike a storm or other temporary factor "could affect prices for the next years " others also expect food inflation to persist "consumers are going to feel it at the meat counter first and theyll see marginal increases in other food products for awhile but we see the price increases lasting for a period of years " says cal dooley president and chief executive of the grocery manufacturers and food products association food prices are already on the rise the price of

transportation labor and energy costs as food companies face these higher costs they are also coming under increasing shareholder pressure to lift profits with the consolidation of grocery chains and the rise of powerful and cost conscious buyers like wal mart stores inc food companies have lost lots of their former pricing power for them "the increase in commodity prices provides a good excuse to increase prices " says burt flickinger managing director of strategic resource group a food industry consulting firm in new york theres been a lot of opportunism " says rick tolman chief executive officer of the national corn growers association who says "retailers are taking advantage of corn price increases to justify price increases " he adds that at &# a bushel corn only accounts for about five cents of the cost of a ounce box of corn flakes and cents in a six pack of soda pop even so higher corn prices are clearly having an impact they have sharply increased the cost of livestock feed typically a blend of corn and soybeans and a major component of meat production costs nationwide high feed costs among other factors are adding &# per head on average to the price meatpackers are paying for cattle according to cattle fax a cattle marketing information service based in denver that makes the average price per head about &# they are also encouraging farmers to send their animals

price he pays for meat has gone up since the beginning of the year and all his suppliers blame higher corn prices for example he says he is paying cents a pound more for boxed beef bringing the total cost per pound to about &# as a result mr begale has raised his selling price for steaks ground beef and lamb shanks by about "i had to raise my prices " says mr begale thats consistent with government data released last week showing that the wholesale price of beef jumped last month following spikes of in february and in january tyson foods inc one of the largest u s chicken producers has increased prices to its retail and food service customers three times in the past year "as more corn is being used for ethanol production prices have gone up significantly " said ceo dick bond at tysons annual meeting in february "we have no choice but to pass along the higher costs to our customers who then pass along their higher costs to consumers " kellogg co has increased the price of some of its cereals and frozen waffles in recent months and other food companies citing higher corn wheat and other commodity costs have done the same h j heinz co has raised prices on frozen potatoes and other products kraft foods inc has been raising prices on cookies and crackers its even getting more expensive to chew gum cadbury schweppes plc and wm wrigley jr co last month announced plans to

about three cents a pound and a tripling of the price of nonfat milk powder a key ingredient in his danishes so far he hasnt passed those increased costs along to his consumers but he says he will have to consider doing so if the price of milk eggs sugar butter and flour turn sharply higher when farmers were making their planting decisions last season they underestimated the demand for corn shifting four million acres from corn to soybeans at the time corn prices were lower having yet to signal the heavy demand from ethanol producers or the export market that have developed since even so

farmers will plant nearly million acres of corn the most since however their plans to plant fewer hectares of soybeans and wheat are pushing up prices of those commodities to combat the idea that corn

chicken prices " he says
