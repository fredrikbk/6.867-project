private investment funds and banks j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp for &# billion people familiar with the matter said late yesterday putting the embattled company into private hands at a time of intense political scrutiny of the student lending industry jc flowers &amp co and friedman fleischer &amp lowe llc plan to take a ownership in the newly private firm with j p morgan and bank of america each taking stakes in the company formally known as slm corp the buyout group plans to pay &# per share these people said nearly a premium to where its shares traded on thursday before word leaked out of a possible transaction the deal represents a turning point for both the private equity industry and the student lending business leveraged buyout firms have generally shied from making big investments in financial services companies because these investments cant withstand the same debt levels normally placed on leveraged buyout targets but jc flowers named for its well regarded chief j christopher flowers has chipped away at this for problem for years first buying banks in japan and germany and now the year old sallie mae indeed some shibboleths of the lending industry may soon fall by the wayside in this transaction while wall street has long believed that such lenders must maintain an investment grade credit rating there is the possibility that the newly private sallie mae wont receive one company officials said last night the purchase will be funded with &# billion in debt and &# billion in equity to ensure low cost access to capital bank of america and j p morgan have committed to some five years worth of backup financing some &# billion worth in the event sallie mae cant tap the overall financing markets sallie mae said in an interview mr flowers said he was attracted to three main factors student lending is "a business that is growing rapidly " he said "secondly with this set of partners we can increase the growth rate of sallie mae thirdly the company also generates strong cash flow and we hope to pay down debt faster " student lenders meanwhile have successfully ridden the waves of demographics around the u s where a large generation of young people are increasingly seeking higher education sallie mae which was a government sponsored entity until manages &# billion in student loans for million customers across schools under a number of federal programs the government pays subsidies to lenders so they offer lower rates to students as well as guaranteeing them if the borrowers default the change to private ownership enables the company to be more than a secondary market for government loans and move into a host of profitable new lines of work most notable is the market for so called private student loans which have no government guarantees and can carry higher interest rates and fees the sector has been booming because government aid and scholarships havent kept pace with skyrocketing college tuitions but lawmakers including sen edward kennedy of massachusetts chairman of the senate committee overseeing education have grown increasingly concerned about the terms of these loans and the sales practices surrounding them with a number of efforts under way to increase disclosure and perhaps curb their growth that is why this deal comes at such an awkward time sallie mae and other lenders have been big patrons of republican politicians but the tide turned against their business in earlier this year president bushs budget proposed making college more affordable by eliminating billions of dollars of subsidies to student loan lenders including sallie mae democrats including mr kennedy want to take an even bigger hit congress is also sure to focus on the arrangements standard in private equity buyouts that will keep the companys management in place while also awarding large stock and options grants this month rep george miller of california who is chairman of the house education and labor committee plans to hold a hearing about student loan abuses last week responding to reports of a possible deal mr miller expressed strong reservations saying a private sallie mae could lead to less information being disclosed to the public "the american people must be able to hold lenders and schools accountable to ensure that federal student aid dollars are being properly used to help students and families pay for college " he said last week the company settled allegations of deceptive sales practices with new york attorney general andrew cuomo who is investigating what he considers widespread corruption in the industry sallie mae agreed to pay &# million to a fund to educate high school seniors and parents about financial aid as part of the going private deal the company pledged to abide by mr cuomos settlement which includes a "code of conduct" that bars among other things paying for travel or giving anything with more than nominal value to college financial aid officers j p morgan doesnt intend to combine its existing student lending operations with sallie mae according to a person familiar with the situation instead the two businesses will operate independently and essentially become competitors j p morgans student lending business is contained within its retail division the transaction also represents a somewhat ironic end to j p morgans long relationship with sallie mae the two dissolved a nine year old joint venture in after j p morgan sued sallie mae contending that the rival lender was competing with the arrangement by originating its own loans sallie mae still services some of j p morgans loans bank one corp which was acquired by j p morgan in also had a relationship with sallie mae ubs investment bank sandler oneill + partners lp and greenhill
