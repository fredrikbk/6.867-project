boss talk a special report adivce to the boss a different track why arent there more women at the top of companies one reason they arent male clones women often are told that all they need to do to advance to the top of companies is acquire experience and show their competence sylvia ann hewlett founder and president of the center for work life policy understands why this is often easier said than done an economist by training ms hewlett has found that women have great difficulty following the same career path as men the author of "off ramps and on ramps keeping talented women on the road to success " which will be published next month ms hewlett surveyed close to women and men and found that most women take some time off work or intentionally avoid advancing for a while so they have time to care for children and elderly relatives getting back on the fast track is difficult and the growing number of jobs that require workweeks of plus hours and attention to clients is leaving women farther behind and costing businesses valuable talent some companies many of them members of the hidden brain drain task force which ms hewlett launched with others are experimenting with new ways to harness womens ambitions here are excerpts of a conversation with ms hewlett the wall street journal most people thought that by today more than three decades since many women launched careers in business and the professions there would be gender parity in senior ranks why hasnt that happened ms hewlett everyone thought if you just eliminated barriers and women filled the pipeline over time theyd be fairly represented in top jobs but this hasnt happened mostly because women arent male clones they find it very difficult to replicate the competitive white male career path they carry the bulk of responsibilities on the home front for children and also for elderly parents so fully of women have nonlinear careers wsj how would you describe a nonlinear female career ms hewlett about of women take an off ramp at some point in their career meaning they quit their jobs but just for an average years another substantial number take scenic routes for a while intentionally not ratcheting up their assignments for instance of highly qualified women have sought part time jobs for some period while others have declined promotions or deliberately chosen jobs with fewer responsibilities wsj can women who off ramp get back on track easily ms hewlett thats the problem the vast majority of them want to return to work for financial reasons and because they like their careers but once a woman stops working for even a year or two opportunities to re enter are few and far between just land jobs and of these end up having to take part time jobs wsj do women who take scenic routes hurt their chances for advancement as well ms hewlett these women also are stigmatized as not serious enough and often find it hard to advance wsj youve coined the term "extreme work" to describe the increasing number of jobs that require plus workweek hours as well as other demands such as attention to global clients and lots of travel does this trend also hurt womens chances to advance ms hewlett extreme jobs are taking their toll on the health and emotional well being of men and women even though a majority of people in these jobs say they love the challenge and adrenaline rush they get from them they also suffer more ailments such as high blood pressure and anxiety as well as relationship problems with spouses and children they have hardly any time for extreme jobs take a special toll on women who are being left behind just of women in our u s survey hold extreme jobs which is bad news for anyone interested in female progress extreme workers are the "a" team the bench strength for future leaders the data show that highly qualified women arent afraid of hard work and responsibility but its hard to sustain a hour workweek if you have serious responsibilities in other parts of your life wsj why should employers care ms hewlett for reasons that range from a tightening job market to retiring baby boomers companies cant afford to lose experienced well qualified women they arent easily or cheaply replaced top executives and heads of law firms and other service companies are just becoming aware of how many talented women are being forced off the leadership career track usually at early or midpoint stretches when men catch a wave of promotions that position them for top jobs later on wsj is there male resistance to addressing womens different timetables and paths ms hewlett for some business leaders accommodating womens nonlinearity is difficult because it means an end of an era it means men give up their last remaining competitive advantage over women i am not arguing that there is any kind of male conspiracy at work but the traditional model of putting in long workweeks year after year enables men to "shake off" most women as they move up the ladder so womens best chance for accommodation is an increasingly powerful business case the war for talent is heating up women are the best and most obvious candidates to fill the void left by aging baby boomers and other demographic changes wsj how are some companies responding to the need to retain women ms hewlett lehman brothers started to create flexibility and virtual workplaces because of concerns about security issues that started with the terrorist attacks of sept they had workers who needed to work at least temporarily from new places and then came the bird flu scare a few years ago which deepened the companys commitment to figure out how to enable employees to be effective from their homes and other remote locations by using an array of technology but these initiatives helped retain female as well as male talent they might otherwise have lost a man whose wife was relocated to florida was able to follow her there and keep working for lehman the company also has found that of employees who work from virtual locations report productivity gains wsj does lehman have other programs aimed at keeping talent ms hewlett lehmans encore program was started two years ago to help women whod quit jobs in the financial sector re enter the work force again no one is promised a job at lehman but participants attend panel discussions where they hear about new trends in their industry such as the heightened regulatory climate and they submit their resumes those who dont get hired still get to network and come away with renewed confidence wsj where else can women whove slowed their careers refresh their skills and get mentoring ms hewlett many other companies including ernst &amp young goldman sachs and citigroup have programs geared at retaining women and business schools and law schools now are starting programs aimed at talented people who want to restart careers wharton business school in march ran a weekend program sponsored by ubs for women with m b a s who hadnt worked for two to seven years there were courses on finance and marketing and advice on career switching followed by a day at ubss new york office no one was guaranteed a job but a lot of contacts were made wsj besides creating virtual workplaces what other things can companies do that convince women not to opt out ms hewlett time warner through its breakthrough leadership program has sought to sustain womens ambitions by giving them a place to bond learn new skills and mentor one another there have been nine of these sessions since attended by women graduates of the first class gave each other tiaras to remind each other not to wait to be rewarded for their industriousness and crowned by others but to pick their heads up and manage their own careers many of those graduates still have the tiaras hanging in their offices ms hymowitz is a senior editor and in the lead columnist at the wall street journal in new york she can be reached at carol hymowitz wsj com
