real time grading my hdtv homework a columnist finally takes the hdtv plunge unleashing a tidal wave of other purchases online edition last months column about taking the hdtv plunge generated lots of mail and discussion folks who knew their way around hd offered point by point advice and debunked some misconceptions i had for which im very grateful at the same time folks who shared my anxiety about big price tags and a blizzard of techie terms wanted to know what id bought and how itd worked out the need to give them an answer probably kept me from backing off and dithering for another few months to my amusement but not to my surprise none of my four tentative conclusions held up to further study to review heres what id decided was best for my wife and me and what actually happened  we want a flat panel and we bought one but its not on the wall and its not going up there any time soon we live in new york city where even the smallest renovation project is complicated and expensive putting our tv on the wall and hiding the wires and cables would require at minimum an electrician a plasterer matching old paint and dealing with our buildings co op board that would be expensive and tedious even if it all went as planned which it wouldnt my wife and i quickly decided it wasnt worth it im not sure what everest sized leap of faith made me think otherwise  we want plasma my concern about viewing angles was outdated we wound up buying an lcd i also was impressed with dlp sets which while not flat can be a good bargain compared with lcd and plasma  we want a inch set this was the tv equivalent of ones eyes being bigger than ones stomach we bought a inch set and even that was too big  were not building a home theater ha ha guess again in other words your typical tech project so what did i buy a sony bravia kdl s which is a inch lcd set that supports p and has one hdmi connection funny how a month ago that sentence would have been incomprehensible to me the bravia was a friends recommendation a smart friend whod done meticulous homework and vetted many models in her own hdtv search thanks megan sonys made such a botch of entering new markets in recent years such as getting its lunch thoroughly eaten by apple in digital music that i was a bit wary of a sony tv but between megans endorsement the bravias good reviews and my own inspection i was convinced ive only had my set for a week so that shouldnt be considered an endorsement the fact that the set isnt p or i didnt throw me we sit far enough from our set that the premium didnt seem worth it that single hdmi connection bothered me a bit more but i decided i would reserve the hdmi connection for the upconverting dvd player and use component video to connect the tv and the hd cable box with the non hd tivo box hooked up via composite video i felt like id done my homework but it was still nerve wracking walking back into the store where id inspected tvs knowing id walk out down nearly &# and then i didnt because the retailer a new york city institution id always respected started playing games with me the price had jumped dramatically in the couple of days since id had a conversation with a very helpful saleswoman and in her absence everyone else professed shock that such a price could have been offered i noted that the sticker on the tv and a sign next to the tv displayed different prices and was told that a customer could have switched stickers i was amused when the saleswoman peeled off the sticker to reveal another one that was still lower than the price now being quoted perhaps thered been a race to the bottom among sneaky sticker switching customers i walked out of that retailer and dont plan to ever walk back in again i took my business to another retailer had a far better experience and a day later had a giant box in my living room a bunch of boxes if my bravia were a shark id supplied a bunch of remoras as i decided various tv peripherals were no longer up to snuff id known that would happen but it was still amusing watching it occur first i concluded that our dvd player wouldnt cut it and we needed an upcoverting dvd player after some homework i settled on an oppo dv hd i also bought a calibration dvd which was probably silly and i needed a new cable box obtained after a brief wait in line at the cable company office one new item did solve a longstanding problem in our house one id been embarrassed to realize existed emily and i had both decried the fact that dialogue was often hard to hear on our tv with its two separate speakers but chalked that up to age or the evils of this wicked world nope we needed a center speaker i wound up buying one from sony one that came with small surround speakers too i hadnt intended to bother with anything that smacked of home theater our neighbors bedroom is right behind our living room wall but then of course id noticed that between the kitchen counter and the mantle two little speakers wouldnt be very intrusive next up on the shopping list subwoofer our old stereo receiver wouldnt support surround sound but it was already curb fodder anyway because i didnt have enough inputs on our old tv live tv went through our series tivo box but that wouldnt work with the bravia live tv looks much worse via tivo than on hdtv and with two different video signals i needed to separate the audio channels tivo audio is delayed with my receivers antiquated phono input useless told you it was old and tape monitor reserved for playing digital music via itunes i was left with two audio inputs and three sources i worked around this problem by running the hd box audio outputs directly into the tv but i knew that wouldnt pass muster with emily "so i switch the video and turn up the tv volume with one remote and then turn down the stereo volume with the other remote why " so i bought an onkyo a v receiver fussing with all this gear wasnt fun ok thats a lie it totally was but happily hdtv itself lived up to the hype the first night i flipped over to discovery hd in the heretofore unexplored upper end of the cable channels and found myself gazing in fascination at a guy sitting on a beach he wasnt doing anything particularly interesting and i didnt have the sound working yet but i didnt care i was happy to stare at the sand and the water and the sky the next night i rented the second "pirates of the caribbean" movie and while no technology could make orlando bloom and keira knightley terribly interesting gawking at the kraken and octopus faced bill nighy and the color of the sea was entertainment enough and then there were mets games the reason wed got hdtv in the first place an inning made everything worthwhile baseball was now borderline hallucinatory i could see the pattern of paint spray on the mets helmets and the little lip of the decal i kept getting distracted by fans in the front rows because for the first time i could see details of what they were wearing or doing but what really amazed me was the wide shot of the stadium from behind home plate shown upon return from most commercials on our old tv the scoreboard beyond sheas center field wall was a dark monolith with smudges of light that i knew were the out of town scores on the bravia i could read those scores perfectly it was like looking at a intricately detailed model of the stadium sitting on the other side of the glass did i make some mistakes of course its not a home project unless i do while i know we need to get used to it inches turns out to be more tv than we need the bravia dominates the living room which in our brooklyn digs means half our apartment giving it a frat boy bachelor feel you cant judge a tvs size in a showroom full of them before you buy cut out a piece of cardboard the size of the tv and see what it looks like if id done that and i was advised to do so i think we would have opted for a inch tv at most ive already seen the truth of some things hdtv philes had warned me about after hd broadcasts standard tv looks blobby and blocky hd broadcasts remain few and far between so you wind up looking for something to watch in hd that will seem funny in a couple of years like the whole family staring at the test pattern on some giant set from the early s and the mets away games arent in hd insult to injury the yankees are and ive got some logistical issues to figure out watching tv now demands multiple remotes unless we get a universal which id rather not do as emily and i are used to our tivo remote and love it and the biggest problem is tivos video and audio are now separate from the hdtvs that means if tivo decides to switch channels to record something you neither see nor hear its prompt the hdtv simply switches channels leaving you scrambling this is really fun in the middle of a key at bat im not sure how to fix that short of switching to a tivo hd unit a big new expense id rather not take on and then theres the question of furniture which kept me from taking the hdtv plunge for a ridiculously long time right now were housing all this new gear on and in an armoire i beheaded to my surprise emily agreed that made sense as a temporary measure until we got my dad to make something for us so before unpacking anything i took a screwdriver and saw to a perfectly good piece of furniture it seemed like a preposterous idea then and still does now but you know what somehow it didnt turn out too badly which i suppose sums up our hdtv adventure so far im not sure i really needed all this gear and theres some work yet to be done to get everything working the way it should be but for all that its been fun and im glad i did it so howd i do any advice for my tivo hd problem got some war stories about your own hdtv setup
