whats behind the stock market jitters june jitters are leaving investors frazzled after a strong may for stocks and an impressive start to shares tumbled last week amid growing worries about rising global interest rates inflation and whether the buyout boom that has propped up the stock market can continue thursday was a particularly ugly day all stocks in the dow jones industrial average declined as the benchmark fell points or but the weeks losses were trimmed on friday when the dow industrials jumped points or for the week the dow benchmark was off and the nasdaq composite index dropped other investments such as gold also fell so far this year the dow industrials are up and the nasdaq is up behind last weeks worries sudden troubles in the bond market in the past three weeks the yield on the benchmark year treasury note has soared to from a huge jump for bond yields which move in the opposite direction of their prices indeed on thursday the treasury market saw its worst price declines in more than two years bond yields now are at their highest levels in a year there were other troubling signs last week including bearish talk of treasury yields climbing to in the next five years by longtime bond bull bill gross manager of giant pimco total return fund why do bonds matter so much rising bond yields put pressure on the economy by making all kinds of debt more expensive including home mortgages and corporate loans at the same time higher yields make bonds more attractive to investors and thus make stocks relatively less attractive just as important if the debt markets run into difficulties that could bring to a halt the rash of mergers that have been running at record levels and have been a key underpinning to the stock market higher rates drive up the costs of the heavy borrowing that leveraged buyout specialists rely on to finance takeovers if the appetite for acquisitions wanes it likely will put a damper on the overall stock market analysts say "today the bond market and the stock market are more intertwined" because of the high level of leveraged buyouts or lbos says john linehan a portfolio manager for t rowe price value fund in baltimore "the stock market needs the fuel of cheap debt because these lbos need the fuel of cheap debt " one factor in the bond market woes concern about inflation or rising prices inflation eats away at the value of bonds as interest payments that are a fixed number of dollars can buy fewer and fewer goods and services now more economists are suggesting that inflation could be a growing problem as global workers even in china and india begin pushing for higher wages foreign central banks also are pushing rates higher amid strong economic growth around the globe in some ways yields on u s bonds are simply keeping up with global bonds yields on european and japanese bonds all have moved up in the last month in the past the fact that u s inflation is still running at a tame rate of about might not have forced up u s bond yields but the u s imports more than it exports and it has to borrow funds from abroad to pay for the difference so yields on u s bonds must stay competitive with those abroad to keep attracting foreign investors for a while rising bond yields were shrugged off by stock investors but as the key year treasury neared and then passed the psychologically important level last week investors started to get nervous part of the problem is that stocks have gone a long time without a severe downturn and some investors were looking for an excuse to pare some positions the prognosis for stocks rests partly on the outlook for bond yields and some observers say there is little cause for alarm martin barnes managing editor of bank credit analyst in montreal argues that u s rates wont surge because the u s economy is too weak and the housing market too troubled to justify much higher yields he also thinks inflation could ease a bit in the months ahead "a continued rise in bond yields and thus mortgage rates would be very bearish for housing and the economy implying that the fed would likely cut rates and bond yields would head lower " he says other analysts are more skeptical that the federal reserve can cut its target short term interest rate with global rates climbing but some are still sanguine about stocks noting that stocks are not expensive in relation to earnings "stocks can still do fine even if the year treasury yield gets up to or even " says al goldman chief market strategist at a g edwards &amp sons "but it does take a bit of the bloom off the rose " similarly michael boulton an investment adviser at financial solutions in mill valley calif notes that rates are still low by historical standards he believes stock prices will remain firm buoyed by strong corporate profits so what should stock investors do steer clear of expensive shares bank of america analyst robby ohmes recently lowered his rating on nike nke which is up more than in the past year citing tougher comparisons with the sneaker makers impressive performance also put together a wish list of stocks you wouldnt mind owning if prices resume their tumble one that analysts are warming to and which still appears reasonably priced allianz the huge munich based insurance and financial services company that trades in the u s under the symbol az allianz is seeing continued strength in its property and casualty insurance business and its u s life insurance unit is stabilizing the stock is up more than in the past year but allianz still trades at an attractive price earnings ratio of times its estimated earnings for the next months analysts have raised their earnings estimates for by more than in just the past weeks some analysts also like honeywell international hon a technology and manufacturing company that has seen increased revenue at its aerospace and commercial construction units the stock trades at a price earnings ratio of less than and
