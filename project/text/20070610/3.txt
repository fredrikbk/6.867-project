eyes on the road is initial quality still relevant gains across the board reduce the gap between auto makers online edition j d power and associates the market research firm came out last week with its annual survey of new vehicle quality and porsche came out on top with just problems per cars as reported by owners within days of purchase the worst brand land rover with problems per vehicles sold among the most improved daimlerchryslers mercedes benz the german luxury brand slashed its problems per score to putting it in fifth place from problems per and th place in "we have never seen this" big a jump in one year says j d powers joe ivers and hats off to ford motor co s lincoln brand which outdid mercedes bmw # with problems per toyota # problems per and honda # problems per and decreased its own problems per vehicles to from in but hold on what does all this really mean possibly less than it appears the j d power initial quality study as noted in the past has functioned for years as a sort of oscar or grammy award program for new vehicle quality the study compiles consumer responses to detailed questionnaires about "problems" encountered with new vehicles within days of purchase the studys methodology has evolved over the years to take into account such things as the distinction between a "dead by the roadside" failure and a customers dissatisfaction with certain design choices such as the german reluctance to take cupholders seriously power also does a good business acting as a consultant to companies that want to improve their scores selling highly detailed data about things gone wrong that company managers can use to attack problems in the design studio or the factory when j d power started publishing this survey it cast a harsh and very necessary spotlight on the significant gap in new vehicle quality between detroits auto makers and the best of the japanese toyota motor corp and honda motor co after an initial period of denial detroit went to work to close the gap as did later on korean auto makers hyundai and kia now most of the major auto makers have made so much progress that the power initial quality survey has less to offer the consumer lets stipulate that most journalists should not be allowed to analyze statistics in public but this example isnt that hard lincoln scored problems per cars that means on average buyers of new model lincolns reported one problem per car to j d power mercedes owners reported problems per cars put another way the mercedes owners identified on average more problems with each individual vehicle than did the lincoln owners except there is no such thing as of a problem problems are like pregnancy its all or nothing so really what the mercedes score suggests is that out of every cars nine had one problem and one had two yes im rounding in our "zero defect" consumer culture one or two defects in a new product is not supposed to be acceptable but i wonder what the shamans of silicon valley would do if their computers and digital music players had to match the current quality standards of the auto business the power survey still has influence within the industry because of the embarrassment manufacturers feel if their brands or vehicles score below the industry average mercedes benzs sub par performance in when its problems per score plunged it below the score that was the industry average helped to propel an ongoing quality crusade in germany and at the u s marketing operation in the u s mercedes marketers revved up a comprehensive customer care initiative known internally as customer one that among other things put more energy into reaching out to make sure that mercedes buyers understood the technology in the cars and trucks they were buying in germany mercedes engineers worked on problems such as reducing the amount of dust thrown off by the brakes in cars shipped to america a common j d power mark down a brake development task force working with the center that prepares vehicles for shipments to the brake dust phobic u s managed to reduce sharply the complaints about this issue says mercedes usa spokeswoman donna boland just as important mercedes took care as it redesigned three important model lines the s class the e class sedan and the m class sport utility vehicle to avoid design choices that had earned these vehicles demerits in the past the m class once an anchor on the brands overall score improved in from problems per well below the industry average to problems per for the survey better than the industry average j d powers mr ivers says the improvements in the m class during the second year of its life resulted from changes made to cure rough or hesitant shifting by the transmission and a difficult to operate rear hatch about two thirds of the improvements "are things we deem to be defects " the s class launched last year jumped from worst in its class in to tied with the best in the industry the audi a at problems per because of fixes to both design problems hard to use controls and mechanical concerns rough shifting still the change in the m classs score means that instead of roughly six out of trucks garnering two problems on average now only two out of ten trucks get tagged for having two problems the rest would have had on average just one problem in each case mr ivers counters that there are other ways to look at the results one problem can be enough to surpass "the customer threshold of pain" and result in damage to a brand he says "its absolutely not just decimal dots " he says "it tends to have a very huge effect on warranty costs " mechanical issues remain about half of all problems he adds but car makers have cut the average number of problems in half twice in the years since power began publishing its survey results compared to the s consumers dont need to be too concerned that a brand new car will fall apart during its first three months on the road theres some evidence that for the most part consumers arent so worried about that set aside porsche because after all whos going to buy a and then nitpick over the design of the cupholder among the other top brands some are doing very well toyota at problems per and others are close to becoming irrelevant mercury at problems per in other words its random is the long battle to improve new vehicle quality basically over the industry average for problems per in the power initial quality study has hovered between and for the past four years mr ivers says thats "a reasonable question and hang on to it for a year or so " in the meantime the bigger issue for consumers has become long term durability and guess what power has a survey for that due out later in the summer send comments about eyes on the road to
