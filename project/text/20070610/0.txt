answers for grandparents about plans our recent column about grandparents efforts to help grandchildren pay for college generated a number of questions from readers here well provide some answers the original column focused primarily on college savings plans which allow a person to set aside money for future college expenses the investment grows tax deferred and withdrawals when used for tuition books room and board and related costs are free of federal taxes one wrinkle is that even though s were first established in under federal statute the plans themselves are state sponsored programs not surprisingly different states have different rules and offerings about in total this variety prompted one reader to ask must the money be invested in a state program or "can such funds be placed simply in a certificate of deposit or a savings account under the grandchilds name " joe hurley an accountant whose web site savingforcollege com is one of the best sources of information about s and other savings vehicles says theres "no such thing as a self directed you cant pick and choose your investments " rather parents and grandparents have to stick with the states offerings a second question involved taxes "are the funds set aside for each grandchild tax deductible " you cant take a deduction on your federal return but states as well as the district of columbia allow for some deductions on state tax returns mr hurley notes another question what if a grandchild ends up not attending college or doesnt use all the funds earmarked for higher education here uncle sam offers a lot of flexibility you can change beneficiaries and use the money for a second or third or fourth grandchild or any other family member for that matter you can use the funds for a grandchilds graduate school if need be you can even use the money for your own higher education expenses one reader wondered whether a established by a grandparent would "disqualify grandchildren from financial aid to which they would otherwise be entitled " for the most part the answer is no typically a grandparents assets arent reported on financial aid applications and thus have no impact on a students eligibility for such benefits mr hurley notes that misunderstandings about plans seem at times to be as numerous as the plans themselves many parents and grandparents assume for instance that they can invest only in plans in the state where they live not so you can invest in any states and use withdrawals to help pay for expenses at any accredited college or university in any state but theres a catch when it comes to state tax savings in most cases you can take the deduction only if you invest in a plan in the state where you live grandparents in particular worry about who controls the one common assumption says mr hurley is that a grandchild gains control of the money at a particular age say or again not so the grandparent retains control of the as well as any and all disbursements until the last dollar is withdrawn
