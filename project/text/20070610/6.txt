love &amp money a dollar for all chores its time to stop this is the summer of my sons discontent schools out and my year old is learning all about the joys of family chores and he isnt happy about it he has griped about matching socks making his bed cleaning the bathroom mirrors and picking up stray toys hell often spend more time complaining about a chore than hell spend actually completing it and his version of "finished" often leaves much to be desired the way he sees it hes living a summer of torture enslaved by the meanest parents ever to give birth to an angelic child who only wants to enjoy his youth and every day im kicking myself not because i feel for his plight but because amy and i created this tempest several years ago by not standing our ground now were having to backtrack to undo the damage but im getting ahead of myself it all started three years ago back when we lived in new jersey i wrote a column about my then year old son always requesting payment most often a dollar whenever we asked him to perform some chore around the house at that time i noted that my wife amy and i generally didnt pay him for every little chore we asked him to perform though we did offer to pay for some duties that we figured were above and beyond the typical duties for a kid his age we reasoned at the time that chores such as setting the table were part of being a family but offering to help rake leaves deserved some remuneration as a way to encourage entrepreneurial spirit around the house with this approach he would learn to complete the tasks expected of him and strive to earn extra money by taking on added chores it sounded good a lot more progressive than the dictatorial approach our own parents took with us mark it though as mistake no because it led us to mistake no we found ourselves asking our son to do fewer and fewer of the routine family chores in part that was because as working parents we felt guilty about not spending as much time as we wanted to with him wed end up doing the chores we would otherwise assign to him because we could get them done more quickly leaving us more time to do things as a family it seemed the right and easiest thing to do at the time but it also brought us to mistake no we ended up paying him for the chores we did occasionally ask of him as well as the ones he offered to do when he wanted a dollar or two for some immediate purchase since we never required him to do the small things any chore suddenly became something out of the ordinary in the end our philosophy largely crumbled under the weight of its own fecklessness instead of paying him for extraordinary chores we ended up pretty much paying for anything he did amy and i know were at fault here for not being more well parental we went all soft in the middle about our time with our son recognizing too late that there is never enough time with your kids and our guilt shouldnt mean that we abandon our other responsibilities to teach our children important values and while im sure lots of moms and dads have a much stronger backbone than amy and i do in this area i also know based on chats with my friends that our struggle is a common one one of my friends says she and her husband are guilty of the same weakness they work hard during the week both at their jobs and then at night cooking cleaning managing homework and getting the kids bathed and ready for the next school day "spending the emotional energy that is too often necessary to force that a chore be done is just too exhausting " my friend says "its not right and im not happy about it but when kids have been cooped up in school all week and all they want to do is play its just easier sometimes to do the chore yourself do it right the first time and not have to argue back and forth negotiate and explain to your child just why it is you have to do chores to help the family " amy and i know those sentiments all too well but now we think we have time to reverse course and undo some of the damage weve done the tipping point came several weeks ago on a saturday morning i was cleaning dishes amy was vacuuming and we asked our son to match and fold the basket of unmatched socks that had accumulated in the laundry room first he whined about losing valuable weekend play time to what he saw as an utterly useless activity then when his argument failed to win his freedom he announced that his efforts would cost us &# wed had enough i looked at amy and exasperated said "we need to make his summer vacation all about teaching him that hes part of this family and that he has to kick in some sweat equity too " she agreed and we informed him of our plan to educate him about pitching in to help the family for no pay and for no other reason than thats the price of admission to be in any family his school year ended a few days later on a thursday friday morning amy had posted on the kitchen table a small list of chores he needed to complete and check off before the sun set simple items like making his bed and picking up his clothes based on the magnitude of moping that morning youd swear we asked him to plow acres with a trowel but we stuck to our guns and weve been requiring him to do various chores almost daily its only been a couple of weeks since our change of heart but weve actually noticed a change in him he still grumps on occasion about us stealing his childhood and replacing it with time in the gulag but the past tuesday was a pretty good example of how its shaping up amy left him his daily note of chores and i didnt have to remind him to do anything he awoke read the list completed his duties and said nothing except to inform me politely that he was done not once has he asked for payment in the end i think amy and i have learned more from this experience than our son has in particular weve realized again that our parents did things like impose unpaid chores on us for a reason sometimes the classic approach to parenting is classic because it works jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney wsj com
