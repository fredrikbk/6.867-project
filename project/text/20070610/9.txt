in the market but many are discovering the advantages of "bootstrapping" or using little or no external capital and conserving as much cash as possible to grow the business its about finding effective ways to build a business yourself without running thin on cash there are many compelling reasons to do it for one the fewer outside investors you take on the less equity and control you forfeit to people who often have vastly different priorities than yours outside investors may want the business to grow as rapidly as possible so they can see quick returns on their money even when slow growth

of the company " says bill payne an expert on private investing for the kauffman foundation a kansas city mo center for entrepreneurs whats more keeping a tight lid on spending during the start up phase means the mistakes you make will be far less expensive than if youd spent a lot he adds there are many methods that bootstrappers use to self finance and save on cash for starters many tap into

until the business is profitable enough to stand on its own there are also business plan competitions and government grants available to some start ups as an alternative to outside investors and
