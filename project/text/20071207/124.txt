who really pays u s corporate income tax you and i do the findings of the national bureau of economic research study on the affects of high corporate income taxes are a no brainer "corporate tax war " review &amp outlook dec as a small business owner my choices are to either pay out my profits in payroll and or profit sharing or pay them out in taxes this assumes that the cash is even available year end profits do not necessarily equate to a flush year end cash position especially if you happen to have a big fourth quarter i originally organized as a subchapter s but changed to a standard c corporation after a couple of profitable year ends with inadequate cash positions resulted in paying personal income taxes on income that i never actually realized as it is i am forced to tie up cash reserves throughout the year either in the form of a payroll escrow or in estimated tax deposits my business needs capital to expand i need to add at least two employees and we need to move into a larger facility both for office space and to develop our warehouse operation due to the impact my corporate tax rate has on my cash position i will be forced to finance most of the expansion cost which will limit the overall scope the result is that l will probably only hire one employee now and i will be forced to draw out the development of the warehouse operation as stated in your editorial high corporate taxes do indeed discourage investment and significantly reduce cash flows and they encourage excessive corporate debt reduce the maximum rate to how about taking it down to that would be more reasonable mike zacharias houston since corporate taxes have accounted for only between and of total federal revenues yet that small tax distorts virtually every major business decision including locational choices and has given rise to a huge tax manipulating and avoidance industry which employs legions of bright tax lawyers and accountants in and outside the corporate sector abolishing that tax outright arguably would be the best supply side economics imaginable curiously one rarely hears corporate executives call for that salutary step why might that be so a clue can be had in the fact that corporations cannot possibly pay the corporate income tax because they are not human beings instead that tax always is fully passed to one or all of three groups of human beings to customers through higher prices to shareholders through lower returns on capital or to employees through lower take home pay under fierce global competition the potential of shifting corporate taxes to customers often is limited similarly in a global capital market the corporate tax cannot easily be shifted to capital owners who have the option of taking their capital elsewhere economists therefore suspect that the bulk of the corporate income tax is shifted back to the least global mobile target the employees liberals in particular should therefore favor the abolition of the corporate income taxes every top corporate executive runs two business firms simultaneously the corporation he or she is hired to manage and his or her own personal multi million dollar household business it is only human that corporate executives generally favor cuts in the individual income tax which accrue to their personal businesses to cuts in corporate taxes which accrue mainly to other people it can explain why there were virtually no voices in the corporate community for using the &# trillion cumulative budget surplus president bush in believed he faced for the coming decade to abolish the corporate income tax or at least to cut it drastically much of that imagined surplus was spent on huge cuts in personal income taxes to the cheers of the corporate community uwe reinhardt james madison professor of political economy princeton university princeton n j its nice to read that the president will propose a cut in the corporate tax cut i only wish he would propose that it be abolished altogether unfortunately too many americans are ignorant of basic economics and too many democrats love the corporate tax issue for its demagoguery value corporations after all have to "pay their fair share " the president could do the nation a big favor if he were to explain in simple terms who really pays the corporate income tax hint it is consumers its abolishment would supercharge the economy eric dalton little rock ark
