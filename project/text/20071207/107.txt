weekend journal review books words between wayward aristocrats the mitfords edited by charlotte mosley harper pages &# near the end of nancy mitfords novel "the pursuit of love" comes a delicious mitford moment when two young aristocrats in an english country house await the expected german invasion in the summer of one of them bursts in on the other "youll never guess she said in a thousand thousand years who has arrived "hitler i said stupidly " in real life the remark would not have been fanciful or stupid for if there was any family with members who might have welcomed the fuhrer to england it was the mitfords the th century expression of an ancient line going as far back as saxon times the familys barony was comparatively recent though conferred by edward vii in the mitfords had no big familial estate but they did possess an enormous talent for eccentricity if such a tame word can possibly encompass the six sisters whose letters charlotte mosley has brought together in "the mitfords " one sister unity blessed with nordic good looks and the middle name valkyrie had been hitlers frequent companion in germany in the s and often rumored to be his mistress so distressed was she by the outbreak of war that she shot herself in the head in a munich park on the very day the war started she survived and hitler sent her to recuperate in a swiss clinic from where her mother a diehard fan of the fuhrer and her youngest sister deborah brought her home in an invalid for the remaining six years of her life older sister diana who defended hitler until her death in had been married in to british fascist leader oswald mosley in the berlin home of dr and mrs josef goebbels with the ubiquitous fuhrer as a witness he gave the happy couple a signed picture of himself as a wedding gift dianas staunchly antifascist sister nancy warned the authorities that diana was "an extremely dangerous person " and so she was arrested in the summer of and joined her husband as a resident of one of his majestys prisons the couple would not be released until over the furious objections of another sister jessica who was naturally a communist she wrote an impassioned letter to "cousin winston" churchill imploring him not to do release them with this political hornets nest it is not surprising that the remaining two sisters pamela and deborah were determinedly apolitical one of the most remarkable aspects of the mitfords as charlotte mosley dianas daughter in law puts it in her introduction is that "between them they were close to many key figures of the last century " through marriage and bloodlines the family was affiliated with "uncle harold" macmillan de gaulles closest adviser fred astaire and even president kennedy whose sister kathleen was married to deborahs brother in law their friends included evelyn waugh john betjeman lucian freud the duke and duchess of windsor and the current prince of wales thus are the mitfords and these letters only of those in the possession of the only surviving sister the duchess of devonshire so fascinating odd they may have been and endless fodder for the tabloid press their mother is said to have remarked "whenever i see the headline peers daughter i know its one of you" but they share much with families everywhere feuds and fondness special jokes repeated references to particular events and special hobbyhorses nancy already interested in frederick the great of prussia who would be the subject of her last book writes to diana in about the prudish self censorship of thomas carlyle a frederick biographer "eddy vita sackville west has seen a london library book in which fredericks homosexual goings on are described &amp in the margin is ay de mi i e "woe is me" in carlyles writing shrieks the old fraud not one word in the life " deborah writes to nancy that "the queen is coming to tea on fri what shall we talk about i wonder cant think of anything " later deborah imagines that if only she had nancys brain she "could converse in frog french and keep my end up " jessica separated from the other sisters by ideology style of life deliberately downscale and geography she lived in oakland calif displays a lot of mitford characteristics in her letters here and apparently passed them on to the next generation after the publication of her memoir "daughters and rebels " in jessica wrote nancy that her son "benjy as usual is being a hopeless tease and when called on to read the reviews insists on reading the cooking hints and letters to editor etc on the other side " apparently nancy disliked every one of her brothers in law all of whom cordially reciprocated the feeling but when she suffered agonizing torments for three years before finally succumbing to hodgkins disease in the devotion and sympathy of all four surviving sisters is manifest in their letters jessica and diana even put their lifelong estrangement on hold at the deathbed although it was resumed immediately after of the sisters archivist deborah and the editors mother in law diana come off best although the facts obtrude inevitably diana to unity in october "i am sitting in a bower of orchids envying you because i expect you are still in the fuhrers train the sight of the fuhrer walking across the sunny garden of the reichskanzlei the chancellery in berlin was the happiest moment of my life " unity to jessica in april "of course one cant separate ones politics &amp ones private life as you know nazism is my life &amp i very much despise that democratic liberal conservative english idea of walking about arm in arm with ones opponent in private life and looking upon politics as a business or hobby i naturally wouldnt hesitate to shoot him esmond jessicas communist husband if it was necessary for my cause and i should expect him to do the same to me but in the meanwhile as that isnt necessary i dont see why we shouldnt be quite good friends " charlotte mosley is wrong i believe in writing that dianas lifelong defense of hitler resulted from her being loyal to her husband oswald mosley may have been a fascist and anti semite to his marrow but unlike diana he was wary of hitler and nazism in their days of triumph and loath to defend them then or later nancy considered her sister diana more dangerous than sir oz as she called him and this opinion was behind nancys wartime denunciation of her diana only found out about it after nancys death and charlotte mosley believes that "had she known it is likely that she would have cut nancy out of her life forever " the mitford saga was a continuing drama with the private and the public clashing again and again but the sisters had the stiff upper lip of their class and it must be said a way with words not that words always came easily jessica wrote to deborah in that she was writing an article for esquire on ronald reagan then a rising california politician "as i know nought of either movies stars or republican politics you must say its difficult i went to hollywood to look into all those matters r reagan the repubs etc which was rather bliss the writing part is the torture " mr rubin is a writer in pasadena calif
