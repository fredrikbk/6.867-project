redefining conservatism des moines iowa stepping out for a press conference here monday mike huckabee fielded the ultimate question just how conservative are you "im as conservative as anyone could hope to be or want to be or needs to be " replied the smiling former arkansas governor never missing a beat and following up with a boilerplate summary of his belief in "lower taxes " the "sanctity of human life" and a "strong military" before moving ever so swiftly on to the next question it was trademark huckabee sounds great explains little its a strategy that has so far served him well rocketing his campaign in recent weeks to the top ranks of the republican presidential field the question is whether he can continue to pull off that trick now that hes receiving belated media scrutiny a few days following the candidate on the iowa campaign trail suggests it could prove tough if mr huckabee does turn out to be everything republicans "want" or "need" in a conservative it will only be because the definition of a conservative has morphed to include tax hiking protectionism corporate scolding and an unserious approach to foreign policy what arent in doubt are mr huckabees social values credentials he has an undisputed record on questions of abortion and gay marriage and hes spent no small portion of his limited advertising money making sure iowa voters know it christian conservatives make up an estimated of the states gop vote and by all accounts hes slowly locking up that vote that alone accounts for a fair share of his recent rise in the polls mr huckabee is the charisma candidate like another man from hope ark the one time pastor is an extraordinary speaker hes self deprecating and funny has perfect timing and never struggles for an answer he has that rare ability to pull out just the right story in response to any situation and to deliver it in a folksy southern way at a meeting in newton iowa when talking about the importance of marriage mr huckabee notes that in his years with his wife janet shed never been "wrong " he waits a beat and throws in that he likes "sleeping on the bed not the couch " people chuckle when one attendee praises mr huckabee as the "nicest" gop candidate mr huckabee quips "i tend to agree i know these guys theyre bums " more laughter along with values the vast majority of the voters interviewed after these events said their top reason for supporting mr huckabee was that he was the only candidate who struck them as "genuine" and "sincere " the yawning questions are mr huckabees stances on those other big gop voter concerns national security and the economy when he can get away with it mr huckabee is vague broadly supporting "school choice " "health care reform " "lower taxes" and a "strong america " its when hes pressed for details that things get dodgy on the stump mr huckabee likes to point out that we are in a "world war" against terror and that his first duty would be to protect americans yet dont expect the arkansan to stand firm against liberal opinion over americas more controversial strategies on monday he became the only republican candidate to attend a meeting with retired military officers who have complained about the bush administrations supposed use of "torture " at an ensuing press conference mr huckabee quickly jumped on the politically popular bandwagon to condemn "waterboarding " and to further declare his support for closing down guantanamo bay because of the "symbol" it "represents" to the "rest of the world " on other questions of foreign policy the arkansan has yet to prove he is ready for international prime time asked how hed handle the iranian nuclear threat his stock answer is that america needs to become "energy independent in years " thereby denying iran oil money "iran i promise you they wouldnt have enough money to build a reactor just by selling rugs " he explained no word on why this didnt stop north korea when asked at a media dinner about the front page news that the latest national intelligence estimate had downgraded irans nuclear threat mr huckabee admitted he didnt even know about the report a populist at heart mr huckabee claims hes "no protectionist " but over and over this week he complained about the u s trade deficit with china and vowed in the best democratic tradition to only sign "fair trade" deals to bring up big companies is to invite a huckabee lecture on the "greed" of corporate executives who tower over "average employees " mr huckabee likes to say he cut taxes in arkansas times and has collected devotees around his promise for sweeping tax reform via the "fair tax " he promises to abolish the irs and along with it all current income corporate payroll and other taxes to be replaced with a national sales or consumption tax hes also promised repeal of the th amendment which established the income tax to ensure americans dont get double taxation the chances of actually accomplishing this are about as likely as christmas three times a year but the benefit of mr huckabees dreamy tax proposal is that it has until now allowed him to avoid talk of his own checkered tax past in little rock that tenure included sales tax hikes strong support for internet taxation bills raising gas and cigarette taxes etc by this week mr huckabee had been slammed on this tax history so much he was no longer disputing the details when asked if he didnt have a "mixed" record mr huckabee shot back "most everyone who has ever governed does " before insisting that even the great reagan had raised taxes while at the helm of california another benefit is that mr huckabee hasnt had to talk about what hed do with the existing messy tax system when i pointed out the unlikelihood of a fair tax and asked how hed handle the real world questions of the bush tax cuts the exploding amt and high corporate taxation mr huckabee allowed that hed keep the bush cuts said something about the problems democrats face with the amt and launched back into a discussion of the virtues of the fair tax voters are only now beginning to hear some of this and mr huckabee with little money or infrastructure in other primary states is still a long way from the nomination but if by some chance he keeps up this surge republican voters need to understand they are signing up for a whole new brand of "conservatism "
