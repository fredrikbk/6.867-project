in stock option gains and retirement pay to settle civil and federal government claims related to stock option backdating the settlement comes a year after the options backdating scandal led to dr mcguires ouster from the minnetonka minn company one of the largest u s health insurers dr mcguire had been among the most successful and highest paid executives in the u s stock options allow executives to buy stock at a fixed price generally the market price on the day the options were granted in the scandal dozens of companies pretended that options were granted at an earlier date than they actually were they picked dates when the stock price was at a low point allowing executives to reap outsize gains more than corporate officials have lost their jobs in the scandal brian foley a compensation consultant in white plains n y said he believes dr mcguires &# million repayment represents the largest giveback related to executive compensation abuses in history "you have to applaud the sheer magnitude " mr foley said "on the other hand he still walks away with a lot " dr mcguire retains about million stock options that currently could be cashed in for a gain of roughly &# million on top of about &# million in pay he pocketed while running unitedhealth from to in the early s former junk bond king michael milken contributed &# million to settle civil actions related to the governments insider trading investigations dr mcguires forfeiture settled two related civil actions yesterday one settlement was with a special committee of unitedhealths board assigned to probe

he was ousted for a total of &# million shareholder representatives said they approve of the deal the board committee reached with dr mcguire the giant payment helped to settle a separate securities and exchange commission complaint which also included an additional &# million civil penalty the largest to date against an individual in a backdating case dr mcguire neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing he will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years "it reflects not only the egregiousness and impact of mcguires conduct but also shows the resolve of the enforcement division to hold executives accountable in these cases " said rick firestone associate director of the secs enforcement division dr mcguire still faces a criminal inquiry into the unitedhealth options scandal by the u s attorney in manhattan although it isnt clear whether that will continue in light of the sec action it is also possible that other former unitedhealth executives will be targeted by the sec which said its investigation continues the twin settlements mark a milestone in the case which began in march with a wall street journal report about options grants to dr mcguire and other executives that had mysteriously good timing the grants consistently happened at low points in the stock price dr mcguire steadfastly denied that he backdated the options but last year an internal probe at unitedhealth concluded that millions of stock options were likely backdated on dr mcguires watch the company was forced to restate &# billion in earnings over a year period as it reflected the value of the extra compensation to dr mcguire and other executives the probe led to the wrenching decision to oust dr mcguire a lung disease specialist and longtime ceo who built one of americas largest health care companies through a series of mergers yesterday the sec backed the boards conclusion stating flatly that dr mcguire used "hindsight to pick advantageous grant dates " in a statement yesterday dr mcguire said "i am very pleased to have reached a resolution that puts these matters to rest " he added "i am extremely proud of all that our team accomplished at unitedhealth group to improve health care and build a highly successful and innovative company " the statement didnt discuss the substance of the backdating allegations his lawyer david brodsky said dr mcguire "deserves great credit for taking full responsibility to resolve the options dating issues " mr brodsky said his client "more than paid back every penny at issue " the board committee said united healths current chief executive stephen hemsley plans to voluntarily have all of his remaining options repriced that means he is effectively forfeiting &# million which comes on top of &# million in gains he agreed to give back last year on options with questionable grant dates the committee concurred with the internal probes finding last year that mr hemsley played no major role in improper granting of options david lubben unitedhealths former general counsel also has agreed to repay &# million in prior stock option gains and surrender unexercised options valued by unitedhealth at more than &# million in total the company said mr lubben will have repaid more than &# million the company says it has clawed back about &# million overall from former and current executives more
