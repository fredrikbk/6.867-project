ahead of the tape survey to trust is household poll the real deal like moonshiners wall streeters seem disposed to mistrust government bureaucrats todays jobs report could fuel their fire economists polled by dow jones estimate jobs were added to u s business payrolls in november down from octobers but still strong enough to help allay worries about a recession getting a read on the job outlook has been tough surveys of the manufacturing and service sectors by the institute for supply management suggest the jobs picture deteriorated last month recruiting firm hudson highland and online job advertiser monster worldwide also point to a slowdown weekly applications for jobless benefits have also been drifting higher on the other hand a report from payroll company automatic data processing and economic forecasting firm macroeconomic advisers hints that private payrolls rose by a robust jobs in november and by even more when government jobs are counted but the adp report hasnt been as accurate as its promoters said it would be when launched last year all of these numbers can be heavily influenced by statistical assumptions made by economists about business start ups and shutdowns it takes time before new companies become part of the sample of firms the labor department regularly polls to account for the jobs start ups create the statisticians have to make some educated guesses the problem is that at turning points in the economy this "birth and death" model can go out of whack heading into a recession the number of new businesses drops leaving government estimates of business births overstated artificially pushing up job figures in a rebound the opposite happens in january payroll statistics showed that the economy had lost million jobs the previous year later revisions showed the loss was greater million jobs partly because of this problem statisticians also have to make sure that they properly account for the relative importance of different sectors when once hot sectors like housing go cold the sample sizes in the government numbers can get kooky overweighting some sectors that dont matter as much as before in addition to surveying businesses to produce payroll employment numbers the government surveys households to produce unemployment statistics in some ways this household survey gave a better depiction of the deterioration in jobs now the household survey is flashing red again for october it showed there were just more workers than there were a year ago compared to gain shown in the payroll figures if the household survey is giving the right read the payroll figures are overstated to the tune of one million jobs the household survey is based on a much smaller sample of workers than the survey of businesses that the payroll figures come from that means it tends to be a lot noisier and while it is good at pointing to big turns in the labor market it can be hard to distinguish signal from noise until after the fact that said with anecdotal evidence piling up that the job market is weakening it makes sense to keep a close eye on that household survey send comments to justin lahart wsj com
