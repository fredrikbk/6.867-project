imf plans to cut jobs lift income moves by new chief are part of bid to remake lender cashing in on gold hoard washington the new chief of the international monetary fund in his initial bid to remake the institution and reduce its deficits plans to cut the staff by as much as including the first significant round of layoffs since the imf was founded in the planned cuts are part of an effort by dominique strauss kahn to keep the imf relevant at a time when developing nations are growing rapidly often have fat reserves and have little need for imf aid the cuts are also part of his strategy to win u s and european backing for a plan to sell part of the imfs gold hoard and invest in income producing assets to put the imf on a sounder financial footing "all this is possible only if i have the commitment by different governments" to boost imf income mr strauss kahn said in his first extensive interview since taking office on nov "if not nothing is done " referring to the imf the year old former french finance minister known for his bluntness said "this institution works well with dedicated people and very high level staff but it is a factory to produce paper " during the interview mr strauss kahn who is trying to turn the imf into a force in global economic policy making dived into several controversies on currency questions he said the euro is "probably on the strong side " and described the sinking dollar as moving "in the right direction " echoing calls in the u s and europe he said china should let its currency appreciate but said that wouldnt be sufficient to restore balance to the world economy "if we had a magic stick to solve the question of the chinese currency today it wouldnt settle world imbalances " mr strauss kahn said china needs to boost domestic consumption as well as to diminish economic inequality at home he said adding that he will press that argument with chinese leaders when he meets them in february the imf also has an important role in assuring that sovereign wealth funds huge state owned funds that are increasingly investing in the u s and europe act in a market friendly fashion he said critics worry that some nations such as china saudi arabia and russia will use such funds to boost their political power "the question is not privately owned or publicly owned investment the question is do the funds act as the markets expect them to do " mr strauss kahn made sharp distinctions though between sovereign wealth funds owned by saudi arabia norway and other oil rich nations and those owned by china countries with natural resources are building investment funds to provide for future generations when those resources run out "if we criticize and isolate them they just have to keep their wealth in the ground" by producing less he said chinas &# billion sovereign wealth fund however is benefiting from an export boom partly powered by an undervalued yuan "in this case you have less argument that those sovereign wealth funds are well founded " he said the imf is putting together a code of "best practices" to guide sovereign wealth funds it is in the interest of the funds to follow such rules to avoid being shut out of western markets mr strauss kahn said on revamping the imfs finances mr strauss kahn said the fund is facing an annual deficit of &# million around assuming loan demand doesnt pick up he would reduce the deficit by one fourth about &# million by cutting the imf staff of by to positions he said he doubted that "voluntary separation" offers would be enough so layoffs would be necessary past imf staff cuts have been tiny job cuts in in trimming the imf bureaucracy should produce a lot of savings he figures he also said he expects to cut the number of economists now and replace some of them with hires from financial markets who have a better feel for how markets operate in exchange for these savings he wants support from the u s and other large shareholders to boost the imfs income as recommended by an outside panel this year he would sell metric tons of gold from the imfs stock of tons to create an endowment whose earnings would boost imf income he also would invest imf reserves in higher yielding instruments both changes require approval by the u s congress and other countries parliaments the gold sales are opposed by mining interests which worry the sales could depress prices u s treasury secretary henry paulson said in october that "its time to roll up our sleeves on the expenditure side" before looking into additional income for the imf mr strauss kahn was responding to that call and similar ones by other financial leaders yesterday a treasury spokeswoman said "we look forward to working with strauss kahn and other member countries at the imf" on imf financing but she didnt comment specifically on the planned job cuts although mr strauss kahn said he would cancel the cuts if he didnt also get approval for the increase in income it would be hard for him to make the threat convincing the imfs members are likely to force him to go through with the job cuts anyway
