weekend journal taste de gustibus books of the new world and the old as a little girl newly arrived in america i couldnt wait for the saturday afternoons when my mother and i would board the subway near our home in brooklyn for our weekly outing to the donnell branch of the new york public library in midtown manhattan it was our favorite corner of new york so i was sad when it was announced last month that the building housing the donnell was being sold to a developer paul leclerc who heads the new york public library system said that the property didnt measure up to its neighbors on tony west rd street a stones throw from fifth avenue on a block that houses one of the citys greatest attractions the sleek renovated museum of modern art donnell or some semblance of it will survive but in a considerably smaller form it will be lodged on the ground floor and a couple of subterranean levels with a modern luxury hotel sitting above but the "poor shabby" building as mr leclerc calls it that welcomed us when we were shabby and poor will be no more public libraries have always embraced immigrants especially in a strange expensive city where so much seems off limits they are among the few enclaves that take in newcomers no questions asked and for those who cant afford to buy books and many immigrants cannot they can offer a better education than any school after getting out of the th street station my mom and i would march up seventh avenue passing the americana now sheraton hotel and turn at rd toward the hilton i am sure that even then there were more luxurious hotels to be found in new york but both seemed the epitome of american opulence to me when we crossed sixth avenue we would walk past the designer ateliers and then the museum of modern art before getting to donnell those blocks became a window into this gilded new world we had not fully entered we couldnt afford the americana the hilton or for that matter the museum rather than going into moma itself which had an entrance fee of &# in the s forbidding to us at the time we would stroll into the gift shop browsing through postcard replicas of the artworks upstairs our pilgrimage ended with donnell no entrance fees there the only barrier was the stern librarian who peered at me when i tiptoed into the young adult collection on the second floor my home was the childrens section so cozy which housed a wonderful collection of books not simply the american childhood classics but in one special corner a bookshelf overflowing with french books we had emigrated from cairo where french was my first language my mother despaired that at p s in brooklyn i was becoming too americanized that is why week after week we set out hand in hand to this corner of new york she waited patiently as i browsed and picked out french books a collection of childrens stories by colette a jules verne novel or my favorite novels by the comtesse de segur a th century french author whose stories of misfortunes always featured redemptive endings then it was her turn together we headed to the adult foreign language collection one of the finest in the city with shelves and shelves of french novels as if under a spell my mother would let go of my hand she always clutched so tightly in this country and drifted off on her own i watched her fingering some proust volumes or the essays of andre maurois back in our native cairo she had once worked as a teacher and librarian and she missed the french novels we could no longer afford to buy as i grew older i would head toward the young adult section filled with tales of american girlhood i would take out those teen romance novels stories about lovelorn young girls who wore "formals" and went to proms with boys in the same way that donnells childrens section kept me connected with my french past its young adult library was shaping my future teaching me about becoming an american teenager i went back to rd street last friday though i can now afford the &# entrance fee at moma i made my way into the gift shop instead and nostalgically looked through the postcards then i went to donnell the place is still as welcoming as i remembered even as the guard searched my bag she was so pleasant i wanted to hug her the patrons were an eclectic collection of urban youth and workers from offices nearby the teen romance novels were still there and while the childrens section was larger its foreign language collection reflected the citys new immigrants with books in among other languages chinese russian spanish and hebrew but donnell had changed there were rows of computers where once there had been bare tables and rap music was playing in the young adult section where i used to hear only the sound of shushing librarians i guess the library is still assimilating new immigrants to american culture its just the culture thats shifted will the new donnell in a chic hotel be just as embracing ms lagnado is a journal reporter
