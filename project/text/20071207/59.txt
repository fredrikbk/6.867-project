nintendo plays it a wii bit cautious firms conservative culture limits game console supply keeping it hard to find even a year after wiis holiday season debut ian arcuri is discovering that finding nintendo co s popular videogame console isnt as easy as playing it "i still dont understand how something out that long which should have a supply chain so mature could be so hard to find " says mr arcuri a program manager at a technology company in cary n c he has been unable to find a wii for two of his children despite searching for more than a month while nintendos problem illustrates how tough it is for companies to try to predict demand for a product even in the second year it also is emblematic of the japanese companys native caution in the past two years for example nintendo has set earnings forecasts so conservative that they achieved them in just nine months nintendo started out as a small family business more than a century ago making traditional japanese playing cards and has undergone difficult transitions in its business to survive since it started making videogame consoles the company has seen its fortunes rise with its nintendo entertainment system in the s and then fall in the s as it lost share to rivals sony corp and microsoft corp because nintendo puts a great deal of focus on cash flow it tries to keep its inventory as low as possible such a strategy is rare among japanese companies which have tended to focus on revenue growth and market share nintendo said earlier this year that it is making its best efforts to ramp up manufacturing still this holiday season is seeing a repeat of last years wii frenzy including lines of shoppers forming outside stores and bidding battles for the consoles on ebay the frustration of u s shoppers could become a problem for nintendo as it seeks to keep up the momentum of a business that has surpassed expectations nintendo has twice revised its forecast for the number of wii consoles it expects to sell in its fiscal year ending march now predicting sales of million units compared with a forecast of million at the beginning of the year on a global basis the wii which lets users play games like tennis and bowling intuitively by swinging a controller has outsold its two direct rivals microsofts xbox and sonys playstation already the persistent shortages have led to speculation by angry consumers that nintendo was deliberately keeping supplies short to create more hype for the product reggie fils aime the president of nintendos u s division denies this saying nintendo simply didnt anticipate this level of demand for the wii this holiday season "it really is a missed opportunity if were not able to satisfy that demand which is why were working so hard with retailers " he says supply chain management experts say missed opportunity may still be better than being stuck with excessive supply unsold wiis could create a negative impression that consumers dont want the product the consequences are so painful that many companies end up erring on the side of a shortage "if you flood the market it will come back to haunt you " says christopher tang a professor of supply chain management at the ucla anderson school of management nintendo may be missing opportunities by allowing other people to profit from the shortage by charging premiums but mr tang says that isnt entirely a bad thing because it creates hype "psychologically its better if the customer is begging for the product " he says an excess supply also angers retailers who must work harder and offer discounts to get rid of the product the manufacturers financial results also suffer because they are forced to lower prices or take back the products retailers cant sell japanese toy maker bandai co is a cautionary tale in the late s it had a huge success with its tamagotchi virtual pets but unanticipated demand led to shortages in stores around the world then when the company focused too much on meeting demand in japan consumers overseas were frustrated by the time bandai was able to step up production and make more tamagotchis available overseas knock offs flooded the markets and few people wanted the real thing bandai ended up cutting its pretax profit forecast by in but even when it plans to step up capacity nintendos job is all the more difficult because it outsources all production compared with other companies who make their own products the wii contains dozens of parts which means "one manufacturer can hold the whole darn thing up " says david cole an analyst with industry research firm dfc intelligence based in san diego nintendo also must balance demand in the u s with other markets the wii craze has calmed down somewhat in japan for instance but the company still needs to make enough consoles available to support the debut there earlier this month of its highly anticipated videogame wii fit which lets users play exercise games by standing on a board that can sense shifts in weight but analysts believe it will get easier for consumers to find a wii next year as nintendo increases production for this holiday season though people who want to get a wii will likely have to shell out the kind of premium that amy zorn did the maplewood n j gymnastics instructor refused to go through "all the shenanigans" necessary to get a wii for her kids last year but this year ms zorn gave in and bought a wii for her year old son on ebay for &# plus shipping charges about &# more than the console would have cost her in a store "i thought id go into the store and say heres my couple hundred dollars im parting with " she says "i didnt think it would be an ordeal "
