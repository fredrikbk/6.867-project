politics &amp economics bush engages foreign foes as policy shift accelerates letter to north korea is the latest example direct talks with iran washington the white house said that president bush sent a letter directly to north korean leader kim jong il seeking cooperation in implementing a pact to dismantle its nuclear arms in exchange for full normalized relations the move is the latest example of the white house accelerating its reversal on numerous foreign policy fronts earlier in his presidency mr bush designated pyongyang a member of an "axis of evil" and expressed loathing for the communist states dictator in recent months however contacts have picked up amid an accord on dismantling pyongyangs nuclear program on other fronts particularly iran syria and lebanon the bush administration is also shifting tactics in ways that could affect american interests long term say u s officials and foreign policy analysts president bush is generally receiving praise for engaging pyongyang and damascus but he is also risking alienating the republican partys conservative wing which believes the u turns will undermine u s standing around the world "our foreign policy is in free fall at the moment " said john bolton mr bushs former ambassador to the united nations and an ally of vice president dick cheney mr bolton argues that engaging dictators will only "diminish our prestige and influence " the release this week of a u s intelligence report playing down the threat posed by irans atomic energy program is already undercutting president bushs high profile campaign to pressure tehran into suspending its nuclear activities mr bush used financial sanctions and the threat of force and a growing number of foreign diplomats now say it will be increasingly difficult for washington to push a new round of economic sanctions through the united nations iranian officials are openly taunting the white house over what they call the u s s latest intelligence scandal the national intelligence estimate concluded that iran froze its nuclear weapons program in though it continues to aggressively enrich uranium to produce nuclear fuel both conservative and liberal pundits see the report as so weakening the white house that the u s may have no option but to more aggressively seek direct talks with iran even some u s diplomats are seizing on the hope that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad could use the intelligence report to open up talks with the west "if they want to pursue our offers to negotiate they now have the perfect face saver " said a u s official in addition to the report on iran washingtons sudden opening to syria and president bashar assad has also stunned many diplomats and foreign policy analysts for most of the past six years the white house viewed damascus as among its most intractable foes in the middle east charging it with supporting militant groups fighting in lebanon iraq and the palestinian territories many u s officials also believe damascus was directly involved in the murder of lebanons former prime minister rafik hariri a charge syria denies in recent weeks though the u s has displayed a growing willingness to talk with syrian leaders damascuss deputy foreign minister faisal mekdad addressed the annapolis peace summit last month just weeks after it was uncertain that the state department would even invite the syrians and u s officials say they are considering backing a russian initiative to promote direct peace talks between the syrians and the israelis pentagon and state department officials say their optimism toward syria has been driven by a lessening of the number of foreign fighters being allowed to cross into iraq from syria they also say they hope mr assad can be constructive in helping lebanon elect a new president after a yearlong political crisis in beirut still there are fears that any u s engagement with syria could ultimately cost lebanons pro western government in recent days the bush administration has indicated it would accept a lebanese general as president who has longstanding ties to mr assads regime many lebanese fear this could restore syrian influence inside their country just two years after president assad withdrew nearly syrian troops the most pronounced reversal of policy between mr bushs first and second terms involves north korea after eschewing any direct talks the state department is now regularly sending envoys to pyongyang and is even promoting a performance by the new york philharmonic there early next year mr bush was also encouraged by secretary of state condoleezza rice to directly contact mr kim through the letter in his letter to mr kim president bush wrote "i want to emphasize that the declaration must be complete and accurate if we are to continue our progress " according to an excerpt of the dec letter reviewed by the associated press the payoff has been a nuclear accord among the u s north korea and four other parties that calls for dismantling pyongyangs nuclear weapons program by next year theres also hope that washington could sign a peace agreement with north korea china and south korea formally ending the korean war but north korea could still back out of the agreement on a trip to pyongyang this week assistant secretary of state christopher hill delivered mr bushs letter but also said he is still facing troubles getting a formal document from pyongyang listing all of its nuclear activities
