weekend journal hollywood report cruises studio proves risky business first ua film falls flat oliver stone project in limbo were making adjustments with a planned slate of four to six movies a year it remains unclear what uas next move will be or how long it will take to score a big hit something the studios financial backers at mgm studios and merrill lynch are hoping for sooner rather than later the revival of the united artists movie label is essentially two comebacks for the price of one its the rebirth of the historic ua name itself created in by hollywood luminaries mary pickford charlie chaplin and others and it marks the return of tom cruise who owns the studio with business partner paula wagner and hadnt been seen in theaters since his high profile dustup with viacom chief sumner redstone last year november was supposed to be a triumphant month for the reborn united artists with mr cruise starring in its first film "lions for lambs" released almost one year to the day after mr cruise and ms wagner announced they were taking the helm of the once illustrious studio like many start ups however the first few months of operations have been rocky "lions " a &# million politically themed movie directed by robert redford and starring messrs cruise and redford along with meryl streep tanked at the u s box office bringing in only &# million in its first month it wont be profitable a rarity on mr cruises hit filled resume the film suffered the fate that befell most of hollywoods efforts at chronicling current political events this fall competing titles including "in the valley of elah" and "rendition " also bombed with audiences united artists faces the same reality as its rivals too many films in theaters the result of a wave of private equity financing over the past few years not only is ua competing with the traditional hollywood studios and the specialty divisions within those studios but with a crop of other start ups also seeking a toehold in the cineplexes ms wagner a former talent agent mr cruises longtime producing partner and now uas chief executive acknowledges the studio is "still trying to find its rhythm " she admits that "lions for lambs" was a stumble but adds that "i would have still made the movie and im proud of the film " ms wagner points out that even major studios typically have only one or two big hits per year among the to films they release annually ms wagner adds that ua is evaluating what kind of movies audiences want to see "there is a learning curve and a process when youre starting out " she says the studios second film "valkyrie " also stars mr cruise this time taking a turn as colonel claus von stauffenberg a nazi who plotted an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate adolf hitler the film due out in june at a cost of at least &# million is directed by bryan singer who found success directing the acclaimed film "the usual suspects" and commercial reward with the "x men" franchise early buzz about the film has been iffy based on some fan reaction online to the movies trailer the trailer features mr cruise wearing world war ii era nazi regalia and an eye patch but sporting an american accent instantly recognizable as mr cruises much of the negative commentary focuses on the filmmakers decision not to have the characters speak german or have german accents other stars including briton kenneth branagh stick to their native accents too the studio said it was a "very carefully considered choice" to not have the actors attempt german accents for fear of distracting the audience "everybody in the film is playing a german so why would they be speaking english with german accents " ms wagner asks meantime the studios third planned project the oliver stone directed "pinkville " about the my lai massacre has fallen victim to the continuing screenwriters strike the studio announced last month that the script wasnt ready and it was indefinitely postponing the project which would star bruce willis and woody harrelson some of the crew were already in thailand preparing to begin filming this month ms wagner says she isnt sure if the film will proceed even after the strike is resolved explaining that mr willis is already at work on another movie a representative for mr willis referred calls to ua with a planned slate of four to six movies a year it remains unclear what uas next move will be or how long it will take to score a big hit something the studios financial backers at mgm studios and merrill lynch are hoping for sooner rather than later in august the studio secured &# million in financing arranged by merrill for to films over the next five years officials at both mgm and merrill say theyre still fully behind the new studio and the leadership of ms wagner but people close to mgm are quick to point out that "lions" missed its target financially an admission hollywood rarely likes to make one person involved in the financing venture says that "from the investor perspective what was important to us was seeing them operate as a studio and were encouraged that they actually stuck to the budget " but the studio has yet to greenlight another film beyond "valkyrie " though ms wagner says a number of projects are in development she says the company is interested in developing comedies with one designed with mr cruise in mind for the starring role the studio will also seek to acquire films at festivals including the sundance film festival in utah next month but competition there will be fierce with multiple studios seeking to bolster their stock of completed films in the face of the screenwriters strike in an attempt to both boost ua and demonstrate confidence in it executives at mgm say theyve handed the reins of the just announced sequel to s "the thomas crown affair " starring pierce brosnan over to ua the film pulled in more than &# million in ticket sales world wide but ua officials including ms wagner are quick to play down the studios role in making the sequel which also will star mr brosnan "i wouldnt say were taking the lead " she says "the sequel is a co venture with mgm " despite uas starry history its not a great time to be a start up even if its a restart in the film business weinstein co the studio formed by brothers harvey and bob weinstein in after they turned over their miramax films to walt disney co has struggled to find its footing over the past two years though the weinsteins have had a hand in dozens of films since then a big commercial and critically acclaimed hit has eluded them the companys highly promoted double feature "grindhouse " directed by quentin tarantino and robert rodriguez and costing about &# million flopped at the box office taking in only &# million after its release in april the next few years will truly define uas position in hollywood ms wagner says "after being in business for a year were very positive weve been extremely well received by the artistic community and were making adjustments as we go " see related letter "letters to the editor hollywood bombs away but hits only itself" dec
