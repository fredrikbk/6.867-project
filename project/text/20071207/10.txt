suit highlights the dangers facing big hospitals and academic medical centers as they respond to pressure over conflicts of interest dr yadav was dismissed for allegedly not complying with the clinics conflict of interest policies his lawsuit filed yesterday in ohio state court says he was being scapegoated the clinic in a statement denied the allegations in the lawsuit and said it planned to file a response as well as a "counter claim for substantial expenses incurred to review his research " getting rid of doctors over issues related to conflicts of interest is rare dr yadav says others at the clinic werent sanctioned and his legal action could become an embarrassing public battle for the clinic the clinic instituted tougher conflict policies in early after the wall street journal detailed the undisclosed investments of the clinic and certain of its doctors in unproven products used there on patients dr yadav had financial stakes in two companies whose experimental products were tested on clinic patients he says the clinic was well aware of his conflicts and that he properly reported them but that he was fired so that the clinic could look tough ahead of a cleveland

conflicts start at the top with clinic chief executive delos "toby" cosgrove according to the complaint the lawsuit says the clinic heavily promotes and uses an invention of dr cosgroves in patients undergoing heart valve surgery dr cosgrove and the clinic both receive royalties from sales of the product known as the cosgrove edwards ring and marketed by edwards lifesciences corp the lawsuit says patients arent given the choice of using competing rings or told that the hospital and its chief executive profit from sales of the cosgrove edwards ring the clinic confirmed dr cosgrove and the hospital share royalties but declined to answer questions about what patients are told and how much the institution and dr cosgrove earn from sales of the ring the clinic said the royalty payments were proper in another case the lawsuit says orthopedic surgeon isador lieberman a member of the hospitals conflict of interest committee failed to disclose his significant financial interests in kyphon inc that company manufactures equipment for an orthopedic procedure that dr lieberman advocated and tested at the clinic the clinic said dr lieberman fully cooperated with a review of his conflict disclosures and that "all appropriate actions were taken " in all of the cases cited in the lawsuit dr yadav alleges there was no disciplinary action taken against those doctors the lawsuit alleges that dr yadav who was born in india was a victim of discrimination the clinic however said it "consistently and fairly applied its policies to all of its physicians " dr yadav says his reputation has been tarnished by the clinic he says his state medical license notes that he lost his privileges at the clinic and he hasnt found a new job practicing medicine he has been serving as

lawsuit dr ouriel didnt disclose these payments according to the lawsuit the clinic yesterday said "dr ouriel received a few hundreds of dollars versus tens of thousands of dollars that dr yadav received dr ouriels situation was thoroughly reviewed and he fully cooperated by taking appropriate actions to rectify the situation immediately after the review the clinic officials determined that
