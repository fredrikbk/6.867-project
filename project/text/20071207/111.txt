weekend journal sports by the numbers the protection game while football games are physically won and lost on the field success in the nfl often comes down to who prevails in the mental game especially where quarterbacks are concerned when a quarterback can stand unmolested in the pocket he can focus on locating his targets with precision and picking apart even the best secondary but when he is constantly looking over his shoulder worrying about getting flattened by a defensive end or a blitzing safety he will get rid of the ball too early and miss his receiver or worse throw it to a defender to see which teams keep opposing signal callers up at night we devised the quarterback harassment factor to determine qhf we started with the total number of sacks a defense collects then we took their interception total and multiplied it by three that is because interceptions are about three times rarer and more important than sacks we add those two numbers together and then divide it by the total number of pass attempts a defense faced in order to arrive at qhf unlike "quarterback pressures" a stat not compiled by the nfl sacks and interceptions give an unambiguous tally of what happens on the field quarterback harassment factor is expressed as a weighted percentage that shows how often a defense can make something really bad happen on a pass play which defenses are best at making life tough for opposing signal callers the san diego chargers are tops in the nfl with a qhf they lead the league with interceptions eight of those coming from league leader antonio cromartie including a yarder for a touchdown on the sack side while shawne merrimans sacks are well behind last years pace sacks in only games his teammates have taken up the slack and their combined sacks still put the chargers in nd place in the afc just a tick behind are the new england patriots with a qhf thanks to sacks and picks six of those by asante samuel in the nfc the new york giants are on top with a mark the giants have thrown more quarterbacks to the ground than any other team their sacks lead the league by a large margin thanks in part to osi umenyioras their division rivals the dallas cowboys lead the nfc in interceptions with thats a big factor in their qhf while most of the top defenses specialize in the things that get into quarterbacks heads at least two top units have succeeded with a more conservative approach the pittsburgh steelers who lead the league in both scoring defense and average yards allowed rank a modest rd in qhf qhf with a robust sacks offset by just eight interceptions and the tampa bay buccaneers who have allowed the fewest points per game in the nfc have also been surprisingly kind to qbs with a qhf and picks if we apply the qhf formula to a teams offensive line i e sacks allowed and interceptions allowed we get qhf allowed which shows how well a team protects its quarterbacks who comes out on top there the new england patriots who have done everything but wrap tom brady in a plastic bubble as illustrated by their qhfa the potential hall of famer has been sacked only times this year compare that with the sack pounding that the detroit lions qbs have endured although mr brady leads the league with passing yards he has thrown only five interceptions trailing only the tampa bay passers who threw one fewer pick in fewer passes with a mark the green bay packers lead the nfc in qhfa sacks allowed interceptions allowed providing brett favre with the kind of protection that translates into a record dallass tony romo whose yards per attempt leads even mr bradys ypa has thrown his share of interceptions so far but his offensive line has done a good job of protecting his back allowing only sacks and racking up a qhfa sixth in the nfc which quarterbacks have been the most beleaguered with interceptions and sacks and a league worst qhfa the st louis rams who have watched both starter marc bulger and backup gus frerotte suffer injuries in recent weeks should be sure their health insurance premiums are paid up on both sides of the ball qhf correlates strongly with winning and losing if football is played as much in the mind as it is on the field the team that can get the opposing quarterback to expect the worst and then watch it happen is well on its way to victory
