weekend journal taste better begging bill gates has &# billion to his name what would you do if he called your home asking you for some money youd hang up on the prankster of course now what would you do if harvard with its &# billion endowment called begging for cash my wife and i take out our checkbook but maybe we should be hitting up harvard instead princetons endowment grew by more than &# billion last year three weeks of gains in the tiger portfolio would have paid for every undergrads tuition and for a fresh pair of stripes on the mascot princetons nothing special at least in this case over universities in the u s have endowments surpassing &# billion a fivefold gain in the past years this lovely fiscal boom has angered some u s senators who want to force harvard princeton mit stanford and many others to spend more from their coffers republican sen charles grassley threatens to pry open the endowments so that like other charitable groups they must spend at least of principal each year compared with the measly they chose to spend in down from in and in whats happening here are rich schools like survivalists afraid to spend and waiting for the apocalypse if we looked in yales basements would we find a million rows of canned tuna and bottled evian guarded by angry bulldogs the universities have all sorts of sensible rebuttals first no one knows if the endowments will continue to rack up winnings they lost money in and that was only a year after alan greenspan warned that the u s s biggest fiscal challenge was handling the booming surplus which could force the federal government to buy stocks his statement came just as the equity boom imploded the economy tumbled tax receipts cratered and a tidal wave of red ink swamped the surplus second many gifts to universities come with strings attached requiring administrators to allocate to certain departments or to a certain time frame say for a theatrical production of "king lear" starring bonobo chimps in third universities argue that they really are spending the money just not as much as the complainers would like students and parents demand better labs faster laptops and greener grass while headline tuition fees are roaring at a pace twice to thrice the inflation rate over half the kids arent paying the headline price as financial aid budgets are booming too the colleges are turning into price discriminating airlines where the passenger sitting next to you may have nabbed that seat for half what you paid for yours who wins in this rhetorical struggle between allegedly tightwad administrators and spendthrift senators are universities just sticking it to the rich delivering "to each according to their needs" if it were only so simple many "not so rich" families are feeling the pinch too two teachers who marry and together earn &# will be struggling to pay for their kids college education without much help even worse theres a perverse incentive not to save because your savings are the first dollars colleges will swipe if you apply for financial aid so middle and upper middle income families are basically told "save up but hide it from us " this is the same nasty spider web created by the estate tax what in the world to do heres my reform plan first senators should mind their own business what credibility do they have on long term savings last i looked social security is not in a lockbox but in the outhouse second colleges should speed up the trend of turning loans into grants a french or art history major buried under a &# debt might as well be reading sartres "no exit" and admiring munchs "scream " bono and u s treasury secretaries made a similar argument on behalf of africa and ghana probably has a better football team than columbia third universities should use their bulging endowments to create room for more undergraduates princeton has adopted a multiyear plan to expand its class by but will still turn away baskets of applications from students with perfect sat scores finally let me suggest a brand new idea that id be lobbying for if i were still teaching at harvard or paying off my own tuition a colleges biggest asset is the psychological bond formed with students and alumni colleges need to harness that bond lets face it emotion affects financial decisions thats why students who belong to fraternities sports teams and performing arts groups tend to give more to their alma maters among the "soft" reasons i give to harvard are that i met my wife there and that i have a happy memory of appearing on the front page of the harvard crimson dressed for a play as macho indiana jones ive seen emotion sway decisions even in cutthroat hedge fund war rooms traditionally israeli bonds paid less than treasury bonds because their investors felt an emotional tug and many even forgave debt it is time for universities to link emotional bonds to financial bonds for families who do pay tuition a portion should be a loan to the university a personal savings account held by the institution your money gets invested say by princetons crack portfolio managers who reinvest the earnings for years after that you have the option of taking back the principal and some portion of the return call it a "clawback bond " my bet is that if princeton did a great job educating its alumni and building a lifelong bond with them many would say "shucks just keep it " now that would put a tiger in everyones tank mr buchholzs new books are "new ideas from dead ceos" harpercollins and a financial mystery "the castro gene"
