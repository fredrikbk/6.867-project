weekend journal review film atonement is epic storytelling without apology a six decade drama vague golden compass leads viewers nowhere keira knightley and james mcavoy are the star crossed lovers of "atonement " as good a film as one could imagine having been made from a great work of contemporary fiction thats high praise and only part of the story this screen version directed by joe wright and adapted by christopher hampton from ian mcewans novel of the same name stands on its own as a singular achievement romantic sensuous intelligent and finally shattering in its sweep and thematic complexity one of its themes is the nature of storytelling what are we being told whos telling it whats the motive and is it the truth "atonement" starts in spans six decades and tells of a single moment of mistaken perception that changes the course of three lives the moment is an odd but innocent encounter between the lovely privileged cecilia tallis and robbie turner the talented son of a servant yet the child who observes it cecilias precocious year old sister briony saoirse ronan jumps to a conclusion that isnt just wrong but perverse she lacks any understanding of adult behavior that might put what she thinks shes seen in sensible context and brionys inflamed imagination leads her to a fateful decision for which she lacks any clear motive in the book these abstract considerations play out slowly and narrative voices change imperceptibly movies are by nature more literal and often need to move quickly to hold our attention the pace of mr wrights filmmaking can be brisk hes the english director whose debut feature was the fine version of "pride and prejudice " with ms knightley as lizzie bennet but mr wright is also good at conveying leisure even the torpor of a hot summer between the wars with telling details the slow click of brionys typewriter a bee buzzing at a windowpane the premonitory silhouette of a bomber seen through a skylight and though the camera beautifies much of what it observes the cinematographer seamus mcgarvey together with the director and the production designer sarah greenwood have heightened the ugliness of world war ii with among other sequences a single astonishing steadicam shot lasting more than five minutes that follows robbie as a soldier through the chaos of the british evacuation on the beach at dunkirk a movie that runs slightly less than two hours cant begin to match the density or the cumulative power of a novel that one critic called "a mighty edifice " yet the uniformly excellent cast and indeed the casting of even the smallest roles lends clarity and urgency to mr mcewans characters ms knightleys cecilia is not merely beautiful though thats hardly a bad thing shes quick tongued and beautifully pensive mr mcavoys robbie combines working class buoyancy with understated intellectuality at first robbie and cecilia look touchingly like silent film stars immune to future tragedy by contrast the young brionys gaunt unfinished face mirrors her unfinished unmoored mind while briony as a young woman played by romola garai seems to be trapped by unmanageable guilt in a life of suspended animation in the last part of her life briony is played by vanessa redgrave a startling apparition in a role thats relatively small but indispensable much is asked of both the character and the actress for the last part is when startling truths are revealed in rapid succession and neither disappoints briony inspires horror but also awe as a haunted version of the person she always wanted to be a writer who has given a measure of happiness and as writers can worked out a happy ending the golden compass the alternate victorian universe of "the golden compass" looks magical seethes with elusive profundities and makes remarkably little sense though the murkiness makes perfect sense on a shallower level thats because this elaborate fantasy was adapted from a trilogy of novels for young adults by the british author philip pullman an outspoken atheist something had to give either the big budget and the risks it entailed or the antireligious elements of mr pullmans widely read epic which centers on a preteen orphan named lyra belacqua and identifies the source of all evil in the universe as "the magisterium " an obvious stand in for the holy church at least one catholic group has called for a boycott of the film in advance of todays release the films scale certainly hasnt suffered sequence after sequence of the sumptuous production which was adapted and directed by chris weitz summons up visual wonders dueling digital polar bears a jules verne dirigible cruising over london an oxford of green lawns and gleaming scientific instruments and at every turn peoples souls strolling alongside them in the form of animals called daemons the script retains the magisterium an all seeing and all knowing institution that kidnaps children and ships them off to an arctic facility where their souls are permanently separated from their bodies but any religious implications have been scrupulously excised and replaced by an all purpose all familiar fascism vaguely evocative of "star wars " and the dust of the pullman novels which equated with original sin at least from the magisteriums point of view now represents even more vaguely a connection to knowledge or an awareness of other worlds vagueness colors all banishing emotional connections in the process its hard to care about lyras cosmic struggles against the magisterium shes played by an attractive newcomer dakota blue richards when youre confused about her relationship with nicole kidmans wicked but tender marisa coulter or for that matter about why lyras vague cockney accent comes and goes similarly its hard to sustain interest in the good polar bear iorek byrnison when despite ian mckellens rich voice he reminds you of more interesting creatures in "the lord of the rings " daniel craig makes a puzzlingly brief appearance as the mysterious explorer lord asriel and sam elliott shows up as a foxy american aeronaut as for how the movie ends the short answer is that it doesnt rather than reconnect poor lyra with the father shes been yearning to find as in the book this chronically disconnected screen version reaches a climax thats all about the next film in the series instead of closure we get coming attractions dvd tip christopher hampton won a well deserved oscar for his adaptation of "dangerous liaisons " the triumph directed by stephen frears that starred john malkovich glenn close and michelle pfeiffer the movie won two other oscars for art direction and costume design actually it was an adaptation of an adaptation the first one being mr hamptons own stage version of the novel by choderlos de laclos that same novel inspired another english language feature the comparatively flat footed "valmont " which was released in but "dangerous liaisons" is the one to see a vibrant costume comedy about erotic power games and the power of acting and language
