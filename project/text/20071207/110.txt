weekend journal review theater broadways back and booming the farnsworth invention music box theatre w th st &# &# august osage county imperial theatre w th st &# &# closes mar the seafarer booth theatre w th st &# &# west bank uk la mama e t c a e fourth st &# closes dec new york three new plays opened on broadway this week all of them worthy and one of them extraordinary thats a sentence i didnt expect to write at the end of the first full week of performances since the settlement of the stagehands strike straight plays of high quality after all have been alarmingly hard to find on broadway in recent seasons that three should now be running on the same block of the theater district may be a coincidence but even so its a galvanizing one for anybody who cares about the parlous artistic state of big ticket theater in america ill take them in ascending order of quality starting with "the farnsworth invention " aaron sorkin who fled broadway two decades ago to till the greener fields of hollywood has returned for the first time since "a few good men" with a play about television and its not a gossipy roman a clef either while "the farnsworth invention" is as slick as "studio on the sunset strip " its also impressively earnest and its subject is the less than burning question of who really invented tv and you know what its good not great you understand but a rock solid two base hit the farnsworth of the title is philo t farnsworth jimmi simpson a small town science geek who more or less invented electronic tv in his garage thus running afoul of david sarnoff hank azaria the ceo of rca whose scientists had been trying without success to do the same thing sarnoff thereupon unleashed a pack of high priced lawyers on farnsworth in an attempt to seize control of the patents that protected his invention that sounds suspiciously like a courtroom drama but instead mr sorkin has written a clever history pageant that juxtaposes farnsworths dogged experiments with sarnoffs meteoric rise through the ranks of corporate america in the process stuffing a stiff dose of interesting information about the early days of radio and tv down the audiences collective gullet farnsworth and sarnoff tell one anothers stories in "the farnsworth invention " an ingenious conceit that keeps the action ping ponging back and forth between the two characters mr azaria plays sarnoff as a tightly coiled tough guy with a sandpaper voice while mr simpsons farnsworth is engagingly and believably sincere des mcanuffs staging roars along like a high speed tank and the other members of the cast all of whom play multiple roles put personal spins on even the smallest parts "farnsworth" is way too fact heavy and some of the "facts" arent true in a nutshell its approximately as accurate as "inherit the wind " which isnt saying much go to www thefarnsworthinvention com a web site maintained by paul schatzkin farnsworths biographer for a detailed description of what the play gets wrong moreover both acts start slow a problem that messrs sorkin and mcanuff unsuccessfully try to paper over by making messrs azaria and simpson talk as fast as possible all this matters but less than you might think and im also relieved to report that mr sorkin one of hollywoods most notorious ideological deck stackers has taken care not to turn sarnoff into a gargoyle of greed incarnate or farnsworth into christ in a white lab coat though "the farnsworth invention" is too pat by half to pass the high art test it does a much better job than robert redfords painfully tendentious "quiz show" of making the viewer think about the role played by the electronic media in modern american life and its vastly more entertaining to boot as an ardent supporter of chicago theater im overjoyed that one of that citys best known troupes has come east to strut its stuff the steppenwolf theatre company is performing tracy lettss "august osage county" on broadway mr lettss new play is a character hour monster about the westons an oklahoma family so dysfunctional that its a wonder theyre not all dead repeat after me adultery alcoholism drug addiction incest one of them is even a poet no doubt it sounds like tennessee williams on a bender but what makes "august osage county" so excitingly watchable is that mr letts has mostly chosen to play these grim matters for laughs the horrific family dinner at which mom weston deanna dunagan pops a double handful of downers and starts settling scores is a glittering piece of black comedy and the cast consummately well directed by anna d shapiro plays it to perfection ms dunagan and amy morton who gives a commanding performance as barbara the oldest weston daughter will surely be remembered at tony time but everyone deserves a group award for ensemble acting above and beyond the call of duty theres a catch and its a huge one the hour long first act is a pretentious piece of superfluous exposition that could and should have been cut i suppose i ought not to suggest that you come late nudge nudge but if you do choose to see the whole thing take my word that it gets better a whole lot better after the first intermission lastly and bestly conor mcpherson has given us a christmas show for the suicidally depressed "the seafarer" is one of those capital i irish plays whose characters one of whom ciaran hinds turns out to be the divvil himself get falling down drunk hint broadly that theres more to life than death and spout four and seven letter words starting with "f" in rich peaty brogues it is also no fooling worthy of comparison with the finest work of the young brian friel strong words i know but the year old mr mcpherson has earned them like mr letts hes written a midnight black comedy one that wrenches laughter out of the despair of frustrated men whose lives have come to naught that it takes place in the hours between christmas eve and christmas morning serves only to deepen the hue of the colors in which their suffering is painted "you absolutely stink again do you know that " "yeah happy christmas to you as well " yet in the midst of this world of hurt mr mcpherson dares to point to the possibility of hope even transcendence and it is this daring that gives his play the stuff of greatness i dont want to tell you too much about what happens in "the seafarer " which ends with a head twisting surprise but ill say this much no matter what youre expecting at the halfway mark you wont feel cheated when the curtain falls mr mcpherson who doubles as director has a knack for pointed physical comedy that he exploits to the fullest and his five man cast is stunningly and uniformly good rae smiths set whose centerpiece is a pitiful christmas tree at which charlie brown would have turned up his nose is the quintessence of working class squalor do not miss this play especially if youre feeling the seasonal blues itll tie a knot at the end of your rope off broadway playwright director oren safdie "private jokes public places" and songwriter ronnie cohen have given the "avenue q" treatment to the israeli palestinian conflict in "west bank uk " a caustically witty four person musical with a middle eastern flavored score that succeeds in wringing hard nosed fun out of deadly serious matters you were expecting maybe a comic duet sung by a pair of suicide bombers well thats what you get and it works believe it or not as does the rest of this rough edged but nonetheless smart little show mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other
