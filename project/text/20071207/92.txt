the numbers guy is a carl doomed to be a c student we dont think so we like our names and that preference can have negative repercussions according to research published last month major leaguers with "k" initials tend to strike out more perhaps reflecting the batters unconscious pull to appear next to the strikeout symbol "k" on scorecards students with initials c and d have worse grades than the as and bs and everyone else gravitating toward the grades their initials represent these findings received widespread coverage for their headline friendly implications less apparent are the statistical parables several statisticians commended the authors for elegant work but the study also demonstrates how pliable numbers can be the surprising pitfalls of working with very large data sets and how defensible yet debatable choices can influence final results ucla statistician ivo dinov finds "unsettling" various "ad hoc selections groupings and stratification criteria" in the initials study yet he adds "i consider this series of studies largely valid intriguing and begging further exploration and validation " the study is the latest to seek the factors that shape our destiny the order in which children arrive in a family may determine intelligence and personality traits the latest study from norway found that first born military conscripts have an iq on average points greater than second born children a book covered on cnn and elsewhere associated drivers astrological signs with their accident rates watch out for merging libras but these findings were hardly conclusive many contradictory studies have called into question the birth order hypothesis and the "car carma" research was based on a single set of about drivers in a single year there is no evidence that libras have been relatively hazardous road companions so far this year the recent initials research actually is a collection of five studies including an experiment backing up the initials preferences for the first of five studies psychologists leif nelson and joseph simmons examined years of strikeout data and found that after controlling for increasing strikeout rates in recent years batters with k initials struck out more than any other players in making this calculation the authors included only batters with at least plate appearances but all of these batters were weighted equally whether they had plate appearances or sports statistician shane reese of brigham young argues that the player with more experience should count more a few missed calls by umpires could make a player with just plate appearances seem strikeout prone but the evidence is more solid for a year veteran prof nelson and simmons respond that weighting players would bias the results because players who strike out less frequently are likely to last longer in the league by prof reeses method kevin koslofski ks in career at bats and his ilk are still more likely to strike out than most but less so than players with initials d and n letters that arent associated with fanning at the plate duke statistician jerry reiter said hed also like to see whether gregs and garys are especially likely to ground out or whether edwards and elmers commit more than their share of errors "one would expect these to hold as well if the authors hypothesis is right " prof reiter says "if not the authors might be finding associations that do not have causal interpretations " prof nelson counters that the alternatives lack the simplicity of strikeouts and involve players in the field plus batters and pitchers the authors are on firmer statistical ground elsewhere in the study the association of slightly lower grades with the initials c and d compared with all other initials was highly significant statistically for a set of data covering graduating business school students students with c and d names wouldnt be expected to perform worse in countries where those letters didnt correspond to mediocre grades but we cant be sure because those numbers havent been studied university of california irvine statistician hal stern points out something most media missed the effect is tiny of a grade point average point lower for the initials c and d and this columnist isnt including that because of his first initial therein lies a lesson in the difference between statistical significance the confidence that there is some association between two factors and the strength of that association "in very large samples like the ones here even small differences will be judged statistically significant " prof stern says "this means that were confident the difference is not zero it does not mean the difference we see is important " prof nelson agrees that this effect is "so small that you shouldnt worry about it" when naming a child though he does say the study exposes an example of how the unconscious mind can undermine conscious motivation but bowling green statistician jim albert warns "you can prove any silly hypothesis by running a statistical test on tons of data " email me at numbersguy wsj com read daily commentary about numbers and join a discussion with readers at my
