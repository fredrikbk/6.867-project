weekend journal the soul of a new instrument its been nearly years since a musical instrument broke into the mainstream has a former microsoft manager built a better keyboard in jim plamondon quit his job at microsoft and embarked on an obsessive quest to invent a new musical instrument his brainstorm an odd keyboard variant with stubby joysticks and a honeycomb of buttons he dubs the thummer among the last new instruments to be widely adopted were the synthesizer and electric guitar more than a half century ago but mr plamondon believes his thummer has a shot one of the instruments key features is a smarter keyboard that he says makes playing music more intuitive mr plamondon is part of a subculture of musical inventors all vying to be the next adolphe sax he invented the saxophone they range from composers such as an mit professor who built a high tech "hypercello" for yo yo ma to basement tinkerers including a piano player in traverse city mich whose "friction harp" resembles a tv aerial they demonstrate their instruments at conferences and niche music festivals they upload videos to youtube and sites like oddmusic com which catalogs roughly new instruments a month including the "symphonic house " a home in michigan outfitted with walls of resonating strings occasionally their wares are adopted by big stars recent concerts by the singer bjoerk have featured a futuristic device called a "reactable " built by a team in spain players issue eerie electronic tones and rhythms by moving glowing blocks across its table top surface the bulk of new instruments rarely get played outside small circles of loyalists or early adopters one big obstacle is the high cost of producing experimental instruments which are usually built one at a time seasoned musicians who have spent years mastering an instrument also are reluctant to start over with a new one while beginners gravitate to what they see on stage or in the orchestra pit and most of the immense repertoire of western music from bach to the beatles was composed for traditional instruments "the hardest thing to do is sell something to someone who doesnt perceive the need for it " says roger linn who is credited with inventing the first digital drum machine in "ive seen the trail of bodies of inventors who have tried and died " what sets the thummer apart from other musical inventions says mr plamondon isnt the way it sounds but the way it is played it consists of two keyboards each about the size of a paperback book they can be played piano style on a tabletop or sandwiched together and held aloft to play a three note chord for example you press a cluster of three buttons to play the next three note chord you keep your fingers in the same shape and move to a different group of buttons mr plamondon says this design makes the thummer easier to learn than instruments like the piano which require players to learn many more chord fingerings the thummer doesnt make any noise on its own it must be plugged into a computer or synthesizer which uses software to mimic other instruments to adjust volume and pitch players thumb a pair of joysticks mounted on the side hence the instruments name like the nintendo wii controller it has an internal motion sensor so players can also adjust the sound by moving the instrument around as they play it marc rossi a synthesizer specialist and professor of piano and jazz composition at the berklee college of music in boston says the thummer sounds like a good quality synthesizer he says the internal motion sensor is whats truly innovative "that could be a whole new world " while veteran players would have little use for a new keyboard configuration like the thummers mr rossi says "it could be very useful for kids and for people learning music who want less technical demands than a keyboard " mr plamondon years old hasnt played an instrument since quitting the tuba after high school he studied geology and computer science in college and later sold storm windows over the phone he spent most of his career in the computer industry taking on a series of software writing jobs before landing at microsoft in just as the companys windows operating system was becoming ubiquitous he spent eight years persuading third party developers to create software for the microsoft platform then left the company to take some time off and later pursue his own projects he says he exercised his microsoft options and invested in a portfolio of stocks valued at &# million he bought a beachfront home on the southwest tip of australia and moved there with his wife and two children most people designing new instruments are musicians for mr plamondon financial need was the mother of invention shortly after moving to australia in almost half of his assets were wiped out in the dot com crash he saw the thummer as a way to start making money again after years trying to get his project off the ground his family is strapped for cash the two kids have put their college plans on hold hoping that in a couple of years their father will be able to help pay tuition the family doesnt have health insurance mr plamondon says he needs to raise up to &# million to engineer a final prototype finalize patents and manufacture a first run of instruments the idea for the thummer began when his wife and daughter both quit piano lessons after only six months his wife patti complained that learning to play separate lines on each hand "was like reading spanish with one eye and french with the other " she recalls he began reading up on music theory and researching why piano keys are arranged as they are he wasnt the first to hunt for an alternative in the s hungarian paul von janko patented a configuration that made fingerings identical in any key a similar idea was developed for the concertina with an patent by a swiss inventor kaspar wicki in the fall of as mr plamondon was playing the videogame halo he says he realized he could use thumb sticks like those on his xbox controller to shift sound effects he created a company thumtronics hired an engineer to build prototypes leased an office above a music shop and brought in nearly &# in a first round of fund raising in after outside funding for the thummer dried up he mortgaged the familys home for about &# million "things got really tight " says ms plamondon for a time she says the family relied partly on the paychecks her then year old son brought home from his computer store job for many on the tech savvy side of the music world sweeping change seems overdue one of the last breakthroughs to catch on in a major way was the saxophone invented in the s during the past century most inventions have only gained cult followings the stick for example is a bodiless guitar with strings that players tap instead of strum inventor emmett chapman has sold about of them since mr linn the drum machine designer calls the thummer "a very good idea " but stops short of predicting its commercial success instead he groups it into a broader category he calls "new little organisms in the darwinism of musical instruments " the music products industry faces a mixed outlook retail sales fell in to &# billion down from a record high the year before according to the international music products assocation a trade group and while the category of computer music products fared best last year growing by about sales of some more traditional instruments suffered such as pianos which dropped more than the plamondons live in austin texas they moved there in april from australia seeking affordable housing and a music and tech friendly city they bought their home online for less than &# using some cash from the sale of their australian home as a down payment in austin mr plamondon started over working up the entrepreneurial food chain at conferences and coffees networking with think tanks and professors fishing for endorsement blurbs that he posts on thummer com where he writes a blog to build online buzz he co authored a paper on the thummer that was published in the peer reviewed computer music journal the funding hunt has been more of a challenge he recently targeted a pair of austin investors fito kahn and david peterman on a thursday afternoon in october mr plamondon walked into mr petermans office eager to make a deal his geek tendencies were on display he set the alarm on his wristwatch to beep prompting him to announce when there were five and two minutes remaining as the three men sat down around a table in straight backed chairs mr plamondon eyed the papers in mr kahns hand "whats in the folder is that a checkbook " it was but it wasnt going to be used on that day the two potential investors had questions about patents and the prospects of manufacturing the thummer in china mr kahn said they also want a sleek new look for the thummer in part to make it appealing to a younger audience "we imagine the thummer as guitar hero only youre learning an instrument as you play " referring to a popular videogame that uses a guitar shaped controller to simulate the rock star experience mr plamondon left with assurances that a written offer would be ready for their next meeting waving as he headed toward the door mr plamondon said "i look forward to getting a check from you next time " following their october meeting mr kahn emailed a proposal to mr plamondon instead of the lump sum mr plamondon sought the investors offered him &# a month for six months and a promise to cover expenses involved in securing manufacturing deals in china in exchange they asked him to set up an advisory board and submit more business plans and other "benchmarks " just after thanksgiving mr plamondon turned them down in an email to mr kahn "im going to wait for a better offer " he wrote none are currently forthcoming he recently hit a wall at a local venture capital firm gefinor ventures wes cole a principal in the firm says he was impressed by a video of someone playing "summertime" on the thummer but he has reservations "this is a market where youve seen no successful investment ventures that im aware of " with a handful of working prototypes mr plamondon is continuing to search for investors and gain a consumer audience taking stock of his savings he says he has about six months left before hell have to find a full time job at that point the thummer will be relegated to an evenings and weekends enterprise he says "and thats the death of a start up "
