our plan to help homeowners after a period of widely available capital easy credit and unsustainable housing price appreciation an inevitable correction in the housing market now poses a significant risk to the u s economy foreclosure starts have almost doubled in the last year and a half and signs point to further increases many americans are facing mortgage trouble foreclosures are a fact of life even in strong housing years borrowers who are overextended or who experienced a change in life circumstances find they can no longer afford their home when foreclosures rise and are concentrated in particular communities they begin to have a wider negative impact driving down property values and undermining the financial stability of neighboring families president bush has called on his administration and the private sector to work together to minimize preventable foreclosures that harm homeowners neighborhoods and our economy this week the mortgage industry and mortgage investors made an announcement that will help do just that by streamlining the industrys process for financial evaluation of struggling borrowers todays mortgage market is complex and diffuse the servicer collecting a mortgage payment is most often doing so on behalf of investors scattered around the world the job of these servicers is to manage loans in the best interests of the multiple investors in the mortgage pool in many cases a modification creates better value for investors than does foreclosure when a borrower calls a servicer to discuss trouble making a payment the servicer assesses the borrowers financial condition to determine what steps are in investors best interest and will modify a mortgage only when it serves that interest under current industry practices this involves a lengthy financial evaluation process servicers often need significant documentation almost going so far as to re underwrite the loan this process is time consuming for all involved in the next two years we will face a rising volume of subprime mortgage resets and we expect a dramatic increase in the number of borrowers who will struggle to make their payments at these higher rates investors and mortgage industry participants recognize that their traditional process will be overwhelmed and unable to handle the higher volume of borrowers seeking assistance in such a diffuse industry no single firm could convene all investors to streamline the current cumbersome loan by loan process this suggested a role for government to bring the private sector participants together so they could develop solutions they could not reach acting individually by convening a large group of servicers and mortgage investors we facilitated their work to improve their outreach and develop an industry wide streamlined response to struggling borrowers because these industry standards are the product of investor and servicer discussions the risk of litigation should be manageable under the new framework announced yesterday investors have identified categories of borrowers who do not need to go through the cumbersome evaluation process but can be streamlined into consideration for refinancing or a loan modification this process will increase efficiency and free up resources allowing servicers to focus on the most troubled borrowers who require more in depth analysis because the number of servicers in this effort represents over of the subprime mortgage market we expect this framework will be implemented industry wide the servicers estimate that up to million subprime adjustable rate mortgage holders will be eligible for a fast track consideration for a refinancing or mortgage modification this approach is part of a larger framework to reach borrowers early and efficiently the industry working with nonprofit mortgage counselors is contacting borrowers facing a reset and providing a toll free number they and other homeowners can call for help together these efforts can result in fewer foreclosures and greater financial stability for families and communities there is no federal funding involved the gains come from streamlining and systematizing a complex and cumbersome process this framework will not prevent all foreclosures nor should it some borrowers particularly those who received loans under the most lax underwriting standards and who havent even been able to make their initial payments likely will become renters again the vast majority of americans pay their mortgages on time there are others for whom the only answer is foreclosure this new industry framework is not designed to address that population but no one should lose their home just because a complex cumbersome process simply couldnt get to them in time to determine if there is another potential solution that is the population addressed by the new industry framework streamlining the evaluation process to enable the industry to assess the needs of more borrowers more quickly and avoid foreclosures where there is a better answer the problems we are facing in the mortgage market are complex and unprecedented and there is no perfect way to deal with them this plan has evolved over time and will not be easy to implement we will monitor the situation closely and do our best to address issues as they arise mr paulson is secretary of the treasury
