hedge fund amd its founder take different paths at citi vikram pandits stature has been rising ever since he joined citigroup inc in july but old lane partners the hedge fund that he co founded and that was sold to the financial services firm earlier this year hasnt enjoyed the same kind of success now with mr pandit among the finalists to succeed charles prince as citigroups chief executive old lane is getting fresh attention from investors while the past few months have been tough on many hedge funds old lanes performance has fallen short of the high expectations that citigroup had when it shelled out more than &# million to buy the fund citigroups goal was to use old lane and its well regarded management team to jump start the new york banks small alternative investments business mr pandit and old lanes other founders meanwhile said that being part of a giant bank would help them attract fresh capital it hasnt worked out that way old lane lost money in november falling about according to people familiar with the matter that stacks up well against other funds which lost an average of about last month according to hedge fund research inc but it weighed down old lanes returns for the year which now are about lagging behind the average hedge funds roughly gain it also is far short of old lanes internal goal of annual returns of to according to an old lane investor mr pandit was instrumental in raising money for old lane and devising its strategy which focused largely on investments in emerging markets like india but he hasnt played an active role in the funds daily operations since at least early this summer when he took the helm of citigroups alternative investments unit in october he was promoted to oversee a new division that included the alternatives business and citigroups giant investment bank further distancing him from old lane mr pandit who ran morgan stanleys powerful institutional securities before leaving after a management shakeup in is one of four remaining candidates for the ceo position that mr prince vacated last month as the bank warned of billions of dollars in mortgage related losses while other citigroup executives including ajay banga who runs the banks international consumer group and chief financial officer gary crittenden have been interviewed for the ceo job mr pandit is the leading internal candidate according to people familiar with the matter a search committee on citigroups board also is considering outside candidates such as former citigroup president robert willumstad and michael neal who runs general electric co s commercial finance business say people familiar with the search the board is expected to name a new ceo within the next week these people say just needs more time a citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment on old lanes performance people close to old lane say the fund deserves more time to prove itself noting that hedge funds often require at least two years to hit their strides in its first year since launching in april old lane generated a roughly return which is respectable for a newly launched fund this year the fund was headed for a roughly annual gain before a credit storm hit in august roiling global markets and leading old lane to a loss for the month according to a person close to the fund that was one of only four months in which old lane has lost money this person said some old lane investors say the performance wasnt as good as expected this year in part because mr pandit has been distracted by his citigroup duties and tumult at the top of the bank "i wouldnt say were disappointed but we arent completely happy " says mark kenyon president and chief executive of union bancaire privee asset management a unit of union bancaire privee of switzerland which invests in hedge funds for wealthy investors and institutions "his focus is distracted that may have caused the problems " old lanes performance doesnt necessarily undercut mr pandits qualifications to run one of the worlds biggest banks some bankers say that managing a hedge fund and running a &# billion bank require different skills old lanes lackluster showing shouldnt be a strike against mr pandit says joe mccabe vice chairman of executive search firm ctpartners in boston old lane was "a warm up act compared to being the ceo of citigroup " he says "i wouldnt hold it against him " old lanes track record also raises questions about the amount that citigroup paid for the fund in april when it had been operating for barely a year the acquisition was the brainchild of robert rubin citigroups current chairman and a former treasury secretary who is now the main advocate of mr pandit becoming ceo the &# million plus price tag represented at least of old lanes roughly &# billion in assets under management at the time that was a generous premium publicly traded alternative investment firms such as blackstone group fortress investment group and och ziff capital management command market values that are of assets citigroup executives said the price was justified "we wanted a world class leader and vikram fits that bill " citigroup vice chairman stephen volk said in an april interview after coming under the citigroup umbrella old lane seemed positioned to expand citigroup executives said the company would use its smith barney retail brokerage and its private bank which caters to wealthy investors to steer new investments to old lane that hasnt happened but it isnt clear if citigroup scrapped those plans or simply hasnt implemented them yet but since joining citigroup old lane hasnt bulked up its assets under management as of early september the fund was overseeing nearly &# billion compared to about &# billion in april old lane today manages more than &# billion say people familiar with the matter citigroup officials say old lanes investors which include harvard universitys endowment havent been trying to pull their money out of the fund meanwhile old lane has wound down its small commodities trading unit over the last several weeks its performance was roughly flat for the year robin sidel ann davis and jed horowitz contributed to this article
