weekend journal review television back to the s for better or worse has become iconic in american history and were about to get a burst of retrospecting in the looming th anniversary year of a harbinger " with tom brokaw" appears on the history channel sunday p m et it makes a start at sorting through the chaff that era has generated beginning groan in haight ashbury it eventually reminds us that beneath the free love and the face paint was also a bummer yet while the time tripping is irresistible there is a lot of stale material along the way this is not entirely mr brokaws fault and in a way it may be his point more about that later take the soundtrack including such classics as "magic carpet ride " "all along the watchtower" and "jumpin jack flash " the latter which accompanies footage of brawling protesters and chicago cops at the democratic convention accidentally made me laugh you could picture an editing room where everybody said "hey cool this stones tune will set the mood " yet the music of the era has been replayed so often and become such a routine part of the culture including advertising for everything from cars to retirement financial planners that it has lost its punch and is veering toward kitsch at least for people who were in the thick of things in the s the old music evokes a satisfying feeling of nostalgia that cannot be said for the appearance of tommy smothers trotted out here for what feels like the millionth time to natter on about how cbs censored and ultimately canceled "the smothers brothers" show because of its barbs about the vietnam war and government morons hes been dining out on that for decades as has arlo guthrie on the whole "alices restaurant" thing at least its fun to see arlo his famous locks now glowing brilliant white admitting with a grin that although he was part of a movement that believed it was more healthy to smoke dope than to drink alcohol he has now changed and "grown to like whiskey " but what about michelle phillips who tells us "i had a good relationship with drugs i used them i had fun with them i grew with them" this coming from the mama whose erstwhile husband papa john and teenaged stepdaughter mackenzie became ravaged addicts mr brokaw perhaps spellbound like so many other men by the still lovely ms phillips offers no perspective along this line when the subject of drugs comes up among those interviewed for the film in fact it is usually in the context of how lsd or something expanded their consciousness an annoying echo in other words of the same things time magazine and others were breathlessly reporting four decades ago as a strong antidote however we have david smith who set up the haight ashbury free clinic and now as in still struggles to patch up lives ruined by drugs dr smith has no patience for those who ignore "the dark side" of an era they instead romanticize "how can we learn from history if we dont have an accurate reflection of history " of course some of the darkness was obvious in and not all of it had to do with the vietnam war we meet a draft dodger and mr brokaw reminds us that many more americans went not to canada but to serve in southeast asia yet the turmoil of antiwar protests was punctuated by shattering events the assassinations of martin luther king and robert kennedy and an explosion of race riots contributed to a sense as mr brokaw puts it that "the entire social fabric was unraveling with frightening speed " for some that was the goal although most have little to brag about now theres mark rudd a leader of the campus takeover that shut down columbia university soon after his trip to admire the cuban revolution mr rudd went on to help found the weather underground he says now that he was mistaken to believe that such a revolution was possible but offers no more profound observations than that ditto the folks who fought police outside the august convention for a battle with the establishment that lasted only minutes were shocked to be reminded how brief it was what did they accomplish how about nixons election and the eclipse of the democratic party amid nonsense from token figures like jerry garcia and footnotes like mr rudd some voices stand out the journals dorothy rabinowitz tartly observes that for all the hoopla then and wait for about the idealistic youth and their counterculture "most of the time it was a wild excess of self glorification and narcissism " by "an incredibly spoiled self indulgent generation " stewart brand founder of "the whole earth catalogue " is less trenchant but you get the feeling that he thinks a lot of the beautiful people were poseurs too this doesnt come across so strongly in the film as it does in mr brokaws new book "boom voices of the sixties " there we learn that internet pioneer mr brand supports nuclear power and that when people tell him they read "whole earth" in their youth he asks them "why " few have a good answer mr brokaws book is far more interesting than this film because it affords time for analysis and insights on tv events and fads tend to whip by leaving only a faint taste of the substantial in say the obvious contrast in reactions to the vietnam and iraq wars as for the staleness of some images mr brokaw doesnt say so explicitly but you sense that he wants us to notice that as much as the s altered america america has also defanged the era by absorbing and even consuming it like a commodity the times may change but they also change back perhaps the most delicious moment comes when we see a womens liberation protest outside the miss america pageant there they are marching on the boardwalk in atlantic city and throwing into a trash can the hated symbols of their oppression and not only bras we are informed but high heeled shoes manolo blahnik and victorias secret must be laughing all the way to the bank for average folks todays drug of choice would seem to be ghosts whether we are seeking escape comfort or just need a new thrill the paranormal appears to offer limitless possibilities tv has been catering to this craving with a raft of programs the latest of which is "paranormal state" p m mondays on a&amp e with another episode from p m this week led by penn state student ryan buell a team sets out to help families in distress with a few gadgets to film any demons or spirits but also with holy water to bless haunted houses it often does the trick not even trying to be scary is "oprah winfrey presents mitch alboms for one more day" p m sunday on abc it stars michael imperioli of "sopranos" fame as a suicidal alcoholic and former ballplayer who miraculously gets a chance to sort out his sorry life by spending time with his mother ellen burstyn long dead but back for one day
