who qualifies for help and what qualifies as subprime the mortgage plan outlined by the bush administration should help some borrowers with subprime adjustable rate mortgages but other borrowers who are having trouble making their payments wont qualify for the "fast track" interest rate freeze outlined yesterday heres a look at the agreement which mortgages does the plan cover the agreement covers only a subset of borrowers these are borrowers who took out subprime arms that were originated between jan and july and whose interest rates will reset for the first time between jan and july it applies only to loans that have been packaged into securities and not those that are held by banks on their own books homeowners should call their servicer to determine if their mortgage is covered by the plan it doesnt apply to borrowers with subprime arms that have already faced their first rate reset it also doesnt cover loans that are seriously delinquent fixed rate mortgages or arms issued to borrowers with good credit how do i know if i have a subprime mortgage the agreement doesnt provide a specific definition of subprime arms because it isnt always clear typically subprime arms carry a fixed interest rate for the first two or three years then adjust annually borrowers who arent sure whether or not they have a subprime arm can ask the company that collects their loan payments what are mortgage companies doing for these borrowers mortgage companies are setting up guidelines for who may qualify for a fast track program that would freeze the interest rate at the introductory rate for five years some borrowers who dont qualify for fast track may be eligible to refinance into a new mortgage based on their credit score and the amount of equity in their home mortgage companies have been encouraged to "take all reasonable steps" to facilitate a refinancing who qualifies for the rate freeze to qualify borrowers must live in their home and face a payment increase of more than when the rate on their arm resets for the first time the program is designed to help borrowers who arent good candidates for refinancing because of a poor credit score have little or no equity in their homes or a history of late payments to qualify for the fast track program borrowers must have a credit score of less than and it cant have improved by more than since the mortgage was originated what if ive missed a mortgage payment missing one mortgage payment wont automatically disqualify borrowers from the program however borrowers wont qualify if they are currently delinquent they also cant have been more than days late more than once in the last months what if i cant qualify for the fast track freeze some borrowers may be able to refinance into federal housing administration loans or other mortgage programs borrowers who dont qualify for a refinance or who dont meet the criteria for the fast track program will be dealt with on a case by case basis by their mortgage servicing company in some cases these borrowers may be able to obtain a lower rate or a reduction in the amount owed other options include a short sale in which the house is sold for less than the amount owed with the lender forgiving the balance or foreclosure whom should i call if i have questions borrowers are encouraged to contact the mortgage servicing company that collects their loan payments they can also call hope which provides counseling to homeowners with mortgage problems
