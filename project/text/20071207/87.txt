the book of romney in anticipation of mitt romneys big speech yesterday on the "religion question " some seemed to expect him to address the meaning and purpose of human existence he didnt and the speech was all the more politically admirable and instructive as a result instead of directly pushing back against skepticism of his mormon beliefs the republican presidential hopeful spoke to the more limited though still loaded topic of faith and politics in america there were considerable risks in doing so he had to allay qualms about his spiritual convictions without also turning off the primary voters who consider religion an important element in selecting their candidate another danger was that "the mormon issue" could dominate the days until the iowa caucuses despite the endless media analogies the speech wont be remembered as the kind of canonical american document that jack kennedys defense of his catholicism is made out to be and thats not a bad thing the kennedy precedent isnt useful because jfk essentially argued that religion shouldnt matter in politics he endorsed "an america where the separation of church and state is absolute " and in many ways that speech anticipated all that would follow the core of the democratic party shifted over time toward secular absolutism where any public engagement with religion is tantamount to its public establishment and maybe even the repeal of the enlightenment the supreme court also took an active role in making the policy preferences of the secular left the law of the land beginning in with its prohibition of prayer in public school mr romney then was addressing traditionally minded voters who have valid reasons for feeling excluded from the cultural if not democratic mainstream he did well to recognize the contributions that faith and religious institutions make to the american civic landscape and as he noted the american system is tolerant enough to accommodate the varieties of religious experience mr romneys implicit purpose though was to speak to the ecumenical alliance called "the religious right " which is united on some political issues but often divided on matters of faith he noted that "a common creed of moral convictions" brings him to the same policy conclusions as evangelical protestants and conservative catholics the political church in other words is broad enough to include mormons even if their doctrines arent simpatico mr romney mentioned the word "mormon" only once and he was right to steer clear of formal theology or specific practices some denominations are leery of or openly hostile to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints considering it un christian or even a cult surveys indicate that many voters oppose mr romney for this reason and his speech probably wont do much to convince them otherwise how unfortunate it would be if he were rejected on the basis of such irreducible doctrinal differences the mormons seem the very embodiment of "family values " and you couldnt invent a religious culture that lived more consistently with biblical messages broadly speaking most mormons have and come from big families theyre regular churchgoers and give to charity they dont drink smoke gamble or engage in premarital sex on the scale of american problems the mormons dont even register its particularly ironic that some religious voters are trafficking in anti mormon bias because the secular left has spent years trying to portray these same religious voters as a threat to the american system evangelicals have spent decades being ridiculed by the coastal elites for the born again lifestyle creationism opposition to embryonic stem cell research the "left behind" novels recall the ridiculous "theocracy" panic after the election now some of those same believers are trying to do the same to the mormons we doubt mr romney persuaded those voters but he probably had more success with say republican catholics who recall their pre jfk ostracism from presidential politics a larger irony is that the biggest doubts we hear about the romney candidacy have nothing to do with his religious convictions which seem consistent and sincere they concern his apparent lack of political convictions he governed massachusetts as a moderate republican and even today he speaks about reforming washington less with policy ideas than with the power of his positive technocratic thinking once a cultural moderate mr romney has converted to conservative social positions on abortion and so on rudy giuliani recently needled him about his "sanctuary mansion" for illegal immigrants so this week he fired his gardeners he boasted about his hillarycare lite reform in massachusetts then had his free market advisers rewrite it for the primary campaign despite yesterdays laudable speech we suspect mr romney will rise or fall as a candidate based on how well he can sell his worldly record see related letters "letters to the editor mitt romney candidate patriot mormon" wsj dec
