politics &amp economics house passes vast energy bill senate overhaul seen washington energy legislation including a landmark agreement to tighten fuel efficiency standards for vehicles cleared the house but appears headed for a senate overhaul the house vote was stronger than republicans had predicted but the white house issued a veto warning and senate democratic leader harry reid conceded that he lacked the votes to get cloture today and move ahead without changes the bills centerpiece is a provision to increase fuel efficiency standards for passenger cars and light duty trucks for the first time in more than years it would raise mileage standards to miles a gallon by a level the senate approved earlier this year democrats are determined to protect that higher standard but acknowledge it could require pruning part or all of two major provisions in the page bill a &# billion tax package that includes incentives and a federal mandate requiring utilities to generate of their electricity from wind or solar power and other so called renewable resources "if we cant get it all well get part of it " mr reid said "i think theres a mindset of everyone here to do the energy bill " senate republican leader mitch mcconnell r ky was focused primarily on the tax provisions and utility mandate which he said would lead to rate increases in his home region "hopefully we can get those problems removed and move toward a presidential signature " he said the white house statement issued before the house vote cited both the tax and renewable energy mandates and called on congress to "clarify" the fuel efficiency standard by naming one agency to oversee it rather than splitting functions between the environmental protection agency and the transportation department the bush administration also called for "an effective safety valve" to modify a mandate for using more ethanol and other fuels made from farm wastes and wood chips it would be needed in case some of the "advanced biofuels" required in the measure dont materialize by when billion gallons of the fuel additives will be required so far none of the advanced fuels has been produced commercially the house vote was a triumph for speaker nancy pelosi the california democrat said she was confident that whatever changes the senate makes a bill will go to the president with the fuel efficiency standards intact "we will have a deal " she said however ms pelosi had to put down a brief rebellion by members of her party several of them from the powerful energy and commerce committee who complained the bill had been assembled secretly in her office the committees chairman rep john dingell d mich voted for the bill although he made it clear on the house floor that his sympathy was with the rebels "i have some reservations to put it mildly about how this legislation was assembled " he said adding "many have been complicit in the curious process that has yielded an imperfect product " as many as democrats were reported to have signed a letter of complaint to ms pelosi but when the vote came only seven crossed party lines one of the rebels was rep gene green d texas who represents houston headquarters of much of the nations oil industry "i knew we were going to lose a substantial number of them the rebels because the speaker is very effective " he said "but i have to represent my own district " republicans were less restrained "we have a bill written in secret by a handful of people " said rep john boehner the house minority leader "we didnt see it until last night nobody knows whats in this bill because nobodys had time to read it " still republicans crossed party lines to vote for the bill many from suburban districts where the issue of improved fuel efficiency is popular
