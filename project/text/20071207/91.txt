the morning brief the latest exposure of the shadow war online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here cia admissions that the agency destroyed at least two videotapes documenting harsh interrogations amid court and congressional inquiries on the matter underline how high a cost the u s has paid since for trying to fight terrorism with methods only fit to be hidden current and former government officials tell the new york times the videotapes showed cia agents using severe interrogation techniques on abu zubaydah and other captured al qaeda operatives in the tapes were destroyed in by the then head of the agencys directorate of operations and apparently without the knowledge at the time of then cia chief porter goss the times reports but they were still around when lawyers for the agency told investigators for the commission and the judge in the trial of terror suspect zacarias moussaoui that the cia didnt possess such recordings law professor daniel marcus who served as the commissions general counsel and dealt with discussions about interviews with al qaeda leaders tells the times he had heard nothing about tapes being destroyed if that happened he adds "its a big deal its a very big deal " because such destruction essentially the withholding of evidence in a criminal matter could amount to obstruction of justice several officials tell the times the tapes were destroyed in part out of concern that exposure of the video depicting harsh interrogation posed legal risks for agency officials current cia director gen michael v hayden said in a statement to staffers yesterday that the tapes were destroyed because they no longer had intelligence value but also because if they became public theyd expose cia officials "and their families to retaliation from al qaeda and its sympathizers " as the times reports but it is the fear of such retaliation against american personnel that so many formerly senior american military officers and congressional critics have cited in opposing the use of such methods in the first place that doesnt bolster u s counterterror the cias admission came the same day "house and senate negotiators reached an agreement on legislation that would prohibit the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation tactics by the cia and bring intelligence agencies in line with rules followed by the u s military " the washington post notes and it will undoubtedly affect that debate at a time when many republican lawmakers and presidential candidates support the use of such tactics as necessary to protecting the u s from terrorism and with president bush threatening to veto any bill that tries to ban them the times says it informed the cia wednesday evening that it was about to publish an article on the tapes and gen hayden acknowledged he was informing cia employees about the matter "because the press has learned" about it that line of reasoning has been a theme of late in washington newsweek cites current and former u s intelligence officials saying the release of the latest national intelligence estimate on iran this week came in part because "some officials feared leaks and accusations of a cover up " allegations of misuse of intelligence and intelligence tactics and a long held penchant for secrecy have played against the administration in mr bushs second term the leaders of france and germany for example are still promoting an international effort to shut down parts of irans nuclear programs as the times reports but they face an uphill battle at the united nations thanks to a perceived disconnect between what the nie says and white house rhetoric the u s also now faces rising opposition to the planned installation of a missile defense system in europe a pressure point in quarrels with russia thanks to the nie as the associated press reports the supreme court face off over trials at guantanamo is all about bringing terror prosecutions into the open and the u s rendition program and once secret participation by allies in europe shoved public opinion on the continent even farther away from sympathy with washington when it was made public in part because of how it clashed with principles shunning what the bbc calls "the unhindered use of government power " lacking geopolitical capital the administration has reversed itself on what the wall street journal describes as "numerous foreign policy fronts " most notable yesterday through mr bushs letter directly to north korean leader kim jong il addressing a regime he once grouped in the "axis of evil" and a man he said he loathed mr bush was asking for greater "cooperation in implementing a pact to dismantle its nuclear arms in exchange for full normalized relations " the journal notes the university of maryland professor of middle east studies shibley telhami once argued that "in every conflict the extent to which a party can muster domestic support and international support and the extent to which its public will withstand higher thresholds of pain is very much a function of the degree of international legitimacy for that cause " the righteousness the u s wielded following was an important asset in counterterror efforts at home and abroad and its one directly affected by admissions like yesterdays from the cia strauss kahn plans layoffs at the imf dominique strauss kahn the new managing director of the international monetary fund tells the wall street journal that as part of overhaul and budgetary mending of the institution he plans to cut about of the staff the first significant series of layoffs since the imfs founding in in addition to shoring up its financial deficit mr strauss kahn is trying "to keep the imf relevant at a time when developing nations are growing rapidly often have fat reserves and have little need for imf aid " the journal notes "the cuts are also part of his strategy to win u s and european backing for a plan to sell part of the imfs gold hoard and invest in income producing assets to put the imf on a sounder financial footing " but as mr strauss kahn himself notes "all this is possible only if i have the commitment by different governments" to boost imf income "if not " he adds "nothing is done " william mcguires &# million surrender a year after he was ousted from one of the highest paid chief executiveships in corporate america former unitedhealth group ceo william mcguire agreed to give up at least &# million to settle claims that he improperly benefited from back dated stock options coming on top of some &# million he had already agreed to return to unitedhealth the payment is one of the largest a corporate leader has ever had to relinquish as the backdating scandal continues to resonate in boardrooms and courtrooms across the country the new york times notes the returned money is part of separate settlements mr mcguire reached with the securities and exchange commission and unitedhealth shareholders "the forfeitures are the first time regulators have successfully employed corporate governance rules put in place after the collapse of enron that force executives to disgorge ill gotten gains " the times adds compensation consultant brian foley tells the wall street journal he believes dr mcguires total repayment represents the largest such giveback due to executive compensation abuses in history "you have to applaud the sheer magnitude " mr foley says "on the other hand he still walks away with a lot " also of note associated press a russian court has ordered the release of a reporter committed to a psychiatric hospital for nine months after writing articles critical of the military campaign in chechnya reporters without borders said the reporter is one of several journalists and opposition activists who have been sent to psychiatric hospitals in russia in recent years reviving a punitive practice widely used in the soviet era separately officials said president vladimir putin and other top russia and belarus officials next week will consider

al sadr for helping through a cease fire to reduce violent attacks in iraq by since june it was unusual praise by a u s official for a relentless critic of the american role in iraq though gen

no religion should dictate to the state nor should the state interfere with the free practice of religion but in recent years the notion of the separation of church and state has been taken by some well beyond its original meaning they seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of god religion is seen as merely a private affair with no place in public life it is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in america the religion of secularism they are wrong " republican presidential candidate mitt romney said yesterday in a widely anticipated speech aimed at confronting religious conservatives skepticism about his mormon faith "i will take care to separate the affairs of government from any religion but i will not separate us from the god who gave us liberty "if my choice is between mike huckabee who i know is saved and gov romney who as a mormon im going to pick mike huckabee " republican voter steve carlson a pentecostal christian and a consultant for the nonprofit voter education organization iowa christian alliance tells the wall street journal although mr romneys speech included such statements as "i believe jesus christ is the son of god " it elicited mixed reviews among some of the evangelical christians whose votes are key to the republican presidential nomination the journal says write to joseph schuman at joseph schuman
