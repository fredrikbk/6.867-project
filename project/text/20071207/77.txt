politics &amp economics mccains new hampshire glimmer winner of primary regains strength amid opponents troubles manchester n h campaign volunteer and retired physicist bill machell says he sees a change from a few months ago when he began telephoning voters on behalf of john mccain fewer people are hanging up on him could the arizona republican senator at years old be this elections comeback kid with one month to go before the jan primary here polls show the presidential hopeful regaining some of the ground he lost during the summer because of his support of an immigration bill and his campaigns collapse amid disorganization and poor fund raising now mr mccains chief rivals are running into turbulence mitt romney has been overtaken in the polls in iowa by mike huckabee raising broader concerns about mr romneys viability among the evangelical base rudy giuliani faces new questions about his ethics as mayor fred thompson continues to be dogged by doubts about his energy for the fight all of that may be prompting republicans to give mr mccain a second look particularly in new hampshire he recently won the endorsement of the states largest newspaper and on a weeklong campaign swing this week he is drawing capacity crowds at the diners and townhall meetings where much of states campaigning takes place "welcome home " vietnam veteran chris lussier shouted to big applause at the union street grill in milford the reference he said was to the senators years as a war prisoner but it could also have been about mr mccains return to the state where his victory in the primary briefly stalled george w bushs drive to the nomination and positioned mr mccain as the national front runner at the outset of the campaign the arizona senators message isnt much different than it was eight years ago strong national defense and fiscal conservatism which have earned him a reliable core following but coupled with his dramatic personal story that message seems to be getting some new attention as voter disenchantment with washington grows mr mccain faces tough odds even in new hampshire the early primary state that most reflects his fiscally conservative socially moderate viewpoint he concedes he may be blown out in the iowa caucuses five days earlier and the next big vote that follows new hampshire the jan primary in south carolina favors candidates from the partys social conservative wing new hampshire voters typically make their decisions in the month before the vote which leaves time for mr mccain to unseat mr romney a former governor of neighboring massachusetts who current leads in the university of new hampshires granite state poll in the november poll of likely republican primary voters said they supported mr romney who has spent &# million on statewide television ads since february mr mccain who has spent &# on tv so far came second with of the vote in the same poll just of voters said they had "definitely decided" on a candidate but this weeks reports about mr romneys use of a landscaping company that employed illegal workers could unsettle some of those voters too mr romney said he fired the company new hampshires undecideds began their big swing toward mr mccain just days before the primary when they did the states huge block of independents who are free to vote in either partys primary here provided the senator his margin of victory that combination of late deciders and independents leaves new hampshire up for grabs among the republicans "were in a competitive position " mr mccain said in an interview "can we continue to move forward i dont know " the senators biggest challenge will be convincing new hampshire voters that he can once more ignite enough excitement to win the nomination new hampshire democrats won both the statehouse and the governors mansion in and republicans arent in a mood this year to "try to send a message" by voting for someone who isnt electable said fergus cullen the states republican party chairman mr mccains vote on a bill that would have legalized millions of illegal immigrants remains a sore point here even though hispanics who account for the majority of illegal immigrants are just of the population "there are a lot of voters that treat me very harshly" over immigration he said in the interview at a town hall meeting in hooksett a few hours later irene darrah was one of them ms darrah who is years old and says she voted for the senator in told him she worries that illegal immigrants are "going to change the whole character of the country " mr mccain answered that he "will secure the border" before considering legalization again but that didnt satisfy ms darrah who said later that she will switch to mr romney despite his personal immigration troubles because she thinks he will be tougher at enforcing immigration laws mr mccains strong support of a large troop presence in iraq also gives him headaches here despite the recent security gains in iraq veterans make up a healthy share of his audiences and mr mccain began all of his campaign appearances here by reminding voters of his support for the troop surge troop "morale is good they know theyre succeeding " he told the milford coffee shop crowd new hampshire republicans still support the iraq war as do mr mccains republican rivals but independents are largely opposed and voters have registered as independents this year more than have registered as republicans even if mr mccain does win new hampshire he may not be able to translate that into success down the line south carolina republican party chairman katon dawson labels his states primary a "brawl" with no clear favorite he says mr mccain remains viable with a strong staff a volunteer network and a recent fund raiser mr mccain who has spent days campaigning in south carolina this year predicted that the states large veteran population and his support among national security hawks will help his prospects there but perhaps even more than in new hampshire the immigration debate is "very harmful to me" in south carolina he said the senator says hell now "ricochet" among south carolina iowa and new hampshire starting with a southern swing next week a victory in any of the three is "all in the expectations who exceeded them who didnt " he said for the moment he added "the expectation is that were coming up "
