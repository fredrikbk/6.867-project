weekend journal tastings the next big thing half bottles top flight wines are increasingly showing up in smaller sizes while we were preparing for dotties most recent spinal surgery we got a great idea for an utterly unexpected holiday present no not an entirely new skeletal system although if you happen to see that in one of those specialty catalogues let us know but something for a wine lover in your life heres what happened weve spent a great deal of time with doctors over the decades and one thing weve learned is that many of them love wine whenever we visit a doctor we discuss what ails us a little bit and then the rest of the time talk about wine this is fine with us of course since its much more fun chatting about semillon than stitches weve known for years that dotties neurosurgeon loved wine but hed never told us this until now his wife doesnt drink wine as a result he said he doesnt enjoy fine wine as often as hed like because he would never drink an entire bottle and wouldnt want any to go to waste we hear variations of this all the time and not just from surgeons we get notes from husbands who dont want to give up good wine while their wives are pregnant from wives whose husbands dont drink at all from couples who are getting older and feel they can no longer share an entire bottle from mixed couples that is those where one partner only drinks white and the other only drinks red and from single people who enjoy wine but dont want to waste any these people usually contact us because they want to know how to store an opened bottle of wine but our doctors lament provided us a eureka moment for the perfect gift for all of these people a case of outstanding wines that happen to be packaged in half bottles many people still believe that only bubblies sweet wines and second rate still wines come in half bottles but that hasnt been true for some time back in we first wrote about the surge of half bottles partly driven by the famous chef thomas keller who asked more than top wineries to produce half bottles for his restaurant the french laundry more than two years ago we wrote about the increasing number of half bottles offered in restaurants twice as many as five years earlier according to one expert look closely at many fine wine stores and youll be surprised at the selection of good wines now available in half bottles many of the biggest and best wine web sites from sherry lehmann com in new york to brownderby com in missouri to winelibrary com in new jersey to winex com and klwines com in california allow you to search specifically for half bottles and they have good selections theres even a site called halfwitwines com based in san francisco that only sells halves and claims to offer more than by ordering a case of half bottles for a friend you really can open up a whole new world of wine enjoyment for them whats out there we decided to order a case of wine for our doctor that would show him that a very wide selection of half bottles now exists the pressure was on hes a brilliant successful man who knows his wine and he knows we do this for a living how could we impress him listed in the box below are the wines we ordered and the prices we paid prices vary widely we did not include any dessert wines or sparklers since pretty much everybody already knows that they come in half bottle sizes now take a minute to look over that list there are wines both red and white from six countries there are trendy wines such as austrian gruner veltliner and new zealand sauvignon blanc and classics such as barolo and chablis theres a good example of oregons outstanding pinot noir and two wines from well known and often hard to find california vineyards including a cabernet blend from the excellent vintage we couldnt believe we found an august kesseler spatburgunder thats germanys name for pinot noir and its from an excellent producer in the rheingau region but we rarely see this wine in any size finally we were pleased as punch to be able to find lynch bages red and white in half bottle size we love the white were crazy about white bordeaux and this is consistently one of our favorites but it can be hard to find and the opportunity for our doctor to taste these together or in close proximity is exciting handle with care when youre buying half bottles remember that smaller bottles may age more quickly so be extra careful to make sure that older bottles have been stored well also we sometimes hear from people who are upset that half bottles cost more than half of regular size bottles indeed this is very broad but it appears that our halves cost us overall about of what we would have paid for full size bottles but this shouldnt be a surprise to anyone who knows that smaller sizes of tide cost more ounce for ounce than larger sizes although its also true that magnums of fine wine can cost more than twice a regular size bottle thats because larger bottles are often rare and can be prized both because they are unusual and because they age well heres our advice if you have friends who think they cant enjoy wine fully because they cant enjoy full bottles call around to local stores to see which has the widest selection of halves be sure to say youre not looking for dessert wines or champagne if you strike out hit the internet hopefully either you or your giftees will live in a state to which wine can be shipped order a mixed case of reds and whites from all over the world and enclose a card that tells your friends to drink these up you might also want to tell your friends that half bottles have a useful afterlife too because when they do open a full bottle and find they have half of the bottle left over they can rinse out one of the halves and pour in the remaining wine fill to the top cork it and have another lovely half bottle for the next night melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com a halves dozen here are the half bottles that we chose to give our doctor as a special gift its impossible to know what half bottles you might find but many wine shops now offer a pretty good selection if you order wine
