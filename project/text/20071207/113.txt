weekend journal taste houses of worship what iowans should know about mormons yesterday at the end of mitt romneys speech he told a story from the early days of the first continental congress whose members were meeting in philadelphia in "with boston occupied by british troops and fears of an impending war someone suggested they pray " but because of the variety of religious denominations represented there were objections "then sam adams rose and said he would hear a prayer from anyone of piety and good character as long as they were a patriot " were adams alive today he most certainly would hear a prayer from a mormon it is hard to imagine a group more patriotic than the modern church of jesus christ of latter day saints but there is reason to believe that voters in iowa and elsewhere will not accept mr romneys invitation put forward implicitly in his remarks yesterday at the george bush library to ignore religious differences and embrace him simply as a man of character who loves his country a recent pew poll shows that only of americans have a favorable opinion of mormons thats roughly the same percentage who feel that way toward muslims by contrast more than three quarters of americans have a favorable opinion of jews and catholics whatever the validity of such judgments one has to wonder why does a faith professed by the hijackers rank alongside that of a peaceful productive highly educated religious group founded within our own borders many evangelicals in the gop view mormonism as "a cult " or at least not a christian faith one southern baptist leader recently called it the "fourth abrahamic religion " i remember a couple of years ago sitting in on an apologetics class at a christian high school in colorado springs colo and hearing the teacher describe a critical moment in the history of the muslim faith when the rock that now sits under the dome of the rock in jerusalem tried to fly to heaven and had to be restrained by mohammad acknowledging that it sounded a little wacky the teacher added "well its no stranger than that guy who found golden tablets in upstate new york " the students laughed uproariously at the reference to the mormons founding father joseph smith six years ago i probably could have counted on one finger the number of mormons i had met having lived most my life in the northeast my situation was hardly unique then while researching a book on religious colleges i decided to spend some time at brigham young university in provo utah in preparation i picked up "mormon america the power and the promise" by religion reporters richard and joan ostling the ostlings offer a comprehensive account of the churchs history and theology as well as helpful descriptions of the mormons cultural and political outlook "the onetime believers in plural marriage considered a dire threat to victorian probity and the entire nation " the authors write "have become the exemplars of conservative monogamous family values " it is hard to disagree mormons marry young and have large families they dont drink smoke or gamble the church does not condone homosexuality members give at least of their income to the church and often volunteer more than hours a week in some religious capacity with no professional clergy the survival of congregations or "stakes" is entirely dependent on lay participation all young mormon men and many women spend two years as missionaries their travels funded by their own families the church stocks soup kitchens across the country and internationally both its own and those of other faiths with food from its farms and warehouses rather than behaving like an insular cult members are integrated into the society around them sending their kids to public schools and assuming leadership positions locally and nationally once mormons complete their missionary service they are not obliged to proselytize so having mormons as neighbors doesnt mean a constant bombardment with invitations to join up but many americans unless theyve actually had a mormon neighbor might find all these rosy facts meaningless feeling deeply uneasy with some of mormonisms tenets a lot of what we call religious tolerance depends on social contact not theological understanding and there are only about six million lds members in the u s mostly concentrated in the western states though increasingly less so if you press baptists they will acknowledge finding catholics belief in transubstantiation implausible at best jews like me have a little trouble getting over the virgin birth but we all get along for the most part because we know each other and live similar lives as americans whatever faith we profess but most iowans will not meet a mormon in the next six weeks unless mr romney comes to call mormons make up less than one half of of the states population so let me offer a brief snapshot not in the hope that iowans will vote for mr romney but in the hope that if they dont vote for him their decision wont have anything to do with his religion the young men and women at brigham young university are among the smartest hardest working and most pleasant college kids you will find anywhere for better or worse i have visited dozens of college campuses the student body lives by the mormon principle "the glory of god is intelligence " most reside off campus without adult supervision yet they adhere strictly to curfews rules about contact with the opposite sex and every other church directive they are purposeful but seem to enjoy themselves spending their free time hiking in the sprawling desert and byu has americas largest rotc program outside of our military schools this last fact is one i had occasion to think about on my trip i left for byu on sept and returned home a week later on the students gathered for a campuswide devotional the university president tried to comfort the students with "the eternal perspective " my eternal perspective is not the same as theirs of course but hearing more than young people around me reciting the pledge of allegiance made me realize that our temporal perspective is the same im sure sam adams would have agreed ms riley is the journals deputy taste editor
