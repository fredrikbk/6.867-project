business technology talking tech dispatches from the gadget wars when one of the warring camps in the continuing format war over high definition dvds cut prices to &# for certain models of high definition players in some big chain stores in recent days gizmodo the widely read gadget blog was all over the story for people interested in consumer toys the rivalry between blu ray and hd dvd is like what coke vs pepsi is for cola fans gizmodos editor brian lam talked about recent developments in next generation disks as well as what its like to be covering that battle on a day in day out basis q high definition players were a thousand dollars a few years back and a few hundred just a few weeks back at &# arent we finally moving beyond "early adopters" and into regular consumers a absolutely i never would have dreamed the price would have dropped so much so quickly you know how consumer price points work above &# and people say "ive got to ask my wife " but while its awesome for consumers im not sure how much of this &# price point is real q why not a i dont know if this is spin or not can you actually buy one or was it a today only limited numbers kind of thing thats the question i never run anything from either camp without checking with the other camp even for a blog that just runs whatever im superparanoid about what these guys tell me at all times im totally paranoid that these guys are spinning its totally messed up how much they spin people q the &# systems were low end hd dvd players whats the difference between them and the more expensive models a its pretty wonky stuff for example they might not upscale older dvds as nicely higher end models might have a special chip that will make older dvds look better q despite the big battle both blu ray and hd dvd have virtually identical image quality do you think most consumers know that a its totally ridiculous to say that there is a difference in quality between the two high definition formats q how about the difference between regular dvd and high definition a you can get fooled unless you are watching on say a or inch tv you might not be able to tell i know people whove watched what they thought was high definition but which in fact wasnt q which is ahead blu ray or hd dvd in the number of movies they have available a thats the question i need to get a researcher to sit down and figure that out for me you cant do it numerically who cares if you are missing say "barney" on high definition you have to look at sales and ask which popular titles are available in either format but in either case the fact remains that its really messed up that you can probably get only half of your favorite movies in hd dvd and half of them in blu ray q what about hybrid players which can play both formats arent they the consumers happy ending for this story a they are really expensive now maybe that has to do with the money they need to give to both of the formats last year there was just one from lg but it didnt really work right for example you couldnt use any of the hd dvd menus this year youve got two the second generation lg and a model from samsung but theyre still expensive &# or so q im surprised they still cost so much a for people who want both types of playback next year is going to be better but then it always is
