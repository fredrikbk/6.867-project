stoppard is back on broadway rock n roll bernard b jacobs theatre tickets &# &# new york in the annals of broadway will be remembered as the year tom stoppard fooled everyone lincoln center theaters production of "the coast of utopia " a trilogy of long demanding history plays about the th century roots of marxism bucked the odds to become the surprise hit of the season now comes "rock n roll " whose cheery title will doubtless lead a certain number of innocents to expect something other than a three hour stage extravaganza about dialectical materialism in czechoslovakia if anyone else had written "rock n roll " it wouldnt have opened on broadway in a showy commercial production directed by trevor nunn the man who brought us "cats" and more recently supervised the public display of ian mckellans private parts in "king lear " but mr stoppard is a wizard when it comes to making complicated ideas palatable and i expect hell make out like a bandit two times running as well he should while "rock n roll" isnt perfect by any means its still an intellectually challenging intensely theatrical piece of work that is destined to be talked about wherever playgoers gather part of what makes "rock n roll" a tough nut is that its really two related plays that are woven together like a double helix and stuffed into a single giant sized package both begin in the year when idealistic czech reformers tugged too hard on their reins and were ruthlessly slapped down by the kremlin which sent soviet tanks rolling into prague play no is about max brian cox a left wing cambridge don of a certain age who has remained faithful to the communist party and its long deferred dream of a marxist utopia even though hes been "kicked in the guts by nine tenths of anything you can tell me about soviet russia " play no is about jan rufus sewell maxs prize pupil a seemingly cool headed realist who returns to his native czechoslovakia in the hope of saving "socialism with a human face " then finds himself swept up in the spring tide of resistance to soviet rule philosophical materialism is the tie that binds the two halves of "rock n roll" as well as making it a quasi epilogue to "the coast of utopia" like all good marxists max rejects the notion that man has a soul separate and distinct from his body "the brain is a biological machine for thinking if it wasnt for the merely technical problem of understanding how it works we could make one out of beer cans " but his wife eleanor portrayed with searing passion by sinead cusack who is dying by inches of cancer knows better "theyve cut cauterized and zapped away my breasts my ovaries my womb half my bowel and a nutmeg out of my brain and i am undiminished im exactly who ive always been i am not my body my body is nothing without me i dont want your mind which you can make out of beer cans dont bring it to my funeral i want your grieving soul or nothing " jan approaches the same problem from a different direction unlike max he is a lover of western pop music who appreciates the subversive soul freeing power of art and he discovers on returning to prague that the materialistic apparatchiks who rule czechoslovakia are as fearful of the unbridled sensuality of a homegrown rock group like the plastic people of the universe as they are of the u s army and its cruise missiles "the policemans fear is what makes him angry hes frightened by indifference the plastics dont care at all theyre coming from somewhere else from where the muses come from theyre not heretics theyre pagans " here as always mr stoppard is careful to wrap his dark and knotty meditations on modernity in the reassuring cloak of wit "theater is a recreation " he has said "it can be much more but unless its recreation i dont see the point of it " but "rock n roll" is the first tom stoppard play ive seen that felt too long to me perhaps because the scenes set in czechoslovakia too often suggest a cross between a historical pageant and a finger wagging lecture on the horrors of communism yes theyre full of good things and i couldnt agree more with mr stoppard about life behind the iron curtain but i think he would have done better to stick to the english half of the play which is where the emotional center of gravity of "rock n roll" is to be found had he done so he could have made all his political and philosophical points in two hours time and given us a more effective play to boot i also have my doubts about mr nunns staging which is a bit on the slow moving side and robert joness set whose over elaborate scene changes are covered by a series of musical interludes in which snippets of recordings by bob dylan john lennon pink floyd the rolling stones the velvet underground and various other period rockers are played loudly while enervatingly extensive discographical information for each song is flashed on the lowered curtain this slows the action down even further at times to the point of outright ponderousness so too does mr coxs noisy acting in which bluster is made to substitute for eloquence none of these problems is insignificant and taken together they prevent "rock n roll" from rising to the level of its strongest scenes though i wonder how i would have felt about the play as a whole had i first seen it in a brisker simpler staging i hate to say it but i expected rather more from the author of "the coast of utopia " yet even so "rock n roll" succeeds in touching the heart while stimulating the mind and in ms cusack who plays the tricky double role of eleanor and her daughter esme with awe inspiring aplomb it has a star worthy of its best pages i wasnt altogether satisfied by "rock n roll " but i wouldnt have missed it for the world mr teachout the journals drama
