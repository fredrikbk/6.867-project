fcc seeks data from sirius xm the federal communications commission sent questionnaires to xm satellite radio holdings inc and sirius satellite radio inc that provide an indication of areas where the fcc could ask for concessions as part of any satellite radio merger approval the request sought detailed information about nearly every aspect of their businesses from exclusive distribution contracts to programming arrangements to technical questions about where equipment is located answers to those questions could help the fcc shape conditions in the event a merger is approved both the justice department and the fcc must approve any merger the fcc asked for information on what channels duplicate each other and could be consolidated following a merger and what opportunities might arise for niche content providers conceivably the fcc could impose requirements mandating more programming by various minority groups for example the fcc also asked for details on interoperable technology that would allow programming from both services to run on satellite radios which now typically can run programming from just one service the questions showed the agency is likely to home in on that issue as part of any merger conditions
