empire solves his two biggest problems overnight not only will he be able to jettison the underperforming parts of his empire such as his online lending business but he will resolve the tension between him and his longtime backer john malone mr diller who is chairman and chief executive of iac yesterday reversed a dozen years of acquisitions with his plan to break up the &# billion media and internet empire into five separate companies he now will be free to focus on his fastest growing internet businesses which are staying in iac including ask com citysearch and match com weaker performers will be carved off into separate public companies they include the hsn home shopping network which has been hurt by management missteps in recent years lendingtree which has been buffeted by the housing slump and ticketmaster profitable but pressured by changes in the music industry also going is interval international a vacation time share business that is growing but didnt fit with the rest of mr dillers empire iac shares jumped to &# in p m nasdaq stock market composite trading future control of the spun off companies is up in the air while all iac shareholders will be given shares in the new companies some of them could ultimately be sold others such as hsn are likely to end up in the hands of mr malone the cable magnate whose liberty media corp owns a controlling voting stake in mr dillers company under a longstanding proxy arrangement mr diller has the right to vote libertys shares but mr dillers voting rights dont automatically extend to companies spun out of iac according to executives of both companies as a result liberty will be given the chance to take control of any of them although it isnt clear mr malone wants them all the two companies are likely to negotiate to allow mr diller to retain voting control of one or two executives said mr diller said in an interview that he is interested in being involved in only one or two of the spun out companies relations between the two men have grown rockier in the past couple of years as iacs stock price has stagnated earlier this year looking for a way to unravel their partnership they discussed having liberty take full ownership of hsn in exchange for giving up the bulk of its stake in iac but the talks fell apart partly over mr malones concerns about hsns performance now mr malone could get control of hsn and probably more the restructuring offers a way to at least partially unravel the arrangement "it unsticks some things " mr malone said in an interview adding that he believes the individual businesses will grow faster and be worth more now that they are on their own "from our point of view each one of these businesses will be more valuable " mr dillers decision to shake up his empire started to take shape after talks to sell hsn to liberty collapsed around march of this year over the summer hsns performance started to improve and mr diller started to formulate his new plan he discussed the option with mr malone and liberty ceo greg maffei in september a few weeks ago he began briefing board members who voted unanimously in favor of the deal friday iac notified some executives sunday night and employees in an email monday mr diller has been building iac since the mid s when he struck a deal with mr malone giving him control of a group of tv stations and hsn in subsequent years mr diller pursued an ever evolving strategy as he first tried to expand in entertainment buying a group of cable channels and a tv production company and then a few years later decided to exit from that business the entertainment channels tv production company and tv stations were all eventually discarded except for hsn instead the mogul who had risen to fame in the business world through his stewardship of paramount pictures and news corp s fox network plunged headlong into the internet world using cash generated by hsn he aimed to create a new type of interactive company centered on premium transaction businesses like travel online dating ticketing and service he milked his conglomerate for managers frequently shuffling executives among divisions and tapping standouts to join his executive team in new york but this strategy ran into problems iacs once highflying stock price hit a wall in as mr diller said he would scale back his buying spree and the company took write downs on some of its businesses to simplify his corporate structure mr diller moved in to spin off online travel giant expedia acquired only a couple of years before but that wasnt enough iac was still a conglomerate of disparate businesses on wildly varying tracks that was demonstrated clearly last week when iac reported third quarter earnings showing growth in the media and advertising businesses that include ask com but lower profit at the retailing division that includes hsn and a loss at lending tree iac and dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal have announced they will together launch a personal finance web site yesterday mr diller admitted that iacs complexity took "many mouthfuls of sentences to explain " boggling investors he had retained some transactional businesses because iac "needed their earnings to allow us to invest in emerging internet businesses now that we have real scale in the pure internet units it makes nothing but sense to me to reorganize the whole " in the future mr diller will try to reinvent himself yet again focusing on ask com and small internet ventures like online games and internet video such as video site vimeo com and collegehumor ask com is starting to show promise google inc yahoo inc and microsoft corp fought for months over the right to run ads on its network over the course of the negotiations microsoft even offered to buy the search engine according to people familiar with the matter a microsoft spokesman declined to comment yesterday mr diller announced a new five year deal with google that iac estimates is worth &# billion in revenue for iac iac will still face formidable competition many of its new internet ventures such as its virtual world for teens are in their very early stages and ask remains a small player in search accounting for about of u s internet searches according to comscore inc
