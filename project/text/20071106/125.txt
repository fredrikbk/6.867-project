when to take a counteroffer from your employer q is taking a counteroffer bad for a career i accepted a new job but then took a counteroffer from my current employer i thought it would be better to stay at a place i knew and was told i could head up some new activities a knowing when to accept a counteroffer can be tricky mostly the decision turns on whether you can be sure the factors that made you want to leave will change usually counteroffers result in bigger salaries if all you wanted was more money taking your companys offer may have been the right decision besides money or additional responsibilities you may be able to negotiate more flexible hours added time off additional training or getting an office "where it gets gamey is when the company says oh we want to keep you and heres what well do for you but you dont have it in writing " says ken stempson director of administration and human resources for intelepeer inc a communications company he says about half of employees take counteroffers but the majority start looking for new jobs within six months because they find that nothing really changed except the size of their paycheck if you want more things to change you need to have a detailed discussion with your manager before you agree to stay "the employee needs to probe deeply and almost overcommunicate why they wanted to leave and see if it will change in the future " says peter vergano senior manager of human resources strategic staffing for samsung electronics americas companies usually dont make counteroffers if theyre planning to dismiss someone mr vergano adds but you should determine if an employer is making promises just to buy time to find a replacement also recognize that some managers resent having to make counteroffers and that it may damage your relationship "most managers i know are not happy being placed in a position of having to create a new opportunity " mr stempson says if you accept a counteroffer be sure to end things gracefully with the employer who made the new offer a team of people there probably put considerable time and effort into recruiting you and each one deserves a personal note see related letter "letters to the editor playing two offers but without forfeiting trust" wsj nov
