a sarbox for housing throughout the s and s congress prodded even strong armed banks into making more mortgage loans to low income and minority families washington enacted anti discrimination and community lending laws with penalties against lenders for failing to issue riskier mortgages to homebuyers living in poor neighborhoods or with low downpayments and subpar credit ratings and so it was that the modern subprime mortgage market was born now and for a variety of reasons some two million of those loans have gone sour and the same politicians are searching for villains leading the charge is house financial services chairman barney frank who is accusing banks of "predatory lending" by which he means making loans to the very group of borrowers that mr frank and his colleagues urged banks to serve as early as today mr frank plans to hold a committee vote on his mortgage reform and anti predatory lending act of which would impose new rules and financial penalties on subprime lenders while providing new lawsuit opportunities for distressed borrowers "people should not be lent money thats beyond what they can be expected to pay back " mr frank says now theres an idea why didnt the bankers think of that mr franks proposal is a trial lawyers dream it would forbid banks from signing up borrowers for "overly expensive loans" require banks to make sure that the consumer has a "reasonable ability to repay the loan" and insist that loans must be "solely in the best interest of the consumer " this kind of murky language would invite litigation from every borrower who misses a payment if it becomes law we can expect to see billboards reading "behind on your mortgage for relief call sue your banker " also for the first time banks that securitize mortgages would be made "explicitly liable for violations of lending laws " this is a version of secondary liability that holds the bundlers and resellers of mortgages responsible for the sins of the original lenders the reselling of mortgages has been a boon both to housing liquidity and risk diversification so to the extent the frank bill adds a new risk element to securitizing subprime loans and it surely will the main losers will be subprime borrowers who will pay higher rates if they can get a loan at all no one disputes that there were lending excesses during this decades housing revels the federal reserves easy money policy created a subsidy for debt and fed an asset bubble that made borrowers and lenders alike think prices would rise forever if companies or individuals committed fraud they should be punished meanwhile federal regulators have been rewriting rules to outlaw the most abusive practices such as onerous prepayment penalties and disguised balloon interest payments but for all the demonizing about of even subprime loans are being repaid on time and another are only days behind most of these new homeowners are low income families often minorities who would otherwise not have qualified for a mortgage in the name of consumer protection mr franks legislation will ensure that far fewer of these loans are issued in the future all of this would also hit banks when they and their shareholders are already being punished in the marketplace the stock values of financial companies have taken a beating and executives are losing their jobs lenders are fleeing the subprime market and the pendulum has swung to the opposite extreme as banks have tightened credit which is contributing to the mortgage meltdown the latest housing data indicate that new home sales are down from a year ago with the biggest retrenchment in the subprime market the volume of subprime securities was down a whopping to &# billion in the third quarter from &# billion one year ago originations of the controversial subprime arms are down by so far this year compared to mr franks bill couldnt come at a worse time as it will further shrink credit to marginal borrowers which will mean fewer buyers and extend the housing downturn the frank bill is essentially a sarbanes oxley for housing an attempt to punish business in general for the excesses of an unscrupulous few and the perverse incentives created by washington policy see related letter "letters to the editor welcome to the house greedy lenders built" wsj nov
