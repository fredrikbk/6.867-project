moving the market how big is petrochina market cap may exceed &# trillion or not beijing petrochina co the main oil and gas producer in china became the worlds biggest company in the course of a few hours of trading yesterday or did it petrochinas stunning debut on the shanghai stock exchange again demonstrated the force of chinas bull market which has more than doubled its benchmark stock index so far this year the company which also lists shares in hong kong and american depositary shares in new york saw its shanghai stock price more than double on its first day of trading after it raised &# billion in its first share sale in mainland china by some measures petrochina could now be valued at more than &# trillion which would make it by far the worlds largest company by market capitalization yet the soaring valuations put on petrochina and other chinese listed companies seem to say more about the problems and idiosyncrasies of chinas market than the performance of the companies themselves in fact it is difficult to determine the real value of chinese government controlled companies like petrochina or industrial &amp commercial bank of china ltd a lender that is the largest financial institution by some measures of market capitalization they have complicated corporate structures that keep most of their shares locked up in government hands with the few that are publicly traded spread across different markets the scarcity can drive up prices and the problem is compounded by chinas capital controls which can cause domestic prices to differ greatly from those on other markets petrochina for example sold a mere of its share capital to domestic investors in its shanghai initial public offering when those shares made their debut on the exchange yesterday their price rocketed to a close of yuan &# each from the ipo price of yuan applying that price to all of petrochinas shares outstanding would give the company a market cap of around &# trillion twice that of industry giant exxon mobil corp the company that at least before yesterday had the highest market value in the world at around &# billion but if you apply the price of petrochinas hong kong listed shares hong kong dollars us&# each as of yesterdays close to all petrochinas outstanding shares then the company is valued at closer to &# billion the valuation of petrochinas american depositary shares is close to the hong kong shares yet about of petrochinas shares are held by its state owned parent and dont trade on any exchange and it is hard to know what price they would fetch if all of them came to market "this does not mean that petrochina is bigger than exxon mobil " says zhou chunsheng a professor of finance at cheung kong graduate school of business in beijing "we cannot compare them based on stock prices because their stock prices are obtained from different markets " by law chinese investors cant invest significantly outside china and foreign investors are allowed to invest only tiny amounts in chinese stocks known as class a shares that means prices reflect high demand from local investors with few other investment options given that uncertainty another way of valuing the company would be to apply prices only to what investors can actually buy and sell the so called free float the total value of petrochinas publicly traded shares is about &# billion that is still large but nowhere close to exxon mobil it is far from clear that petrochinas business deserves to be valued higher than its u s rival petrochinas class a shares are trading around times this years forecast earnings compared with times earnings for its stock listed in hong kong that compares with an average of times forecast earnings for big oil companies listed internationally exxon mobil is also significantly bigger than petrochina by other measures petrochina produced billion barrels of oil equivalent last year compared with exxon mobils billion exxon mobil posted revenue of &# billion and net income of &# billion for last year petrochinas revenue was &# billion and net was &# billion of course the stock market values companies more on what they will produce in the future than what they have produced in the past and petrochina does seem to have strong growth prospects the company projects that its production will increase at to a year while most other major oil companies arent expected to grow at all that is because petrochina through acquisitions and better production and exploration techniques has been able to find enough new oil and gas to continually increase its reserves even as it pumps more gordon kwan head of china energy for clsa asia pacific markets is still bullish on the stock arguing petrochina will benefit more than its overseas rivals from continued high oil prices whatever its prospects petrochina is also benefiting from the overall enthusiasm of chinese investors whose unchecked eagerness to put money into stocks has drawn increasing official concern the seemingly unstoppable rise of chinas stock market has drawn worrisome comparisons to the bull markets in japan and taiwan in the s and to the u s technology stock bubble "its very difficult almost impossible to predict bubbles but what we can say is that based on historical examples this kind of miracle is never sustainable " says zuo xiaolei chief economist for china galaxy securities in beijing "whether foreign investors believe in this or not is up to them "
