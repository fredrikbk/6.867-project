business technology big computers big changes shift to multicore design creates challenges for users a shift in semiconductor design is creating new challenges for users of the fastest computer systems and opportunities for companies pushing new technologies the massive machines dubbed supercomputers and vital for jobs ranging from oil exploration to car design are most commonly constructed using chip technology that evolved from the personal computer industry as suppliers intel corp and advanced micro devices inc kept boosting the speed of each electronic brain users got answers faster recently however speed improvements of individual processing units have largely stalled in part because of concerns over excess power consumption so intel and amd have shifted to squeezing the core circuitry of multiple microprocessors on their chips which are known by the moniker x the "multicore" approach as those companies call it doesnt speed up all programs equally some national laboratories and other cutting edge computer users are pondering whether more radical technology approaches could bring greater benefits "there is a sense of big change ahead and nobody knows where it is going " said horst simon director of the national energy research scientific computing center an affiliate of lawrence berkeley national laboratory "suddenly we will see this huge variety and all kinds of experiments " one response sometimes called hybrid supercomputing augments x chips with specialized accelerator chips cray inc for example today is announcing new systems that include a model with amd microprocessors as well as two other kinds of chips to speed up specific chores international business machines corp which vies with hewlett packard co for sales leadership in the supercomputer segment sells machines based on variants of its power chip line as well as x based systems a supercomputer called roadrunner it is constructing for los alamos national laboratory may be the biggest bet to date on hybrid supercomputing combining amd chips with processors used in sony corp s playstation system the project is expected to cost &# million over three years laboratory officials expect roadrunner to be the worlds most powerful system when it is switched on in other hardware makers including h p sun microsystems inc and silicon graphics inc are testing accelerator chips of various kinds amd and nvidia corp which sell chips for handling graphics are pushing their use for high performance computing another approach is based on chips called fpgas for field programmable gate arrays that can be configured to do specific jobs at ultrahigh speed clearspeed technology plc a company with offices in england and silicon valley is attracting attention for another accelerator chip that has been selected to upgrade a supercomputer at the tokyo institute of technology the technologies arrive at a turbulent time supercomputers once built from a handful of hand crafted processing units evolved rapidly in the s as scientists began stringing systems from hundreds or thousands of x chips those systems called clusters continue to shape the industrys economics the market for high performance systems doubled between and rising an additional last year research firm idc estimates but sales of the very largest supercomputers dropped in to &# million earl joseph an idc analyst said organizations that once paid &# million or more for a supercomputer can get comparable results with clusters costing &# million or so at the same time company departments are buying &# clusters to help groups of engineers get results quickly for some computing jobs the more electronic brains the merrier at oak ridge national laboratory a big cray machine called jaguar is used for chores such as computing the effects of climate change it originally had amd chips with one microprocessor each and was later converted to dual core chips giving the system about processors in all the lab plans to boost capacity again by switching to a new four core amd chip dubbed barcelona thomas zacharia the labs computer chief is pondering the benefits of future chips with many more processors bringing large systems to millions of calculating engines "at some point you simply will not be able to throw the same software at the problem and expect it to run efficiently " he said other users are running into problems already robert singleterry jr a researcher at national aeronautics and space administrations langley research center studies the potential effects of space radiation on astronauts his software depends heavily on each chips clock speed a contributor to computing speed measured in gigahertz and has seen disappointing test results based on quad core chips with slower clock speeds than dual core chips "now when i buy the latest and greatest the performance goes down " mr singleterry said "this has never happened in the past " vincent scarafino a consultant who was previously manager of numerically intensive computing at ford motor co worries about the impact of slower clock speeds on software that simulates crashes during the car design process those programs typically divide a vehicle into sections and arent easily split up further to take advantage of more processor cores he said dave turek a vice president for what ibm calls its deep computing business argues that the benefits of multicore x chips have been overhyped ibm plans to exploit that technology but is also investing heavily in other microprocessors communications circuitry for hooking chips together more effectively and new tools to program complex supercomputers he said roadrunner is one outcome ibms proposal for the giant system was selected in large part because the combination of cell and amd processors could achieve high performance with low energy consumption and other operating costs said john hopson program director for advanced simulation and computing at los alamos using x chips alone would have required expanding its data center he said cray based in seattle sold specialized machines called vector processors before clusters came along a new system called xth scheduled to arrive in early includes circuit boards with vector or fpga chips in addition to amds opteron cray eventually hopes to incorporate all three kinds of circuitry on one piece of silicon as part of an effort it calls "adaptive" supercomputing said peter ungaro crays chief executive amd and intel are adding technology to help exploit accelerators alongside their chips their executives also argue that most users will find that their multicore chips will do just fine after all people who adopt accelerator chips may have to modify their software even more intensively than they do to exploit complex x systems "there are people who will take that risk " said nash palaniswamy a marketing manager associated with intels supercomputing technology "its not as pervasive as you might think "
