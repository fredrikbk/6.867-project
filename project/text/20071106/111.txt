the morning brief applying a goldman axiom to todays wall street online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here it was the screenwriter william goldman who described the single most important fact about the movie industry as "nobody knows anything " with the corollary that its executives "must get results now or theyre gone " while mr goldman may currently be on strike with his fellow writers those nearly year old conclusions seem to be ringing true today across a much broader spectrum of the economy take banking and the renewed calls for a breakup of citigroup the new interim regime at citigroup yesterday said the u s financial giant expects to report record losses of between &# billion to &# billion in the current quarter and that it could be cleaning up its credit market messes until the middle of next year but stung by repeated revisions this fall by citi and other major wall street players to their credit crunch bills and dreading what that says about the banks ability to manage risk "investors made it clear they think the largest bank in the u s by assets will need much longer than that " as the wall street journal says since august the stock markets have see sawed through bank assurances and reassurances as well as actions and words from the federal reserve alternately read as comforting or alarming "counting citigroups potential new losses banks and investment houses will have racked up combined losses of more than &# billion because of mortgage and debt market problems " the journal says fearing more bad news to come investors sold off stocks but as the journal notes "it could have been worse " the dow jones industrial average ended the day more than points below the record it hit oct but the daily drop was just points or earlier in the afternoon the index was off as much as points on rumors that goldman sachs group was about to announce its own write offs but a goldman denial brought a rebound still "citigroups new woes underscored for many investors that the fallout from credit market turmoil will likely continue for longer than many expected " the journal says during a speech yesterday about the subprime mortgage borrowing whose defaults are at the heart of the credit market problems fed gov randall kroszner pointed out that conditions for subprime borrowers could get worse before they improve thats partly due to the worsening prices in the housing market and also due to a condition in many subprime loans that eventually reset their rates at higher levels "the bulk of resets is yet to come on average in each quarter from now until the end of next year monthly payments for more than subprime mortgages are scheduled to undergo their first interest rate reset " he said "that number is up from roughly per quarter during the first half of delinquencies and foreclosures are therefore likely to continue to rise for a number of quarters " compounding the problem as a fed survey noted yesterday large banks have been tightening their credit standards on nearly all types of loans in the past three months as reuters reports those tighter standards mean loans are more expensive and harder to get and make it even harder for distressed borrowers to refinance their way out of the resets mentioned by mr kroszner to deal with all of its securitized subprime loans the packaged loans coiled into tradable bunches that once brought high returns citigroup appointed richard stuckey "who nine years ago helped unwind long term capital management lps bad bets " bloomberg reports but as several financial commentators have noted lately ltcms problems however large were contained at one misguided firm while the subprime mess reverberates across the global financial system and to what the journals dennis berman finds to be a shakespearean level "an audience would surely roar at the comeuppance delivered to wall streets impeccably credentialed mortgage makers a group of subprime knaves got the better of them leaving the ph d s choking on their own hubris " he writes "the subprime realm has thus become a vital portal onto wall street helping us understand just how upside down the place has become in this world risk management is applied retroactively ceo succession planning is too " unwinding iac and maybe time warner another veteran of mr goldmans industry and one judged there as a pretty smart cookie yesterday also announced what amounts to a major reversal of strategy just a few years after barry diller boasted of the far flung conglomerate of online marketplaces he was putting together in what became iac he said he was splitting it up as described by ad age "the company will spin four of its divisions into separate publicly traded companies ticketmaster lending tree home shopping business hsn and time share travel business interval international whats left including ask com match com citysearch and collegehumor among many other businesses will be part of an internet media and services company that will claim more than of its revenue from web advertising " the wall street journal sees the breakup as a way for mr diller to "jettison the underperforming parts of his empire such as his online lending business" and "resolve the tension between him and his longtime backer john malone " but mr malones liberty media may still be able of take control of any of the new pieces if he wants them the journal adds and yesterdays confirmation of the succession at time warner may allow the worlds biggest media company to move past the corporate untidiness and investor clamor plaguing the company since the aol purchase in ceo richard parsonss "five year tenure centered on the task of cleaning up after the debt and devastation wrought by hurricane aol " variety notes and wall street has long been calling "for a breakup of the distinctly nonsynergistic five division conglom as a means of boosting the companys share price " the trade publication says jeff bewkes who will take over jan could follow mr parsonss disposal of the music and book units with a sale of the aol division and time warners profitable but already semi autonomous cable unit an administration push for consumer protection the white house today plans to propose a broad expansion of federal drug and consumer protection watchdogs authority in response to the wave after wave of food toy and other product recalls that have concerned u s consumers but propelled by popular outrage and worry over the recalls congress is already "moving quickly to adopt even broader legislation that is strongly opposed by manufacturers and the administration " the new york times notes the administrations "initiative aims to steer the nation toward a prevention based regulatory system that targets the riskiest products" and "calls for giving more authority to agencies that regulate food and consumer goods improving data gathering on imports and increasing cooperation between agencies and with u s trading partners " the wall street journal reports but the journal adds that much of the initiatives "success depends on congressional action and some lawmakers and outside experts already contend they are inadequate " meanwhile the washington post reports that "top officials at the consumer product safety commission repeatedly took costly trips at industry expense after internal reviews that ethics experts say were weak and superficial including one instance in which the agencys ethics official traveled with the commission chairman as a guest of a regulated industry " a widening u s nuclear target list the list of nations targeted by u s nuclear weapons has broadened from washingtons traditional cold war adversaries "to smaller nations with nuclear ambitions " scientific american reports while the warheads on ballistic missiles in silos carried on submarines and stowed aboard u s aircraft were once aimed only at the u s s r and then russia and china a document obtained by the federation of american scientists "reveals that in recent years the u s target list has expanded to include so called regional proliferators smaller states seeking to acquire such weapons of mass destruction " the magazine says fas was founded by creators of the first u s atomic bomb to monitor following generations of weapons included in the document are pictures of russian made scud ballistic missiles which are used by five nations listed by the bush administration in a december nuclear postures review iran iraq libya north korea and syria "this is the first formal confirmation at that high level that those countries entered mainstream strategic nuclear war planning " hans kristensen director of the nuclear information project at fas tells the magazine iraq was probably dropped after the invasion and libya was likely removed from the list after muammar gadhafi formally gave up his wmd ambitions mr kristensen says fas obtained the information from a u s strategic command briefing on changes to the war plan that would take effect in among the changed aimed at including such regional states were a "series of redacted options" and a "scenario driven approach" as well as "attack structure changed to increase execution flexibility " a spokesman for u s strategic command declined to comment the magazine says also of note new york times president bush during a meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan pledged to increase intelligence cooperation with turkey in its fight against kurdish rebels hoping to head off any significant turkish military operation in iraq and while mr bush declined to say how the u s would respond if turkish forces entered northern iraq he promised that the american and turkish militaries allies in nato would work together to fight the kurdistan workers party or pkk which he called "an enemy of turkey a free iraq and the united states of america " financial times the european commission today plans to recommend that turkey be blocked from joining the european union unless it revises a much criticized article of its penal code that makes it a crime to insult turkish national identity under the proposal the eu would refuse to open accession talks with turkey on the crucial policy area covering the judiciary and human rights until ankara changed article of its penal code which nationalist prosecutors have used as a weapon against turkish authors scholars and journalists associated press the
