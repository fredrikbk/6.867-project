ecb after hard birth comes of age in crisis europe bank gets points for first response role war games in frankfurt frankfurt at p m on thursday aug just past its ninth birthday the european central bank grew up the summers mounting financial crisis sparked by rising defaults on u s subprime mortgages had fully crossed the atlantic that morning european banks feared their counterparts were exposed to risky investments linked to these mortgages and became unusually reluctant to lend to each other financial institutions were paralyzed tasked with stopping such a meltdown was the european central bank which sets monetary policy for countries from ireland to greece the institution has been dogged since inception by criticisms that it valued consensus over decisiveness early on it had been called slow footed disorganized and prone to miscommunicating its intentions but that day the ecb swooped to the rescue the bank offered unlimited overnight loans at its policy rate of by days end it had lent &lt euro&gt billion about &# billion which was more than it had put into money markets the day after sept the first response by a major central bank to the summers crisis it stunned markets for its size it also surprised counterparts at the u s federal reserve who followed the ecbs injection with a smaller &# billion one of their own later that day observers credit the ecb and its head jean claude trichet with making a trenchant decision that calmed markets the move shored up confidence in the banks ability to keep markets functioning for the u s dollars most significant rival with its boosted credibility the ecb could enhance the euros standing in world markets continued confidence in the currency could ultimately come at the expense of the dollar the current favorite of big world investors thanks in part to the size liquidity and stability of u s markets "there were always worries that the ecb would be a stereotypical european institution slow to decide and going off in multiple directions at once " says adam posen of the peterson institute for international economics a washington think tank "mr trichet has put that to rest in this situation " the ecb now faces fresh challenges global stock markets are swooning as the credit market fallout deepens with big write downs and ceo departures at citigroup inc and merrill lynch &amp co spurring fears that other banks could post more big losses european bank shares fell yesterday helping to bring down major indexes and as in the u s and united kingdom the gap between the rates euro zone institutions charge each other for longer term loans and the ecbs target rate remains unusually wide suggesting markets remain tense this complicates the picture for ecb policy makers who meet thursday prior to the summers credit market unrest robust euro zone growth had the bank set for at least one more interest rate rise this year now policy makers are caught between worries that inflation pressures are building while the economy has yet to feel the full effect of credit market turmoil bank sector write offs and the euros surge in contrast to the fed which has cut rates by of a percentage point since september the ecb is likely to keep its key rate on hold thursday investors see a protracted pause but some policy makers have said the rate still could rise a portrait of the ecbs august response to the financial crisis emerges from documents public statements and people familiar with the banks workings the ecb had been primed for a liquidity lockup running pentagon style war games with such scenarios as early as april its president long time french central banker mr trichet had warned loudly that investors were underestimating the danger of risky holdings after market tremors earlier in the summer ecb staffers who monitor markets were on high alert some observers criticized the ecb for inciting panic with its intervention saying the scope of its response suggested the bank was bracing for a catastrophe a few still say the ecb overreacted arguing that the offer of unlimited funds at the ecbs target rate the central bank equivalent of a fire sale rewarded the type of risky investments that spurred the subprime debacle to start with the ecb still has vulnerabilities of course as separate events over the past three months have demonstrated a communication gaffe by the bank left financial markets confused for days in mid august about whether the ecb intended to raise rates a fragmented system of bank supervision left it without detailed information about bank balance sheets at a moment of crisis and it faces persistent sniping from politicians as it refuses to restrain a rise in the euro on foreign exchange markets that is provoking yelps from some exporters the ecb was established on june critics derided the institution as unworkable from the start to shore up credibility the ecb modeled itself after germanys inflation phobic bundesbank like the u s federal reserve the ecb sets a target for interest rates on overnight loans between banks but unlike the fed whose dual mandate makes it attentive to both inflation and growth the ecbs prime focus is on keeping prices stable it aims to keep inflation at just under in the countries that now share the euro currency the ecbs rate setting body includes the six members of its executive board who oversee the banks day to day operations plus the heads of the euro zones national central banks rather than voting on interest rate decisions and publishing the minutes of their meetings as fed officials do the ecbs governing council members make decisions by consensus the bank explains its thinking in a news conference after each decision the euro debuted with fanfare and an initial value of &# in although the ecbs primary focus is inflation not the exchange rate a falling currency can be read as a market vote of no confidence in an economy and its managers over the next months amid scattershot communication from ecb policy makers the euro deteriorated to cents the banks now deceased first president wim duisenberg initially reinforced the perception of disorganization although he had been an accomplished former dutch central bank head the lanky policy maker with a mop of white hair became known at the ecb for a colloquial candor uncommon in central banking circles that repeatedly steered markets the wrong way british tabloids dubbed him "dim wim " since late the ecbs public face has been mr trichet a poetry buff who studied economics and mining engineering the year old mr trichet is long on practical experience from the french treasury to the world bank he was president of the paris club of creditor nations from to an era in which latin american african and russian debts were restructured and head of the french central bank for a decade by the ecb was preparing for potential market chaos that april at its story glass and metal headquarters in frankfurt participants spent two and half days in exercises aimed at honing their response to a future crisis about a year later some people took part in a conference from their home countries to play out shocks to the financial system in teleconference calls over half a week the group responded to various scenarios including a prescient case in which banks sought emergency loans but policy makers didnt know whether the banks were solvent top policy makers were barraged by rumors sometimes contradictory and by actors playing inquisitive journalists the real thing arrived this summer for months u s homeowners with subprime mortgages high interest loans extended to high risk borrowers had been defaulting in rising numbers investors who had bought opaque securities backed by these mortgages ran into trouble as the securities became difficult to value and thus potentially hard to trade by late july there were mounting clues that continental european banks were vulnerable on july the little known german ikb deutsche industriebank ag revealed it had major exposure to the u s subprime mortgage market prompting an emergency weekend billion euro bailout organized by germanys financial regulator with contributions from major german banks markets lurched into early august even as european business slowed for vacation the ecbs team of market monitors usually about people whittled to around a dozen because of vacations was on alert working on the second floor of the banks high rise the team watches everything from global stock exchange movements to copper prices some five members of the team monitor money market rates the interest banks charge each other for loans in the afternoon of tuesday aug rates on loans ranging from overnight to a year started rising this was puzzling just that morning the ecb had conducted its regular weekly refinancing operations that should have provided banks with enough cash to last them the week and by extension kept the rates between banks relatively flat in phone calls with the market monitors commercial bank treasurers confirmed their banks were antsy wednesday brought more jitters though the ecb had set its target rate at overnight money market rates continued rising above that investors were fleeing to havens such as two year german government bonds data showed commercial banks reserves with the central bank had fallen another sign that banks might be hoarding cash by wednesday evening staffers had suggested that the six member executive board consider taking the unusual step of injecting cash to restore calm by then mr trichet and lucas papademos the ecbs vice president were in touch with u s fed governors the ecb prefers to stage major interventions before noon when commercial bank treasurers are sure to be at their desks the bank decided to wait until the morning and act if markets were still tense they were at a m on thursday aug major french bank bnp paribas announced it was suspending withdrawals from three investment funds because it couldnt value them amid the subprime crisis rumors flew that other banks were in trouble "ive never experienced anything like it " says christoph rieger interest rate strategist at dresdner kleinwort in frankfurt the fear "ground the market to a halt " interest rates on overnight loans between european banks soared typically market monitors snap to attention if the overnight rate moves a few hundredths of a point away from the banks policy rate now rates hit far above the ecbs target signaling extraordinary tension convening at a m the ecb liquidity group decided to recommend intervening that morning and taking the unprecedented step of pre announcing that the bank would honor every bid it received to send a clear signal that the bank was covering the markets back the committee settled on offering funds at the banks policy rate rather than a variable rate or a higher penalty rate taken together the moves would show the ecb just how high the demand for cash was because banks in principle would bid for exactly what they felt they needed the ecb could use the information to judge future injections more accurately the six executive board members approved the move within minutes at a m the bank told markets it stood "ready to act " at p m it flashed its decision on trading screens across the euro zone the notice said the ecb would accept bids for funds until p m response was immediate at p m the ecb publicized the total take of billion euros the overnight rate fell back down to around in subsequent days and weeks the ecb continued to add funds to money markets to keep the market liquid but challenges continued to arise in part because the ecb doesnt have detailed insight into the euro zones banks while the fed effectively supervises most of the biggest u s banks and has access to detailed information on these banks books the ecb cedes banking supervision to each member country days after its aug fund injection the central bank sent commercial bank supervisors across the euro zone a questionnaire asking about their subprime exposure the basic question were banks basically sound and just having a problem with short term liquidity or were some of them in deeper trouble some responses were returned quickly and fully others came back late or without sufficient numbers in the end the ecb learned enough to be confident that banks were sound but some people in and out of the ecb are unsure that the bank would get the information it needs in a bigger crisis in the following weeks another old ecb problem resurfaced communicating intentions clearly to the market mr trichet had been getting high marks for predictability but that changed on aug on the back of the ecbs continuing cash injections overnight lending rates had fallen back to around the target but three month interbank rates still hovered around a sign that banks were reluctant to lend to each other for longer periods at p m that day the ecb released a surprise statement saying it would hold an auction the following day accepting bids for billion euros in extra three month funds markets greeted the announcement with relief but the statements last sentence caused confusion "the position of the governing council of the ecb on its monetary policy stance was expressed by its president on august " it read that was a reference to a briefing held by mr trichet weeks earlier at which he indicated that the bank at the time was inclined to raise short term rates at its next meeting on sept in the intervening turmoil however markets had steadily revised down expectations of an ecb interest rate rise the late august statement seemed to put a hike back in play "to say markets didnt know how to interpret it is putting it mildly " says dresdner kleinworts mr rieger the communication problem was compounded two days later on aug anonymous sources at several national central banks leaked word to reuters that markets had misinterpreted the sentence about the ecbs monetary policy intentions ecb policy makers were not set on raising rates speaking in budapest a few days later mr trichet intervened to clarify the message essentially telling markets that policy makers hadnt decided whether to move rates on sept the bank kept its policy rate unchanged at observers say that while the bank proved its chops with its early august moves it still has room to master the subtle art of communicating its intent "its as important as moving rates well " says luigi buttiglione a former bank of italy economist now with new york based investment fund fortress investment group in london who praised the august intervention "you not only have to do the right thing but you have to explain why this is the right thing if youre not able to do that then markets can take a different direction and you can achieve the opposite result "
