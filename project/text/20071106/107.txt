afghans she sees a lack of support for international forces "people in afghanistan dont have the impression international forces will stay and if they leave people could be treated very badly" by the taliban ms dormandy said battles in southern afghanistan between taliban fighters and u s led coalition forces have resulted in some or more taliban deaths since early september a sign that u s or
