google bidding for phone ads lures partners google inc is trying to shake up the wireless industry by helping to create cheaper phones that can access advanced internet services and carry its lucrative advertising now that the internet giant has cemented an alliance with partners the question is whether they will follow through on its attempt to change the rules of the game after months of anticipation a group including google and a number of mobile handset makers cellular carriers and other technology companies plans to make new software available free of charge to power mobile phones that will start hitting the market in the second half of the move paves the way for mass market cellphones that will bring consumers experience on the mobile web closer to that of personal computers and google is betting that its ad revenue will surge as a result yesterdays announcement could prove a short term disappointment for consumers who were eager for more details and photos of what some have termed the "google phone" or the "gphone " google didnt announce the creation of any single google powered device or show what one might look like still the move shows googles latest tack for breaking down barriers to expanding its advertising and services businesses it also highlights googles belief that its large ad business can benefit if it broadens web usage in this case on mobile phones even if "android " as the platform is called falls short it highlights an important shift carriers and handset makers are seriously considering changes to the economics of how phones are sold to consumers as well as offering more open access to the web and third party applications the android platform announced yesterday by the google led open handset alliance includes several layers of software for phones among them an operating system a user interface and applications such as advanced web browsing software among the handset makers that have signed on to the initiative are taiwans htc corp samsung electronics co and motorola inc operator partners include deutsche telekom ags t mobile sprint nextel corp and japans ntt docomo inc android is a bid to change how the wireless industry operates carriers traditionally have decided what applications most consumers see on their cellphones setting rules and negotiating fees for software developers to gain access google has struggled at times in recent years to get its products including google maps gmail email and its search engine onto mobile phones in a way thats easy for people to use with android software makers can theoretically write applications that run on any users phone and consumers can freely browse the web but until new handsets based on android come to market it wont be clear how far operators have gone to satisfy googles desire for open mobile software some carriers have said they still want to make sure android doesnt allow sensitive user information to fall into the hands of rogue third party developers leading to invasions of privacy and security risks those issues partly explain why large u s operators such as at&amp t inc and verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc have yet to sign on to googles initiative verizon wireless is still weighing whether to join a person familiar with the companys thinking said at&amp t in part because it exclusively carries apple inc s iphone in the u s is restricted from partnering with google people familiar with the matter say one issue for the carriers is googles interest in bidding for wireless spectrum in a coming auction run by the federal communications commission people familiar with the matter say if google which has said it will likely bid buys spectrum and partners with another company to build a new mobile network it would become a direct competitor to the operators the google software initiative arrives in a field already crowded with cellphone software platforms including ones from microsoft corp and palm inc companies that arent part of googles alliance question whether android represents a major breakthrough nokia corp the worlds largest handset manufacturer with more than one billion current users said it has already embraced an open approach with its high end cellphones which use the symbian operating system and have a large community of application developers "its great to see others following the trail weve been blazing " said bill plummer a top nokia executive in north america tech consortia for decades have been notorious for failing to live up to their promise google director of mobile platforms andy rubin acknowledged the troubled history of previous consortia but said that android was different because "were actually releasing in one week this software " google executives were coy about any eventual plans for google branded phones "if you were to build a gphone you could build it out of this platform " chief executive eric schmidt told journalists during a conference call but he said he hoped there would be thousands of mobile phones based on the android platform google has used prototypes of android powered phones internally including one code named "dream" and says that the software will run on most phone designs including touchscreen devices or phones with slide out keypads the google led alliance plans to release the android platform for free use by carriers and handset makers it plans to provide software developers with an early version next week the prospect of richer cellphone features and lower cost phones has enticed several carriers to sign on t mobile usa which expects to have a google powered phone in the market by the second half of wants to develop new social networking applications initially on its own but ultimately with the help of independent developers cole brodman chief development officer of t mobile says android is a breakthrough because it gives software developers access to information they didnt have before including a users location communications history contact list and "presence " a signal of whether someones phone is on or off sprint hasnt agreed to carry a google powered phone yet but signed on to the android alliance while it continues talks john garcia the carriers senior vice president of product development said using android in phones would make it easier to get a variety of mobile applications to consumers mr garcia said mobile game makers routinely have to test their applications on an array of sprint phones writing specific programming code for each one that could become a thing of the past if an open platform becomes widespread carriers will be able to customize the "open source" android software as they see fit they can include a package of googles home grown mobile applications such as its search engine and email or just use the open android platform the details would be decided in conjunction with google and the handset partner google wont make money on android itself but the company believes it will create new opportunities for google to sell ads on mobile phones something executives have characterized as the companys biggest business opportunity google is betting that easier access to the internet from mobile phones will lead people to use its services more as has been the case with web access on the personal computer googles mr rubin said ads will appear on the phones as they normally do when a user surfs the web the company may also sell ads for some developers of applications that run on the phones the name of the new platform stems from googles purchase of android inc a silicon valley startup co founded by mr rubin google said it would likely share revenue from ads with wireless carriers the carriers then could reduce the cost of handsets or wireless fees for consumers google also could make money in other ways possibly by getting a share of monthly revenue from carriers or selling a rate plan for a package of applications google is counting on the many developers who build applications for pcs and the web to start making products for the phone google said the android platform will make it easy for developers to write applications that meld different data sources such as a service that shows users where their friends are at any given moment on a map for u s consumers android could speed the arrival of advanced applications already available abroad such as multiplayer gaming googles strategy of cooperating with multiple handset maker and operator partners to develop perhaps thousands of different phone models differs starkly from that of apple which developed a single iconic mobile device the iphone that consumers now associate with its brand
