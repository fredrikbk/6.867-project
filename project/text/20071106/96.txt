small business link the conversation continues excerpts from wsj com smallbusinesslinks forum succession planning readers and experts talk the oct small business link looked at ways small companies had planned for a change in management at the top we asked tim berry founder and president of palo alto software inc in eugene ore and andrea fetterman director of corporate image consulting at city apparel an offshoot of uniform and dry cleaning business kramer enterprises inc in findlay ohio to be guest moderators on a reader forum on wsj com about succession planning mr berry passed the baton at his software company to his daughter this year ms fetterman is working with her father who is handing the reins of the family business to her and her brother below are edited excerpts mr berry what surprised me most about my transition was that it was about me being ready to give up command more than about the new team being ready to take control i had thought succession was about grooming the next generation the hardest part was actually giving up command in practice not just in name only id been in charge for years my instinct is to do speak decide and manage when people came to me looking for solutions i had to learn to say "thats not my job " ms fetterman the most challenging part of a transition can be just starting the process most people have a fear that it will be cumbersome and wait until it is too late start with open communication family members can be disappointed when expectations arent met often its because the issues werent open for discussion everyone expected the succession would just magically transpire family members may need to talk about the process on a continuing basis so they can tweak things as they arise before the actual transition occurs i am a third generation business owner when i knew that i was here to stay i was in my mid s i voiced my intention and began the process with my father this has strengthened his confidence of growing our company together wsjs simona covel ive received several notes from readers lamenting the lack of resources for succession planning for small companies when researching this package i was surprised when business owners said they hadnt found many books or tools to help them as they planned to move on is there just too little information out there on how to plan for succession ms fetterman most books are written from a human resources family planning or legal perspective none that ive read seems to capture the essence of the issue at hand building the value of the organization and helping owners meet its changing and growing challenges year after year that said "six disciplines for excellence building small businesses that learn lead and last" by gary harpst had a positive impact on our company as we were in transition going beyond succession planning the book shows you how to "learn how to learn " so that a business can be handed off to the next successor while increasing value also check out local resources such as the family business centers at nearby colleges or universities i joined an affinity group for family business issues that meets about every six weeks we share stories problem solving and research on hot topics wsj reader i am the second generation at a family bank we have begun discussions on when my father will fully retire but i feel there is no real plan he does not actively participate much in the day to day operations but seems to question my decisions he talks to me as if i were instead of as his executive vice president i think this has to do with him being gone a lot and not wanting to lose control have any of you faced these same issues and do you have any advice mr berry i recognize some of these signs ive been in the same position as your father everybody agrees in theory about changing the roles eventually but its really hard to point that general idea to specifics i recommend you start working with a family business expert and work on the easy stuff first like developing a code of conduct and trying to better define what part of the business process is really yours your goal is to move things from the general to the specific which will help your father move from not wanting to think about change to wanting to think about change you cant do that yourself because its something he has to deal with youll want to work toward creating the atmosphere that makes it easier to happen
