why energy efficiencies prove elusive in china beijing chinas ability to avoid economic damage from &# a barrel oil depends partly on making big gains in energy efficiency which the nation has so far shown little sign of achieving though the government raised retail prices for gasoline diesel and jet fuel nearly at the start of this month its reluctance to liberalize energy prices is compounding problems such as local protectionism "i am skeptical that &# oil will have much of an impact on average energy efficiency in the country so long as gasoline and diesel prices remain controlled " said trevor houser an energy specialist at china strategic advisory based in new york china wants to build its economy at a pace that uses less fuel by such an increase in energy efficiency would help keep the countrys oil import bill down and tame demand growth oil accounts for of chinas energy needs the international energy agency forecasts that the countrys oil demand will reach million barrels a day this year nearly half of chinas crude oil consumption is met by imports which are rising at a year despite pledges to invest millions of dollars and introduce a raft of policies aimed at driving inefficient enterprises out of business china has yet to hit any of its annual goals for energy savings targeting a reduction in energy use per unit of gross domestic product last year it recorded a cut of the first annual decline since in the first half of this year energy use fell from a year earlier xie zhenhua the energy efficiency czar at the national development and reform commission said in june that this is a "make or break" year for the governments goals beijing appeared relaxed about high oil prices until fuel shortages became widespread late last month and brought violence in places zhu zhixin a vice chairman of the commission which is chinas economic planning agency said in mid october that costly crude might "encourage enterprises that use a large amount of oil to adopt energy saving measures " the commission estimates chinas energy efficiency is about below that of developed countries because of obsolete technology but many experts say beijings policy priorities are a bigger obstacle worries about social unrest and inflation led beijing to put the brakes on pricing overhauls at tremendous cost to state refiners petrochina co and china petroleum &amp chemical corp known as sinopec "market prices are a very important and key issue because they send out the right signal to the customer to save energy " said yang fuqiang vice president of the energy foundation in beijing prices of benchmark west texas intermediate crude are more than &# a barrel higher than when china previously raised gasoline diesel and jet fuel prices in may according to a bear stearns note the importance of using prices to tame oil demand is magnified by chinas lack of room to make efficiency gains elsewhere the most inefficient portions of the industrial sector which accounts for more than of chinas energy consumption use coal rather than oil officials have touted natural gas as an alternative to oil or coal but china is grappling with shortages that are unlikely to ease before major pipelines start flowing in and more terminals for liquefied natural gas become operational china has tried a carrot and stick approach to reducing energy intensity vowing to strengthen a decade old energy conservation law that analysts say lacks teeth but beijing has often run into local opposition when trying to implement its directives that has certainly been the case with or so small refineries or "teapots " which are scattered across chinas provinces and provide employment for local communities and valuable tax revenues some of these plants have capacities as small as barrels a day a tenth that of a large refinery the teapots kept runs to a minimum and sinopec and petrochina werent able to take up the slack leading to the shortages that prompted the government to raise retail prices
