charles prince citigroup inc officials said it will take the bank until the middle of next year to clean up its problems caused by credit market turmoil investors made it clear they think the largest bank in the u s by assets will need much longer than that as it became clearer how the banks problems have deepened in recent weeks they sent citigroups stock down yesterday despite pledges by officials that the bank would maintain its dividend and remain a "vibrant" institution the bank sunday night said it expected it may have to record losses of between &# billion to &# billion in the current quarter likely wiping out net profit for this period the citigroup shares yesterday reached their lowest level since april falling &# to &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange since the debt market turmoil erupted in august citigroups market value has dropped nearly &# billion and since the start of the year the shares are down citigroups new woes underscored for many investors that the fallout from credit market turmoil will likely continue for longer than many expected counting citigroups potential new losses banks and investment houses will have racked up combined losses of more than &# billion because of mortgage and debt market problems many worry that citigroups predicament is a signal that more losses could be in store for other financial players that helped spark a fall yesterday to in the dow jones wilshire u s banks index its lowest close since october citigroup has been weighed down for months by investors concerns about its leadership financial flexibility and corporate strategy besides its exposure to subprime mortgages citigroup is also facing problems with off balance sheet vehicles that are now the focus of a possibly &# billion industry rescue attempt citigroups mounting woes led to several reversals in the past week among wall street analysts who had been optimistic about the bank keeping up with rivals morgan stanleys betsy graseck citing concerns about the firms risk management procedures yesterday told clients to "sell into any rally" in citigroup stock chief financial officer gary crittenden on a conference call with analysts yesterday acknowledged that the &# billion to &# billion in losses flagged by the bank are an estimate of write downs that may be needed the bank "cant give any assurance" that the loss wont grow as the quarter progresses he added analysts are bracing for the worst "we wouldnt be surprised if additional write downs were forthcoming " goldman sachs analyst william tanona wrote in a note to investors investors were particularly unnerved by the fact that citigroup announced the possibility of additional write downs just weeks after it said third quarter losses due to the banks subprime exposure would be &# billion the new vastly bigger losses called into question the banks ability to measure its holdings and the information it was providing to markets mr crittenden said potential fourth quarter losses were sparked by downgrades of mortgage backed securities in october these sparked losses in indexes that track even highly rated mortgage backed securities as a result citigroup was forced to change some of the assumptions backing models it uses to value collateralized debt obligations or cdos and mark down their value citigroup sunday disclosed that it had &# billion in subprime exposure of which about &# billion is in the form of securities known as cdos that are linked to risky mortgages but that came as a surprise even to some analysts who cover the company closely cdos pool different securities often including bonds backed by mortgages and sell slices that carry different risk and payout levels citigroup said the majority of its cdo holdings were considered the safest slices but the downgrades had affected even these securities mike mayo an analyst at deutsche bank who rates citigroups stock a "sell " questioned why investors werent given information about the banks cdo holdings earlier and whether citigroups board was aware of their potential for losses he asked on the citigroup conference call yesterday what the board did if it knew and why it didnt disclose the potential problems in response robert rubin who was appointed citigroup chairman on sunday in the wake of mr princes departure said that "ever since the board became aware of the problem the board has been engaged" in working to resolve it some analysts questioned whether citigroup could restore its capital base given the potential for further write downs citigroups tier ratio a key measure of a banks capital cushion fell to at the end of the third quarter from a year earlier in addition investors are worried that this ratio could deteriorate further if citigroup is forced to take off balance sheet assets onto its books that could happen anyway if the feared losses materialize write downs that result in an after tax loss of &# billion could cause citigroups tier ratio to fall to says pri de silva an analyst at creditsights citigroups ratio is still well above a threshold considered by the federal reserve to assure that institutions are well capitalized but it is below an average tier ratio seen at the end of the third quarter citigroups mr crittenden stressed that despite possible write downs such losses dont impede cash flow the bank will have sufficient liquidity to pay its dividend currently at cents a share a quarter and boost capital levels by june he said
