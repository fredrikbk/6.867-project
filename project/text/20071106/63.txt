is there a heart attack in your future genetic tests promise to map your personal health risks but some question usefulness what are the chances that you will get heart disease or alzheimers or that youll get fat new genetic tests will soon be available to offer people answers to these questions and more assessing their risk for a range of conditions based on a sample of saliva its one of the promises of the genetics revolution putting personalized medical information directly into the hands of individuals so they can make informed choices about their health yet despite the potential there are several reasons people might not yet embrace such tests including skepticism about their scientific soundness steep prices and insurance and privacy issues indeed many genetic experts believe predictive gene based tests arent ready for wide use besides questions about accuracy there is also the issue of how useful the answers will be theres no evidence many physicians say that people will act on such information to lead healthier lives little is known about the interplay of genetic and nongenetic factors such as diet exercise smoking and pollution that also affect a persons risk for disease and few doctors are well versed in how to interpret genetic tests or what to tell patients based on the results one such test is set to be announced today by navigenics inc of redwood shores calif called health compass the test will be available starting early next year and will be offered directly to consumers via the internet circumventing the traditional doctor patient relationship the company believes people will want to take the &# test when theyre healthy and then make lifestyle and other changes to avoid or delay disease results which will be posted on a web site that customers access with a password will tell consumers their risk for more than conditions including diabetes obesity prostate cancer and glaucoma consumers would learn how their risk compares with the general populations and what strategies they can follow to possibly reduce their chances of developing it "when youre reading your genetic risk and you realize that you might get this disease thats when its real and relevant " says mari baker chief executive of the san francisco based start up for consumers the test will say "what i might get and what i might start doing today so i dont get it in the future " another company andme inc of mountain view calif is working on a similar direct to consumer test that outsiders say will provide gene based ancestry and health related information the company isnt providing details until it is ready to launch the product possibly by the end of the year these tests are part of a larger rush to capitalize on the growing body of genetic information that has been emerging since scientists finished mapping the human genome silicon valley venture capital firms kleiner perkins caufield &amp byers and sequoia capital are among navigenics backer while biotech giant genentech inc and google inc are among those financing andme some genetic tests are already on the market but the vast majority focus on single genes associated with generally rare conditions some help assess the risk that a child will be born with a birth defect myriad genetics inc markets tests for mutations known as brca and brca that are linked to a very high risk of breast and ovarian cancers more recently decode genetics inc of iceland launched two tests based on genetic variants that increase risk for heart attacks and a common heart beat disorder called atrial fibrillation like decode navigenics test focuses not on rare single gene diseases but on widely prevalent illness that have multiple genetic causes and that account for the biggest portion by far of human disease but many genetics experts note there arent any studies that connect use of such tests to improved health one concern is that results might encourage consumers to seek unnecessary and expensive follow up tests to look for problems that arent there or despair that they cant do anything about their genetic fate because the catalog of genetic variants linked to disease isnt complete consumers could also receive a falsely reassuring clean bill of health "progress in this field is extremely encouraging but its premature for this kind of test to be offered " says david valle director of the mckusick nathans institute of genetic medicine at johns hopkins school of medicine in baltimore "for the most part it is too early for the tests to have any meaningful impact on the current practice of medicine " behind the navigenics test is an explosion in the discovery of gene variants known as snps or single nucleotide polymorphisms tiny alterations in the alphabet of our dna that can result in differences in how people are predisposed to or protected from disease but scientists believe multiple snps figure in predisposing people to most common illnesses typically the role a single mutation plays is modest involving interaction with other snps and a persons living habits "we dont have an understanding of how these things work yet " says kathy hudson director of the genetics and public policy center at johns hopkins university navigenics officials and their advisers acknowledge that much remains to be learned about snps and disease risk but they say that links between certain variants and about diseases are now sufficiently validated in multiple studies to provide consumers with useful information "the genie is out of the bottle " says john doerr partner at kleiner perkins one of navigenics principal investors advances in genetic research and the internets role in empowering people to learn about their health are poised to change the health care landscape he says the plan is for consumers to order a test kit online then send a saliva sample to affymetrix inc the california based developer of a gene chip that can sort through a million snps at once affymetrix will forward findings to navigenics which will do further analysis and post the results on a secure web site the &# fee for the test will also cover consultations with a genetic counselor and a year of updates as more snps and diseases are validated and added to the test annual subscriptions for additional updates will be available for about &# david agus a cancer researcher at cedars sinai medical center in los angeles who is a co founder of the company says he took the test and found he had a risk of having a heart attack in his lifetime compared with about in the general population his kids he says now help him stay away from french fries "im a believer in empowerment " he says one possible impediment to consumer interest is cost health insurers arent likely to cover the tests until studies prove their value and link them to improved health that means for the near term at least that relatively affluent consumers or early adopters of new technology are likely to be the main customers another concern is confidentiality legislation aimed at making it illegal to discriminate against patients based on genetic information is pending in congress but many people are worried that health insurance and even job opportunities could be jeopardized if evidence of genetic risk of disease became part of their medical record indeed that is one reason navigenics decided to go exclusively to consumers rather than include physicians in the initial rollout of the test says dietrich stephan co founder and chief scientific officer of the company taking orders and delivering results directly to customers through a secure internet site is intended to assure that only consumers decide whether and to whom to disclose the information still "we fully anticipate that well have to plug into the traditional health care system " dr stephan says the company plans to develop education materials for doctors and it is negotiating partnerships with such academic centers as the cleveland clinic mayo clinic and scripps health to provide clinical support for the tests and conduct research to determine their benefits
