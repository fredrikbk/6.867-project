to getting things done " mr rubin and other citigroup executives indicated that another reason for the choice was that sir wins age would rule him out as a candidate himself avoiding the risk of disruption that could result from one internal candidate being placed above others mike mayo a bank analyst at deutsche bank ag said many investors were surprised by the choice "in talking to a lot of people today they said who is he " mr mayo said "thats the repeated phrase where did he come from how did he emerge almost from obscurity as the interim ceo " while mr rubin conceded that sir win isnt

fantastic job at schroders in terms of repositioning it shedding excess assets " said david reid scott who runs the hawkpoint boutique advisory firm in london and has known sir win since the mid s
