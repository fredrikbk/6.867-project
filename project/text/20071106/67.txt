interest rates defy feds recent cuts credit market crunch keeps yields relatively high on savings while home equity and some other loans remain pricey interest rate cuts by the federal reserve are normally bad news for savers and good news for borrowers but that scenario hasnt been playing out fully since the central bank began cutting rates in september the fed has trimmed a total of three quarters of a percentage point from short term rates in recent weeks however rates on such popular savings products as money market funds savings accounts and certificates of deposit havent fallen anywhere near that much and some have even held steady meanwhile rates on certain types of borrowings including home equity loans and auto loans remain stubbornly high behind the discrepancies is continuing tightness in credit markets where many banks raise much of their capital instead banks remain especially eager to attract consumers deposits and are willing to pay savers handsomely to keep the money coming in the door at the same time banks higher cost of raising capital is keeping many of them from lowering rates on some kinds of loans "even though the fed has eased three quarters of a percentage point since september the market has only gotten between and of that easing " says james bianco president of bianco research llc a market research firm in chicago "if you look at it from a savers and borrowers side it shows you that the market is still not functioning properly " thats fine with savers average yields on money market mutual funds for example whose yields typically move in line with changes in the fed funds rate are hovering at compared with in mid september roughly half the amount theyd be expected to drop says peter crane of crane data llc declines in cd rates also are relatively modest one year cds currently average down from in mid july and five year cds are at down from according to greg mcbride a senior financial analyst at bankrate com by contrast he says comparable treasurys have dropped a full percentage point over the same period "normally cd yields would drop like a stone and now theyve been dropping like a feather " he says to be sure banks may still trim yields on deposits in the wake of this past wednesdays fed cut in the federal funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks the move aimed at bolstering the economy amid plunging home construction and eroding real estate values pushed the fed rate down a quarter point to however market experts expect consumers will continue to enjoy favorable yields on many savings products in the to range with the highest yields on savings products still above "yields are going to drop a little bit but wont drop as much as we would expect in normal circumstances " mr mcbride says for borrowers some lending rates have declined in line with the fed cuts and consumers with home equity lines of credit and variable rate credit cards should have already seen some rate relief thats because those products are usually tied to banks prime rate which typically moves in lockstep with the fed funds rate average rates on home equity lines of credit and variable rate credit cards have dropped to and respectively from and in early september according to bankrate com but other loan rates havent fallen as quickly as would be expected rates on fixed rate home equity loans currently averaging have barely budged from in july according to bankrate com and average rates on five year new car loans which are generally tied to the movement in treasurys are compared with in july homeowners have gotten some rate relief though average rates on year fixed rate conforming mortgages which are typically influenced by rates on year treasurys havent fallen as much as they would under more normal circumstances while yields on year treasurys ended last week at down percentage point from the first week of june average yields on year fixed rate mortgages fell just percentage point to on average in the same period according to keith gumbinger vice president of mortgage tracker hsh associates mr gumbinger says mortgage rate declines have lagged behind those of treasurys partly because institutional investors are still skittish about mortgage risks and are demanding higher premiums to hold the loans also treasury yields have been falling more quickly as investors seek the safety of higher quality investments lower rates could benefit some homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages that are soon to reset for arms whose reset rates are tied to the one year treasury that rate is currently before the fed began cutting rates in september that adjustment might have been or more says bankrate coms mr mcbride for savers some of the best rates are on liquid accounts and short term cds last month amtrust direct owned by ohio savings banks amtrust bank division rolled out an e savings account paying an introductory yield of for days while m&amp t bank corp launched an online money market account yielding in mid september but relatively high short term rates could begin falling faster as banks enter a period of the year when loan demand is typically lower and the institutions are going to have less of a need to raise deposits to fund those loans says bradley smith executive vice president at umb financial corp s umb bank savers concerned that short term rates
