politics &amp economics turmoil tests pakistans economy booming foreign investment could wane on destabilization fears for months pakistans economy seems to have existed in a parallel universe to the countrys turbulent politics despite street protests militant attacks and legal challenges to the legitimacy of pakistans military strongman nothing seriously dented the rise of the stock market or slowed one of asias fastest growing economies but emergency rule may be different declared saturday by the army chief and president pervez musharraf the order strips away constitutional freedoms that galvanized opposition to the military backed government whether the new controls will muzzle pakistans media courts and political opposition or spark a backlash is unclear pakistan police continued their clampdown against opponents and critics yesterday firing teargas shells to disperse thousands of lawyers in the eastern city of lahore and taking into custody hundreds more opposition party members and lawyers the total detained since saturday was at least opposition groups said more than twice that number had been detained meanwhile gen musharraf told a meeting of ambassadors in islamabad that the government aimed to stick as closely as possible to its timetable of holding parliamentary elections in mid january which would install a new prime minister and new members of the national assembly a spokesman for the president said over the weekend government officials had suggested the elections viewed as a key part of pakistans transition to civilian government from military rule could be delayed for up to a year the prospect of delaying elections had met with fierce criticism from officials from the u s and other countries president bush yesterday urged gen musharraf to hold elections "as soon as possible" and to "remove his military uniform " a reference to the pakistani leaders previous pledge to step down as head of the army but in a reference to the important role played by pakistan in the u s fight against terrorism mr bush also noted that gen musharraf has been "a strong fighter" against radical extremists mr bush who met with reporters at the oval office after a meeting with visiting turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan didnt respond directly to a question about whether the u s would cut aid to pakistan "all we can do is continue to work with the president to make it abundantly clear the position of the united states " mr bush said the political tension in pakistan is almost sure to yield a heavy diet of rumors to rile markets and spook foreign investors even as many parts of the economy see business as usual the karachi share index sank yesterday on rumors that gen musharraf had been placed under house arrest gen musharraf who came to power in a military coup denied rumors of his ouster but the benchmark index dropped to the indexs biggest ever single day fall over the past five years pakistans economy has averaged annual growth and the economy is expected to expand about as fast this year the benchmark index has risen from a year ago even after yesterdays drop so far this year it is up the economy has continued to hum despite some of the countrys worst unrest in years but the outlook is no longer so rosy economists say for one thing billions of dollars in foreign assistance might be in jeopardy after gen musharrafs veering away from a planned transition to civilian rule angered allies such as the u s it has sent nearly &# billion in aid to pakistan since the sept attacks mostly to the army to fight militants before those attacks pakistan was struggling to pay off international loans and sanctions for nuclear testing had frozen u s aid the u s is the largest investor in pakistan accounting for nearly one third of the countrys foreign direct investment from july to september this year according to pakistans ministry of finance yesterday credit ratings agency moodys investors service changed the outlook to negative from stable on the b government foreign and local currency bond ratings and placed a negative outlook on pakistans b foreign currency country ceilings for bank deposits the outlook for pakistans ba foreign currency country ceiling for bonds was unaffected and remains stable "from a credit perspective the emergency rule and more important the factors behind such an action could undermine pakistans ability to sustain significant inflows of confidence sensitive capital " said analyst aninda mitra another potential problem for pakistans economy foreign investors could be more cautious about pumping money into a country that is apparently becoming less stable and more authoritarian last year pakistan enjoyed record inflows of foreign direct investment as banking telecommunications and property markets boomed partly because those investment numbers were so high and partly because of worries about the nations stability foreign investment slipped in the july september period from a year earlier by to &# million according to pakistans government some now fear a steeper downturn after emergency rule and an escalating islamic militancy that has targeted both soldiers and civilians with suicide attacks "its very difficult to see how foreign investment is going to hold up since it can be the most politically sensitive " says ahsan chishty an economist in karachi for standard chartered pakistan a unit of standard chartered plc of the u k ditas lopez in singapore john d mckinnon in washington and haris zamir in mumbai contributed to this article
