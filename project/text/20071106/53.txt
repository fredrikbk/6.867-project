hollywood is going off script as writers gamble for digital pie prolonged strike could open alleys of content distribution pushing daisies still filming with their first strike in nearly two decades film and television writers have made a risky bet that they can win a bigger piece of the entertainment industrys digital future at a time when consumers growing expectation of cheap or free entertainment delivered over the internet has made that future uncertain members of the writers guild of america made good on their promise to walk off the job early yesterday after talks with film and tv producers failed to produce a new contract over the weekend the writers mounted pickets from rockefeller center in new york to the paramount picture lot in hollywood emphasizing the thorny issue at the heart of the dispute they want better compensation for new media uses of their work the internet mobile phones and digital music players than they received when their products were recycled on videocassette and dvd no further talks between the two sides are scheduled though industry officials said it was likely that back channel negotiations would continue the writers are making their play at a perilous time when all media is under siege because of the transition to digital distribution as music companies newspaper publishers and other content creators have wrestled with these questions one thing they havent done is stopped churning out their product a prospect the film and tv industries face with this strike the writers are betting that the public will rally behind their work creating late night talk shows scripted tv shows feature films and other programming that falls under their guilds jurisdiction that is a bold gambit at a time when reality shows often using nonunion writers have already taken control of much of the airwaves at the same time entertainment delivered over the internet ranging from youtube to social networking distractions such as myspace and friendster allows consumers to engage themselves in ways that have nothing to do with films and tv programs any prolonged strike could open new avenues of content distribution born of necessity "if anything the strike could create an opportunity for the online world to step up and prove its value to the guild " said ken hertz a beverly hills calif attorney who has done extensive work in the digital music arena "a strike could in a strange way damage the studios by creating online competitors who come forward to offer the union writers a new model that no one would have otherwise had the time or effort to conceive of " adding to the writers risk it will be a long time before their attempt to disrupt hollywoods entertainment machine is clearly felt while late night talk shows and other programs produced on a daily basis went directly into reruns yesterday it will be weeks or months before the impact is more fully felt in sitcoms and tv dramas in the film business which produces its work months ahead of time it would be well into before any impact was felt the writers union which has members aimed to shut down film and tv production almost immediately in part by convincing teamsters who represent truck drivers location managers and others to support their work stoppage across the industry yesterday however there was little evidence of production halts related to teamsters refusing to cross the picket line at the van nuys calif location of nbcs "the office " teamsters largely respected the picket line according to a person close to the show and jeff hermanson assistant executive director of the writers guild of america west producers still were able to shoot some scenes yesterday those people said albeit scenes without star steve carell who didnt show up to work a representative for mr carell declined to comment on the warner bros lot in burbank meanwhile abcs new series "pushing daisies" is still in production shooting its eighth episode according to executive producer dan jinks a person close to the show said that at least some teamsters reported for work on the show "we were all here at a m this morning and everything is going very well " he said standing outside a soundstage where star kristin chenoweth was shooting a scene shooting for that episode could keep the show in production until next week mr jinks said that he had received a final draft of the shows ninth episode from creator bryan fuller and the shows other writers before midnight sunday and he expects to begin shooting it this week that would keep the show in production until thanksgiving he said some productions were shut down however particularly situation comedies which rely on on set script revisions warner bros television suspended production of shows including "two and a half men" and "the big bang theory " while sony pictures television stopped production of "rules of engagement" and "til death " in new york charlie rubin a writer producer on "law and order criminal intent " was picketing at rockefeller center yesterday morning while scenes from an episode of the show he had co written were being filmed on rikers island he said the unions havent yet distributed firm guidelines for people who write and serve other roles on a show "as a producer im interested in continuing that role but as a writer i dont want to go against the union " he said "were shooting at this very moment and i really want to be there but i cant " "law and order criminal intent " as with most scripted dramas has a few scripts ready for production and it remains unclear whether they will shoot because under normal circumstances writers make changes to scripts immediately before and during shooting neither executive producer warren leight nor his fellow writers knew exactly what would happen to the production of the show in weeks to come he had one prediction "this will accelerate the demise of network television " he said as about writers picketed outside cbs studios in the fairfax district of los angeles some feared that the public wouldnt sympathize with their cause as people focused on the big numbers a handful of writers make rather than the haphazard nature of the work and the low salaries going to the bulk of writers craig hoetger years old said he has made &# from script writing for feature movies this year but just &# from writing last year "i have some momentum in my career and now its on hold " he said raza syed said he would rely on his parents for support to get him through the strike in the meantime he hopes that the notion of the "writers being on the bottom of the totem pole going up against the big corporations maybe that resonates with the public " mr syed said he and his writing partner sold a script for &# a good chunk of his share went to taxes and his various representatives the money went fast he said on "expenses and living the dream " sarah mcbride contributed to this article
