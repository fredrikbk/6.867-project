the middle seat how fewer flights at jfk could affect you the faa proposes new caps on planes at key airport low fares vs lengthy delays new yorks la guardia airport has two runways and the federal aviation administration says it can handle operations takeoffs and landings each hour liberty international airport in newark n j has three runways and handles operations an hour new yorks john f kennedy international airport has four runways and yet the faa now says it can handle only flights per hour the math doesnt seem quite right but that was the faas opening stand with airlines and others trying to figure out how to avoid another summer travel meltdown next year the faa wants to cap traffic at kennedy by regulating takeoff and landing slots as it now does at la guardia a decision is set to come next month and whatever it is it will affect air traffic across the country under the current voluntary system the faa suggests that airlines hew to a limit of operations per hour at jfk and during some hours airlines end up scheduling more than that but this summer the faa says it was able to handle an average of only flights per hour at jfk causing flights to back up in long lines and resulting in maddening waits as a result the faa has now proposed a mandatory cap of flights per hour but cut to flights per hour from airline schedules and new york and by extension the entire u s would experience a significant change in air service six of the most heavily traveled routes in the country touch new york and the faa says about one third of the nations air traffic passes through new york area airspace the problem raises two fundamental questions should airlines schedule for sunny days or stormy days and whats more important on time flights or cheap fares if the faa restricts traffic small communities around the country could lose flights connecting to international trips growth at airlines such as jetblue airways corp and delta air lines inc could be grounded which could lead to less competition and higher fares on some popular routes new entrants like virgin america could be stymied british airways plc and others plan new service when a new "open skies" treaty with europe takes effect next year but that could be scuttled if flights are restricted new airlines not yet launched might be shut out of new york airlines and others from the governors of new jersey and new york to hotel and restaurant associations and even the league of american theaters and producers have expressed outrage at what they see as a draconian limit proposed by the faa at kennedy curbing air traffic could pinch tourism and regional growth they say "you cant say sorry we cant take any more new yorks closed " says bill decota aviation director at the port authority of new york and new jersey the operator of the three main new york area airports at the same time routine lengthy delays cant be acceptable to travelers either in august the three airports with the worst on time records in the country were all within miles of each other kennedy la guardia and newark at each one or more of flights were late kennedy has seen a huge increase in flights which strained the regions airspace this summer the number of flights at jfk increased from march to last august the port authority says and the airport received nonstop service to new domestic cities and new international destinations yet after last summers misery it seems clear that new york has to find a way to cut back on the number of flights and the faa has to find a way to manage them better airlines have filled schedules with lots of small airplanes regional jets with seats or so making multiple trips each day regional jets are the only profitable way to serve some communities but jfk has regional jet flights from major cities like boston chicago st louis washington atlanta toronto and montreal some flights could be consolidated at the same time critics of the faa plan say there are changes the faa can make to improve new york traffic flow long before next generation modernization is put in place a decade or more from now mr decota of the port authority put together a group of airline community and industry consultants to find ways to enhance capacity at new yorks airports and the group has come up with about different ideas he says they include giving new york some of the new technology such as additional departure routes using satellite based navigation already in place in dallas and atlanta installing ground surveillance radar to better manage aircraft on the ground building more taxiways and adding an additional airway in the sky for westbound departures some are quick improvements some are long term projects faced with a similar mess in south florida two years ago the faa appointed an air traffic "czar" to get the system moving faster it worked and some suggest a similar step is in order for new york the faa began meetings between airlines and the faa on oct and so far officials say they have been "constructive " because airlines need to publish schedules months in advance the faa has until about mid december to come up with its plan for next summer the port authoritys task force report will be out about the same time any solution needs to be made regionally curbing only jfk for example may prompt airlines to flood newark with flights even though newark is highly prone to delays even during good weather in addition imposing restrictions on one airport can change the competitive balance between airlines curbing traffic at jfk for example hurts delta jetblue and amr corp s american airlines while not affecting continental airlines inc which has its hub in newark transportation secretary mary peters has begun pushing another idea that has been debated for years by academics and analysts "congestion pricing " thats a market based scheme that would raise the price of landing at a congested airport so that small planes become uneconomical or price peak landing times so high that airlines spread out schedules more "congestion pricing has worked exceptionally well in other areas of our economy such as highways electricity and telecommunications " ms peters said recently in congressional testimony airlines say congestion pricing is just another tax on a financially ailing industry thats already heavily taxed another problem is that since so many people want flights at peak times the government may not be able to levy fees high enough to really affect scheduling "there is no price that you could put in effect that would impact demand " says mr decota of the port authority
