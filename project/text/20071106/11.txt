blunt diplomacy surrender is not an option by john bolton threshold editions pages &# the british conservative enoch powell once famously said that all political careers end in failure john boltons career as we read in the opening pages of "surrender is not an option " began with the defeat of barry goldwaters presidential campaign on which he had served as a teenage volunteer it is a disarming start to the memoir of a man usually caricatured as a bombastic tub thumper in any case history records that john bolton bounced back from this disappointment rose through the republican ranks in the s and after loyal service interpreting floridian chads during the election count found himself propelled into high office he tells the rest of the story with a focus brutality and exasperation that will give pain and pleasure in all the right places among mr boltons pungent chapter titles "sisyphus in the twilight zone " "why do i want this job " my favorite may be "following the yellow cake road on north korea " certainly "the wizard of oz" would have served as good preparation for mr boltons two bush era portfolios undersecretary of state for arms control and u s permanent representative to the united nations mr bolton often finds himself in a fantasy fueled munchkinland in which all the problems of the middle east are blamed on israel and the iranian quest for a nuclear bomb is either denied or ignored or justified as a legitimate response to u s and zionist hegemony the u n in particular mr bolton makes clear was a place for third world ax grinding and waywardness to be asked by a congolese staffer during difficult iran related negotiations "why do we care about nuclear weapons " was par for the course and to find many u n member states determined to revive the spirit of the long repealed "zionism is racism" resolution was almost routine in that sense mr boltons experience matched that of u s ambassadors to the u n going back to jeane kirkpatrick daniel patrick moynihan and perhaps beyond much more worrying is mr boltons account of european policy on tehrans nuclear program the policy started as a well meant attempt to avoid military confrontation by persuading the iranians to abandon their plans peacefully at almost every stage along the way however the french british and german negotiators were hoodwinked by the iranians who later gloated over the deceptions they had been allowed to get away with far from holding all this against iran the europeans or "euroids " as mr bolton calls them tended to vent their frustration on mr bolton and americas supposed intransigence thus the british representative to the security council is quoted as being "so tired of having to go out in front of those damned cameras and explain why we gave up on this or conceded on that " far and away the most feeble performance is put in by the envoy from berlin who reflexively gives the iranians the benefit of the doubt crediting their claims of peaceful intentions the germans of all people should care about nuclear weapons in the hands of a maniac such as president mahmoud ahmadinejad who has called for the destruction of israel their diplomats at the u n should not be making excuses for an iranian nuclear program that is plainly intended for military purposes mr bolton it should be said does not proceed merely by assertion he supplies dates names names cites documents recounts conversations and gives a blow by blow record of his diplomatic dealings his memoir is entirely without coyness and spares no one not even george w bush himself whom he accuses of dropping the ball on iran in recent times mr bolton is merciless with the senior and middling state department officials who he felt tried to sabotage the campaign against tehran his criticism will no doubt send them back to their diaries to pen a rebuttal for the moment however "surrender is not an option" serves as a first draft of history even for those who disagree with him mr boltons account will be the first port of call for those seeking to understand u s policy on nuclear proliferation during president bushs two administrations it will also lay to rest a tenacious misunderstanding about the author mr bolton has long been described even by otherwise well informed commentators as a "neoconservative " in fact his political roots in small government goldwater republicanism could not be further removed from the big government origins of the formerly democratic neoconservatives moreover mr bolton is innocent too much so in my view of any ambition to put the export of democracy at the center of u s foreign policy in fact mr bolton is in many ways a member of the same "realist" family as colin powell richard armitage and condoleezza rice but unlike them he sees nothing realistic about appeasing irans nuclear ambitions mr bolton provides a depressing account of how within the bush administration itself initial firmness gave way in mr powells case to a concern for his "legacy" and in ms rices to a penchant for "carrots" over "sticks" in her dealings with iran he was so outraged over one of her capitulations that he pointedly ordered carrot soup at his next dinner with her in the end history will record all this as a question of judgment if iran is peacefully persuaded to stop short of the final turn of the screwdriver or even if tehran uses a nuclear device it develops "responsibly" then ms rice mr powell and "the euroids" will be vindicated but if as seems more likely the iranians develop a deliverable nuclear device and put it in the hands of the zealots currently running the country then we shall rue the day that john bolton stepped down after all to adapt goldwater restraint in the pursuit of durable solutions is no virtue and robustness in pursuit of american interests is no vice mr simms is the author most recently of "three victories and a defeat the rise and fall of the first british empire " penguin allen lane
