what the auction houses are doing to try to keep the art market booming new york elvis presley looks at liz taylor across a crowded room picasso gazes on indulgently john d rockefeller jr captured midswing by sculptor alexander calder plays golf with a ball aimed right at andy warhols version of muhammad ali at christies auction house paintings of famous faces some being sold by famous names stare out at potential bidders on the eve of the biggest series of art auctions in history in a special exhibition of portraiture last weekend in new york christies invoked the power of celebrity because it needed to at sales that begin tonight and run through nov christies sothebys and phillips de pury will put art valued at nearly &# billion on the block a similar spring series of sales shattered a record when they made &# billion for weeks anxious prognosticating has focused on whether the mortgage meltdown will halt the dazzling art boom and on which contemporary artists would be most vulnerable in a downturn surprisingly those questions turn out to be moot these are some of the most coordinated micromanaged even staged sales in the art markets history the auctioneers have made a considerable effort to insulate the auctions from economic gyrations such as citigroups losses and the recent ouster of its and merrill lynchs ceos attempting to ensure that such bad news doesnt pop the markets bubble auctioneers have pre placed artworks structured complicated deals to underpin prices altered the language and targets of their marketing and even completely overhauled their "merchandise mix " the goal to curate around a potential art market crash the art buyer looking to next weeks major contemporary art auction for clues to the value in a softer economy of a work by for example cecily brown a superhot young contemporary painter of riotous sex scenes wont find answers here these sales completely sidestep a referendum on the contemporary art boom of the past decade in a striking switch theyre filled with works by mid or late career living artists names like cy twombly john chamberlain robert ryman frank stella brice marden artists with a generation of fame behind them whats up for bid has also been altered markedly by who the auctioneers expect to be bidding and thats simply put european middle eastern and most prominently russian buyers in the wake of that nations privatization of wealth art buying has become a growing "social" activity among russians says mariana skorokhodova haseldine an art adviser who recently led tours of russian art collectors through the london art fairs among her clients theres increasing competition to win works at these auctions and to be seen "playing in the big leagues " courting the deep pocketed russian buyer goes far beyond printing brochures in cyrillic and bringing art to moscow both of which the auctioneers have done in recent weeks earlier this month phillipss chairman simon de pury flew to st petersburg for a dinner for supporters of the hermitage museum and to appeal to buyers these sales are packed with works by russian born mark rothko one of his works brought &# million last may and by henri matisse who briefly lived in moscow and who is well known to russian collectors matisse went to russia in the autumn of at the invitation of collector sergei shchukin whose extensive collection of the artists works is now in the hermitage strikingly there are more matisse than picasso artworks at the evening sales unprecedented arithmetic brightly colored slightly figurative work is much to the russian taste says david norman vice chairman of impressionist and modern art at sothebys so the auction house is offering a vivid gauguin "te poipoi the morning " with sky high hopes of a &# million to &# million price and paintings by german expressionist and european fauve painters amid a weak dollar asian and middle eastern bidders havent been forgotten he notes "u s real estate is down but oil is at record levels " notes mr norman at christies the company used to simply pack up its sales highlights and send them on a world wide grand tour says the companys head of impressionist and modern art guy bennett now the sales are split into separate tours tailored to each nations tastes allowing whatever paintings that market may value most to be showcased as the sales masterpieces christies is also much more active than it once was in attempting to pre match each painting with potential bidders says mr bennett and in advising collectors on trading their art to fund new acquisitions if it all sounds a bit frantic perhaps it is the auction houses need new buyers because to an auction veteran these walls would look very familiar with the exception of chinese contemporary art which is new to these sales many of the paintings for sale have been on the block in the past decade or so at a fraction of their current prices at christies a modigliani portrait of russian sculptor oskar miestchaninoff estimated at &# million to &# million sold for &# million in works by renoir and monet are making similar reappearances at sothebys actor hugh grant is selling his warhol "liz" at a &# million to &# million price estimate he paid &# million six years ago if buyers balk at the run up the risk is christies not mr grants "liz" carries a guarantee more than of the artworks in the evening sales are guaranteed thats the highest proportion ever in the contemporary art sales a guarantee means the seller receives a pre agreed amount of money from the auction house no matter what happens in the salesroom in practice these deals sound riskier for the auctioneer than they have proved to be since sellers swap a substantial portion of the potential profit for the security but the financial arrangements underpinning these sales go beyond standard guarantees in such third party arrangements dealers agree to place the first bid or several bids in exchange for a lessened buyers commission if they win such deals are a welcome safety net for the seller or for the auction house if its the guarantor but theyre controversial in that they give dealers a financial edge over private buyers and they mislead the market the price reported isnt the one actually paid "third party guarantees exist " notes a christies spokeswoman "we dont comment on them " she adds that all guaranteed lots "both types " are flagged in the sales catalogs and that christies is offering guaranteed lots in its evening sales a source high in one auction house says it has made arrangements with dealers in several cases to place the opening bid in exchange for a share of the buyers commission if that bid wins a dealer and a collector said that such overtures have been made to them will all the maneuvering work probably some works like vincent van goghs last finished landscape or picassos giant bronze of mistress dora maar defy market hiccups others like that gauguin that "liz " or jeff koonss giant blue steel engagement ring at &# million might be extravagantly priced even amid a rally the success of these sales may hang on how much less than the now dated price estimates printed in the sales catalogs sellers are willing to take "the artworks are very aggressively priced given the fragility of the market " notes collector larry warsh who spent more than &# million at contemporary art auctions in london last month the stakes are huge sothebys accounts receivable money owed by clients and dealers stood at &# million at the end of the second quarter that number is "not out of whack " given the exceptionally strong growth in sothebys sales over the past year says the auction houses ceo william ruprecht christies is not a public company and thus does not disclose its balance sheet however in one indication either of financial pressures or of sellers racing for the lifeboats christies sale tonight is packed with so many artworks that it will start the bidding at p m thats a half hour earlier than it has done so for the past quarter century ms peers writes on art and culture for the journal correction christies does not discount its buyers premiums in return for assuming the risk involved in a third party guarantee the guarantor who can be a dealer collector or financial institution receives a fee based on a percentage of the hammer price and the buyers commission "what the auction houses are doing to try to keep the art market booming" leisure &amp arts page nov reported that only dealers were third party guarantors and that they were directly rewarded with a reduced buyers premium wsj nov
