every day low prices every day low taxes i find it interesting that the federal government and high tax states constantly have to fight taxpayers who utilize tax shelters "inside wal marts bid to slash state taxes " page one oct instead of wasting taxpayer dollars chasing down abusive tax shelters maybe they should look at the tax laws of states such as delaware that apparently dont have the same problems the common thread here isnt the companies that rightfully attempt to minimize their own taxes but the high tax rates that cause them to reduce their tax burden wal mart should be applauded for cutting their effective state tax rates in half because those savings are passed through to shareholders in higher stock value and to customers as lower prices contrary to what tax authorities would like us to believe companies dont pay taxes consumers do as judge learned hand once wrote "anyone may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible he is not bound to choose that pattern which will best pay the treasury there is not even a patriotic duty to increase ones taxes " alan williams elko minn i have worked as a tax attorney in state government and i buy without hesitation the argument that its nobodys patriotic duty to pay any more in taxes than what the law requires however it turns my stomach that there are so many institutions playing very fast and loose with "what the law requires " sham transactions like the various wal mart examples you wrote about are in plentiful supply the law is what it is and wal mart and others and their ernst &amp young enablers arent above it i would like to pay whatever amount of taxes i feel like paying too but our system isnt founded on vigilante justice now maybe you can help the general public start connecting the dots when people and businesses dont pay their fair share of taxes to the tune of multiple millions of dollars theres less money coming in to run the state that means tax rates need to go up to generate the revenue to pay for building and maintaining those silly little things like roads and bridges and schools and prisons that people take for granted or else they dont get built or maintained and things like bridges collapsing into rivers and our kids leaking mold infested schools should come as no surprise to anyone oliver wendell holmes got it right when he said "taxes are what we pay for a civilized society " kelly kennedy west hartford conn
