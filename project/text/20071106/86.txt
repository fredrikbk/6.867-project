politics &amp economics carried interest tax unlikely to rise in washington the senates top tax writer said a tax increase on "carried interest" isnt in store this year for private equity and hedge fund managers but managers putting off paying taxes by stowing income offshore have more to worry about increasing taxes on carried interest doesnt have the necessary support to pass the senate said sen max baucus the montana democrat and chairman of the senates tax committee carried interest is a portion of fund managers pay that is taxed at the capital gains rate a house proposal would tax carried interest as ordinary income at rates as high as however mr baucus said it is "not as difficult to pass" another proposal put forward by the house which would limit hedge fund managers ability to defer taxes on their compensation by holding the money offshore mr baucuss posture shows how democrats are searching for politically palatable ways to raise taxes on some narrowly targeted groups in order to offset other tax cuts congress identified high paid private equity and hedge fund managers this year as a possible target as lawmakers marveled at the size of their compensation and their ability to pay low tax rates on much of it the house proposal on offshore income would raise an estimated &# billion over years in revenue mr baucus said passing that provision in the senate wouldnt be easy "but theres more interest in that than there is in" the carried interest proposal both tax concepts are included in a house bill expected to come up for a vote later this week that would prevent more than million people from having to pay the alternative minimum tax this year increasing taxes on carried interest and limiting tax deferrals by hedge fund managers would generate the &# billion over years to make the amt change comply with congresss "pay go" budget rule that requires tax cuts to be offset with tax increases or spending cuts in the senate mr baucus said he too intends to abide by the budget requirement though he concedes it will be "challenging" to construct amt relief that is fully offset stopping the spread of the amt this year is so popular he said "i dont know whether senators would vote against an amt fix" if the offset proposals are palatable mr baucus suggested carried interest should be taxed at a higher rate "basically i think as a general rule carried interest to the degree that you dont put skin in the game it should be ordinary income " he said one reason the move lacks support in the senate is that it is "perceived as affecting lots of industries " including venture capital and some real estate ventures mr baucus said both industries lobbied heavily against the change as has the private equity industry arguing it would harm their industries and the broader economy "the main thing here is this trumps everything i want to pass legislation here that can pass " mr baucus said adding that he expected president bush would veto an increase on carried interest taxes even if it did pass congress
