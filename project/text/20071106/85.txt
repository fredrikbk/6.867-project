pfizer drug for cholesterol needs additional research orlando fla researchers involved in a study that prompted pfizer inc to halt development of torcetrapib a drug designed to boost "good" cholesterol levels said that they cant explain exactly how the drug contributed to an increase in cardiovascular problems and death in december pfizer halted the development of torcetrapib after the independent data safety monitoring board overseeing the study recommended it be stopped after seeing an increase in deaths and cardiovascular events among patients receiving torcetrapib complete results from the study known as illuminate were to be presented at the american heart associations annual meeting in orlando and are being published in the new england journal of medicine the study led by researchers at the heart research institute in sydney australia involved patients who were considered at high risk of cardiovascular problems like heart attacks and strokes all of the patients received atorvastatin a cholesterol lowering drug pfizer sells under the brand name lipitor while half also received torcetrapib after a year the study showed there was a increased risk of death among patients in the torcetrapib group and a increase in the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks compared with those receiving atorvastatin alone in real terms there were deaths in the torcetrapib arm of the study and in the atorvastatin only arm torcetrapib boosted so called good cholesterol or hdl by an average of and lowered "bad" ldl cholesterol by torcetrapib falls into a proposed class of drugs known as inhibitors of cholesteryl ester transfer protein or cetp which are designed to raise the level of good cholesterol in the blood the protein transfers cholesterol from hdl or "good" cholesterol to ldl or "bad" cholesterol so inhibiting cetp keeps cholesterol in hdl researchers said it is thought that boosting "good" cholesterol in addition to lowering "bad" cholesterol with statin drugs could have a larger impact on reducing risks for heart attacks and strokes the study showed torcetrapib boosted blood pressure a side effect seen in earlier studies but researchers said many of the deaths in the torcetrapib group had blood pressure levels lower than the median blood pressure level among patients in the study philip barter the lead researcher with the heart research institute said the most plausible explanation for the increase in deaths and cardiovascular problems is that torcetrapib increased aldosterone levels a hormone involved in blood pressure regulation but he said more research is needed to explain how the aldosterone rise may have contributed to the safety problems with torcetrapib dr barter said that while the study cannot rule out a problem from inhibiting cetp itself or essentially a drug class problem he said he hoped research on other compounds in the same class moves forward merck &amp co and roche holding ag are developing cetp inhibitors but have been partly waiting for the results of the illuminate trial before deciding to move forward with further development of the drugs
