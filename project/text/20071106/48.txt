farm production strains may keep food prices high agricultural production is struggling to keep pace with demand as diets improve around the world and agricultural products become more central to energy markets according to a report being released today by credit suisse group the structural changes in agriculture markets mean commodity prices and therefore consumer food prices will continue to stay aloft over coming years with emerging markets feeling more of the burden since a larger slice of their spending is more heavily weighted toward food the report says however net agriculture exporters like brazil and malaysia and foreign food companies with lower labor costs could benefit demand is largely being driven by changing dietary habits the report says as growing populations in developing countries consume more meat and more calories exacerbating the situation is the advent of biofuels the report estimates that crops grown to meet government biofuel mandates world wide will account for of total arable and permanent cropland over the next to years up from about today the change in dietary patterns alone means food production needs to grow at per year just to keep pace over the next five to eight years the report says to meet global food and biofuels demand overall agricultural production will need to grow annually historically global food production has risen annually rising commodity prices are likely to continue pressuring food processors profit margins even though the report notes that on average only about of the value of an individual food item is directly related to commodity prices or farm value the remaining largely goes to labor transportation and packaging companies with strong brand recognition will be insulated more than less branded businesses a kernel of good news for biofuels producers over the next year low ethanol prices could recover with the addition of new ethanol markets in the southeast and improved biofuels transportation and blending infrastructure however corn prices are expected to stay high adding pressure to current demand is a slowing growth rate in land availability due to land degradation and urbanization the amount of arable land in china has dropped about over the past decade because of urbanization in the u s some potentially productive cropland will likely remain tied up in what is known as the conservation reserve program which sets aside crop land to protect the environment the limited ability to access new land for agricultural purposes means more emphasis will likely be placed on genetically modified products which could help boost yields for food and energy crops also the increasing demand for biofuels could pressure countries to reduce their biofuels mandates as a way to alleviate pressure on food prices already china has reduced its biofuels target to two million tons of biofuels production by down from five million tons
