love and money your kids break it do they buy it my year old son walked in from the rain several days ago upset because the electric scooter he got for christmas no longer scooted it turns out he had been driving his scooter through puddles and wet grass after a rain storm and fried the scooters brain in the process i could see my son was upset with himself for ruining the one gift he has wanted every christmas for the past three years he finally got it and a month later it was broken fortunately the part my son destroyed was replaceable for &# it could have been a lot worse but that left a simple question who should pay whether its a youngsters scooter or a teenagers car kids are constantly breaking or losing their possessions sometimes replacement is affordable sometimes pricey whatever the cost do we mom and dad pony up just because we have the money or because we feel bad when the loss might not have been our kids fault or should we impose the same rule as stores do you break it you buy it kids at some point have to learn the value of a dollar and that they must protect what they value but whats the best way to teach that lesson i had my fair share of disappointing screw ups as a kid when i was just about my sons age i spent weeks working on a model of the lunar lander but i missed a step on a flight of stairs my lander tumbled and shattered and i was heartbroken but i never got a shot at a new model my mom couldnt afford a replacement kit as a parent its only natural that we want to make our kids feel better when theyre sad and fix problems that arise they lose a favorite toy and we replace it they drop a favorite book in the bathtub and we buy a new copy they rip a favorite shirt or ruin a favorite pair of shoes and were at the store the next day is that the right approach though its certainly compassionate but it also threatens to instill the idea that everything is replaceable and thus disposable and that there are no consequences to careless actions there are a few ways to look at this my friend grace says she understands that accidents happen "but tough cookies " when her kids break a beloved toy "we dont go out and replace it right away they either have to cough up the bucks or they do without more often than not they choose to do without " another friend a mom of a young daughter sees it differently i told her i was leaning toward having my son foot the &# bill this was after all his mistake her comment "i think youre being mean hes a little kid and he wasnt irresponsible he didnt know the consequences of his actions he was just playing and being a kid and you are punishing him for not having enough life experience to understand that cars can go out in the rain but electric scooters cant im not even sure i would have realized that either and im " meanwhile erik a friend in atlanta says he and his wife have dealt with this issue often and that "circumstances dictate whether his kids experience consequences or receive grace " when his daredevil son racing his skateboard like scooter down a hilly street wiped out and destroyed the scooter "i could have made the case that he was being irresponsible " erik says "in reality he was just being your typical year old boy while i hope he learned his lesson i gladly paid for a new scooter " conversely both of eriks kids have been warned numerous times to either keep their toys off the floor or close their bedroom doors or else the familys two puppies might gnaw the items to pieces when a dog chewed up a prized new american girl doll accessory "i told my daughter sorry but you are paying to replace it " erik says "the dangers and risks involved were well known it resulted in her being more careful in the future " when i told amy why the scooter wasnt scooting she and i both agreed initially that our son should empty his wallet to pay for the fix we want him to learn that those things that are important must be cared for but the more we talked about it and the more i talked to friends ive come to see that approach as too harsh for one thing i never warned my son to steer clear of puddles and wet grass on rainy days whats more as my friend says he sees cars drive in the rain all the time why is a scooter any different docking him for the repair seems unfair when he did nothing particularly wrong still if we just pay the price he learns nothing so were going with an approach similar to that of our friends drew and colleen in new orleans "life is about mistakes and what it costs you to make those mistakes " says colleen her daughter is in the school band and a couple of times has dropped her flute and bent the valves "the first time i didnt make her pay for the repair because it was a complete accident " but colleen told the girl that such repairs are expensive about &# and warned her that she needed to be more careful then she dropped it again "i made her clean out her bank " colleen says "it may have been &# that she gave me but she has not dropped her flute again and that was two years ago i would like to believe that it was forcing her to take responsibility for her mistake i even heard her fussing at her brother to take care of his instrument because it cost a lot of money to fix " something similar seems a good strategy in our situation ill order the part and fix my sons scooter but amy and i both want him to think twice about the consequences of his actions in the future we want him to have some skin in the game so were making him pay half the cost &# its not much but its meaningful to him because it shrinks the stash he has been saving for a family trip to disney world in april still he agrees that he should be responsible for half of the repair costs and the half we provide comes with a free warning attached "next time this happens its all on your shoulders " jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney wsj com
