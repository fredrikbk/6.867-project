family finances financing the care of a disabled child parents of children with severe disabilities can turn to their doctors for medical advice their religious leaders for spiritual guidance and their communities for encouragement they should also turn to a financial adviser and an attorney to create a lifeline for their child this is especially critical for families of children who are unlikely to be able to support themselves as adults and who may never be able to live independently while family needs vary widely on average parents need to accumulate &# to &# to ensure that personal care will be provided for the rest of such a childs life says chris sullivan manager of special needs financial services for merrill lynch mr sullivans program works with clients whose children are in "very severe situations " such as severe cerebral palsy and severe autism such families need considerable savings he says because "it is now very common for a disabled child to live another or or sometimes years " planning for a disabled childs future isnt just about saving enough though there are also pitfalls to be avoided and opportunities for parents to create some peace of mind for themselves disabled individuals typically receive benefits from the federal and state governments in the form of supplemental security income and medicaid without such assistance a familys savings would need to be far greater families can use a "special needs trust" to provide additional dollars for a disabled individuals future care without threatening those government benefits but loved ones with the best of intentions can inadvertently disqualify a person for disability benefits thats because it takes only &# in assets in the childs name rather than that of the trust to lose government benefits "oftentimes unintentionally the grandparents will make out a will that makes a direct contribution to the child " says mr sullivan "that will create a calamity for the parents because it will automatically disqualify the child for government support " despite these complications many parents of disabled kids arent seeking out the proper advice says joyce gordon a vice president of the wealth strategies group at metlife in a survey metlifes division of estate planning for special kids found that of such parents have not established a special needs trust and nearly a third have made no plans for how to provide for their kids after their own deaths ms gordon speculates that parents want to put off difficult decisions such as choosing a guardian for the child and she notes that these tough decisions are only "compounded by all of the stress they are under " that said actually making a plan often including a letter of intent spelling out day to day details as simple as the childs preferred brand of toothpaste is "going to provide the security that they need when thinking about that childs future " ms gordon says both merrill lynch and metlife offer free consultations with their special needs financial advisers these and other financial firms can make money charging fees to develop financial plans managing assets in special needs trusts and selling life insurance policies to provide a lump sum upon a parents death to be sure parents trying to finance the care of their child or years from now have time on their side sometimes whats more difficult is finding money for immediate expenses "one of the problems is that when you need the money when the child is young and you need all those extra services you dont have it and when you have it and the child is older you dont need it " says emerson dickman a special needs attorney in new jersey whose son was born with down syndrome mr dickman recently created a group the dickman consulting alliance to provide parents and others with resources on special needs what can hard pressed young parents do to meet their immediate financial needs mr dickman offers a suggestion from his own experience ask for help mr dickman says he and his wife "didnt have enough money for the speech lessons that my son needed " so he asked a local fraternal organization to pitch in "we asked for charity because when you have a child with a disability you do things for them that you would not do for yourself " he says "and thats what these groups are there for they want to help " its a better option than jeopardizing your financial security "we have families who sell their houses who take out second mortgages or cash in iras to pay for their childrens therapy " says alison singer senior vice president at autism speaks a group that raises funds for research and advocates for autistic children ms singer whose year old daughter is autistic notes that therapy for autism which can cost thousands of dollars a week isnt typically covered by insurance "when parents have a child that is diagnosed with autism its a double whammy " she says "first they are hit with all of the emotional issues associated with having a child with disabilities and then they are told that they have to pay for the treatment themselves " a little research might turn up some unexpected sources of funds though the state of new jersey for example has a program called the catastrophic illness in children relief fund that helps families foot medical bills the new jersey program gives away about &# million a year and the awards are based on financial need says executive director ralph condo go online to nj gov humanservices and click on "disability programs " the fund is unique to new jersey mr condo says but other states and the federal government have expressed interest in creating similar programs
