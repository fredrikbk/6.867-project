super bowl xli and other market oracles one of wall streets most beloved and surprisingly accurate market predictors says the stock markets direction for the year is foretold by which team wins the super bowl this year in an unusual twist we can tell you the prognostication even before todays kickoff stocks are headed up thats because both the bears and the colts were in the national football league prior to its merger with the american football league legend has it that a win for one of the "original" nfl teams or a national football conference expansion team signals a market gain for the year while a win for one of the afl teams or an american football conference expansion team predicts a decline the super bowl indicator is just one of numerous oddball gauges that investors consult for hints on where stocks are headed the wall street equivalent of relying on punxsutawney phil or another groundhog to predict how long wintry weather will drag on heard of the lipstick indicator or the boston snow gauge heres a look at several of these measures and whether they really tell us much at all the super bowl indicator has been correct in of the games giving it an accuracy rate of a game day factoid there have been seven other years when two original nfl teams faced off in the super bowl six times the market as tracked by the dow jones industrial average went up some say the "predictor" is a simple coincidence they say it works because there are more teams that count toward an nfl win than an afl win now to and stocks go up more often than they go down with the dow industrials rising in of the last years but such indicators also "take on a life of their own when investors believe they have forecasting ability " says thomas krueger a finance professor at the university of wisconsin at la crosse dr krueger has published several academic papers on the super bowl predictor he found that since the indicator gained popularity in the late s trading volume has spiked the week after the super bowl and in years when the pregame odds in las vegas shifted to support an old nfl team rather than an afl team stocks rallied accordingly still not everyones a believer using the super bowl as your investing guide is like expecting to win the lottery because "a fortune cookie says these are the six winning numbers " scoffs david bergmann a financial planner in marina del rey calif almost as ubiquitous as the super bowl indicator is the january barometer which says a gain for stocks in january signals a good year for the market when the dow advances in january as it did this time with a gain the next months were above average in of the years since the indexs first full trading year in according to the wall street journals market data group but this year the january barometer is in conflict with another calendar watching indicator relying on the markets course in the first five trading days of the year those initial days of saw the dow industrials slip confused then forget the dows results altogether and rely on your powers of observation for hints about the markets course when women show more leg some market seers say the market is destined to show you the money shorter skirts are fashions way of saying that consumers are confident and ready to live it up while dour ankle length skirts reflect a dreary market outlook this year female intuition predicts an advance for the dow "hemlines are definitely up " says elena castaneda president of new york image consultant another good sign women are buying less lipstick leonard lauder chairman of estee lauder companies gets the credit for connecting a spike in lipstick sales to a slump in the economy lipstick is a cheap pick me up for consumers when they are wary of more extravagant indulgences lipstick sales rose after the terrorist attacks of sept and went still higher the following year as the bear market of to dragged on but theyve been trending downward ever since supermarkets drugstores and mass merchandise outlets excluding wal mart stores sold million tubes of lipstick last year down from million in according to market researcher information resources want to trust but verify the female point of view look to the white house the dow has advanced in the third year of every presidential cycle since franklin d roosevelt led the u s into world war ii if you go back to the dows inception the accuracy rate is since this is year three of george w bushs second term the stock market is due for a boost most observers credit political posturing for this phenomenon the commander in chief does what he can to pump up the economy before voters hit the polls the following year but this indicator doesnt guarantee a steady upward climb for the year remember october s "black monday" on that day in the third year of ronald reagans second term the dow industrials fell more than points a stunning the average did recover but only enough to post a gain for the year with all these positive indicators a bull market may seem a sure thing until you factor in global warming the inconvenient truth warm temperatures in december led to a snowless christmas in boston thats bad news according to the boston snow indicator which says a white christmas in beantown foretells a strong year for stocks this predictor sometimes disparaged as the b s indicator is credited to staffers at wall streets defunct drexel burnham lambert who said that they found that the average market gain following a christmas with snow on the ground was about greater than that of years without snow so where does all of this leave investors this sampling of indicators sends the bad news bears packing with a score of to in favor of a market advance in of course no one admits to making investment decisions based on these indicators unless they work and then they gloat about it at next years super bowl party email forum sunday wsj com
