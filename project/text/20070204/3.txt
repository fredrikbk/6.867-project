getting going what you count defines the decade so far its been a terrible decade for stocks or has it over the past seven calendar years u s stocks have lost a cumulative as measured by the standard &amp poors stock index of big blue chip companies yet despite that lots of investors have made decent money this decade and lots of financial experts are boasting about their market beating results puzzled the reality is the s&amp p s raw return just doesnt tell the whole story and that has important implications for how you manage your money suppose that over the past seven calendar years you had owned vanguard index fund the giant &# billion mutual fund that tracks the s&amp p instead of losing you would have made and thats after deducting the funds annual expenses which currently run a year the reason the funds shareholders received the dividends paid by the s&amp p companies but those dividends arent included in the raw s&amp p index today the s&amp p companies are collectively yielding some and ignoring dividends is hardly the only problem when we look at the s&amp p s return for the current decade theres an implicit assumption that folks invested a heap of money on a single day at the start of the decade but most of us dont invest that way instead we add to our portfolios over time imagine you had invested &# in vanguard every year for seven years starting at year end as of year end your &# total investment would have been worth &# or more than your cost calculates allan roth a financial planner with wealth logic in colorado springs colo in all this however theres an even bigger assumption were presuming the s&amp p is a good proxy for how our investments have fared and a good benchmark against which to compare ourselves but thats hardly the case "the s&amp p with dividends reinvested is an appropriate benchmark for people in large cap u s funds " mr roth says but if you own other funds or youre gauging the success of a globally diversified portfolio you should be using another benchmark he argues lets say youre trying to get a handle on u s stock performance my advice skip vanguards s&amp p fund and instead look to vanguard total stock market index fund vanguards total market fund is a better indicator of how u s stocks have performed because it tracks the performance of the entire u s market including both large and small stocks thanks to stellar gains by small stocks the fund has notched in the current decade modestly ahead of vanguard s return but why stop with the u s market today many american investors have significant holdings of foreign shares suppose you started the decade with in the vanguard total stock market index fund and in vanguard total international stock index fund which owns a mix of developed and emerging markets through year end your stock portfolio would have clocked a cumulative gain "the s&amp p is roughly of the global stock market " mr roth notes "and recently its been the worst because foreign has beaten u s and small has beaten large " of course theres more to financial markets than just mainstream u s and foreign stocks imagine that at the start of the decade you had wanted some exposure to hard assets so you bought small stakes in vanguards precious metals stock fund now closed to new investors and its real estate investment trust fund with the addition of those two funds you had of your stock portfolio in u s shares in foreign stocks in reits and in precious metals lets also assume that these four stock funds accounted for of your total savings and that the other was allocated to vanguard total bond market index fund result you are now looking at a seven year cumulative gain of or a year thats a far cry from the s&amp p s cumulative share price loss the presumes you bought the five funds at the start of the decade and then left your portfolio to run what if you had rebalanced back to your initial portfolio allocations at the end of each year while rebalancing often bolsters performance it would have hurt results during this stretch reducing your seven year gain to mr roth calculates taken together the data offer four valuable lessons first and most obviously they show the power of diversification in the s the s&amp p posted dazzling gains and many folks came to view s&amp p index funds as a safe one stop stock investment but if you had owned just the s&amp p during the current decade you would have had pitiful returns second whenever mutual funds or financial advisers compare their results to a benchmark index ask yourself whether the index chosen is really appropriate "there is no perfect benchmark " mr roth says "it does involve judgment but you should be careful when advisers claim to have beaten the market because after costs very few do " less ethical investment advisers wont simply compare themselves with an index that has recently been easy to beat which in the current decade has been the s&amp p they may also compare themselves with the share price only index conveniently forgetting to include the indexs dividends third dont give up on rebalancing true it hurt results during the current decade because we saw long winning streaks by precious metals shares reits and international stocks and rebalancing meant you cut back on these winners along the way but if anything those long winning streaks should make you nervous and rebalancing is a great way to keep your portfolios risk level under control finally despite all the hand wringing over stocks during the current decade it hasnt been that bad a period for investors "has it been a stellar decade " asks mr roth "no but its been a fairly respectable decade for those who were disciplined kept costs low dollar cost averaged and diversified the boring tried and true worked again " jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall street journal write to him at jonathan clements wsj com
