eyes on the road new mini isnt alone anymore bmws redesigned small car enters changing u s market phoenix when bmw launched the new mini cooper in the u s five years ago it was in a class by itself defying the conventional wisdom that the american road was a land of the giants now bmw ag is rolling out a new mini although you probably cant tell just from a photo of the exterior but today a tiny car with lots of technology and distinctive style doesnt seem so unconventional in fact it looks like a pretty mainstream idea the minis quirky blend of attributes the exteriors homage to the old "mr bean" mini the high tech go kart performance and the planet friendly fuel economy hasnt changed but the environment around it has small car sales by one count hit vehicles in up from the year before while theres still nothing quite like the mini shoppers fancying a car compact enough to scoot into tight city parking spaces while sipping instead of chugging fuel are getting spoiled for choices this week for example toyotas scion brand will unveil a second generation of its scion xb the toaster profiled mini wagon that has become a style icon of sorts in its own right next year daimlerchrysler ags smart micro car unit will bring to the u s its teeny fortwo perhaps you remember it from the movie version of "the davinci code " a few years ago selling a car the size of a fortwo in the u s seemed like madness which is why daimlerchrysler didnt bother the minis success in the u s evidently prompted a rethink in stuttgart bmws ambitions for mini have grown as well jim mcdowell head of mini usa says that over the next five years the mini family of cars could expand to include four or five body styles with a new model launching every year over that period next year for instance mini is expected to introduce the production version of a wagon often called the traveller its been previewing at auto shows mini has expanded production capacity at its british plant by to cars a year mr mcdowell while betraying no concrete information observes that back in the days of the original mini not all minis were made in britain mini isnt limited to one factory by any sort of tradition or brand concern mr mcdowell is planning to expand minis u s dealer network by two to three stores per year each year for the next four years mini even has a store in omaha neb whod a thunk that five years ago minis rise highlights a shift in the conversation that americans are having about cars some americans at least after more than a decade of rewarding car makers for delivering ever more horsepower and weight americans are fretting over the recent united nations report warning that human beings are indeed altering the planets climate in potentially catastrophic ways they are having millions of anxious conversations about the war in iraq the nations "addiction to oil " or exxon mobils profits advocates of less petroleum consumption take heart that sales of midsized truck frame sport utility vehicles such as the ford explorer which displaced more efficient sedans throughout the s took a pounding during as gas prices gyrated true since gas prices have settled back closer to &# a gallon in many parts of the country there are signs that demand and pricing for traditional suvs such as the chevy tahoe or ford expedition has stabilized the power information network which harvests pricing data from thousands of dealerships says that the average price paid for a large suv in january was &# up from &# in august but this doesnt mean old fashioned suvs are going to bounce back to the levels of three or four years ago by its likely that the ford explorer once the best selling suv on the planet will be transformed into a car like crossover even still this successor vehicle will likely dwarf a mini general motors has decided not to invest in a successor to its rival line of truck frame mid sized suvs which includes the chevy trailblazer instead gm is pushing its new lineup of large crossover wagons such as the buick enclave saturn outlook and gmc acadia when it comes to basic values how to balance size versus fuel efficiency versus safety america is not one nation it is many and it will stay that way for a while cars like the mini represent a bet that for a meaningful probably elite class of consumers small is beautiful its also a cultural "hi" sign by which those who share a certain set of values can recognize each other you might call these values "european " since in europe where gas prices are about triple u s levels mass market cars tend to put fuel and space efficiency first but for americans minis marketing still stresses handling performance and fun its not happenstance that mini decided to hold part of its press preview at a race track most of the money spent to redesign the second generation mini was invested under the skin to improve pedestrian crash safety and more importantly upgrade the cars ride the biggest cosmetic change is the look of the dashboard where the distinctive center stack under the unique big round speedometer dial is narrower the better to provide room for passengers knees the base engine gets a modest horsepower boost to horsepower from the cooper s gets a similarly demur bump to horsepower from horsepower in the outgoing car prices are up a bit too the base mini cooper will start at &# up &# when it goes on sale later this month the turbocharged cooper s will start at &# up &# on the well lit desert highways around phoenix a base cooper with the new six speed manual transmission is nimble but not as harsh on the bum its still "go kart like " compared to a toyota camry or an suv but bmw engineers have dialed in a bit less kart and a bit more comfort the new mini is designed to get miles per gallon city miles per gallon highway while the s model is designed to deliver city highway mini is stressing the safety improvements of its next generation car the new mini will come with six airbags stability control traction control and a feature called "brake assistant" that automatically builds up brake pressure when the car senses a panic stop in the making as impressive as the technology of the mini is the fact remains that no driver of such a car will want to hit a chevy tahoe it will be a good deal better for a mini motorist to use the cars nimble handling and lightning reflexes to avoid tangling with the big brutes of americas roads send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
