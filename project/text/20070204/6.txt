marketwatch that old ticket sold for how much to all of those lucky enough to score a ticket to super bowl xli a word of advice dont bend the corners "i think a lot of people dont realize how valuable the tickets are from the super bowl " said joe orlando president of psa dna authentication services the autograph and memorabilia authentication division of newport beach calif based collectors universe some collectors make it their goal to acquire one ticket from every super bowl game and theyll pay top dollar to complete the set for example in a full ticket from the super bowl graded in quality out of a maximum sold for &# while a super bowl ticket graded went for &# mr orlando says creases tears and bent corners will affect a tickets grade its worth mentioning that in the past most tickets were torn at the gate so the full untorn tickets would sell for a premium mr orlando says but the stubs are worth something as well as are todays tickets which often are scanned at the gate and not torn "of course theres the old saying in our business collectibles are worth what someone is willing to pay for them " he says in some cases thats quite a lot baseball card collectors may have thrived for decades but when "a tremendous number" of sports cards began being produced in the early s some collectors shifted to acquiring different pieces of memorabilia instead says margaret olsen an accredited senior appraiser with the american society of appraisers ms olsen is also president of westminster appraisal &amp consultation in westminster colo specializing in sports memorabilia and currency the increase in online auctions fueled the popularity of hiring third party sources to evaluate collectors items mr orlando says the fbi sting "operation bullpen" in the s aimed at cracking down on forged autographs also increased awareness of fraud ms olsen adds "some people will ask me to do an appraisal in advance of purchasing an item " she says a safeguard that may be cost effective on some of the more significant pieces of sports memorabilia "some people will consult with us before they sell an item " and will also ask for help in finding the right market in which to sell the piece she adds once ms olsen appraised a pair of new york yankees baseball pants that were worn during road games by lou gehrig they were handed down to a player on a barnstorming baseball team of the day and the players family held onto the famous uniform piece at the time barnstorming teams often took hand me downs from the major leagues ms olsen says the fair market value of the flannel baseball pants was approximately &# she says had they been pants gehrig wore at home games the value would have been higher had the pants been a jersey instead the value would have risen to about &# a variety of considerations go into evaluating a piece of sports memorabilia "one of the most important things to learn about an item is the history how did a person obtain it " ms olsen says "theres a tremendous amount of fraud that exists " she says and the fewer intermediate stops an item has the more certain one can be that its authentic the condition of an item as well as the price that comparable items are able to fetch in the market also are important in estimating an items value "condition is everything " says brian marren vice president of acquisitions for mastro auctions a burr ridge ill based company that holds auction sales of sports memorabilia and other historical items the companys april auction will feature a wilt chamberlain game jersey from his college days at the university of kansas the jersey could sell for &# to &# mr marren says the career of the player and the success of the team or the importance that an item has in a big game also affect value for that reason super bowl rings and other championship rings are often sought after collectibles and game winning balls attract high bidders people want to be associated with winners and a winning teams key players ms olsen says "if you had the quarterback super bowl ring instead of the punter no offense to the punter " that would be more valuable she says if an item can be linked to an important event in sports history that item is all the more valuable the full uniform gehrig wore during his historic farewell speech for example was once sold for &# ms olsen says and the ball mark mcgwire hit for his th home run in went for &# million at one time however because the home run record has been broken and suspicions of steroid use clouded mcgwires achievement it is likely that the ball wouldnt bring that amount today she adds to keep track of the balls used in important super bowl plays psa dna tags more than footballs for the nfl prior to the game mr orlando says nfl representatives track each ball so it can be linked to a particular play and be auctioned off for charity afterward and sometimes an item has an "added characteristic of value " ms olsen points out such as the super bowl ring of former chicago bears player william "the refrigerator" perry that perrys size ring is the largest in super bowl history gives it a touch of added value should it ever be up for sale she says
