real time in search of serendipity can online papers recreate a joy of print you bet in fact they already do online newspapers draw their share of complaints and in years in the online newspaper business i think ive heard them all i hate the blinking ads reading on a screen is cold i cant take the paper with me it wont fold for easy reading on the bus to all of the above i say "fair enough " ive switched irritably to "print view" to read a story without multiple clicks taken the newspaper to bed instead of a laptop and would much rather get on the subway with a few carefully chosen sections or a rolled up magazine instead of printouts theres one common complaint i dont buy however and thats that an online newspaper cant possibly replicate the experience of paging through a traditional paper and having your eye alight on a story you wouldnt normally have read the shorthand for this is "serendipity " and mourning its loss struggling to recreate it or steadfastly defending it has become a ritual at every newspaper trying to navigate the wrenching transition between the print and online worlds but heres the thing serendipity isnt lost online in fact many newspapers desperate to recreate it dont realize theyve already done so this not so secret weapon its variously called most popular or most viewed most popular is little more than a simple list of the stories getting the most page views or being emailed to others most frequently newspapers typically run it on their front pages on individual stories or in both places youll find it on the online journals home page and over there on the right for many people who grew up with a print newspaper including this columnist the act of reading one long ago became a mixture of routine and ritual and as such it can summon up some surprisingly deep emotions ones that an online newspaper has trouble competing with most couples will happily tell you their carefully honed strategy for divvying up the sunday paper someone who waxes rhapsodic about his order for reading browser favorites will probably make you back away quietly but try to set aside associations with cherished or merely comfortable morning routines for a moment lets break down how serendipity works in a print newspaper in print its a byproduct of page layout of scanning past ads for watches and jewelry for articles you might not expect and our own rituals may actually limit serendipity if there are sections of the paper you throw away or get to only if you have time youre not going to find any hidden gems inside where print serendipity is derived from top down decisions electronic serendipity is bottom up it comes not from editors but from readers who "vote" by reading stories emailing them and blogging about them that in itself doesnt make it better or preferable popularity is no guarantee that somethings worthwhile or for that matter that it isnt and the ceaseless flood of information on the net has made filters and editors more valuable rather than less but most popular stems this tide by narrowing the selection to a single newspapers recent stories as chosen by readers of that paper a group that readers presumably identify with and regard with at least some degree of trust if most popular is so valuable why dont newspapers and readers take more notice of it on the newspaper side i think its because papers think so hard about how to organize and channel their sites as they should that they risk neglecting opportunities to let readers do the job for them organizing home pages and site navigation feels high minded adding a box of automatic links that seems designed to appeal to voyeurism doesnt for readers part of the problem is our misgivings about recommendation engines we get impatient with recommendation engines that just serve up obvious variants of things were already buying or looking at or misfire because they dont know why were buying or looking at something a purchase thats a gift for a child for instance though see this june column for reasons why such engines are better at what they do than we give them credit for done properly most popular avoids these obstacles to serendipity it does one simple thing it tells you what stories other readers of this paper read most as such its a goldilocks path through the paper turning up results that are neither too fine grained which is why variants such as "readers who read this story also read" and "most popular in this section" dont deliver serendipity nor too general which is why serendipity eludes traffic based searches of the overall web or blogs not to mention newspaper home pages most emailed which some papers show instead of most popular is a rather different animal in an interesting way its list of top stories often includes more "news you can use" stories that people share as a way of offering advice whether its tips for getting into college a health warning or commentary readers think will change somebodys mind at least at the online journal many days most emailed and most popular are quite different lists most emailed offers serendipity but not as much of it as most popular does i maintain that when presented properly most popular does a better job of delivering serendipity than scanning the print paper most popular takes in the entire paper not just stories in the sections you usually read it offers you a second chance at intriguing stories from a day or two earlier as well as ones that blogs and emails have made part of a larger cultural conversation by casting a net thats wide but not too wide it even helps newspapers counteract one of the internets inarguable downsides the way it helps people herd themselves into little box canyons of their own ideology and interests or maybe its just that im a sucker for it when a link leads me to a newspaper article ive learned the hard way to avert my eyes from the most popular box because i know something in it will make me curious maybe that something is how they spell out go bears on the side of chicagos cna center chicago tribune or the story of nasas missing space tapes washington post and a serendipity two for one since reading it reminded me that id put aside an issue of "wired" containing another account of that tale or an academic furor over criticism of israel by liberal jews new york times theres my own papers explanation of how too much frugality can hurt your credit score and how wal mart gets a tax break by paying rent to itself or a heartbreaking story of quilts made for wounded u s soldiers washington post or how about a strange tale of a wine theft in silicon valley new york times i found all those stories last week through most popular left to my normal rounds i might have found one or two of them but most would have gone unseen and i couldnt have then recommended them to others or emailed them around a virtuous circle of serendipity that benefits readers writers and newspapers alike this isnt to say that online newspapers are perfect im still not interested in taking print outs on the subway or spending sunday afternoon sprawled on the couch with a warm laptop but as newspaper readers we shouldnt let our habits blind us to possibilities however unlikely they might seem just think about it a little module designed to generate page views by appealing to our voyeurism turns out to be the solution for one of online journalisms more vexing problems id call that a bit of serendipity how do you find serendipity online what works and what doesnt write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
