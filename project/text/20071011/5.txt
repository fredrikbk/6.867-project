bacteria factor in asthma in a discovery that may pave the way for more targeted asthma management doctors found that infants with certain bacteria in their airways have a higher risk of developing asthma and its symptoms in early childhood researchers report in todays new england journal of medicine that one month old babies whose airways contained any of three kinds of bacteria were about three times as likely to develop asthma by age five compared with babies without the bacteria the study also found the existence of the bacteria was a significant predictor of wheezing and other related symptoms importantly the association was only found when the bacteria were present at one month of age not when the babies reached one year reinforcing current thinking that environmental factors in pregnancy and the first weeks of life play an important role the study followed danish babies with asthmatic mothers a factor that puts children at higher risk for the disease asthma is a chronic lung disease that afflicts more than six million children and million adults in the u s according to the american lung association inflammation and the narrowing of airways can lead to wheezing chest tightness and breathing trouble asthma attacks can be fatal in the current study doctors sedated high risk but asymptomatic one month old babies and took samples of airway secretions from the region just above the larynx twenty one percent of the babies harbored at least one of the three kinds of bacteria those babies had nearly four times the risk of developing wheezing that required hospitalization the study found the babies with the bacteria had a chance of developing asthma by the age of five years old compared with just for the others these results can be interpreted in several ways says hans bisgaard the studys lead author a child genetically predisposed to asthma might be less able to fight off bacteria alternatively dr bisgaard says the bacterium itself could be initiating the inflammatory process that leads to asthma to test that hypothesis dr bisgaard a professor at the university of copenhagen is about to launch a new study to determine whether treating asthmatic pregnant women and their newborn babies with probiotics so called good bacteria might help lower the risk of developing childhood asthma treating newborns with antibiotics would be more complicated because of the drugs side effects he says an editorial accompanying the study doesnt support the theory that bacteria cause asthma its author erika von mutius a professor of pediatrics at the university of munich says she believes the researchers have uncovered "just an indicator of a developing disease " not "a causal factor " if that theory holds it could still help doctors devise more tailored prevention and treatment plans says dr bisgaard "you know your child is at higher risk and you can take precautions "
