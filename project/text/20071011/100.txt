poor but educated finally thank you for the heartening review of anthony t kronmans "educations end" bookshelf leisure &amp arts oct i have an undergraduate degree in philosophy and writing and a postgraduate degree in theology however i often lament that i went to school for the wrong reason i wanted to discover the meaning of life while i should have been preparing myself to find a job i spent my time and parents money studying subjects that thrilled me and challenged me regardless of whether they were scheduled for a m or on fridays and this education is without a doubt something for which i am superbly grateful now i just have to figure out how i will pay the rent but at least the books in the library are still free melissa bean towaco n j
