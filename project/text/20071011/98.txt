politics &amp economics ethanol industry is losing clout in congress as food prices climb the stalling ethanol industry wants congress to mandate greater use of the biofuel but many of the industrys former friends have turned against it amid soaring prices for corn and other grains congress gave a big boost to ethanol in when it mandated that oil refiners blend billion gallons of renewable fuels such as ethanol into the nations gasoline supply by the farm lobby was united behind ethanol as a way to strengthen rural economies environmental groups backed it as a way to fight global warming and lessen the nations dependence on foreign oil even the petroleum industry was supportive since then dozens of ethanol plants have sprouted around the country turning corn into fuel the rise of the industry has helped to boost grain prices and create jobs in farm states but ethanol production today is close to reaching the billion gallon level in the law oversupply has forced down prices and driven some ethanol producers into trouble producers and corn farmers are lobbying hard for congress to boost the requirement anew to ensure that demand can soak up the rising production without new legislation there will be a "natural barrier to growth in the industry " says eric washburn legislative counsel for the american coalition for ethanol a trade group based in sioux falls s d in june the senate passed a bill increasing the mandate for renewable fuels use to billion gallons by with billion gallons coming from corn based ethanol a house bill would leave the current goal in place lawmakers in both houses are preparing to work on reconciling the bills though the timing isnt clear opposition to the ethanol industrys goals has grown significantly stiffer the so called barnyard lobby representing the meat livestock and poultry industries says high corn prices are hurting its profits the price of corn based animal feed has increased about since according to the u s department of agriculture "our single biggest priority is for congress to reject a new renewable fuels mandate " says jesse sevcik vice president of legislative affairs at the american meat institute a meat and poultry trade association other groups that were originally sympathetic to ethanol are drifting away they fear that the fuels advantages are outweighed by the rise in corn prices which they say increases the cost of foods ranging from steak to cereal "many policy makers were seduced by ethanol " says cal dooley president of the grocery manufacturers association he opposes increasing federal support for ethanol the agriculture department says consumers can expect to pay as much as more for groceries and restaurant meals this year over last up from a rise the year before the renewable fuels association the washington based ethanol trade group disputes that ethanol is the chief culprit for rising food prices it says higher energy costs are more to blame the acting agriculture secretary chuck connor told the association last week that "clearly ethanol demand is having an impact" on food price inflation but the impact isnt as dire as some suggest the spreading coalition against new ethanol mandates includes the american petroleum institute representing the oil industry it says it supports ethanol but prefers a market driven approach rather than one driven by the government some petroleum refiners say ethanol prices are low enough now that they would consider buying the fuel on their own without mandates the institute is finding common ground with environmental groups that usually battle the oil industry some environmentalists say unchecked growth in ethanol production could lead to soil erosion and degradation of wildlife habitats as more land is turned over to corn production "weve certainly had discussions" with the oil lobby says jim presswood a lobbyist for the natural resources defense council mr presswood notes that his organization has also talked with food and livestock groups to search for common ground charles stenholm a former democratic congressman from texas who was influential in agriculture policy is now a lobbyist in washington his clients include pork dairy and oil interests according to lobbying records they all agree he says that "you need to let the market be the biggest determinant for ethanol " ethanol proponents say that isnt realistic for the short term most oil and gas pipelines arent designed to distribute ethanol gasoline stations have been slow to install ethanol storage tanks and so called e pumps which pump an ethanol blend instead of the more common mix of ethanol and gasoline matt hartwig spokesman for the renewable fuels association says ethanol is "still a young and developing industry " the government needs to keep supporting it he says if americans want to "sniff the dream" of commercializing cellulosic ethanol which can be made from materials including wood or switchgrass see related letter "letters to the editor ethanol meets the market" wsj october
