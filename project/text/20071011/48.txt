its fortunes "the road to recovery will be incremental step by step " he says "were not suddenly going to be back to where we were four or five years ago thats unrealistic " bps reputation was badly tarnished after the explosion and fire at a texas refinery in that killed people and an oil spill in alaska the same year more recently the oil major has been hit by holdups in commissioning
