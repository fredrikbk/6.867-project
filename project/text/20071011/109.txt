samsung suffers as gadget boom ages profit has been slipping as consumers postpone upgrades focus on price seoul south korea three years ago samsung electronics co was at the top of its game raking in huge profits from a wide range of digital products that were rocketing in sales it was the worlds top seller of televisions and the third largest in cellphones and it also made key components in them for competitors but the swift growth has passed the big profit margins on digital products have shrunk and the glitter is gone for samsung its stock is down this year if it reports a drop in third quarter profit tomorrow as analysts expect it would mark samsungs fourth consecutive quarterly decline one by one digital products that used to show double digit increases in sales every year are now seeing slower growth as consumers move on to their third fourth or later purchases of pcs cellphones and digital music players they have become more satisfied with features and performance so they are waiting longer to upgrade products and focus more on price when they do the industry as a whole can still find big growth opportunity for pcs cellphones and tvs in emerging markets but consumers in those places are even more concerned about price and the marketplaces there are becoming increasingly crowded with samsung industry analysts lately have focused on short term pressures in its memory chip business but says samsung investor relations chief chu woosik "we are really grappling with a challenge of a greater dimension " samsung is trying to adapt to this shift the company plans to increase investment in capacity to build higher margin products like color laser printers and more complicated computer chips on the low end the company is offering less expensive cellphones in emerging markets to boost unit sales samsung also says it is considering whether to trim jobs which in south korea can be a politically sensitive move should it decide to pursue cuts which would be bigger than the jobs it trimmed this summer it would disclose its plans in december or january the shifting marketplace for digital products is most visible in demand for semiconductors which are essential to the innards of nearly all these products sales of chips by revenue are expected to grow about this year down from last year according to isuppli a u s market research firm the biggest drop is in consumer electronics products where chip growth is expected to be about this year down from last year it can also be seen in the scramble at motorola inc which is rejiggering its cellphone lineup as industry growth slows to this year from in meanwhile price competition is intensifying for liquid crystal display and plasma tvs allowing little known upstarts like vizio inc to suddenly grab the leading share of the u s market for lcd tvs by emphasizing ultralow prices samsung is particularly vulnerable to this trend to many investors samsung "represents global technology " says analyst d j yook at deutsche bank in seoul "it has everything pcs cellphones tvs and all the components " samsungs profit has been under pressure since when it came in at a record &# billion but until recently many in the industry thought the lower profits were a result of a cyclical downturn in the chip and lcd businesses now analysts say it is becoming clearer that samsung has been hit by a broader industry shift this year samsungs profit is expected to be about &# billion down from &# billion last year chips samsungs biggest business are in their worst slump in several years the company makes chips for computer memory known as dram or dynamic random access memory and flash chips for digital storage and gizmos like apple inc s ipods known as nand chips part of the trouble is self inflicted though executives noticed a year ago that many consumer products with memory chips were experiencing slower growth they decided to spend more than originally planned for chip factory expansions lifting the years total to trillion won or &# billion investing in a downturn has paid off in the past for samsungs chip business by boosting capital spending and building factories when sales are slow samsung would give itself added capacity to grab market share and profits when the cycle turned upward but this time competitors did the same thing industry spending on new dram and nand factories jumped to &# billion this year from &# billion last year says nam hyung kim an analyst at isuppli as a result of the oversupply prices for memory chips have fallen much faster than expected this year samsungs chip operating profit is expected to remain sharply below year ago levels for the rest of the year there are some things samsung can do to improve sales even in products where growth is slowing for example while the company has long focused on high end phones in an effort to maintain an upscale image it started selling less expensive cellphones earlier this year in fast growing markets such as india china and brazil that has helped boost the companys cellphone unit sales by this year faster than forecast and more than twice the industrys growth rate meanwhile samsung is making its first major strategic changes since the asian financial crisis in the measures will expand samsungs investment in some promising products such as color laser printers and lower costs in others one of the thorniest steps is likely to be factory relocations and job cuts later this year in south korea where samsung is one of the biggest employers companies rarely lay off workers in the country because doing so is portrayed by politicians and the local media as a failure of corporate responsibility to society "theres a general sentiment that major companies should go out of their way to maintain employment " mr chu says other steps also pose risks samsungs push on printers for instance puts it more squarely into competition with hewlett packard co one of its biggest customers for memory chips and computer screen components samsung is focusing on the changeover in laser printing to color technology from black and white for consumers it is expanding its line of advanced corporate printers to eight models by the holiday season up from three at midyear none of these steps are likely to return the company to the heady growth and profits of its recent past or give a jolt to its stock price analysts say the best chance for that says mr yook of deutsche bank would be for samsung to double its cellphone profit margin now around to bring it closer to the level of industry leader nokia corp "well have to see if they can pull that off " he says
