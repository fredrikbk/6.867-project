boeing in embarrassing setback says dreamliner will be delayed boeing co reversed itself after weeks of promising its new widebody jet would be delivered on time saying the ambitious project now faces a delay of at least six months the setback for the dreamliner marks a blow for boeings plan to revamp how it builds airplanes by having suppliers take on a greater role in design and manufacturing executives were forced to apologize for breaking their commitments to customers they said the first airplane would be delivered in late november or early december of next year instead of may boeing shares fell the delay which boeing attributed to shortages of key materials and slow deliveries by suppliers damages the companys prestige and could hurt the bottom line if airlines cant receive their big orders on time and demand penalty payments the snafus are particularly embarrassing because boeing had picked up business from rival airbus after the european plane maker had to postpone its own highly anticipated new models "every one of boeings customers will be watching this program much more closely for signs of trouble " said john plueger president of leasing giant international lease finance corp a big boeing customer many airlines are relying on the for fleet expansion and now will have a tougher time expanding their schedules frequent fliers will be spending more time on aging jets as they await the new amenities airlines are planning to include in their dreamliners the delay irked the airlines that have flocked to buy the and poses the most serious setback for boeing chief executive jim mcnerney since he took the reins in mr mcnerney who cut his teeth in aviation as an executive at general electric co s jet engine business acknowledged the challenges but said "we remain confident in the design of the and in the fundamental innovation and technologies that underpin it " in planning for the boeing remade its production process to rely heavily on major suppliers as risk sharing partners in return for investing more upfront and taking on a share of the development costs suppliers have been given major sections of the airplane to build the wing sections are made in japan while factories in italy south carolina and wichita kan assemble the bulk of the fuselage the parts are flown aboard modified cargo planes to everett wash for final assembly boeing says that when the system is up and running it will eventually be able to snap together dreamliners in as little as three days in a manner not unlike how plastic model airplanes are assembled boeing officials say the system has reduced the companys upfront development costs by billions of dollars the downside they acknowledge is that boeing has less control over the day to day progress of the dreamliner program than it has had for any new airliner in its history boeings setback is something of a vindication for european rival airbus which has been pilloried for concealing manufacturing snafus that forced the giant a jetliner to be delayed by two years airbus is scheduled to deliver the first a next week to singapore airlines it is a double decker plane that can seat more than passengers and is designed for long routes boeing says the problems with the are different from those with the a because they dont point to a fundamental flaw in its design but rather involve difficulties in the supply chain airbuss production system for its new midsize a which will compete with the dreamliner is modeled along the same lines as boeings dreamliner plan because of the financial benefits amid airbuss problems with the a boeing made the dreamliner the hottest selling widebody jet in the world since boeing has received orders from airlines for the plane which will carry between and passengers the a which was delayed as airbus struggled with the a isnt expected to hit the market until or later boeing is advertising the dreamliner as more fuel efficient and easier to maintain it says passengers will benefit too because the airplane is being built largely of carbon fiber composites which are stronger than aluminum the windows on the will be larger than on conventional jetliners also since composites dont corrode airlines will be able to raise the humidity of cabin air and make long flights more comfortable boeing says boeing said it isnt changing financial guidance and still expects to deliver airplanes by the end of just three shy of its earlier projection about customers will be affected by the delays starting with japans all nippon airways which was scheduled to get the first dreamliner ana said in a statement that officials "regret that the delivery of the will be delayed and we hope to keep the impact of the delay to a minimum " ana plans to use the dreamliner to replace its fleet of older boeing s mr plueger of ilfc which is a unit of american international group inc said boeings delay "causes you to ratchet up a notch your healthy skepticism " ilfc is the largest customer for the with airplanes on order mr plueger said ilfc which has been a launch customer on virtually all of boeings and airbuss major new airplanes decided early on not to take delivery until early because of concerns about delays boeings announcement came as little surprise to many in the aerospace industry since summer the industry has been beset by a shortage in titanium and aluminum fasteners used to hold airplanes together boeings problems were exacerbated because suppliers are working with composite materials instead of the more familiar aluminum boeing first announced that the dreamliner program was running behind schedule on sept but officials said then they still thought they could deliver the first airplanes on time officials said yesterday that the first dreamliner which was covered in a shiny coat and unveiled on july before a crowd of more than invited guests was in shambles beneath the surface the plane held together by thousands of temporary fasteners had to be largely disassembled after the ceremonies suppliers hadnt preinstalled wiring or other major components needed to make the system work smoothly once engineers got inside it became evident that it would take more time to put the plane back together than anticipated mr mcnerney said boeing officials decided to pull the plug on the old delivery schedule earlier this week during a regularly scheduled meeting to discuss the airplanes progress from the outset boeing has said the new supplier system adds a certain amount of risk for more than a year teams of boeing experts have lived on the road troubleshooting problems at farflung factories and making sure they have enough raw materials to do their work yesterday mr mcnerney said the delays reflected a "slowing up in the supply chain rather than a fatal flaw in the supply chain " in some cases such as with a factory that was erected in charleston s c by italys alenia aeronautica spa and vought aircraft industries inc of dallas relatively inexperienced workers were hired from the local area to begin building an airplane that is technically more advanced than any commercial airplane in history "if theres a lesson learned youd start earlier and do a little more training with our people there " said scott carson chief executive of boeings commercial airplanes unit mr carson said there are still "growing pains at the front end" of the program a vought spokeswoman declined to discuss specifics of the companys work for boeing she said vought can meet boeings new schedule yesterday boeing officials said they expect to have about dreamliners completed and on the ramp when the federal aviation administration declares the airplane ready for delivery the maiden flight originally scheduled for two months ago will wait until the spring of next year unlike the previous schedule mr carson said the new delivery schedule has a margin built in for unexpected problems that might arise during flight testing which gives boeing "much more confidence in our ability to deliver this plane" on time
