the daily fix baseball returns with an nlcs featuring young exciting teams online edition these last two october days have felt empty if youre a baseball fan the one sided first round of the playoffs three sweeps and a victory left the four remaining teams idle on tuesday and wednesday on the colorado rockies blog up in the rockies tom stephenson is irked that major league baseball has added more dead time to this falls schedule "ive always liked baseballs postseason because its relatively short " mr stephenson writes "the nfl has those pointless two weeks between the conference championship games and the super bowl the nba playoffs with teams and seven games in each series began this year on april and ended june baseball unfortunately seems to be going the way of the other pro sports " of course things could be worse for mr stephenson the playoffs could be resuming without the rockies instead the team that has lost just one of its last games begins the nl championship series tonight in arizona against the diamondbacks both teams are oddly constructed they have better pitching than hitting much better in the d backs case yet play in two of the most hitter friendly ballparks in the majors the new york suns tim marchman breaks down the numbers and explains why arizona may have the edge in the best of seven series then he steps back to explain why this series should be simultaneously irrelevant and thrilling "because the al is so much stronger than the nl right now this series just doesnt have the weight the nlcs ought to have " mr marchman writes "both of these teams are much much weaker than the boston red sox and cleveland indians and a world series classic is not in the making that doesnt mean though that this series wont be enormously entertaining both teams were built the right way around homegrown prospects and theyre young between them they have three regulars two starting pitchers and one key reliever over these teams are as hungry and exuberant as any youll ever see playing this late in the year " the san francisco chronicles john shea takes a closer look at how the d backs and rockies have thrived with their homegrown prospects "both the diamondbacks and rockies havent been afraid to exercise patience and live with the growing pains " mr shea writes todd helton the expensive outlier on the rockies blueprint has become a focal point in the colorado clubhouse the year veteran is one of the best hitters of his generation albeit with some help from the thin air at coors field and yet had never played in the postseason until last week "all helton has done in his seasons with the rockies is hit " jeff passan writes on yahoo sports "pull it slice it poke it gap it pummel it the ball tends to be no match for heltons left handed swing pretty more in its efficiency than in the fashion of will clark or rafael palmeiro whose swings looked like they were diagrammed by da vinci problem was few noticed heltons numbers his career batting average ranks second among active players and st overall since because the rockies never gave good reason " in arizona the fans have been slow to warm up to their surprise nl contenders ben shpigel notes in the new york times that unsold tickets remained for the two opening games at chase field after the middle three games in denver were quickly sold out the d backs average home attendance this year ranked th of major league teams and colorado reliever brian fuentes said the din at chase field cant compare to coors "those words could be mistaken for the opening salvo in a burgeoning rivalry " mr shpigel writes "the natural elements are there they play or times every season train every spring in tucson and each seems built to contend for years the rockies won of their meetings this season " arizona players could nudge that rivalry forward by wearing black uniform tops tonight which would force the rockies to doff theirs fully aware that the ebon unis have been good luck totems in their recent run arizona republic columnist bob young goes so far as to suggest that uniform chicanery to arizona pitcher brandon webb and then reviews the history of other teams that rose or fell in supposed tandem with their sartorial choices the alcs begins tomorrow and the fix will have a preview also remember to enter the fixs postseason baseball contest before the first pitch of arizona colorado tonight and let us know if youre the right fan to pen an ode to your team details in box at left the nfl season is five games old and the miami dolphins are already five games back in the afc east south florida sun sentinel columnist ethan j skolnick offers "a step program to survive long weekends until the regular season ends " for two of those weekends his suggestion is to watch a high school football game in ohio "with the dolphins across the pond you check out the ohio prep powers at fawcett stadium " mr skolnick writes "tour the other landmark on the premises the pro football hall of fame there you can be reminded of a day when dolphins busts referred to carved likenesses of dan marino jim langer dwight stephenson and paul warfield not draft picks like billy milner jamar fletcher john avery and eddie moore " while dolphins players consider the prep school stars and try to forget the draft busts they can stop to consider how football potential is an elusive quantity not always fulfilled of four ballard high teammates who four years ago led their seattle high school to the state title game three are out of college and the fourth is third on the depth chart at his school "a storybook season four teenagers with so much promise how could it go awry " asks jon naito in the seattle post intelligencer then he checks in with the quartet to seek answers to that question five years ago sirlee monzey was a year old phenomenon of midget football the best many football observers in the washington d c area had ever seen after injuries and several transfers hes at his fourth high school and living up to his potential like michael lewis in "the blind side " washington city paper columnist dave mckenna enhances his profile of a young football prodigy by including the broader context "even without the silly proposal to allow kids a fifth year to play high school sports the d c public prep league has bizarre eligibility rules that actually encourage athletic recruiting " mr mckenna writes "monzey had enrolled at kennedy high school in silver spring for his senior year but he wasnt on the football team kennedy head coach gunnard twyner says monzey was in good academic standing but was declared athletically ineligible to play at that school by montgomery county officials he says he decided to transfer to his fourth school after the season kicked off because coaches from coolidge called me up and said hed be welcome to play for them " as newspapers fill up with brief announcements of would be nba players released from preseason camps the chicago tribunes k c johnson pauses to examine short term bull joseph blairs unusual trip "you wont find many nba rookies or veterans for that matter who call khalil gibran their favorite author by far and spend pregame time reading sidney poitiers spiritual autobiography the measure of a man " mr johnson writes "blair wasnt your typical nba rookie " mr johnson adds "blair has lived a nomadic life of overseas basketball opportunities and self discovery blair a houston native has played in france greece italy and turkey and twice for the harlem globetrotters " now he tells mr johnson "my goal right now is to evolve gracefully into being an ex basketball player " tip of the fix cap to readers ruth brandes christopher dickson and don hartline found a good column from the world of sports dont keep
