operation also any treatment an undetected thief receives in your name eats into your lifetime maximum benefits beware of "free" medical services or treatments sometimes illicit entities use the lure of free services to obtain patient names and insurance information for use in submitting fraudulent claims always question what is being offered and who is paying the cost if you arent satisfied with
