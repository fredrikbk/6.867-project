hedge funds from europe take a crack at self policing attempting to head off calls for greater regulation a group of europes largest hedge fund managers yesterday proposed ways to make the secretive industry more transparent fund managers in london drafted a proposed code of behavior that would give investors and banks more information about the risks hedge funds take and how they value their assets the code would require funds to disclose the full stakes they own in companies including positions held through derivatives funds would be required to disclose in more detail and follow best practice guidelines governing operating practices such as their risk management and governance the effort intended as a framework for voluntary global standards for an industry that is lightly regulated in some places is being closely watched in the u s the u s treasury has two advisory groups examining the issue and they have been in contact with the united kingdom throughout their efforts the hedge fund working group based in london counts industry leaders such as marshall wace llp glg partners lp and man group plc among its members the group will now solicit feedback from other u k hedge funds which manage around of europes hedge fund cash as well as banks investors and others stanley fink deputy chairman of man group said that while it is "pretty difficult to coerce" hedge funds to do anything peer pressure as other funds sign up and investor demands may persuade other funds to adopt the code hedge funds own investors which are increasingly large institutions with their own strong governance codes could also prompt the funds to adopt the code mr fink said regulating hedge funds has become a big political issue particularly in europe where activist funds have played key roles in prompting or blocking major corporate takeovers in recent years voluntary only standards likely wont go far enough for some politicians and they are expected to continue calling for statutory regulation some observers consider hedge funds a potential risk to financial stability for reasons such as the debt they often take on to make investments as well as a propensity to make the same bets such situations can exacerbate volatility when markets turn sour and hedge funds unwind their positions critics also focus on hedge funds lack of transparency and their use of derivatives and trades which can make it hard to quantify exactly what sorts of risk they represent until its too late in europe they have also been faulted for harboring a short term focus with little interest in the longer term health of a company or economy hedge funds largely reject the criticisms saying they are an increasingly important part of financial markets in that they often provide investment and innovation where other funds cant yet poul nyrup rasmussen president of the european socialist party at the european union parliament says "voluntary standards are not enough what we need now is for regulators and policy makers to independently assess the regulation of hedge funds " german officials using their chairmanship of the group of eight nations this year have been particularly aggressive in pushing for more disclosure of hedge fund portfolios or a ratings system like that for corporate debt ulrike abratis spokeswoman for the german federal ministry of finance said the government viewed yesterdays report as " welcomed" and "a big step forward " "a lot of issues of concern that have been raised by politicians have been addressed head on here " said andrew large a former bank of england deputy governor and chairman of the london group trade groups have tried to implement voluntary standards on hedge funds with limited success this time though some of the worlds largest hedge funds are devising and backing the effort increasing the likelihood that the standards will be adopted when the final report comes out early next year the blowup of two bear stearns cos hedge funds this year and high profile losses during the credit market turmoil in july and august underscored how little hedge funds disclose about their investments in complex global markets over time the code will be viewed as part of a larger effort by the industry "saying to the wider world hedge funds are serious asset management businesses not cowboys " said jacob schmidt chief executive of hedge fund research firm schmidt research partners eric mindich who runs new york hedge fund eton park capital management and is chairman of the u s hedge fund advisory group created last month by the presidents working group on financial markets said he is eager to look at the u k s proposals "anytime a group of industry leaders steps up and takes on responsibility to help advance best practices its of service and benefit to the marketplace " mr mindich met recently with mr large his counterpart at the london group mr mindichs hedge fund group has met once and has held numerous teleconferences with the goal of providing recommendations to the presidents working group by years end britains market regulator the financial services authority encouraged the industry to produce standards and the group based its code heavily on the fsas regulatory principles fsa chief executive hector sants in an email said he welcomed the groups work and in particular the reports "focus on issues such as transparency and valuation " the u s effort differs in some respects the u s groups include an investors group in addition to a hedge fund managers group because the treasury department wants to ensure investors get clear guidance "treasury is pleased with the u k managers efforts " said jennifer zuccarelli a u s treasury department spokeswoman she noted the work of the advisory groups in the u s "will complement the work in the u k " the proposed code would establish principles of behavior as well as operating standards hedge funds would be required to disclose their full holdings of companies where they agitate for change companies that have been the target of activist funds have complained activist investors hide the true extent of their holdings by methods such as buying with derivatives "we would be big backers of this code it would make our life much easier " said jan frogg head of the alternative asset management group at swiss private bank union bancaire privee which invests &# billion in hedge funds mr frogg said funds will want to make sure they arent adopting behavior that could hurt their investing strategies "there are a lot of smaller funds who probably will have to be convinced they have to join this and some who wont have the resources to implement it " corrections &amp amplifications an article yesterday about european hedge funds
