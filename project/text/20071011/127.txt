the price of human cargo the slave ship by marcus rediker viking &# pages during a voyage from west africa to jamaica capt luke collingwood commanding a ship named the zong faced a conundrum after months at sea epidemic dysentery had already killed seven of his crewmen and of the captive slaves packed below deck scores more slaves were ill collingwood knew that if they died from illness the loss would fall on the vessels owners but if he treated them as damaged cargo and discarded them as he would spoiled sugar or rum the loss could be construed as a legal jettison and be covered by insurance collingwood ordered his remaining crew to throw the sick slaves overboard the first day and more soon after ten more slaves committed suicide by leaping into the sea the ships owners later claimed gbp insurance money for each slave "lost " the murder of more than slaves aboard the zong was "perhaps the most spectacular atrocity in the history of the slave trade " marcus rediker writes in "the slave ship " but it was unique less in kind than in degree from the late th century through the th more than million africans were transported to the americas as slaves by some estimates a million and a half died en route mr redikers provocative and briny account chronicles what he calls the "golden age" of the slave trade from to when at any given time hundreds of slavers cruised the african coast between gambia and angola trading firearms textiles metalware brandy and other goods for human cargo at first european slave traders simply stepped into "preexisting circuits of exchange" with african chieftains and entrepreneurs over time though the demand for vast numbers of slaves in the americas transformed slave hunting into a major west african industry slave ships were thus an essential part of one of the first truly global industries and the development of modern capitalism the captain of a slave ship once arrived on the african coast shopped for healthy young people between the ages of and usually at a ratio of two males for each female many were soldiers captured in war or sold into slavery as punishment for crimes but untold numbers were simply kidnapped from their homes by raiders and had often been sold several times over before they reached white traders on the coast although trading was for the most part carried on with well established african middlemen fraud was routine on both sides when one captain accused a black trader of malpractice the african replied "what do you think i am a white man " slave ships or "guineamen " as they were called came in a variety of types sloops schooners brigs barks snauws or snows they ranged in size from as little as ten tons to behemoths of hundreds of tons capable of accommodating as many as slaves and sailors the slave ship itself mr rediker observes was "a strange and potent combination of war machine mobile prison and factory " the conditions onboard were often unspeakable captives lay chained next to each other in dark and fetid compartments dense with the reek of sweat and human waste "when stowed " recorded one officer "there was not enough room to put down the point of a stick between one and another " violence erupted among captives belonging to hostile tribes women were sexual prey for officers and men alike desperate rebellions were common and savagely punished diseases raged through masses of captives already debilitated by abuse bad food and despair "the deck was covered with blood and mucus " wrote a ships doctor alexander falconbridge who provided eyewitness evidence for abolitionist reformers "and approached nearer to the resemblance of a slaughter house than anything i can compare it to " mortality among captives on many ships often surpassed the slave trade also had a ravaging effect on the souls of the captors "a savageness of spirit not easily conceived infuses itself into those who exercise power on board an african slave ship " remembered john newton a reformed captain who later composed the hymn "amazing grace " so pervasive was violence that it tended to "efface moral sense to rob the heart of every gentle and human disposition and to harden it like steel against all impressions of sensibility " although wages were somewhat higher on slave ships the death rate among seaman was almost as high as it was among their captives sometimes entire crews were carried off by fevers while those who survived were left ruined by illness or parasites such as the horrible "guinea worm " which burrowed beneath the skin and grew to enormous size if the risks were great so were the profits investors could generally count on returns of between and a captain could expect to earn the equivalent of &# in todays currency drawing on fees commissions and the "privilege slaves" that the shipowners commonly granted him from the cargo some captains earned even more despite losing sailors and slaves during one voyage capt james penny earned roughly the modern equivalent of &# "the slaver is a ghost ship sailing on the edges of modern consciousness " mr rediker writes its story is not a pretty one but it is no less gripping for its ugliness mr redikers greatest achievement has been to people the hellish world of the guineamen with the slave traders and their captives with captains and sailors men and women africans and europeans many of whom he allows to speak to us in their own self satisfied guilt ridden or agonized words in this book the ghosts all have their say mr bordewich is the author of "bound for canaan the epic story of the underground railroad americas first civil rights movement "
