the morning brief a bad political week for rationalizations online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here this week has produced a particularly conspicuous trend of reality clashing with the rationalizations often needed to grease the wheels of policy and geopolitics take yesterdays ruling by a federal district court judge in san francisco which set at odds two concerns voiced by almost all republican presidential candidates at a debate the night before alleged overregulation of american business and the need to crack down on illegal immigration in sympathy with the latter the bush administration announced plans to punish companies that dont fire workers whose social security numbers dont match the records at the social security administration the aim was to weed out unauthorized workers by giving employers days to fire any whose names provoked a "no match" letter but judge charles breyer issued a preliminary injunction blocking the program saying it would do "irreparable harm to innocent workers and employers " as the los angeles times reports the homeland security department program which threatened to force the firing of as many as million workers was the centerpiece of president bushs effort to re energize a fight against illegal immigration after the senate rejected a wider policy overhaul he backed "but the court ruling sought by major american labor business and farm organizations highlighted the chasm that the issue has opened between the republican party and its traditional business allies " the washington post says "the case also called attention to the gulf between washington rhetoric about the need to curtail illegal immigration and the economic reality that many u s employers rely on illegal labor as well as to the governments inability for nearly three decades to develop adequate tools for identifying undocumented workers " on another legal front the bush administration yesterday found itself before the supreme court arguing in support of the international court of justice a body it hasnt always favored in the past the case concerns mexican nationals convicted of crimes in texas courts and in violation of an international treaty not told after their arrest that they had the right to seek legal assistance from the mexican consulate the white house wants the treaty enforced and the cases re opened while a texas state appeals court says the president has no right to make the state do so among the oddities in the case with a hearing that exceeded the usual hour by minutes and featured questions from the justices were "the state of texas thumbing its nose at its favorite son" and human rights groups applauding the presidents defense of a convicted murderer legal times notes the conservative justices also seemed disinclined this time to support the white house which the wall street journal reports had been divided over which way to go "but with the u s under criticism abroad for its perceived disregard of international obligations secretary of state condoleezza rice persuaded the president" to back the world court across the street on capitol hill the house foreign relations committee passed a nonbinding measure condemning the world war i era killings of armenians in turkey as an act of genocide the deaths of as many as million people between and amid the crumbling of the ottoman empire have largely been attributed by historians to turkish forces or to the harsh conditions the armenians were exposed to by forced deportations as the l a times notes but it is probably the touchiest historical issue for the turkish nation that arose out of the empires wake and ankara has fiercely opposed other countrys official efforts to accuse it of genocide which is why the bush administration which badly needs turkey in a region where other friendships have frayed implored the house to leave the issue alone "we all deeply regret the tragic suffering of the armenian people that began in " mr bush said in remarks that reflect official american policy as the new york times notes but "this resolution is not the right response to these historic mass killings and its passage would do great harm to our relations with a key ally in nato and in the global war on terror " as it happens the resolution comes as turkey is preparing to send troops and tanks over the border into iraqi kurdistan in response to attacks from kurdish rebels as the times of london reports and that risks a confrontation with iraqs kurds who are the most reliable u s allies in that country a strike and then a deal at chrysler the united auto workers members went ahead and staged a strike at chrysler yesterday morning but not for very long and at the end of the afternoon the two sides emerged with a new contract apparently modeled on the ambitiously transformational pact the uaw reached with gm people familiar with the matter tell the wall street journal that chrysler too will create a multibillion dollar trust fund in order to get its retiree health care costs off its books and that it won the right to hire new workers at lower wages and with different benefit packages than those of current chrysler employees according to the detroit news the uaw obtained job security for its rank and file workers at chrysler though the details on these guarantees arent clear people familiar with gms deal tell the journal that buried in its uaw deal are pension and benefits changes affecting new employees that will make their compensation "closely match those offered in the u s by toyota motor corp and other japanese rivals " whether chrysler wrung the same changes from uaw also was unclear a pre agreement strike at gm lasted just a couple days and the walk out at chrysler was in effect for about six hours so the detroit free press asks why go through the drama in the first place free press columnist tom walsh argues it was inevitable uaw president ron gettelfinger "is on the verge of doing something so historic forging the most important uaw contracts since the gm sit down strikes of that he felt compelled to deploy the biggest weapon in his arsenal the strike to make it happen " mr walsh says "he called strikes to squeeze every last penny and every possible promise of a job from the companies in return for the uaw agreeing to major cost saving measures most importantly a union run trust fund to handle future health care costs for retirees " now the negotiating process and potential strike threats move over to the last of detroits big three ford nobel for writer doris lessing the swedish academy today awarded the nobel prize in
