send in the attorneys tuesdays republican presidential debate offered little economic news but it did provide one revealing and dispiriting moment about modern political life that was mitt romneys reply to the question of whether hed have to ask congress for authorization to take military action against iran "you sit down with your attorneys and tell you what you have to do " said the former massachusetts governor "but obviously the president of the united states has to do whats in the best interest of the united states to protect against a potential threat the president did that as he was planning on moving into iraq and received the authorization of congress " asked immediately if president bush needed such authorization mr romney repeated that "you know were going to let the lawyers sort out what he needed to do and what he didnt need to do " egad call in the attorneys perhaps it is mr romneys experience in business that taught him to want lawyers at his elbow given that no ceo can survive without them these days or perhaps it is our hyper legalized politics with mr bush accused daily of "breaking the law" over mere policy disagreements but deferring to lawyers to tell a president when he can and cannot use force to defend the country is not the proper understanding of executive power under the constitution and it is dangerous if it is the first instinct of a commander in chief mr romney should have said that a presidents first duty is to do whatever it takes to protect the united states and that hed have the constitutional authority to use military force to do so as presidents from washington to teddy roosevelt to reagan have done but that of course he would want to consult with congress and win its support as time and circumstances allowed mr romney doesnt need a lawyer he needs to reread the federalist papers see related letter "letters to the editor mitt romney on lawyersand use of military force" wsj october see related letter "letters to the editor egad and gadzooks its one for the books" wsj october
