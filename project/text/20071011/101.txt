restoration job e e cummings and his works in paint the twin obsessions of e e cummings a benefit to celebrate and restore artwork of the famous poet suny brockports metrocenter rochester n y tomorrow go to www brockport edu cummings benefit for more information you have to go out of your way to get to brockport n y a pretty little victorian village west of rochester that had its moment in the sun before the civil war when the erie canal briefly ended there and canal boats loaded up on products like grain and cod liver oil yet a few enterprising brockporters are hoping that arts lovers will beat a path to their door this month to help them restore the works of the painter e e cummings which are torn dusty stained and otherwise in pitiful condition thats right the very same enduringly popular inventive bard of love sex rebellion and nature who ranks with the best of th century poets painted with paints as well as with verbal images arranged just so on a page cummingss paintings are largely forgotten but he considered himself just as talented a painter as a poet and worked hard at it especially on his early abstractions he made thousands of works "he painted every day and devoted more time to it than to his poems " says milton a cohen a humanities professor at the university of texas at dallas and author of "poet and the painter the aesthetics of e e cummings early work " how of those paintings ended up in disrepair at the state university of new york at brockport miles away literally and figuratively from cummingss bohemian life in greenwich village paris and new england is a tale that reveals much about his career the fame that shaped it art world fashions and of course money when cummings left harvard in the year old didnt know what direction his life would take soon he was in paris where he studied art seriously more so than writing according to cummings scholars in tune with trends there he mostly painted abstractions although "theres a series of watercolors in the s of a town in france pornic that are wonderful " says christopher sawyer laucanno one of cummingss biographers "they are very cezanne " back in the u s cummings regularly showed his work at the annual exhibition of the society of independent artists from until about unjuried it showcased thousands of works yet reviewers almost always singled out cummingss for a positive mention as late as prof cohen says cummings wrote to his father saying he considered himself primarily a painter aside from cezanne and early picasso he was influenced by joseph stella albert gleizes and early john marin scholars say literary success however soon claimed him in came the publication of "the enormous room" and in "tulips and chimneys " soon "he was in demand as a poet " says mr sawyer laucanno in he won the dial award which was created in by his friend scofield thayer who as the dials editor made the publication a must read for modernist literature cummings kept painting but around he began to abandon abstraction prof cohen says that cummings liked to paint spontaneously befitting his philosophy as a poet and so he was better at watercolors than at the more serious medium of oils "thats why he gave up abstractions because he labored at them " prof cohen says instead cummings tried out many styles and genres still lifes nudes portraits landscapes cityscapes interiors religious themes that change was a defining moment by the s america which had always looked to europe as the cultural light had produced painters like marsden hartley georgia okeeffe and arthur dove with a unique modern american style cummings missed it he knew people like alfred stieglitz but he no longer went to artists openings to see what his contemporaries were doing "he continued looking back at europe " mr sawyer laucanno says later he disliked abstract expressionism cummings knew that he had to develop an individual vision for his painting but he never did after the mid s he exhibited his paintings only sporadically and their quality varies considerably "you almost have to take it painting by painting " prof cohen says he calls some works "striking" especially abstractions like "noise gbp " and adds "if he had stayed in that work and exhibited it he would have made a name for himself as a painter " at least by the s cummings knew that he was far more original as a poet than a painter mr sawyer laucanno says and "he was moved in this direction because of that success " but renown didnt bring cummings money he never really "worked" in a job with little cash he painted on paper shirt cardboard and anything else he could find as well as on the occasional canvas "he wasnt thinking of the long term " prof cohen says "he never could support himself " he always depended on patrons and friends luckily for him at harvard he had befriended james sibley watson jr an heir to the western union fortune it was sibley watson who had actually purchased the dial after thayers initial &# investment giving cummings his main chance it was sibley watson who sent cummings money and with his wife hildegarde lassell watson bought his paintings it was sibley watson who settled in rochester in an elegant mansion that cummings frequented and it was sibley watson after hildegarde died who was moved in to give much of their cummings collection to nearby suny brockport over the years the works have gone on view a couple of times but mostly the college was ill equipped to handle them "none of the paintings have ever been kept in a climate controlled room " says frank short dean of brockports school of arts and performance "theyve been in a dark place with stable temperatures but its a closet " now theyre coming out brockport wants to show the works but they need restoring first for an estimated total of &# but having failed to procure help from the government dean short is turning to the people of upstate new york and perhaps beyond hes asking them to "adopt" a painting by paying for an individual restoration people can choose a work online www brockport edu cummings intro php or at a kickoff "gala" benefit tomorrow in brockports downtown rochester extension center are they worth it after all a few museums the whitney museum of american art and the metropolitan museum of art to name two own works by cummings that are never on view but both prof cohen and mr sawyer laucanno say brockports collection which includes such works as "noise #" and "surrealist landscape " is worth saving and showing "it represents the best individual collection of any of cummingss work because most of those paintings were given to or bought by the watsons and because he valued them as friends " says mr sawyer laucanno "he wanted to make sure they had the best " prof cohen believes "we should be able to see what he was doing " whether or not he was a great painter "his poetry is about spontaneity and his paintings after try to embody that spontaneity " the two are complementary for &# which in this art market barely buys a work by a recent art school graduate how could anyone disagree ms dobrzynski based in new york writes frequently about arts and culture
