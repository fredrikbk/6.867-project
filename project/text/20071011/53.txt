home &amp family cranky consumer free web games for kids come at a cost price is right but ads irk and content can be racy avoiding the cyclopses it is tempting to forgo buying pricey videogames for kids when there is an abundance of free games online the savings may come at the expense of parental control online games are a &# billion industry world wide according to dfc intelligence a market research firm in san diego that could more than double to &# billion in five years says david cole a dfc analyst to find out which free game sites could potentially appeal to a youthful audience we took an online tour with an eight year old boy to five web sites that he accesses regularly we learned the choices range from kid friendly sites based on popular entertainment characters to more mature content that is submitted to sites by users many online games arent rated by the entertainment software rating board while the ratings process is voluntary for game publishers retailers usually wont sell games that arent esrb rated those restrictions dont necessarily apply to games in the online environment according to an esrb spokesman we didnt worry as much about scrutinizing game content for younger children on the sites of entertainment giants such as viacom inc s nick com and walt disney co s disney com since many of the games were based on television shows and movie characters we have come to know over the years but we would have preferred seeing fewer ads and not all of the sites we visited were entirely appropriate for younger children nick com offers free games based on nickelodeon television characters such as spongebob squarepants fairly oddparents and drake &amp josh our familiarity with the characters made us feel comfortable but we were troubled by the sites heavy dose of advertisements an ad for a dvd of "wayside the movie " about a quirky grammar school filled the game window just as we clicked to download planktons fun house a game based on a spongebob character the banner ad across our monitor changed each time we selected a new game and included advertising for kid cuisine frozen meals marketed to children a nickelodeon spokesman said the site is ad supported but that ads dont appear during the course of playing games and there is no product placement many of the games available at disney com are based on the companys television and movie characters the majority of the games are free some including club penguin and toontown online feature free "play areas" but require subscriptions to access additional features a banner ad for a dvd movie blinked so frequently that it bothered our eyes as we set up a free account for disneys virtual magic kingdom a spokeswoman said the site includes advertising in some areas because of a large number of adult users but that many premium games and virtual worlds are free of ads once inside virtual magic kingdom a prompt reminded us not to use foul words while chatting and explained how to find online staff members if other players acted inappropriately we also played several games based on the underdog movie character including a word scramble that tested our knowledge of underdog trivia we failed miserably more than free online games are available at addicting games a site owned by viacom inc s mtv networks we understand why the colorful graphics characteristic of almost all sites that offer free games might attract a younger crowd but some of the sites games arent necessarily appropriate for younger kids the content also changes regularly so it is difficult for parents to monitor clear vision a sniper game was one featured selection last week the main character a stick figure assassin shoots other stick figures whose heads erupt in blood spurts we did find some more benign selections such as a timed wordsearch puzzle and bloons in which a smiling monkey shoots darts at colorful balloons but we preferred our tester to avoid sextreme catapult in which animated characters propel themselves across a field of voluptuous women frequently landing in toilets a spokesman said the site is designed for to year olds with teen boys as its core demographic we found more youth appropriate content when we visited miniclip com mr bump a colorful online pinball game that features smiling yellow pinballs with legs was listed as one of the "hot" game selections that day the object of one clever game sushi go round is to assemble sushi rolls as specified in the restaurant cookbook and serve them to customers before they become angry there was one world war ii themed shooting game in the "hot games" section but the general "shoot em up" game category isnt positioned near the top of the page we found it only by scrolling down a banner ad for a mortgage service ran on the day we visited but we werent distracted kidsgamesfree com initially felt like a haven for our tester there were many non combat themed games such as backgammon and golf master d but a featured game during a second visit romanius ii was a combat themed game about two cyclopses whose goal is to avenge the death of their brother we didnt notice any sexual themes but some others including home run in which the object is to guide a drunken man to his house before he passes out are perhaps better suited to teenagers and young adults as a result of our tests we will be more careful about our childrens online activities and more receptive to paying for our videogames especially for the younger crowd well gladly part with some cash in exchange for a bit more control over what our kids are doing free games web site addictinggames www addictinggames com user age range ages to teenage boys are the sites core demographic safety features some games such as "ladybug mating game " are preceded by a "mature content" warning there are currently no community features on the site that allow users to share information with each other comment our eight year old tester was
