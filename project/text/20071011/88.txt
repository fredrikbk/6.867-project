now playing on cable hdtv catch up directv has the edge as others try to overcome bandwidth limits with satellite tv operator directv group inc planning to offer as many as channels of high definition television by the end of the year cable companies are scrambling to keep up by reclaiming bandwidth and adding high definition video on demand after spending &# billion for satellites and upgraded ground installations directv the countrys largest satellite tv operator by subscribers says it is now offering hd channels including five regional sports networks and relatively new hd offerings like cnn and the weather channel the largest cable operators such as comcast corp and time warner cable inc offer to hdtv channels in most regions but some small operators offer a handful or none the gap is becoming more important as more households buy the hdtv sets they are now in one third of u s homes and are expected to be in half of u s households by according to the consumer electronics association the average price of a inch flat panel tv set is &# compared with &# in according to npd group inc a market research firm some smaller hdtv sets sell for less than &# cable operators are determined not to give directv an hdtv advantage especially since cable has gained an edge over satellite by bundling phone and high speed internet service with cable tv also cable operators have to defend themselves against a growing threat from telephone companies that are adding television service verizon communications inc for example offers pretty much the same to hdtv channels that many comcast and time warner cable systems do but the new fiber network that verizon is building has greater capacity than the average cable system cable operators are coming up with a number of creative ways to make up for the bandwidth constraints in traditional cable systems that limit the number of hdtv channels a few are simply increasing the capacity of their systems many are moving channels from analog tiers of service to digital tiers which use bandwidth more efficiently some operators also are adding high definition programming to their video on demand services a feature that satellite cant offer because it is broadcast only comcast for example offers about high definition on demand options including movies "sopranos" and "csi" episodes and music videos comcast executives argue that many viewers prefer watching high definition this way rather than on traditional channels because they have more choices and they dont have to watch programs at scheduled times "there is no way we will let directv make hdtv an advantage for them " said dave watson a comcast executive vice president to save bandwidth large cable operators also are installing a new technology known as "switched digital video " cable systems typically broadcast all channels to subscribers at once but systems using switched digital only transmit the signals of channels being watched in a particular area so if no household in an area is watching programming in spanish or korean it doesnt get transmitted saving bandwidth space comcast which is conducting trials of switched digital in denver and new jersey has said it plans to spend &# million on the technology this year time warner cable has installed it in six of its markets including greensboro n c where the company is adding hd channels next week to the it now offers cox communications inc launched switched digital in its northern virginia system earlier this year and is planning to launch it soon in two other markets the company says the saved bandwidth also will enable it to conserve space for analog signals while cox along with other major operators is shifting subscribers to digital service which requires a set top box the company recognizes that many households will want to keep analog service on some tvs analysts say the cable technologies are closing the hdtv gap very quickly "within a year the sheer tonnage of hd channels wont be a relevant statistic any more " said craig moffett cable analyst at sanford c bernstein &amp co "well be back to basics who offers the best value the best service and the best bundle " also its still not clear how fast television programmers will make more hdtv channels available directv hasnt said what new channels it plans to add later this year to bring its hdtv total up to but competitors say they doubt the satellite operator will be able to find many more hdtv channels worth watching some of the hdtv channels that directv offers today dont give it much of a competitive advantage for example the satellite operator offers both an east coast and a west coast transmission of hbo meaning a subscriber can watch programs like "the sopranos" at two different times but directv does offer a number of popular networks on hd that most cable systems dont for example comcasts flagship system in philadelphia its headquarters city doesnt offer channels such as bravo animal planet usa network the history channel and the weather channel on high definition directv does meanwhile in rural areas directv subscribers can watch high definition broadcasts of major networks like cbs and abc from los angeles and new york when local affiliates dont broadcast in hd rural cable systems are particularly vulnerable to directvs hdtv offering of the to cable transmission facilities known as head ends in the u s between and dont transmit premium hdtv services according to mark schaffer director of product management for motorola inc s home and networks mobility division these head ends are concentrated in remote areas leaving about of the u s population without access to hdtv via cable some of these head ends are part of major cable companies for example time warner cable systems dont offer hdtv in such locations as shawneetown ill white sulphur springs w va and owensboro ky catalina cable tv co which has subscribers on californias catalina island has lost subscribers to directv since the satellite operator began offering hdtv "i couldnt respond quick enough " said ralph morrow who is the owner chief executive weekend installer and janitor of the company based on the island miles off the coast of long beach mr morrow spent &# to upgrade his systems to carry four hdtv channels discovery espn espn and fsn west and is installing a satellite dish to raise the total to by the end of this month still the year old mr morrow is actively looking for a buyer another example is suddenlink communications which serves million households in texas and the south the company has been investing to provide new high definition programming and telephone service for of its customers by years end "covering the remaining areas will require investments in the largest of the remaining markets and divestitures in the markets where we dont feel that we would be the best provider " said pete abel a spokesman for suddenlink among the largest u s cable providers by subscribers
