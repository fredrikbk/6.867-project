smiling past corruption robert zoellick outlined a vision for the world bank yesterday at a speech marking his th day as president his theme "inclusive and sustainable globalization " whatever that means we long ago became accustomed to the toothless catchphrases by which the bank shovels money now more than &# billion a year out the door and it remains to be seen if mr zoellicks agenda will amount to more than a high gloss on the status quo to his credit the former u s trade rep is emphasizing the importance of free trade to economic development still a controversial point at an institution that was once home to anti globalization guru joseph stiglitz but the real test of his tenure will be whether he can restore the banks reputation especially regarding the corrupt uses to which its loans are often put and the bank staffs habit of looking the other way that point was brought home last month by paul volckers report on the banks anticorruption efforts which painted a vivid picture of institutional resistance to having its projects "exposed as rife with corruption " mr volcker avoided specifics though we revealed the devastating report by the banks internal anticorruption unit int on bank funding for drug procurement in india the losses in that one case ran into the tens of millions of dollars a senior operational bank source has now showed us a second set of int reports concerning corruption in seven projects in cambodia the reports are so sensitive that they were never shared with cambodias government lest they put the lives of whistleblowers at risk we have therefore agreed not to publish or quote directly from the documents as well as to obscure certain details but take our word for it these are remarkably specific reports that document corrupt practices and name officials and companies by the dozen even more astonishing senior bank officials have essentially let the cambodian government get away with it as usual the projects have the most benign sounding names "land management and administration" "provincial rural infrastructure" "flood emergency rehabilitation" "provincial and peri urban water supply and sanitation " and so on yet in each case evidence of extortion bribe taking bid rigging and procurement manipulation was rampant in one or more of the projects of companies seeking project work admitted to offering bribes to government officials some of them in the tens of thousands of dollars in another project investigators found that contracts for out of new office buildings were manipulated in favor of just one company and that they had been built with substandard materials or not built at all the jockeying for bids even led to contracts being taken out on peoples lives and so on and on causing one to wonder what part of the world banks work in the country wasnt corrupted when int released these reports inside the bank in may then bank president paul wolfowitz immediately put the projects on hold and demanded the cambodian government refund the &# million the bank estimated it had lost to corruption bank sources tell us mr wolfowitz would have pulled the bank out of cambodia altogether but he was prevailed on to adopt what amounted to a "stop go" strategy toward cambodia the banks bureaucracy had its own ideas within months the bank had lifted its suspension of the land management project and two others in february james adams the banks vice president for the east asia and pacific region wrote to the cambodian finance minister noting brightly that despite the ints findings the bank was ready to forgive "considering the governments expressed commitment to improve governance and fight corruption the bank proposes to seek the immediate refund of only a portion of the bank funds against the misprocured contracts " were told that not one company has been debarred despite ints recommendations in august mr zoellick visited phnom penh where he announced that the bank "wants to assist the government to enact reforms to reduce rural poverty encourage social development improve the business and investment climate and strengthen the rule of law " yet if the int reports mean anything it is that cambodias government cannot administer even the most basic projects honestly its far from clear that further aid wont simply generate more corruption however many strings are attached mr zoellick is still new to his job and no doubt he is eager to win over the staff that ousted his predecessor yet mr zoellicks most basic obligations are not to them they are to the banks donors and to the worlds poor both of whom are cheated when corruption is tolerated cambodia is one country where that happens if the bank isnt willing to act against it then congress should deny the bank more money until it does see related letter "letters to the editor world bank confronts cambodia corruption" wsj oct
