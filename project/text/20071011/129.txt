the united states of subprime data show bad loans permeate the nation pain could last years as americas mortgage markets began unraveling this year economists seeking explanations pointed to "subprime" mortgages issued to low income minority and urban borrowers but an analysis of more than million home loans made over the past decade reveals that risky mortgages were made in nearly every corner of the nation from small towns in the middle of nowhere to inner cities to affluent suburbs the analysis of loan data by the wall street journal indicates that from to when home prices peaked in many parts of the country more than banks thrifts credit unions and mortgage companies made a combined &# trillion in high interest rate loans most subprime loans which are extended to borrowers with sketchy credit or stretched finances fall into this basket high rate mortgages accounted for of the total number of home loans originated last year up from in about million high rate loans were made in the past three years out of a total of million mortgages high rate lending jumped by an even larger percentage in metropolitan areas from lewiston maine to ocala fla to tacoma wash to examine the surge in subprime lending the journal analyzed more than million records on mortgage applications and originations filed by lenders under the federal home mortgage disclosure act subprime mortgages were initially aimed at lower income consumers with spotty credit but the data contradict the conventional wisdom that subprime borrowers are overwhelmingly low income residents of inner cities although the concentration of high rate loans is higher in poorer communities the numbers show that high rate lending also rose sharply in middle class and wealthier communities banks and other mortgage lenders have long charged higher rates to borrowers considered high risk either because of their credit histories or their small down payments as home prices accelerated across the country over the past decade more affluent families turned to high rate loans to buy expensive homes they could not have qualified for under conventional lending standards high rate loans are those that carry interest rates of three percentage points or more over u s treasurys of comparable durations the journals findings reveal that the subprime aftermath is hurting a far broader array of americans than many realize cutting across differences in income race and geography from investors hoping to strike it rich by speculating on condominiums to the working poor chasing the homeownership dream subprime loans burrowed into the heart of the american financial system and now are bringing deepening woe the data also show that some of the worst excesses of the subprime binge continued well into suggesting that the pain could last through next year and beyond especially if housing prices remain sluggish some borrowers may not run into trouble for years "we had an aggressive home mortgage industry trying to get people into homes they couldnt afford at a time when home prices were very high it turned out to be a house of cards " says karl case an economics professor at wellesley college "were in the early stages of the cleanup " the journals analysis indicates that some major subprime lenders such as washington mutual inc s long beach mortgage unit began scaling back or tightening their standards a year or more ago but commercial banks and thrifts filled the void helping to sustain real estate markets that might otherwise have begun cooling the data suggest that financial suffering is likely to persist in many parts of the u s where subprime lending had surged many loans at risk of going bad have not yet done so as much as &# billion of adjustable rate subprime loans for example are due to adjust to higher rates by the end of which means that more and more borrowers are likely to fall behind last september darla ball a printer and copier saleswoman purchased a &# home in las vegas using an adjustable rate subprime loan with an initial rate of at the time she says she expected to refinance before her interest rate resets to next year which will raise her monthly payments to &# from &# but in the past year she says prices of comparable homes in her subdivision have fallen to &# which means she would not qualify for a new &# mortgage unless home values

american planning association daniel immergluck an associate professor at georgia institute of technology in atlanta found a similar pattern between foreclosures occurring in early and cities with high subprime lending in there are some less gloomy signs too last year the number of new high rate loans fell to about four million after jumping in that reflects the collapse of some of the most aggressive lenders and tightening credit standards of others slowing home sales have put the brakes on loan demand and borrowers have grown more wary of mortgages with teaser rates and other gimmicks yet last years data show that even as the housing market was weakening some lenders still were eager to make riskier loans banks and thrifts grabbed of the market for high rate loans last year up from in suntrust banks inc of atlanta long known as a conservative lender more than doubled the number of high rate loans made by its mortgage unit smaller banks such as first national bank of arizona part of first national bank holding co of scottsdale ariz also revved up their riskier mortgage lending last year joel gottesman chairman of first nationals mortgage division says much of the jump reflects borrowers who got second mortgages the bank has since scaled back that business he says suntrusts increase reflects that it "was comparatively late getting into this area " says a spokesman he added that the jump was heightened by changes in interest rates higher income home buyers began using such loans for larger purchases among borrowers characterized in the data as white with annual income of

people had to use subprime loans " says kevin gillen a research fellow at the wharton school of university of pennsylvania but in pricey areas such as miami where the high rate market share jumped percentage points from to subprime loans didnt have a downscale reputation they were seen as the answer to sky high housing costs "they are different groups but subprime served both of them " mr gillen says it used to be that high rate borrowers werent allowed to stretch as much as conventional borrowers on loan amounts a reflection of their higher credit risk but as home prices rose throughout the u s in the early s lenders grew more willing to let high rate borrowers get bigger loans as measured against their annual incomes in borrowers who got high rate mortgages to buy one to
