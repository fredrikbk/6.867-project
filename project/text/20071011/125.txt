scavengers reveals a split in the city between those who want to forget the financial crisis of the mid s and those who have yet to recover from the economic shock scouring the city for trash and selling it to recyclers has been a last resort for the unemployed for a decade reports travel writer j malcolm garcia the depreciation of the argentine peso in made the trade especially attractive since pricier imported materials increased the demand for cheaper local scrap as the number of scavengers or cartoneros rose the city took steps to accommodate them in part to spare commuters from having to ride on trash filled trains the government rewrote its contracts with waste disposal companies which had complained that cartoneros were stealing trash the disposal companies began to be paid according to the cleanliness of neighborhoods mr garcia says cartoneros have effectively become the bottom layer of argentinas recycling industry and significantly reduced the amount of waste going into landfills dubbed the "white train" for its initial color or "ghost train" for the barebones carriages skeletal appearance the scavenger trains never appeared on an official timetable for a middle class starting to recover from a decade of turmoil the train is an unsightly reminder of poverty says mr garcia the citys new mayor mauricio macri who has the support of much of the citys business community has accused the cartoneros of ruining the city landscape stealing trash and not paying taxes the trains operator has said the white train will stop rolling by the end of this year suggested alternatives include trash carrying trucks riding alongside regular trains and more conveniently located trash warehouses mr garcia says the cartoneros believe the trains disappearance will end their livelihood but at an impromptu protest he attends he sees little evidence the cartoneros will be able to organize to effectively campaign for its preservation the virginia quarterly fall

constructive change in the political process what is needed says mr sabato are sweeping reforms that can be accomplished only through a constitutional convention one change would be to create a more representative senate mr sabato suggests granting the states with the largest population two additional senators each and the next most populated states one additional senator each for similar reasons mr sabato recommends overhauling the electoral college with more populous states receiving additional electors mr sabato also calls for requiring congressional approval for committing combat troops for more than six months and he says the requirement that presidents be born in the u s should be abolished in favor of a law that allows anyone who has been a citizen for years to aspire to the white house the idea of making changes to the document that spawned the american political system strikes many as heresy but the founding fathers themselves would have been dismayed if the inheritors of the constitution hadnt tried to adapt it to new developments says mr sabato consider the words of thomas jefferson "no society can make a perpetual constitution the earth belongs always to the living
