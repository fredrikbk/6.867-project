madonna heads for virgin territory concert promoter lures material girl from warner music with &# million in the latest seismic shift to rock the music industry pop superstar madonna is close to leaving warner music group corp s warner bros records for a &# million deal with concert promotion giant live nation inc according to people familiar with the deal madonna still has another studio album left to deliver with warner music the year pact with live nation of beverly hills calif would give madonna a rich mix of cash and stock in exchange for the rights to sell three studio albums promote concert tours sell merchandise and license her name the fact that a concert promoter like live nation is set to land the deal rather than a traditional record label like warner music is a sign of how quickly the landscape is shifting in the cratering music industry traditionally acts like madonna would release their recordings through a major record label and then make separate deals for touring and merchandising with other companies now however a range of players in the music business labels concert promoters and even managers and ticketing companies are eager to make broad deals that give them a larger piece of the pie by participating in revenue streams such as endorsement deals between artists and advertisers as well as the sales of concert tickets and merchandise promoters typically book artists and venues for concerts dividing the door take with the performers live nation appears to be gambling that by bringing virtually all of madonnas ventures under one roof it can make money by cross promoting albums concert tours and other merchandise the package includes a general advance of &# million and advance payments for three albums of &# million to &# million according to people briefed on the deal live nation also is expected to pay &# million in cash and stock for the right to promote her concert tours if and when she does tour though the promoter will only get of the gross with going to the artist that is the standard split for music superstars in the concert industry these days income from licensing ventures such as the use of madonnas name on fragrances or other products would be divided evenly with live nation madonnas representatives have been negotiating for months with both warner and live nation warner took the unusual step of enlisting iac interactivecorp the parent of ticketmaster as a partner to try to counter live nations proposal for a deal that covered both touring and recorded music iac and ticketmaster would likely have brought concert industry expertise to the table though it is unclear precisely what role they were proposing to play the deal carries significant risks for live nation people in the music industry estimate that at current recorded music prices the promoter would have to sell about million copies of each of its three albums to make back its investment on that piece of the deal alone but an artist manager not involved in the deal said that with prices for cds and downloads alike falling that number could increase warner music would retain the rights to sell madonnas catalog of albums dating back over years and her last studio album for the label will likely arrive next year it isnt clear when her first album for live nation would be delivered nor is it clear how the promoter would distribute and promote the album since the company has limited infrastructure to do so under the terms of the deal ownership of madonnas three live nation albums would revert to her after a period that couldnt be determined people briefed on the deal speculated that live nation would enter a licensing arrangement with one or more traditional labels to release her albums a spokesman for live nation declined to comment madonnas manager guy oseary couldnt be reached most major labels have struck at least a handful of " deals" with new bands where they share in multiple revenue streams superstar deals are more expensive and riskier and therefore much more rare going the other direction radiohead this week released its latest album through its own web site circumventing for now any corporate partner madonna years old has reinvented herself multiple times throughout her career seizing on new music dance culture and fashion trends even as her album sales have steadily diminished her protean persona has kept her in the news and maintained her clout as a concert draw currently shes an adherent of a brand of jewish mysticism known as kabbalah brian posner chief executive of
