rollback school integration efforts face renewed opposition supreme court ruling sways milton battle off to private school milton mass last spring town officials in this affluent boston suburb changed the elementary school assignments for streets and sparked outrage some white families had been reassigned to tucker a mostly black school which has historically had miltons lowest test scores among those reassigned is kevin keating a white parent who is talking to lawyers about going to court to reverse the plan i "just dont feel good putting my son in an inferior school " he says his ammunition the u s supreme courts june ruling that consideration of race in school assignments is unconstitutional without the backing of the supreme court mr keating says his effort wouldnt have "much of a standing " five decades ago federal courts began forcing reluctant districts to use race based assignments to integrate schools but in june a bitterly divided supreme court reversed course concluding that two race based enrollment plans in louisville ky and seattle were unconstitutional "the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race " chief justice john roberts declared now in an era when schools nationwide are becoming increasingly segregated the ruling is affecting local school districts in ways large and small some districts are sidestepping the ruling by replacing measurements of race with household income but many others such as milton are adjusting their programs in the face of opposition thats been emboldened by the supreme court decision in georgia the bibb county school district which encompasses macon has decided to abandon a balancing plan between whites and minorities at one of its top magnet schools next year a broader school board redistricting plan aimed at promoting integration is facing a host of opposition including a threat of legal action by a lawyer citing the supreme court decision the student tucson ariz school district dropped its race based assignment system after a federal court judge declared it unconstitutional in august citing the supreme court case tucson is holding public hearings to gather parent opinion on assignment plans parents have gone back to federal court seeking to reopen their challenge to a race balancing plan in lynn mass another boston suburb they lost that case last year but now are citing the supreme court ruling as grounds for a rehearing an overturning of lynns program could lead to the dismantling of similar ones in more than other school districts in massachusetts says chester darling an attorney for the plaintiffs although the push to integrate public schools is often associated with the civil rights movement these days many school administrators want to integrate schools for a more practical reason to raise test scores studies show black and other minority students tend to perform better academically when they learn alongside white classmates districts face the threat of losing government funds if school test scores fail to meet a certain threshold but the supreme courts june ruling handed opponents powerful ammunition and some experts say the ruling could further accelerate the resegregation of americas schools while the famous supreme court ruling in brown v board of education concluded that racially segregated schools are "inherently unequal " a string of federal court decisions in the s curbed desegregation plans in of black students nationwide attended schools where minorities were the majority compared with in according to the civil rights project at the university of california at los angeles in a group of parents sued the seattle school district because their white children we denied admission into certain popular schools officials at those schools had imposed a racial quota to reflect the districts racial composition three years later a group of white parents sued the louisville school district for basing admissions on a plan that aimed to maintain black enrollment at any school between percent and percent in june the supreme court ruled that in both cases parents involved in community schools v seattle school district no and crystal d meredith v jefferson county board of education the student assignment systems were in violation of the constitutions equal protection clause which says that "no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws " the battle of milton pits the two opposing forces against each other on one side was a vocal strong willed school administrator committed to integration on the other were miltons mostly white residents who clamored to keep everything more or less as it was before founded in milton just south of the boston city line is a town of there are no malls or movie theaters and about half the town is made up of conservation park land the town which is home to massachusetts gov deval patrick and the prestigious milton academy boarding school is an enclave of above middle class affluence with a per capita household income of around &# to &# miltons black population is concentrated in the northwest section of town sometimes referred to locally as "miltonpan" because it adjoins bostons predominantly black mattapan neighborhood the student body at tucker elementary school which serves this area is nonwhite up from seven years ago as the number of black students in milton grew so did concern about their lower relative performance to whites on state tests minority representation at the three other elementary schools in town located in slightly more upscale mostly white neighborhoods averages about test scores at these schools are generally higher than those at tucker last summer a group of parents started pressing school superintendent magdalene giffune to narrow the achievement gap dr giffune shared their concerns and believed the answer partly lay in better integrating miltons schools while of tuckers black students fell into the "needs improvement" category in fourth grade english in the academic year only of black students attending the three other schools did there have been efforts to make the american educational system a fairer one for african americans and other minorities but "the plain truth is that it isnt even steven " says dr giffune a silvery haired year old whose voice carries traces of her new york origins it was a good time to reconsider school assignments tucker was overcrowded and the district was nearing the end of a &# million renovation project that will add new capacity at other schools as last school year began milton school officials began discussing who would be going where this fall in december the school board named a member student assignment committee made up of parents teachers and school officials the next month parents responded to a district survey about their assignment priorities while a majority of nonwhites ranked classroom diversity first or second on the list a majority of whites ranked it last or second last white parents first priority was having kids attend their neighborhood school the status quo at about that time the supreme court held oral arguments milton school officials paid close attention and realized the court was leaning toward striking down race based assignments as a result the committee found itself trying to balance two seemingly opposing missions improving diversity while also making its assignments "race neutral " to do that the committee devised three alternative plans none of which required consideration of a students racial background the first called the "consolidation" plan called for grouping all second through fifth grade students together in a single campus the second "sister schools" plan would also group children townwide in a slightly different arrangement a third choice called "neighborhood schools " kept students at the four schools but with different attendance boundaries during public meetings parents outside the tucker district heavily backed "neighborhood schools" the plan that would result in the least amount of integration white parents whose children attended schools cunningham and collicot pointed out that many of them had voted for higher property taxes in ballot initiatives to pay for renovations at the schools opponents of the consolidation plan also frequently cited the then pending supreme court case tucker parents who favored the more integrated consolidation plan included karen horan an african american former financial analyst on the assignment committee "the greater good was for the children of the entire town to go to school together and learn how to get along with each other starting at kindergarten " she says in april the school board sided with the white parents voting to for the neighborhood school plan board chairman beirne lovely who was away on vacation at the time said he would have sided with the majority whose votes reflected "the overwhelming consensus of the community " the board also felt he says that the supreme court "was going to come down hard on the issue of not using race as a factor " dr giffune was disappointed with the boards decision if it wasnt for the supreme court decision dr giffune says diversity advocates like herself would have had "a bit more of a fighting chance to do the right thing the supreme court really put us at a disadvantage " to determine how many streets would be reassigned school officials used a computer program that considered such factors as the addresses of children attending milton public schools and school building capacities in june the school board voted on the streets whose students would be reassigned to new schools while the racial make up of students was not considered some in white neighborhoods were switched to tucker some minority heavy streets previously belonging to tucker were switched to glover which is white but the plan made the switch gradual the assignments only applied to new students allowing those already enrolled last year to stay where they were despite those efforts ms giffune says most of the white families reassigned to tucker elected to send their children to private school instead one of them is mr keating a real estate broker his street abuts a pond and the town forest and has newly built homes and well manicured lawns it had previously been assigned to the cunningham school which has a minority enrollment less than a third that of tucker from to test scores at cunningham topped tuckers by to percentage points although he says his objections have nothing to do with any racial bias and that he supported consolidating the schools mr keating says the purpose of the reassignment is to make tucker "a whiter school " "im just being used to fix the scores problem at tucker and i have a problem with that " he adds "its a townwide problem that a small neighborhood shouldnt be expected to shoulder " mr keating has been looking for other parents in his neighborhood to join him in seeking a restraining order from federal court to quash the reassignment plan if successful he says he might switch his child from private school back to cunningham "we really feel vindicated in this struggle especially with the supreme court fully behind us " he says another critic living near mr keating is anthony polimeno a property manager whose daughter is due to enter kindergarten in he says he is "outraged" at the prospect of her having to go to tucker mr polimeno says he checked out the school and "wasnt impressed " if the reassignment plan isnt stopped he says his options are to move to another town or send his daughter to private school "clearly the supreme court is saying one thing and our schools in milton are doing just the exact opposite " he adds about white parents interested in miltons french immersion program also rejected tucker for the upcoming school year dr giffune says they had applied for the program at glover but because the program there was full they were offered slots in the immersion program at tucker about a mile away most turned the offer down and two of the families opted for private schools dr giffune says the bottom line theres been no change in tuckers racial mix this year school officials say thats largely because of the grandfathering exceptions in the redistricting plan white rejection of the school and heavy minority enrollment the failure to mix more black and white students has left some black parents in town with bitter feelings average household income of the neighborhood that feeds tucker is &# not much lower than the whiter areas of town "at all the town meetings the feeling us folk from tucker got from the rest of the town was we dont want your kind " says richard fischer an african american investment adviser and a parent of three tucker students ms horan says she moved her family to milton from boston years ago seeking open minded neighbors only to be confronted by the same prejudices that she had hoped to leave behind "hurtful as it is to admit racism is alive and well and living in milton " she says mr lovely the board chairman denies any racial tension meanwhile drew echelson tuckers principal says the school is moving to improve its academic performance its offering full day kindergarten instead of the half day offered at the other schools the staff is visiting students homes prior to the start of the new school year to encourage greater parental participation tucker teachers have formed a collaborative designed to boost teaching skills test scores for are already showing improvement now in her last academic year before retirement dr giffune admits to leaving on a somber note "i did the best i could but i feel i failed those kids at tucker " she says "maybe i trusted the process and the goodness and idealism of everybody "
