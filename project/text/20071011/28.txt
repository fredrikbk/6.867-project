capital why job market is sagging in the middle you dont need to be a ph d economist to know something big is happening in the job market the salaries of wall streets financial engineers are surging while wages in industrial companies stagnate manufacturers complain about "skill shortages" while cutting payrolls the number of health care jobs soars over years outstripping the increase in other jobs computers seem to have infiltrated every job yet demand for unskilled low wage immigrants doesnt abate for decades employers in the u s and other industrialized countries sought more skilled workers as technology and the availability of low wage workers abroad diminished the employers appetite for lesser skilled workers at home it was painful but simple employers of all sorts wanted more skills and more education and paid more to get them it is no longer that simple cue the ph d economists there is still strong demand for high end workers the stars of finance software law sports and entertainment as well as for the highest skilled factory workers the only news is the intensity of that demand which is pushing up pay for those at the top but and heres the switch demand is increasing for some workers at the low end of the pay scale the ones who wipe brows in hospitals care for kids clear tables at bistros and stand guard in office building lobbies in about of workers without any college education were working in such personal service jobs according to calculations by david autor a massachusetts institute of technology economist in of them were the losers "the sagging middle " says princeton university economist alan krueger as harvard economists lawrence katz and claudia goldin put it recently "u s employment has been polarizing into high wage and low wage jobs at the expense of traditional middle class jobs " heres the hypothesis evolving among these and other academics technology and globalization are boosting demand for the most educated workers those prized for abstract or conceptual skills top hedge fund managers arent being replaced by computers theyre harnessing them to their great profit by contrast technology and globalization are eroding demand for workers who do routine tasks in factories and offices many of whom are high school or even college grads the voice mail system does away with switchboard operators back office software eliminates bookkeepers robots replace assembly line workers or the work is shipped overseas to a foreign factory or an office linked to the u s by fiber optic cables but technology and globalization are not eroding demand for personal service workers those tasks cant be done by computer or shipped offshore the services have to be delivered here in the u s and in person either by natives or by immigrants indeed as the folks at the top make more money more of them want nannies gardeners personal trainers and gourmet chefs these workers are indirect beneficiaries of the upward flow of wealth their wages have been rising while those of midlevel factory and office workers though still higher than those of many service employees are stagnating dissecting data on american communities mits mr autor and colleague david dorn examined places that were particularly heavy with easy to automate or easy to outsource jobs in by they discovered wage inequality in those communities had widened more than elsewhere the erosion of jobs and wages in the middle coincided with increasing employment and wages for personal service workers at the bottom of the income ladder and highly educated workers at the top some economists speculate that the same economic forces are at play in europe but are hidden because rules and customs that restrain incomes at the top also restrain demand for personal service workers at the bottom that means less inequality than in the u s but also fewer jobs overall and more people on the sidelines the ones who would be service workers if there were jobs to be had so what if anything should the u s do about this thats a harder question economists warn that shoring up the middle by shielding manufacturing industries from imports or otherwise meddling with the market would cost consumers heavily some certainly not all suggest letting the market be and using the tax code to transfer money from the biggest winners others suggest "professionalizing" personal service jobs perhaps encouraging unionization to boost wages unlike factory jobs advocates reason these jobs cant be moved offshore or automated if employers have to pay more the more popular solution at least among economists is a familiar one educate all workers so they are better at interpersonal or abstract skills the jobs of the future as opposed to dial turning or keyboard pounding rapidly disappearing jobs of the past
