musharraf in the middle lahore pakistan when gen pervez musharraf won of the votes cast in pakistans presidential election on saturday an election that was boycotted by the opposition no less one national newspaper headline aptly screamed "musharraf steals the show " not quite yet that is the supreme court will decide later this month whether or not to validate the election results if it does mr musharraf has promised to doff his uniform and hold elections if it doesnt he may impose martial law this acute uncertainty has created a flurry of debate here and more importantly in washington where the bush administration is belatedly working out how to proceed is mr musharraf a failing military dictator or a burgeoning democrat and more importantly should the u s back him or ditch him the answer isnt as clear cut as the white house might like the radical view outlined by sandy berger and bruce riedel in yesterdays international herald tribune proposes to ditch mr musharraf altogether and push for "free and fair elections " in this perfect world a secular civilian government with legitimacy to tackle religious extremism would emerge saving americas face but this kind of proposal grossly misrepresents the on the ground reality free and fair elections would likely produce a deeply divided polity one in which the religious forces would likely hold the balance of power between benazir bhuttos secular peoples power party ppp and mr musharrafs conservative ruling pakistan muslim league pml in the absence of mr musharraf the pml would most certainly ally with the muttahida majlis amal mma an alliance of five bitterly anti american religious parties if that happened the first casualty of a rightwing coalition government would be washingtons war on terror in the political paralysis that would inevitably follow the pakistani army would welcome the opportunity to retreat to the barracks rather than fight "its own people" in the border provinces then america wouldnt have mr musharraf to lean on to "do more" to fight terror it would have to go it alone other analysts contend that the u s should not back an emerging alliance between ms bhutto and mr musharraf because the former is corrupt and the latter is unpopular that leaves ex prime minister nawaz sharif in contention ousted by mr musharraf in and exiled to saudi arabia mr sharif gained in popularity recently when he tried unsuccessfully to defy the president and return to pakistan last month a sharif government probably wouldnt be much to americas liking either mr sharif is a deeply conservative politician who has always ruled in alliance with the mullahs going so far as to pass various islamic laws to appease them recently he set up the all parties democratic movement apdm to oppose mr musharraf this grouping comprises all the religious and anti american parties in the country like ms bhutto mr sharif has dodged corruption charges when he was in power he suppressed the free press with a vengeance under the circumstances he is hardly likely to prove pakistans long lost democratic savior and champion of the war on religious extremism that leaves mr musharraf who is quickly consolidating his power base on monday he named gen ashfaq kayani the former head of the interservices intelligence vice chief of the army that puts mr kayani a musharraf loyalist in line to become the next army chief another trusted aide gen tariq majeed became chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee mr musharraf is also strengthening his position by rupturing the mmas grip on the volatile north west frontier province bordering afghanistan and his influence is growing in the taliban al qaeda infested tribal badlands of waziristan mr musharrafs alliance with ms bhutto isnt perfect by any means the twice sacked former prime minister ms bhutto a pro west liberal in self exile since struck a deal to have her corruption charges dropped in exchange for supporting mr musharrafs bid for the presidency mr musharraf whos survived three assassination attempts remains deeply unpopular with middle class pakistanis because he is perceived as a u s puppet and an anti islamic secularist ms bhutto by contrast is still quite popular but that may not matter baitullah mehsud the taliban al qaeda commander in waziristan says he is planning to welcome her back home with suicide bombers "because she is an american agent " the bush administration cant ask mr musharraf to "do more" in the war against radical islam at a time when he is so unpopular at home nor can they ask him to hold free and fair elections immediately and quit the scene the best bet for pakistan and its friends abroad would be a liberal secular civil military alliance that leads to a stable and moderate government sometimes that takes more patience than washington is willing to extend mr sethi is editor of the friday times and daily times in lahore pakistan
