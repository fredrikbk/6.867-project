how to fix the amt just as our nation is addicted to foreign oil our federal government is hooked on revenue from the alternative minimum tax its a destructive addiction compounding one of the worst policy failures in the near century of the individual income tax and it could get a lot worse under the "paygo" rules adopted by the democratic majority in congress taxpayer relief from the amt no matter how meritorious on its face must be offset by revenue raised somewhere else for some members revenue raised somewhere else means increasing taxes on other taxpayers key house democrats are sketching plans to stop the amt from hitting millions of middle income earners this year they want to raise some marginal tax rates to pay for it if they do vast numbers of people would see their taxes go up in amt filers mostly families filing joint returns paid more than &# billion into the treasury if congress does not extend the most recent amt hold harmless provision aka the "patch" that expired at the end of that number is projected to balloon dramatically to roughly &# billion in in that year the number of families and individuals liable for the amt is projected to increase to million long term budget forecasts show that if congress does nothing of american households will pay the amt by roughly of individual income tax liability would be generated by the amt compared with about today these forecasts are from the nonpartisan congressional budget office nevertheless enacting a tax increase elsewhere to relieve some of the burden of the amt would compound one policy failure with another the amt went on the books in in response to the discovery that wealthy taxpayers were able to eliminate their entire tax liabilities through legal means but congress didnt index the amts rates and exemptions for inflation as a result middle income taxpayers are getting socked with a tax they were never intended to pay and yet ironically the amt has not achieved its original objective according to an irs analysis of tax year data earners with incomes of &# or more escaped their entire federal income tax liability so this tax has failed in every way except for the ability to raise very large sums of money to feed government spending now some democratic leaders want to keep raising that money if not through this tax then another a fair question to ask is what did republicans do to slay this beast when we controlled congress in congress passed a wide ranging individual tax relief bill only republicans in the senate voted for it only a handful of house democrats voted yes if enacted that bill would have phased out the amt over years president clinton vetoed it in as chairman of the senate committee of jurisdiction i shepherded through five years of protection against any more taxpayers falling into the amt that was significant relief as the bite was just getting bigger and amt wasnt a household term at the time the thinking was wed visit full scale reform or repeal after the five years passed then came the election now the democrats control congress and theyve put us in a paygo straitjacket what needs to happen next first budget planners need to take off their rose colored glasses when looking at long term revenue projections if we start trying to spend revenues we expect to collect in the future because of the amt well be living beyond our means we need to stop assuming that record levels of revenue are available to be spent and recognize that the amt is a phony revenue source second we need to rein in the amt without requiring an offset it would take a simple procedural step a waiver of the democrats paygo rule in the senate it would take votes to waive paygo and other budget resolution restrictions if the democratic leaders dont take these steps theyll punish the american taxpayer for an ill conceived poorly executed total failure of a policy theyll allow the federal government to feed its amt revenue addiction with more and more spending i hope instead for an intervention of common sense and fiscal restraint mr grassley is a republican senator representing iowa and ranking member of the finance committee see related letters "letters to the editor you shouldve fixed amt back then chuck" wsj oct
