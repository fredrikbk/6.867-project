wonder land hillary talks about it in an interview in yesterdays washington post hillary clinton said she had contributed to the countrys mood of bitter partisanship and wants to "put an end to it " the senator hedged her words for future revision by referring to the problem throughout the interview only as "it " thus she spoke of "having gone through it having been on the receiving end of it and in campaigns that were hard fought maybe on the giving end of it " when the reporters pressed her to explain her views on polarization she said "ive talked about it a lot and i think i will continue to talk about it in a lot of different ways " its a start i would like to put a question to the senator would you defend rush limbaughs speech rights against the pressure that was brought upon him on the floor of the senate by your colleagues harry reid and ken salazar colorados sen salazar went so far last week as to say hed support a senate vote to "censure" mr limbaugh rhymes with censor when sen reid attacked mr limbaugh on the floor of the senate some felt that mr limbaugh was a big boy and perfectly capable of defending himself im not so sure if mr limbaugh and his critics at media matters want to have a street fight thats their business but sens reid and salazar arent just a couple of opinionated guys they are agents of state authority and they were leaning hard on mr limbaugh if you are media matters if you are a man or woman of the left does state pressure on someones political speech discomfort you or is it a welcome even defensible repression of harmful right wing speech this controversy over talk show hosts is usually fought around democratic efforts of late to resurrect the fairness doctrine the purpose of this effort the reason sen reid has attached himself to it is to suppress voter turnout on the right and lift it on the left political talk radio since its inception has energized voters on the right in the presidential election the left found its own voter turnout instrument in howard deans web based "netroots " now led by moveon org and other leftwing or "progressive" sites such as daily kos and media matters some of the left wing sites however also do fund raising and political organizing as in the netroots campaigns against democratic politicians who didnt hear that dissent is dead talk radio does neither its hosts mainly excite people reimposing the fairness doctrine essentially a toxic cocktail of boredom would cause a narcotized right wing base to sit on its hands handing an advantage in the turnout wars to the properly unregulated political organizers of the left wing web while mr limbaugh fought off the democratic senate in one corner the commentator juan williams also found his speech and job status under pressure from media matters in the same week that mr williams a fox commentator appeared on bill oreillys show to speak critically of black culture his bosses at npr rejected a white house request to have mr williams interview president bush on race in a media matters posting on all this eric boehlert wrote that "real damage is being done to npr by having its name via williams associated with fox news most opinionated talker " noting that mr williams supported clarence thomass nomination mr boehlert said there are "better advocates for genuinely liberal positions " and suggested "now is the time for npr to address the growing problem " in a now famous remark this summer at the kos convention of progressive bloggers sen clinton described "a real imbalance in the political world" and praised the growth of "progressive infrastructure institutions that i helped to start and support like media matters " who threw the first stone in these media driven bloodlettings good question but to my knowledge the right has no equivalent to "repressive tolerance " the aggressive theory of scorched earth political argument laid out in the hothouse years of the s by the late left wing political philosopher herbert marcuse just last november in an admiring essay for the chronicle of higher education the left polemicist stanley fish aptly summed up marcuses assertion that "liberal" notions of tolerance for political speech should be overturned the rationale for this notion is that standard tolerance is rigged against the left in practice tolerance extends only to the ideas and beliefs of the powerful while it shuts out ideas on behalf of the weak or "marginalized" the poor minorities women and the rest mr fish says liberals fail to see "the dark side of their favorite virtue " prof fish has an alternative to traditions of tolerance and to anyone awash in american politics today it will sound familiar "that is to say and marcuse says it anything the right does is bad and should not be tolerated anything the left does is good and should be welcomed " this would explain the emotional intensity and animosity in politics now the other side no longer deserves minimal respect its not enough to disagree with conservative viewpoints one has to undermine and delegitimize them mock them put them beyond the pale incidentally marcuse fish and others on the left who want to "withdraw" tolerance from the speech and ideas of their opponents count centrist democrats among them that is what happened to joe lieberman digital technology now fixes someones random remark forever in the ozone amber of the web or youtube its easy to make anything anyone may say such as "macaca " a weeks long campaign to diminish or even destroy the sayer wherever the nonbeliever marcuse is now this tool would have put him in heaven i find it putting us closer than id like to be to an american "lives of others " media monitors always listening for the vulnerable spoken word sen clinton this week told the post "i intend to build a centrist coalition " that may depend on how one defines centrist for her progressive bloggers at media matters the center on tolerating speech likely falls closer to prof marcuse than john locke so which is it this summer sen clinton said she was a founder of media matters and this week she said she was a centrist that doesnt compute perhaps in a year well know which side shes on
