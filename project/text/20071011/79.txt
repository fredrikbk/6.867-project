mr levins stock options if there were a hall of fame for those whove done the most to pad the pay of top ceos carl levin would be a first ballot shoo in strangely however the michigan democrat seems unhappy with his own political handiwork the senator was chief architect of the biggest single boon to stock option issuance back in the s the change in the tax code that limited the tax deductibility of executive pay to &# million unless that pay was "performance based " stock option grants have since soared and executive pay has climbed to even greater heights the difference is that now close to half that ceo compensation comes from options which avoid his &# million cap because the options are in the money only if the stock goes up ergo they are "performance based " mr levin is a mad political scientist who clearly doesnt learn from his laboratory mistakes rather than repeal his folly the michigan democrat now wants to compound the error thus last week he introduced a bill to include stock options under the &# million cap while also raising taxes on option grants generally he claims this will net the treasury &# billion a year only someone on capitol hill could really believe this or at least pretend to if mr levins new bill passes companies looking to attract ceo talent would simply move more of the pay package into performance based bonuses or stock grants or something else whatever the details you can be sure of two things executive compensation consultants would see their phones light up and ceos would continue to command whatever compensation the market requires to attract top managers in our highly competitive global economy mr levins bill would also require corporations to use the same figure for deducting stock option expenses from their taxes that they do when expensing options in their annual and quarterly reports the discrepancy arises because a federal accounting rule adopted in requires companies to deduct the value of options from their earnings when the options are issued however for tax purposes companies take the deduction when the options are exercised which is usually years later and after the options have increased in value both rules are arbitrary since no money leaves the companys coffers at either moment but never mind mr levin would have you believe that the discrepancy between book options costs and options expenses reported to the irs is the result of a nefarious conspiracy to inflate earnings and evade taxes but suppose a company does make the right conservative assumptions about cost when it reports the expense as it is required to do at time of grant then against all expectations the stock triples in three years and the ceo gets a windfall the expense reported to the irs when the options are exercised will be much higher than what was originally reported to shareholders mr levin would penalize the company actually its shareholders for that outperformance by denying them a tax deduction thats been on the books for four decades one last word on the "loophole" mr levin created it was included in the law because "performance based" pay was seen as good creating incentives for growth and job creation and meritocratic to boot now even that pretense has vanished mr levins latest exercise shows that his real purpose is to punish executives solely for the sin of being highly paid see related letter "letters to the editor the money pours in" wsj oct
