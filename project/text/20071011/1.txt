a senators obtuseness regarding economics if sen bernie sanders i vt really thinks trade causes poverty he should encourage the vermont legislature to erect high tariff barriers against goods from the other states "free trade treaties mean impoverishment " letters to the editor oct or perhaps he can organize a "boycott vermont" campaign and encourage companies to refuse to sell goods and services to vermonters just think if the citizens of vermont no longer face competition from outside the state they could open up auto plants and steel mills reopen shuttered textile factories and cultivate every acre of open space and forest land with crops using sen sanderss flawed logic he also claims free trade has been a bane to mexico but a boon to china this would be a windfall for the state but the more probable outcome at least if of economists who have ever lived are right is that the standard of living of vermonters would plummet but at least they would then be closer to the vaunted goal of equality that sen sanders seems to cherish more than freedom consumer choice and wealth creation roger r ream washington there are many flaws in sen sanderss arguments but one of them really stands out he thinks free trade hurts both sides lets take his argument that americans would lose jobs under cafta to countries like costa rica if we pretend that hes right doesnt that have to mean that costa ricans are gaining jobs so how can he say with a straight face that then somehow even though theyre gaining all these jobs theyre still worse off i challenge sen sanders to find any situation in history where free trade hurt everyone involved peter alrich bloomington ind as part owner of a vermont based manufacturer and exporter i am appalled but not surprised by sen sanderss lack of understanding of fundamental principles of elementary economics the senator cites numerous problems with the current u s economic environment including loss of health insurance loss of pensions growing wealth disparity and loss of manufacturing jobs all of these problems stem from our countrys growing lack of competitiveness in the world economy protectionism will only temporarily postpone an even harder fall as the world goes elsewhere for its goods and services perhaps the senator would make a more convincing argument if he were able to show a single example where lack of free trade had helped economies grow and prosper in the long run if not i suggest he read thomas sowells "basic economics " it is written in a simplistic style that even a politician can understand allan sapp gardnerville nev the democrats and socialists like sen sanders love to throw out the phrase "working families" in any economic debate what is their definition of a "working family" and at what income level in their view does a family even those that are gainfully employed cease to be a "working family" robert k kelly rockaway point n y sen sanders asserts that mexicos "agricultural sector has been decimated by cheap exports from american agribusiness " to the contrary mexicos agricultural markets have been roiled by high corn prices caused by our subsidy fueled demand for ethanol earlier this year the mexican government imposed price controls on tortillas because of sharp price increases caused by american corn demand to give the senator his due hes correct that carlos slims billions are obscene however since hes such a careful reader of mary ogradys columns he should know that mr slims wealth is not symptomatic of "the kind of economic development championed" by her indeed in a jan column ms ogrady describes carlos slim as the beneficiary of "mind boggling privileges " e frank stephenson chairman department of economics berry college mount berry ga
