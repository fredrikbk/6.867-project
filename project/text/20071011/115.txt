stoppards russians come home moscow last week as a cast of russian actors rehearsed for the local premiere of "the coast of utopia " its author british playwright tom stoppard mused on how the play was still relevant to present day russia despite its focus on events that took place more than years ago "its really interesting how much of what is said in a play that ends in about still seems to apply to russia now " mr stoppard the acclaimed creator of numerous plays and screenplays including the oscar winning "shakespeare in love " said "now we have the equivalent of slavophiles we have a kind of russian nationalism we have these tendencies pulling in opposite directions " he continued speaking in a back room at the russian academic youth theater located a short walk from red square and the kremlin as well as from the bentley dealership and the glitzy five star hotels that add nouveau riche glamour to the heart of todays moscow "on the one hand all the goodies of western civilization can set up shop here the glossy magazines here seem thicker than anywhere else theres so much to sell in them so you have that tendency and you have what i think of as a kind of puritan tendency which sees this influence as corrupting " russias ambiguous position between east and west is a key theme of "the coast of utopia " a sprawling dramatic trilogy that tells the story of the th century russian revolutionaries who sought to overthrow the czar and abolish serfdom becoming the intellectual precursors of lenin and the bolsheviks when "the coast of utopia" ran at new yorks lincoln center theater last season it got generally strong reviews but it also prompted complaints that mr stoppard a famously erudite author had gone too far forcing his audience to learn all sorts of obscure russian names and delve into the politics of a bygone era that is not a problem here to begin with the plays main characters the socialist alexander herzen the anarchist mikhail bakunin and the literary critic vissarion belinsky are familiar to any russian who grew up in the soviet era when they were canonized in history textbooks one can even say mr stoppards characters are part of the landscape in the metro station next to the russian academic youth theater commuters still hurry past a large marble portrait of karl marx who makes several appearances in the play but the more vivid link to the present is the fact that the plays central debate whether russia should mimic the liberal west or pursue its own path is still hotly disputed in the age of vladimir putin who has retreated from the democratic reforms of the s and moved russia back onto a path of confrontation with the west "the play certainly has relevance more so now than four years ago when we started to translate it when it was much more historical " said arkady ostrovsky the moscow bureau chief of the economist who rendered "the coast of utopia" into russian together with his brother sergei at last saturdays premiere one of the loudest bursts of applause came when actor yevgeny redko playing belinsky concluded a speech about russias backwardness compared with europe "look at us " he shouted before issuing a litany of complaints about bureacracy police informers and the passivity of the population several audience members interviewed at intermission acknowledged that they had felt a frisson of recognition during the speech "when belinsky went up and started talking about russia and the west it was like wow " one young woman said mr stoppards trilogy which runs about nine hours in its entirety traces a broad arc starting with youthful idealism and ending with disillusionment "the people are more interested in potatoes than freedom " herzen says in the last part lamenting the failed democratic revolutions of the same words could arguably pertain to the beleaguered democratic opposition in todays russia despite mr putins crackdown on political freedoms he has approval ratings of about largely because he has presided over strong economic growth that has restored stability after the chaos of the yeltsin years by coincidence the day after "the coast of utopia" had its russian debut hundreds of opposition activists gathered in moscow to mark the first anniversary of the murder of outspoken journalist anna politkovskaya but the protest was dwarfed by a rally marking mr putins birthday which happens to be the same day orchestrated by a pro kremlin youth group and attracting over people in a break between rehearsals last week actor alexei maslov who plays the essayist chaadaev drew a connection between mr stoppards play and post soviet politics "the sad experience of our unrealized democracy is definitely echoed in the text especially in the third part when the disillusioned herzen says everything we wanted has crumbled into dust " mr maslov said mr stoppard himself declined to say much about putin era politics "im not a font of wisdom on the subject " he said "but if one generalizes it seems to me that the arguments and debates which these people were having years ago were arguments which never ceased and in a sense go back centuries earlier " the history of "the coast of utopia" itself began in the s when mr stoppard who has often said he is more interested in ideas than characters read isaiah berlins classic study "russian thinkers " the book inspired him to write a play starring herzen bakunin and belinsky while writing mr stoppard said it was always his "fond dream" that the resulting work would someday be staged in russia after the trilogy premiered at londons national theatre in mr ostrovsky caught a performance and in his words "fell in love with it " he wrote to mr stoppard asking for permission to translate it into russian and the playwright agreed within a few days mr ostrovsky then a reporter for the financial times got to work "the hardest things were the jokes " he said the translated script was kicked around between various moscow theaters until messrs stoppard and ostrovsky felt they had found the right director alexei borodin of the russian academic youth theater in messrs stoppard and borodin held a news conference to announce that the theater would mount the ambitious production also present was mikhail shvydkoi head of the federal culture and cinematography agency the government body that finances most russian theaters the agency provided much of the productions &# million budget according to producer natalya nikolaeva despite his lack of russian mr stoppard attended a number of rehearsals acting largely as an observer "i didnt want to interfere i couldnt in fact " the dramatist said in mr stoppard accompanied mr borodin and a group of actors on a trip to pryamukhino the bakunin country estate where the trilogy begins the once stately manor was pillaged during the bolshevik revolution and now only its foundation remains the moscow production differs greatly from previous stagings in london and new york mr stoppard said "its a completely fresh approach to it its pretty depressing when theaters attempt to reproduce what theyve seen in london thats rather tedious its refreshing if you see something which is nothing like what we did in london or new york so this is entirely alexei borodins vision together with his designer and his whole team its a wonderful russian company " although russians can be prickly about western authors drawing on russian material mr stoppard said he had not encountered any cross cultural resentment "what ive been finding is that theyre strangely moved and i could almost say grateful that somebody from outside has taken an interest in a part of their history and in certain people who on the whole have been ignored outside this country " he said "stoppard gave us a sort of present " grigory zaslavsky theater critic for the daily newspaper nezavisimaya gazeta said by telephone mr zaslavsky expressed his hope that mr stoppards trilogy would help shake up the russian theater world after a period in which it has shied away from serious ideas opting for commercial fare instead "over the past years there has not been a tradition in russia of coming to the theater for reflection " he said "about anything serious theater is somewhere on the periphery " for mr stoppard himself the moscow premiere of his trilogy means coming full circle "all the time i was writing this play i would often indulge in the childish fantasy that one day it would be performed in russia before a russian audience " he told a group of students at moscow state university last week the fact that he was speaking at herzens alma mater in the sparrow hills of southwest moscow where a young herzen and his friend nikolai ogarev made a solemn vow to devote their lives to overthrowing the czarist autocracy was not lost on mr stoppard "so here we are on the sparrow hills and i really feel quite emotional about being here " he said "these have been some of the most memorable times in my life " mr osipovich is a writer based in moscow
