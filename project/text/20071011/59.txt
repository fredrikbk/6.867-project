getting richer fast and where companies could find their shares worth more allowing them to go out and buy other assets other factors have played a part in recent volatility from septembers u s interest rate cut to easing concerns about the global credit crunch to a tax cut announcement yesterday in hong kong but analysts and fund managers estimate that about two thirds of the hong kong
