a day without email is like when u s cellulars chief operating officer jay ellison imposed a "no email friday" rule at his company he thought it would ease workers overload instead he got a rebellion among many irate responses kathy volpi a marketing director confronted mr ellison and "just ripped me " he says "she really gave me a piece of her mind " ms volpi says that at the time the ban seemed like a needless obstacle "i thought he just doesnt understand how much work we have to get done and how much easier" it is when using email a growing number of employers including u s cellular deloitte &amp touche and intel are imposing or trying out "no email" fridays or weekends while the bans typically allow emailing clients and customers or responding to urgent matters the normal flow of routine internal email is halted violators are hit with token fines or just called out by the boss the limits aim to encourage more face to face and phone contact with customers and co workers raise productivity or just give employees a reprieve from the ever rising email tide emails sent by individual corporate users are projected to increase this year to an average of a day up from in says radicati group a palo alto calif research and consulting firm and one third of users feel stressed by heavy email volume according to a study of people by the university of glasgow and paisley university in scotland many check email as often as to times an hour the study showed managers complain that rather than confronting problems employees use email to avoid them by passing issues back and forth in long message strings like a hot potato email reduces face to face contact among co workers and clients terse poorly phrased messages further strain those relationships and it is spilling into weekends chaining employees to computers when they should be relaxing but withdraw it even for a day and some employees fight back like recovering smokers in a nicotine fit jeremy burtons email ban at a california software firm wasnt minutes old before self described email addict michael parker hit the "send" button on the first digital contraband accustomed to sending up to messages a day mr parker says he couldnt help himself "its kind of like speeding " he says "you know theres a law that says youre not supposed to do it but when youre in the heat of combat you aim and fire " in a mirthful counterattack mr burton fined mr parker &# had "wanted" posters with his mug shot tacked up around the office and made him wear a scarlet "e" on his chest mr parker still works for mr burton who is now president and ceo of serena software san mateo calif although it has taken three years mr parker says his bosss insistence on face to face communication has helped him curb his email usage he guesses by roughly for heavy users he says an executive intervention is the only cure "somebody has to say no were going to turn this off its a bit of a shock but thats what it takes " psychologist ken siegel classifies the email habit as "a dependency " cut off from their habit employees at first may become hostile and critical says dr siegel president of impact group los angeles management consultants initial efforts to communicate in other ways may be halting at best "people will take one or two steps forward and three or four steps back " although nancy flynn executive director of the epolicy institute a columbus ohio training and consulting firm recommends employers impose "no email" days she attaches a warning "when you try to take email away from some users theyre going to panic " pbd worldwide fulfillment services alpharetta ga ordered its employees to halt nonessential friday emails last year the problems were obvious says greg dockter senior vice president sales and marketing "wed have email chains with or subject lines back and forth with six or seven people involved and it just became ridiculous " but some employees immediately tried to circumvent the ban "email has become our right arm and now youve cut it off " stacey villarrubia pbds payroll and benefits coordinator recalls thinking at the time she abided by the letter of the rule but not the spirit she continued drafting emails on friday but stockpiled them in her box for automatic release on monday the resulting backlog from her and other employees led to a logjam of messages in everyones in boxes on monday to curb offenders mr dockter says "id run down the hall and call them out on it " the e mail edicts are working well executives say and in time all the resisters i interviewed came around to support their employers email bans pbds ms villarrubia says that instead of emailing the bosses of warehouse employees and asking them to relay messages she started walking to the warehouse to see the employees face to face more people stop by her office now "to say hi pass on family plans " she says at deloitte &amp touches employee regulatory and capital markets consulting practice managers have been promoting a ban on nonessential weekend email since it was announced last january says leslie knowlton houston human resources leader for the practice gradually employees like jeff craft a manager in the group have caught on although he still works almost as much on weekends he picks the hours he works rather than feeling chained to incoming email on his computer he says even ms volpi now u s cellulars director of product management and marketing has become a fan of her bosss ban gradually she realized that reading and responding to all the email she was sending was probably a burden to co workers now she makes a point of visiting co workers on fridays business she says isnt only about emailing "cold reports" and being efficient she says "its about human beings and interaction " clients have benefited too says brion zaeh pbds senior vice president client relations his team has gotten better acquainted with co workers throughout the company and when a client recently needed a big order sent quickly his group teamed up with co workers to work seven days a week until the shipments were out "if we had just done it the same old way " with heavy reliance on email relationships he says "theres no way it would have been successful " email sue shellenbarger wsj com
