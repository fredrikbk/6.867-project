style on style how a designer woos power and celebrity among the swarm of celebrities and well wishers backstage at giambattista vallis runway show in paris last week it would have been easy to think justo artigas was just another flashy hanger on but mr artigas whose job is to make sure famous faces wear mr vallis clothes is one of the secret weapons behind mr vallis quick rise in the fashion industry these days after just two and a half years with his own line mr valli has developed a loyal following among power brokers and socialites on both sides of the atlantic although the brand is still small the company declined to give figures it is showing up on movie stars like sarah jessica parker at red carpet events and getting a lot of publicity from retailers like saks fifth avenue unlike most new designers mr valli has managed to cater to two constituencies that can often be incompatible starlets and grandes dames with the help of mr artigas he catches the attention of young buzz generating celebrities like jessica biel and the olsen twins who love his frothy short party dresses but his own high society contacts many of them forged in his earlier career at emanuel ungaro help him appeal to powerful women patricians like lee radziwill the year old sister of jacqueline kennedy onassis and professional women who appreciate his elegant draping "i would love to dress actress gena rowlands " mr valli said in a recent interview casting his eyes heavenward mr vallis gambit is to attract celebrities to wear his clothes generating buzz without alienating professional women and others who can afford to wear his clothes most new designers try to carve out narrow constituencies and then build on them but he puts clothes in every collection that appeal to both types of client mr valli who left his post as artistic director at ungaro in blends gently edgy design with careful couture techniques and fabrics his spring collection last week included a black minimalist caftan and hot pink frocks the fall clothes in stores now range from elaborate party dresses to a classy black suit that could adorn any chairwoman of the board many of the fabrics are so thickly woven they might stand on their own reminiscent of balenciaga for spring mr valli wrapped swarovski crystals in tulle so they wouldnt glint crassly and draped models in huge earthy baubles of rough turquoise he said he was inspired by the jordanian desert no doubt a tribute to queen rania al abdullah of jordan a client as well as by the light artists james turrell and dan flavin giambattista valli isnt for the faint of pocketbook prices range from a &# cocktail dress to a &# giraffe print coat the giambattista valli label is controlled by italys gilmar group which also owns the iceberg fashion sportswear line mr valli also designs for iceberg thus far the designer has drawn the patronage of stores like bergdorf goodman and saks fifth avenue saks in fact has been advertising giambattista valli in full page spreads alongside dior in its direct mail catalogs and in the september issue of vogue the queen of jordan wore his designs on several outings during a recent trip to new york providing him with enough name dropping fodder to last for months and when the italian socialite margherita missoni attended her th birthday fete in milan last february she snubbed her familys own famously striped knit designs and wore instead a crimson couture like creation from the latest season of giambattista valli still his recent success is due as much to who sits in the front row of his fashion shows as to what he creates ms radziwill was one of the most notable people attending his first show in by the following year he managed to place celebrities katie holmes and victoria beckham in the front row thats where mr artigas who was hired away from dolce &amp gabbana two and a half years ago comes in "its my job to place the clothes" with celebrities said mr artigas recently wearing a shiny silver jacket with a dolce &amp gabbana cap atop his balding pate "now im saying no more than im saying yes it took me five years to get to that point at dolce &amp gabbana " while its common for big red carpet designers like dolce &amp gabbana to have a celebrity wrangler like mr artigas getting the clothes into places where they will be photographed it is more rare for a small designer in turn mr artigas has his own secret weapons one of them is cristina ehrlich who is a somebody in hollywood fashion along with her partner estee stanley ms ehrlichs roster of high powered clients includes penelope cruz demi moore ms biel and the olsen twins several of whom have been seen wearing giambattista valli at last weeks show ms ehrlich brought along jennifer morrison an actress best known for her role on the television show "house m d " and sat her in the front row decked out in a black giambattista valli dress with stiff couture ruffles running vertically down the front ms morrison was giddy afterwards backstage "i love this stuff " she said posing for any camera that came her way ms ehrlich is so enamored of the giambattista valli clothes that she abandoned ms morrison in her paris hotel room last week and spent the days before the show helping mr valli assemble runway outfits "bar none hes whats going on " said ms ehrlich mr artigass efforts sometimes go awry when he went to ferry mary kate and ashley olsen to the runway show last week he arrived at their paris hotel only to learn the twins had decided to skip the show for an unrelated photo opportunity nonetheless mr artigas says recent interest from celebrity stylists bodes well for mr valli this season says mr artigas "theres going to be a lot of red carpet " email christina binkley
