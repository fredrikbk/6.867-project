new incentives may bolster public service student loan law forgives debt for those who pursue careers in altruistic fields a law president bush signed last month drew a lot of attention for trying to make college more affordable for many less trumpeted were provisions that support the altruists among us the law signed by president bush last month appropriates &# billion to cut interest rates on certain federal student loans and increase grant aid for low income students over the next five years but the college cost reduction and access act also creates an important incentive for all students to enter fields of public service by offering to forgive what could amount to tens of thousands of dollars of school debt per student the legislation broadly defines public service to include a wide range of occupations such as public health public education working for a nonprofit organization and serving in law enforcement or as a public interest lawyer the education department says it expects to issue guidance to clarify exactly which professions will qualify "it changes the whole calculus of the situation " says honora spillane a year old law student at syracuse university after graduation ms spillane wants to work in state and local government but for a long time she wasnt sure she could afford to now the new law makes that a more realistic goal she says the median starting salary for public interest law is about &# compared with pay at private law firms that can start at &# for a highly rated graduate according to philip schrag a professor at georgetown university who directs the law schools public interest law scholars program students coming out of private law schools carry about &# in debt on average if public service "was your career goal and that was why you went to law school then this law is going to make it possible " mr schrag says he says the legislation could potentially reshape the field of public service providing more lawyers to serve more people such as middle income families who cant afford a lawyer but arent poor enough to qualify for legal aid heres how the public service loan forgiveness program will work for people working in public service the balance of a student loan is forgiven after monthly payments equal to years lets say a single borrower graduates with &# in student debt and gets a public service job that pays &# a year with annual raises of because of the relatively low salary the borrower would qualify for a newly created program known as income based repayment which stretches out the repayment period beyond the usual years monthly repayments for this graduate would be between &# and &# after years the individual has repaid &# and is forgiven the balance of &# assuming interest of the current rate for federal stafford loans in order to qualify for the program your loans must come under the federal direct loan program if you borrowed from banks and other commercial lenders for your federal student loans you can still qualify for the program by consolidating them through the direct loan program some colleges offer direct federal loans while others work through commercial lenders only your college financial aid office should have more information on the program or you can check finaid org which offers financial aid information and has a page at www finaid org loans publicservice phtml other professional groups also are expecting heightened interest in public service work "we have low salaries and a very high debt burden " says rebecca myers special assistant to the executive director at the national association of social workers "were really glad to see that theres some movement on this and we believe it will help social workers " for medical school graduates who carry an average &# of debt the provision could save up to &# in student loan payments by working in public service for at least years according to the association of american medical colleges the group says it is seeking clarification on which specific types of jobs qualify as "public health" workers under the terms of the new provision some caveats federal law treats the amount of any debt forgiven as taxable income also if a borrower gets married the couples combined income is counted toward calculating monthly payments and the borrower might not qualify for income based repayment beyond public service the new law aims to make college more affordable for middle income and low income students by gradually halving the interest rate on federally subsidized stafford loans to from currently by the stafford loan program is the governments biggest student loan program with more than six million undergraduates expected to borrow more than &# billion for the academic year more than half of those typically qualify for subsidized loans where interest accrued in school is paid for by the federal government tuition increases continue to surpass the typical rate of inflation average tuition and fees at four year private colleges in are &# higher than they were a year earlier add in room and board and the total comes to &# at public colleges total tuition and fees in for in state students is &# more than a year ago the law also helps needy students who receive pell grants the maximum amount that students can currently receive is &# that gets increased to &# by next year then to &# starting in and then to &# by however to offset the cost of the additional spending the government has reduced payments to banks and other lenders who acting as middlemen issue the federal loans to students these lenders in turn have begun scaling back a host of discounts they had previously offered students amid competition for borrowers the law also makes some improvements in the federal formula that schools use to determine aid it doubles the amount of a dependent students earnings that are sheltered to &# by from &# for it also raises the income threshold below which a family isnt expected to contribute to college to &# from the current &# doing the right thing new legislation aims to lure more graduates to public service students can have federal debt forgiven after years in public service work qualifying jobs range from public health to law enforcement and public interest law conditions apply so check with your financial aid office or get information at www finaid org
