panel backs medtronic stent experts advise fda to approve device if clot risk studied washington a food and drug administration panel recommended the agency approve a medtronic inc drug coated stent despite concerns about the long term risk of developing blood clots and questions about the devices effectiveness the panel of outside medical experts said medtronics data presented in support of its device known as endeavor showed "there was adequate" assurance of safety and "reasonable assurance" of effectiveness the panel unanimously recommended the fda approve the device on the condition the agency require medtronic to conduct a five year post approval study with at least patients to examine blood clot risk the company had proposed a similar study already two drug coated stents are on the u s market boston scientific corp s taxus and johnson &amp johnsons cypher sales have fallen since concerns surfaced last year that some patients might develop blood clots more than a year after the devices are implanted stents are tiny mesh cylinders that prop open arteries coated stents such as endeavor use medication to fight renarrowing that can lead to repeat procedures endeavor was implanted in more than patients in three main clinical studies one compared endeavor to patients with medtronics nondrug coated stent or bare metal stent known as driver the other studies compared endeavor to patients who had the cypher or taxus stents overall the fda said studies showed endeavor was as safe as the other devices when looking at death rates and serious problems such as heart attacks and blood clots and it was more effective than the driver stent at keeping previously clogged arteries open however there were mixed signals in the studies that looked at whether endeavor was as effective as cypher and taxus the most recent study released last week which looked at endeavor and taxus showed a higher rate of vessel renarrowing as many as nine months after the endeavor device was implanted but fda reviewer andrew farb said it isnt clear whether the narrowing is clinically significant and whether it would be enough to require patients to undergo a repeat procedure to reopen the artery several panel members including john hirshfeld a cardiologist at the university of pennsylvania said endeavor when compared to taxus appeared equally safe but looked slightly less effective bram zuckerman director of the fdas cardiovascular device division said device makers need only to prove a device is reasonably safe and effective and not necessarily better than a similar device on the market to gain fda approval the endeavor taxus study which involved patients showed endeavor had a rate of stent thrombosis or stent related clots at nine months against a rate for taxus this difference wasnt considered statistically significant the study showed six cases of stent related clots for endeavor but none occurred beyond the first six months of the study the fda said no major safety concerns including late blood clots have emerged when looking at patients who have had the endeavor device at least a year and patients who have had the device three years however the agency has said current stent trials typically arent large enough to address concerns about blood clots that might develop several months or years after a stent is implanted medtronic has said it plans to follow patients in the endeavor taxus study at least five years scott ward president of medtronics cardiovascular business said that the company was pleased with the panels decision and that it would work with the fda to bring endeavor to the market quickly "we believe that endeavor provides the optimal combination of safety efficacy and deliverability " he said
