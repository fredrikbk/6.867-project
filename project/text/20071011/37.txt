dont tell your boss but there is a way to im despite blocks does your company stop you from downloading instant messaging software in an effort to keep you from wasting precious time well theres a way to get around company barriers so you can chat away with family and friends just use an internet based service so that you can chat from a web page without having to install any software which might be blocked by a firewall i tested two such services meebo at www meebo com and koolim at www koolim com both are free these services let you simultaneously log in to multiple im accounts and communicate with people with various services if you have a friend who uses yahoo messenger for example and another who likes msn messenger you can chat with either another plus meebo and koolim are far less vulnerable to viruses than downloadable applications theyre also more efficient saving users the hassle of installing multiple programs on a computer this is especially handy for people with old computers that slow down when running several applications meebo has a well designed sleek interface that makes it appealing to even the least tech savvy from its home page users simply sign in for different im services microsofts msn messenger yahoo messenger googles gtalk or jabber and america onlines aim or icq your buddy list will be combined automatically you dont have to register but if you do you get perks such as a single sign on for all of your accounts and the ability to share files save chat logs and store conversations i tried meebo on my work windows pc and my ibook at home and it worked well on both to start chatting you just log in to any of the im services by entering the screen name and password you already have with a service or by picking a new name password and services your buddy list will appear in a window on the right side of the page with each name marked by an icon denoting the service the person uses once in your buddy list you can add or delete a contact message or join a group chat the service also offers meebome a way to chat from your own web site bloggers can use this to start a conversation with site visitors who log in to their meebo account it also shows how many users are on the site at any time but meebo like most such web services lacks the ability for audio and video chats basic features on installed im software if youre used to plugging in a webcam and headgear to chat with friends these services might not be for you meebo also doesnt have the standard send button thats on installed im software instead you press a key on your keyboard sharing files using meebo is tricky too only meebo account holders can send files although anyone can receive them when i sent a pdf file to my friend on her installed msn messenger she received a message and a link that rerouted her to meebos home page with no further guidance when i sent her the same file after she logged in to her msn using meebo she could open the file koolim also connects users to multiple im accounts from one web page it gives you the option to create an online account so you dont need separate log ins for each im service youll encounter you can select an embedded or a pop up version of the service the embedded version shows your buddy list and messages as windows tied to a web page while the pop up version lets you move the windows around the screen you can choose to display all of your buddies or only the ones online in your buddy list window you can add and delete names and log in to or out of a service i didnt like having text ads appear at the bottom of the im window in koolim or the fact that unlike meebo there isnt a time stamp on messages to tell you when they arrived it also doesnt allow you to send files as meebo does and it doesnt let you save conversations or chat logs koolims lack of some of these basic features might make it less appealing to consumers especially those who ponder swapping it with their desktop software i preferred meebo but both services are good alternatives to installed im if youre willing to do without audio and video features you can email me at sarmad ali wsj com walter s mossberg is on vacation
