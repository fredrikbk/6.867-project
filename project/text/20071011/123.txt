the evening wrap a bit better balanced online edition trade data bolstered best case scenarios for rebalancing the global economy as the weak dollar and strong global demand stoked the u s export engine in august the u s deficit in international trade of goods and services shrank to &# billion from julys downwardly revised &# billion the commerce department reported thursday wall street economists were betting that the august trade gap would be larger with those surveyed ahead of the report by dow jones newswires predicting a &# billion shortfall during the month u s exports grew to &# billion led by sales of industrial supplies like gold cotton and chemicals meanwhile imports fell to &# billion despite high oil prices whet by the weak dollar global appetite for u s goods has helped the domestic economy this year and todays report suggested that trend stretched clear through the third quarter overall the report could be seen as consistent with the rosiest of prospects for the global economy in which a u s economy that is huffing and puffing can smoothly pass the baton to faster growth foreign markets goldman sachs economists wrote that "the strong export increase about reflects the strong world economy and the effects of continued dollar depreciation " they cautioned however that "imports declining could be a reflection of weakness in domestic demand " if such is the case the fatigue could prove contagious said economist david resler of nomura securities stronger demand and economic conditions abroad "may not endure if weaker u s imports begins to undercut growth overseas " he said "such a development would probably curtail overseas capital spending and cool demand for u s made capital goods " even as a weak dollar can help bolster the u s economy it doesnt come without fairly immediate risks mostly in the form of inflation a labor department report out today showed that headline import prices matched wall street expectations in september by rising after falling in august the report also detailed the fifth straight rise in prices of goods from china suggesting the u s can no longer count on cheap imports from that country to offset domestic inflationary pressures even so some economists pointed out that import prices were broadly contained in areas outside the volatile oil and food sectors they say that suggests that weak dollar hasnt put too much pressure on the prices of overseas products "for those who worry that the falling dollar will cause import prices to surge think again " wrote joel naroff president and chief economist at naroff economic advisors "it is just not happening " other economists notably those polled in the latest wsj com forecasting survey also have been feeling optimistic about the direction
