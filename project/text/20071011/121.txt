and earnings misses was slightly worse and more broad based than imagined of late higher end shoppers had ridden out the economic waves that tend to batter consumers with less disposable income so weakness at pricier stores such as j c penneys and nordstrom was something of a surprise said bill dreher a senior retailing analyst at deutsche bank weather typically plays less of a role for more affluent shoppers but it could have played a part he said a weightier influence might be the performance of financial markets and the housing sector which have a strong correlation to sales at such stores as such he pointed out that sales at nordstroms have actually been firming up along with financial markets in recent weeks still he notes that soft performance at giant retailers such as target and wal mart "does reflect a consumer spending slowdown " thomson financials ms martis says that because of economic uncertainty "the consumer is being defensive and holding off on their spending "
