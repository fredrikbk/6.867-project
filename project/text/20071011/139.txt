whats the hindi word for dot com long dominated by english the language of its founders the internet is about to take a big step toward becoming a truly world wide web starting on monday web surfers will be able to test internet addresses in languages that dont use the roman alphabet the letters used in english and most other european languages the development means the domain name suffix the part of a web address after the dot such as "com" or "org" could now be in a language like japanese or hindi until now that part of the address had to use the roman alphabet under the internets system of addresses overseen by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers or icann a private nonprofit organization the change follows icanns decision in to allow the part of a domain name preceding the dot called the secondary level domain name to be in a language that uses a non roman alphabet russians for example will be able to type web addresses entirely in the cyrillic characters used in russian language instead of having to revert to english for the last part the change also involves languages such as chinese arabic and korean spoken by billions of people many of whom arent yet internet users "there are a billion people on the internet which means there are five billion not on it " said paul hoffman a santa cruz calif based programmer who created the standards behind the so called internationalized domain names the new names "are not for the current users but for the next billion " web users in non roman language countries have typically needed keyboards that could type in both roman and local characters to access the internet china uses a roman alphabet equivalent called pinyin which is then converted into chinese characters english speaking users with western style keyboards wont be able to type the non roman domain names directly into a web browser instead they will be able to access the new domain names by clicking on links from search engines or other web sites the question of international domain suffixes has been loaded with geopolitical tension internet users outside the u s in recent years have clamored for the right to have domain names in their own language they argue their internet culture and usage are hindered by the requirement to learn english the issue fanned broader discontent that the key architecture of the internet called the domain name system is overseen by one country the u s icann is based in marina del rey calif and reports to the u s department of commerce icann which the u s government created in approves new domain name suffixes among other technical matters the criticism came to a head two years ago at a united nations summit when the u s government fought off demands from more than countries to give up its unilateral oversight of the domain name system icann agreed to pursue internationalized domain names as early as but progress was slow due to technical considerations and bureaucratic delays in trying to coordinate so many entities in different countries some critics of the process said that since icann is based in the u s it wasnt a priority having lost their patience some countries most notably china south korea and some arabic speaking nations as well as private entities in europe have created domain names in their own languages using non roman letters independent of icann these separate systems known as alternative roots can create online confusion with duplicated domain names or multiple addresses for the same sites "the arab countries dont want alternative roots " said baher esmat a former official in egypts ministry of communication and information technology and now a cairo based representative of icann "we just want our country codes in the arabic language if that happens then there is no reason to continue" with the alternative roots he said country code refers to the domain name assigned to each country such as dot uk for britain in egypt about seven million people or of the population use the internet according to mr esmat most of the users are well educated and speak at least some english to get the next of the population online however having domain names in arabic is critical he said the egyptian government is moving ahead with various e government initiatives such as online applications for drivers licenses that likely would catch on only if the web sites were entirely in arabic he said "the potential users are not able to use the internet unless its in their native language " said mr esmat some critics argue that enabling the growth of languages on the web in particular those that dont use the roman alphabet in itself amounts to fragmenting the internet since it encourages regional use around a local language rather than global interaction based on a popular language like english "theoretically all pilots speak english when trying to land a plane " said paul mockapetris who invented the domain name system in the early s the internationalized domain names are "a huge opportunity for balkanizing the internet or uniting it well know which way it goes in about years " the domain name system that mr mockapetris designed and that is still in use today allows internet addresses limited to characters known as ascii consisting of the numbers zero to nine the letters of the alphabet and the hyphen the internet stems from work done in the s and s funded by the u s department of defense largely for military purposes now as the internet grows beyond its u s origins myriad technical and policy questions about how other languages will actually work in domain names are cropping up india for example has several dozen major dialects raising the question of which one should be used for its country code in hindi its not clear who would make that decision concerns also exist about people using characters from other languages to dupe users with bogus web sites a practice called phishing scammers have already used the russian cyrillic a to make a fake paypal web site since arabic is spoken in multiple countries it remains to be determined what entity decides how that domain name suffix would be handled unlike in the u s where domain names are bought and sold on the open market in most of these countries likely to use the new domain suffixes governments manage and parcel out the domain names "this is the first time we will see fully localized domain names " said tina dam the icann official heading up the project "we still have to make sure that things will be secure and stable thats why were testing it to make sure it works " companies that sell domain names both the wholesale registries and the retail registrars expect a windfall once the names are approved domain names are booming growing by in the second quarter from a year earlier according to verisign inc a registry that manages dot com and dot net the bulk of that growth comes from country code domain names such as chinas dot cn which more than quadrupled from a year ago neustar inc which manages dot biz said its business in non english domain names has grown by more than from last year with much of that growth in south korea english is still used by of all internet users but other languages are growing rapidly online chinese now no online as the language of of users has grown nearly fivefold during the past seven years according to internetworldstats com the other non roman languages included in the test are persian greek yiddish tamil and simplified chinese icann says the languages were chosen based on the interest expressed by the various countries on monday icann will post links on its web site www icann org to test sites in non roman languages users can click on the links to visit the test sites leave comments about them and create their own versions of web pages that use the non roman suffixes icann expects working addresses in the new languages to be available by the end of next year
