the sooner back flip for a case study in the political power of trial lawyers consider oklahoma the public wants tort reform the state legislature wants it and even democratic governor brad henry claims to want it yet that didnt stop mr henry from recently vetoing an impressive reform bill at the urging of his plaintiff lawyer funders oklahoma sure needs something the state is th on the u s chamber of commerces rankings of state liability systems it suffers badly in comparison to neighboring texas which has used its sweeping tort reform to lure business across the border malpractice premiums are high and rural areas in oklahoma report shortages of such specialty doctors as obstetricians the good news is that oklahomans understand the trouble and want change a public furor erupted in when former state senate leader stratton taylor a partner in a personal injury law firm was caught inviting trial lawyers unhappy with the texas tort reform to sue in oklahoma tort reform has since become a top election issue the issue helped republicans draw even with democrats in the state senate in for the first time in history it also helped state senator susan paddack prevail in a democratic primary runoff against a favorite of the trial bar last month ms paddack became the sole democrat to break senate ranks and pass comprehensive tort reform on a vote the bills reforms included a stricter definition of "frivolous" lawsuits a cap on pain and suffering awards new standards for expert witnesses and the elimination of joint and several liability most impressive it would have required anyone who wanted to join a class action lawsuit to sign an agreement to actually be represented by an attorney the bill would have gone a long way toward making oklahoma a far more welcoming place for new business and job creation mr henry has been claiming to support reform for three years and at one point he promised to "out texas" texas on the issue then again mr henry is himself an attorney and was elected with the help of trial bar donations he may also have assumed hed never have to act on his promises because a heretofore democratic senate could always be counted on to kill any reform well mr henry has now shown his untrue colors as soon as the senate passed the bill democrats and the plaintiffs bar dug in democratic attorney general drew edmondson issued a hastily written opinion saying the legislation would make it harder to prevent pollution in the state trial lawyers took their usual line claiming many provisions were "unconstitutional " mr henry used all of this malarkey as an excuse to veto the bill even for a politician this was an impressive back flip with a twist off the high bar mr henry says he wants to work out a compromise but he delayed his veto long enough to give the legislature little time in this session meanwhile what he wants the legislature to abandon is the heart of the bill including the cap on economic damages what he says hell accept isnt even "texas lite " having won re election last year mr henry now faces no electoral pressure to stick to his campaign promises but we hope oklahomans keep reminding him that his double cross is hurting everyone who wants to do business in their state
