fashion journal the gatekeeper how posh hotel sizes up guests ever wonder what the maitre d is taking in as you walk into a high end restaurant or what the saleslady at bergdorfs knows about you plenty count on it theyre acting on information youve given them without even knowing it the staff of the peninsula beverly hills once gave bill pohlad the film producer behind "brokeback mountain " a new york architecture book when he thought he was being secretive about looking at manhattan condominiums "its almost a psychic thing " he says "im not sure how they do that " the peninsula staff is famous for keenly serving and observing the influential in their restaurants spa and hotel rooms the hotels managing director ali kasikci is something of an anthropologist of status signals he is highly aware of the delicate hierarchy of fashion and symbols of influence and he looks for small details to tell him what a pair of jeans and a t shirt cant in addition to his own research the hotel keeps careful records on its guests tastes as well as what they spend there he has perfected his own branch of semiotics interpreting signs of wealth and sophistication he says he doesnt have a fashionistas skill at identifying designers but he did point out one guests charvet shirt and hes a big fan of hermes more often recognizing an influential guest requires putting together the pieces of a puzzle using both eyes and ears a woman in good jewels but poor clothes may have recently inherited wealth he notes in mr pohlads case the staff had noticed he traveled frequently to new york though they werent aware he was in the market for a condo when they gave him the book "its like a skunk " mr kasikci said one afternoon looking around his lobby "theres enough scent being sprayed around that you can connect the dots " it turns out that this is a term mr kasikci uses a lot ive eaten lunch at the peninsula twice in the past month in the midst of nancy reagan film mogul harvey weinstein and jamie oliver the celebrity chef theyre famous im not yet when i arrived for an interview the parking valet manager whipped open my car door and suggested "you are with the wall street journal " among the dozens of people coming and going what gave me away i initially blamed my not chanel wardrobe or it could have been my infiniti or just something in my air when i asked the valet juan carlos rivera he gallantly shrugged and smiled mr kasikci said mr rivera is good at "connecting the dots " for the guests these distinctions can translate into the amount of pampering they receive at the hotels a m meeting one recent morning managers ran through the days incoming guests each of whom were paying &# to &# a night for their room except for a friend of restaurateur wolfgang puck who rated a discount to &# as a favor among these arrivals were jet set sacramento kings owner gavin maloof a japanese movie star and an array of bankers chief level executives and their wives in one case the entire senior staff carefully noted that a regular guest from chicago would arrive this trip "with a companion not the wife " mr weinstein was coming in for his th stay along with his fiancee and their entourage each guests name was called out and the number of their stays if frequent the restaurant had been notified of its coming arrivals as had the spa staff took turns listing special services to be doled out in staccato shorthand "special flowers " "fresca in room " "monogram " pillowcases at the peninsula come in three tiers no monogram two letter or three letter monograms of the guests initials top dogs get three letter monograms which are harder to use with multiple guests mr kasikcis sensibilities played a big role in who got what diana jenkins the wife of a british banker was slated to receive a &# gift certificate to escada until the hotelier connected the dots he knew she sends expensive clothes to the hotels in house dry cleaner and hed seen her mentioned in the social pages "shes a shopper and a very fashionable lady " he ordered "give her van cleef &amp arpels " thus the ladys smart appearance upgraded her to a &# spending spree at the jeweler proving that an investment in fashion can pay dividends lest you think that van cleef is the ultimate reward the hotels most frequent and discerning guests may receive certificates for made to order zegna suits worth several thousand dollars this sort of bid for a guests loyalty would not be offered to someone deemed unable to appreciate it as donald trump once told me while exiting his on the house suite at the beverly hills hotel "those who can afford it dont have to pay it isnt fair " perhaps its obvious that the snazziest vehicles await their owners at the porte cochere rather than disappearing into the depths of the garage but guests with flashy cars sparkling jewels and other obvious signs of big spending may also find that mr rivera has washed their car and stocked it with bottles of fiji water during lunch interpreting those signals requires care because "we can be very very wrong " says mr kasikci during the morning meeting stewart rahr stopped by to say hello dressed in a rumpled golf shirt and cap mr rahr a pharmaceutical executive who recently paid a reported &# million for his hamptons home is one of the hoteliers favorite frequent guests after mr rahr waved hello and left mr kasikci said that mr rahr often runs around the hotel in casual even disheveled clothes and thats just fine with mr kasikci because it fits his concept of a pecking order a billionaire has earned the privilege of dressing the way he chooses mr kasikci believes in maintaining a careful line between servers and those who are served he dresses impeccably in zegna suits he wears only hermes ties maintaining a collection of of them each worn five to six times before being "retired" to a cabinet with electronically controlled tie racks in his closet he orders his monogrammed shirts custom from a hong kong tailor and in deference to his sense of social order he orders from the same tailor for mr rivera the valet "but in a lesser fabric of course " "you dont get to act like a guest until you are independently wealthy " mr kasikci says mr kasikci has been offended by mr weinsteins colorful limo driver freddy baroth who often spends afternoons waiting around the lobby "he sits around smoking a cigar and people think he works here " says mr kasikci he has given mr baroth some zegna ties to spruce up his appearance mr baroth has gotten the message sort of he showed up the other day in ray bans and a three day stubble wearing a baggy pinstripe suit "normally when i drive clients i wear jeans and a t shirt " he said puffing on a cigar in his place in the pecking order though mr weinstein enjoys the privilege of carelessness at lunch recently the hollywood hotshot could be seen talking with his mouth full and he had his elbows on the table nevertheless "we love him " mr kasikci said
