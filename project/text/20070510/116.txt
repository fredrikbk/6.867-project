wonder land after the bush muddle when mitt romney john mccain rudy giuliani barack obama and hillary clinton were hauling their ambition around the country a month or so ago the primaries a year off and the general election nearly two years their march to the horizon looked to me like a parody of serious politics i was wrong its too short it would take a lifetime to figure out who these guys really are and longer than that to decode hillary clinton yet come january one will run the nation times running out fred thompsons boom voiced boomlet is said to reflect republican dissatisfaction with the announced candidates what that dissatisfaction consists of is hard to say given there were men onstage in last weeks debate in the haunted house of the reagan library nearly all experienced and serious republican politicians thats a pretty high level of dissatisfaction what do gop voters want what they want i suspect is not so much mr right as a clearer understanding than theyve got now of what it means to be a republican the gop muddle is george bushs fault after more than six years of the bush presidency the republican template is broken largely this is the result of presiding over a war presidency for nearly two terms the war has dropped virtually all else in the nations political life into the footnotes one has to wonder what the political legacy of the bush presidency would have consisted of without september or the iraq war his commitment to incentivizing reaganite tax cuts is solid george bush is a social conservative his supreme court nominees notwithstanding the miers hiccup articulated recognizably conservative legal philosophies but he lacked enough political capital in his second term to privatize social security or secure personal health savings accounts so theres little to mitigate the ideological confusion of lavish spending on education and prescription drug insurance if he hadnt needed congresss support for a war would he have issued an astonishing zero vetoes of their spending bills the bush presidency leaves behind a puddle of confusion after the bush presidency the good the bad and the endless what republicans most want to do is simply reboot themselves and their party what do i stand for now what do i want to achieve in the next election do i just want my party to win philosophy be damned or do i mainly want my ideas elevated and argued or ne plus ultra translation after this i can die do i simply want "her" candidacy defeated this isnt the kind of campaign that appeals to the pundit class accustomed to dividing all life into a versus b or pollsters percentages theres no clear front runner setting the daily agenda in either party that exposes to view the fact that the parties themselves have become shifting inkblots with no meaning until one candidate wins the nomination and redefines the party for awhile the only people giddy about our current blank slates are the political scientists dial one up and hell tell you that the muddle is the normal condition of the american political mind most of the time poli sci profs sit unnoticed up in the trees watching the political parade go by and writing articles for professional journals such as "electoral choices and core value change the presidential campaign" or the provocative "another lesson about public opinion during the clinton lewinsky scandal " the short version of which is most people most of the time didnt pay close attention to the clinton scandal and thats the rub political scientists have known for over years when detailed election data began to appear that most of the millions of people who vote have no settled political ideology you and your friends may watch all the political talk shows on sunday morning but most people dont the originator of the notion of politics as eternally wet cement was philip converse of the university of michigan his study "the american voter " with angus campbell and other michigan colleagues remains the basic starting point for all arguments over why people vote it is why a john mccain or hillary clinton pay political professionals huge fees to lie awake nights trying to match the content of their candidates next speech with whats tripping through the minds of plus listeners in short divining the collective mind of million u s presidential election voters remains gloriously a deep and unsolvable mystery in this spirit last weeks gop debate ridiculed as a jumbled fiasco struck me as useful because it was a jumble despite the expectation of rote base pandering replies on abortion and such the candidates often struggled to fine tune their thoughts reflecting the complexity and fluidity of what gop voters actually think example the moment when the candidates revolted against chris mathewss effort to reduce support for embryonic stem cell research to a yes or no answer sen sam brownback gave strong disapproval "i will not with all due respect to mrs reagan and her desires here " sen mccain approved "i believe that we need to fund this i would remind you that these stem cells are either going to be discarded or perpetually frozen " others attempted to describe work being done with adult stem cells or the dilemma of extinguishing life on behalf of others lives this is roughly the arguments one would hear among most groups of republicans on iraq while there was little support for a democratic date certain pullout there was a range of views around a theme of support from mr giulianis hardline to the increased diplomatic engagement of sam brownback and gov jim gilmore to rep duncan hunters gradual rotation of iraqi troops into the fight and ours out of it include rep ron pauls never should have done it and you probably have the current spectrum of republican voter thinking on iraq so what if its a jumble in may the idea that some monolith called "the republicans" wants one perfectly programmed candidate is preposterous more "data" will emerge this year as voters rotate these candidates into focus and notwithstanding the distance most americans put between themselves and the daily political fishmarket numerous studies of political opinion formation have shown that most people trudge through these campaigns with "core" personal beliefs which they eventually deploy to fix their opinion of john rudy mitt fred newt hillary barack and the others out of this cloud descends a president too bad the campaign is so short write to henninger wsj com
