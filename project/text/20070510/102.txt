the blame game revisited mistakes were made by carol tavris and elliot aronson harcourt pages &# when don imus got caught out using offensive language on his radio show last month he issued an apology actually employing the word "sorry" in his official statement not to mention "thoughtless and stupid" soon after he was fired he might have been better off attempting one of those "non apology apologies" that are a ubiquitous part of our culture not least in the realm of business mcdonalds in having neglected to mention that its french fries contain beef by products shied away from forthrightly saying to its angry vegetarian customers "we made a mistake " instead it used the passive voice the infamous "mistakes were made" formulation thereby avoiding a direct admission of wrongdoing the same phrasing appeared not long ago in a statement by cardinal edward egan of new york referring to clergymen who may have failed to deal properly with charges of child molestation cardinal egan said "if in hindsight we discover that mistakes may have been made i am deeply sorry " the mangled grammar shifting from active to passive to active voice from a conditional "if" clause to a main clause with the wrong verb form it should be "i will be deeply sorry" suggests a confused point of view at best i borrow these two examples from carol tavris and elliot aronsons anecdote rich "mistakes were made " a ramble through the evasive tactics we employ when weve done something wrong and dont want to face up to it the authors tell of an ethics professor who neglects to alert his hotel that he spilled ink on the bedspread in his room because "management expects such accidents and builds their cost into the price of rooms " an overzealous prosecutor justifies his manipulation of evidence because the accused is "a bad guy even if he didnt commit this particular crime he undoubtedly committed another one " during world war ii when thousands of japanese americans were interned in camps gen john dewitt forced to address the absence of any evidence of japanese american treason declared that "the very fact that no sabotage has taken place is a disturbing and confirming indication that such action will be taken " ms tavris and mr aronson are psychologists and they knit their stories together by citing the theory of "cognitive dissonance " people experience so much "mental discomfort" when they hold two conflicting beliefs "i am a good person" and "i did a bad thing" that they cannot "rest easy until they find a way to reduce it " inevitably this reduction involves their convincing themselves that they didnt do something bad "mistakes were made" is by turns entertaining illuminating and when you recognize yourself in the stories it tells mortifying it is certainly true that we can be artful to the point of self delusion when we feel guilt for something we have done but psychology is arguably only part of the story ms tavris and mr aronson press their diverse stories into a single psychological explanation the dissonance dodge but our multiple forms of apology or verbal self defense can convey shades of real meaning too sometimes persuasively philosophers draw a useful distinction between excuses and justifications excuses occur when the apologist admits a wrongful act but pleads that he is not to be blamed for it usually by claiming that the harm arose unintentionally out of ignorance or duress when worldcoms bernie ebbers told the court "i dont know about technology and i dont know about finance and accounting " he was trying to excuse himself from blame for the companys implosion justifications by contrast get offered when the accused wants to insist that what he did wasnt wrong indeed it was more than proper tyco ceo dennis kozlowski justified the hundreds of millions he received because he "created &# billion in shareholder wealth " juries of course didnt buy either mans versions of the facts yet often excuses can be legitimate conflicts of interest for instance are a notoriously vague category of wrongdoing and politicians among others are often right when they plead ignorance of the thing they have mistakenly failed to disclose and sometimes wrongful acts can be justified by broader effects war think only of "collateral damage" is full of such morally divided moments ms tavris and mr aronson however dismiss excuses and justifications across the board it is always better to accept blame and apologize they say otherwise you are allowing your inflated sense of your own goodness to prevent you from acknowledging the simple fact that you acted badly perhaps so but the effect of the authors zero tolerance policy is to lump in all excuses and justifications even plausible ones with what we might call their evil twins common defenses that really are objectionable have "you ever done a little finessing of expenses on income taxes " the authors ask if so you probably told yourself that it "compensates for the legitimate expenses you forgot about" or that "youd be a fool not to considering that everybody else does " on a first glance it might seem as if the first defense youre rebating to yourself an overpayment you had previously made is a form of plausible justification it is a claim that really you didnt do anything wrong but it is too self referential for such a lofty purpose justifications must be fair to others the irs being the wronged party here not simply so to speak fair to yourself the second defense of tax cheating "everybody else does it" is by contrast a kind of excuse but a bad one it admits wrong but cant even rise to the effort of claiming a special condition of duress say a starving family in need of funds it merely implies conformist pressure and if we are all doing it no one can be blamed it would have been helpful if ms tavris and mr aronson in their instructive survey of our elaborate self exculpating habits had separated out these especially risible versions we must always leave room for excuses that focus on the peculiarities of ones circumstances and for justifications that take into account the interests of everyone but when it comes to excuses that would excuse everybody and justifications that focus only on oneself well there is no excuse for them and they are hardly ever justified mr
