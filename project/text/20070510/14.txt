capital capitalisms vigor may hinge on confronting its risks the contest between capitalism and communism is over china and on some days even russia are moving away from central planning and collective ownership toward markets and private property yet capitalism as practiced in the u s is different from the capitalism practiced in say singapore or saudi arabia "capitalism takes many forms which differ substantially in their implications for economic growth and elimination of poverty " three economists write in "good capitalism bad capitalism " the book identifies four strains of modern capitalism and argues the u s version is particularly well suited to creating and exploiting innovations that boost living standards this is a risky venture harvards ezra vogel celebrated japans brand of capitalism in and lester thurow of the massachusetts institute of technology warned ominously in that unifying western europe was a threat neither proved correct still trying to explain u s success at promoting and harnessing technological change in the past years is a useful exercise the book was written by william baumol an eclectic new york university economist impressively energetic at years old carl schramm president and research director of the kauffman foundation and a recovering health economist and insurance executive and robert litan an economist lawyer who was a budget and antitrust official in the clinton administration disclosure i recently spoke at kauffmans kansas city mo headquarters their taxonomy goes like this in state guided capitalism the government decides which industries get investment and it often controls the banks and usually emphasizes exports no country falls exclusively in any one camp but think of china much of southeast asia and india and to a degree japan this approach has helped economies propel themselves from also rans to the first tier problems emerge the economists say when these economies catch up and no longer have a clear path ahead they tend to invest too much in the wrong places stick too long with yesterdays winners and fail to spot tomorrows in oligarchic capitalism prevalent in parts of latin america and the arab middle east power and wealth are held by a few and economies are organized to make them not the general populace richer this approach has little to recommend it then theres big firm capitalism in which big private enterprises dominate think much of western europe south korea with its chaebols conglomerates japan to a degree and the u s in the era of john kenneth galbraiths "new industrial state " "at its best it generates sufficiently large cash flows to finance continuing incremental improvements in products and services " the authors write "at its worst big firm capitalism can be sclerotic reluctant to innovate and resistant to change " finally there is entrepreneurial capitalism in which small and innovative firms are significant think the u s ireland israel taiwan and increasingly the united kingdom forming a company is easy socially useful entrepreneurship is rewarded institutions provide incentives for innovation and growth a catch all that encompasses everything from openness to trade to sound bankruptcy laws to effective antitrust regulation given the kauffman foundations mission to promote entrepreneurship its no surprise messrs baumol litan and schramm conclude the "best form of capitalism" blends elements of the entrepreneurial and big firm strains the former provides the oomph to imagine and invent technologies that propels economies the latter provides the money and organization to refine and mass produce them the secret to prosperity then is for other economies to find their own ways to be more like the u s along the way the economists make a point often missed in the romanticism about "small business " they arent talking about all small businesses the corner dry cleaner for instance or all the self employed their entrepreneurs are entities that provide a new product or service or develop methods to produce or deliver existing goods and services at lower cost spending a lot of energy and tax money to produce lots of little businesses that make or sell already existing goods or services may be politically appealing but it isnt a strategy for faster economic growth it all sounds great and compelling a capitalism that cannot spur innovation and or display flexibility to reorganize itself cannot be a model in their book though the three touch too lightly on an issue about which mr litan has written previously as he puts it in an interview "an entrepreneurial society is going to be more of a high risk society " the strengths of u s style capitalism are apparent no place in the past quarter century has better mixed the ingredients of talent imagination education science and capital but the risks are apparent too workers who lose jobs and find new ones that pay far less and lack health insurance widening disparities between economic winners and losers challenges posed by stiffening competition from low wage increasingly skilled workers abroad and schools that arent improving as fast as the economy is changing preserving the strengths of american capitalism requires finding a way to reduce the anxiety and harm posed by such risks without losing the entrepreneurial vigor thats the hard part
