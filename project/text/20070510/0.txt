a cultural conversation with frank langella understanding nixon from the inside out new york the half dozen dark suits and white shirts that hang outside frank langellas dressing room at the bernard b jacobs theatre in new york are among the few props the year old actor has allowed himself when summoning up the blasted soul of richard m nixon in peter morgans hit play "frost nixon" a loose re creation of the television interviews between the british talk show host david frost played by michael sheen and the disgraced ex u s president mr langella has eschewed a prosthetic ski nose or heavy makeup and succeeded in an acclaimed performance that critic terry teachout called in these pages "all the more remarkable given the fact that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to tricky dick " offstage the contrast is even more striking after a wednesday matinee the soft spoken film and theater star demonstrates a comfort with himself that the politician never remotely found despite more than half a century in the worlds spotlight whereas nixon behaved in public with haunted desperate anxiety as if his body were on loan and had to be returned before the stroke of midnight mr langella drapes his large toned frame over a chair in his sitting room legs dangling he is dressed in a black leotard his silver hair cropped short his lemur like eyes watched this interviewer with a courteous stare that was nothing like the twitching evasive looks nixon gave mr frost and virtually everyone else the touching sympathy that the play conveys for the awkward and aggrieved overachiever while trying not to minimize his destructive bitterness or his crimes is magnified by mr langella who dominates and mostly outflanks the slighter but equally persuasive mr sheen their encounters are directed by michael grandage as at one level a comic battle between a heavyweight boxing champion and a figure skater "we have very little in common " says mr langella about his character "i have an easygoing mediterranean temperament he was almost never at ease but as ive said before hes my guy and i will protect my guy " to become this enigmatic and widely hated figure he watched hours of nixon at the museum of radio and television "my first day of research i got there at eight oclock and this nice lady had pulled stacks of tapes for me " he says with a groan "i put in a tape scribbled something about his hands and then i just absorbed absorbed i watched the checkers speech he was always doing this" he raises his fists "and he came out from behind the desk always acting acting so badly " he sighs "he became better as he got older he was never very good at it but as a young man he was appalling " as a young actor in new york mr langella describes himself as belonging "to the brigade of liberal minded theater people who saw nixon as this silly foolish uningratiating monster " the watergate hearings riveted him "as addictive as the o j simpson trial the monica lewinsky story one of the first truly great melodramas of the television age" but nixons resignation speech on aug provoked no jubilation mr langella was rehearsing a play in williamstown mass that night "we were given an hour off to listen my reaction to the news was how was i going to make this second act scene work i wasnt a very political animal " he seems even less of one now his lengthy habitation of the role the play opened last fall at the donmar warehouse in london before moving to broadway last month has only deepened his empathy for nixons tormented nature and his own age a few years older than nixon was when he sat down with mr frost has also further heightened his suspicion of television one of the plays themes is that the interviewer retained ultimate sway over these confrontations because mr frost knew the power of the close up and the tricks of editing "what you come to realize as you grow older is that no one is his or her sound bite " says mr langella "everybody is increasingly reduced to a frame" he locks his fingers in a rectangle like a film director planning a shot "into a little box imus is our bigot anna nicole is our dumb blonde thats it we make snap judgments theres less and less time for reflection or irony as the play says the first and greatest sin of television is that it simplifies " mr langella spoke to dozens of people who had known nixon in various phases of his life everyone from attorney leonard garment and nixons english biographer jonathan aitken to barbara walters and mike wallace one of his chief sources was the historian frank gannon who himself interviewed nixon extensively in "we had long phone sessions about to hours " recalls mr langella "i let frank talk about the political situation a lot because he wanted to finally i said forget his politics forget events give me your visceral impression of the man frank remembered him sitting in a barcalounger one foot on the floor holding a tumbler with a double scotch listening to the richard rodgers score for victory at sea " his lips curl up into a smile "thats a lot to know about someone " mr langella developed a picture of a man from whom animals shied away "he couldnt get his dog to go near him so he carried little bits of food in his pockets to keep the dog close" and yet he was also told that nixon "could be wonderfully improbably solicitous of other people " at the nixon presidential library in yorba linda he was able to read pre interview notes from nixons assistants diane sawyer and jack brennan saying "we think david frost will ask this we suggest this "this let him watch the interviews knowing nixon had memorized certain lines "he was prepped as they all are " like everyone involved in the production he is genuinely shocked by the plays enthusiastic reception he accepted the part mainly for the chance to spend more time in london "id lived there a lot " he explains "at this stage of life you look closely at the circumstances surrounding a project oh god they want me to make a movie in mobile ala in august pass when youre younger it doesnt matter but i thought eight weeks in london thats kind of nice " the rehearsal process however was slow and painful "the first week i thought this is not my thing i cant do this and then i just did something that i learned as a very young actor which is essential i let myself be terrible "and i was i just was terrible every day i couldnt find the heart of any speeches i would sound like jimmy stewart one day with my voice low wayall wayall and then i would go high and think no thats mr magoo i just was terrible every day "but you know if you allow that to happen in all things in life if you say i dont know how to do this very well im not very good at this and if you keep trying youll improve you look at those people on television who cant dance they get better i just watched those tapes over and over not in an effort to imitate nixon but to understand him " the biggest problem in bringing the role home to new york was that in his view american audiences expected a nixon caricature "i could feel it " he says "they wanted" he waves his arms in the double v for victory salute and gives me the hang dog scowl the performance here required that he find a way to transmit those qualities of nixon he found "endearingly funny but not turn him into such a clown that people didnt take the grotesquerie the heinousness of what he did seriously " when audience members offer mixed praise telling him theyre angry with him for humanizing a villain they had hated all of their adult lives mr langella is quick to point out "theres enough in the play that you can despise him " at the same time he is especially proud that one of nixons grandchildren came up to him after a performance and said "thank you for making my grandfather a human being " just as the interviews with mr frost were a crucial step in restoring the image of the first u s president forced to resign the role has marked a reascendency for mr langella the week before we talked he had learned he would play nixon in the film of the play to be directed by ron howard a low budget independent film that he did on a passionate whim "starting out in the evening " was a favorite at sundance and opens this fall "its a good time and i have had some really bad ones " he says he compares this last year favorably to when he first became a broadway star in the revival of "dracula " his current success may be even sweeter because he is " years older and wiser ive been around long enough to know it will last as long as it will last i do not think this is it this is my moment " then he adds sounding more like "his guy" than perhaps he intended "its all about staying in the game " mr woodward is an arts critic in new york
