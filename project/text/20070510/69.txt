moving the market fasb weighs simplifying complex accounting rule accounting rule makers are quietly debating whether to revamp parts of one of the most cumbersome and complex accounting standards one that has tripped up scores of companies including giants such as general electric co and ford motor co their goal simplify the rule that governs how companies account for complex but commonplace financial instruments used to protect against or hedge swings in the value of things like interest rates and currencies most companies hedge these items because a sudden move can play havoc with their business plans and profits the standard governs what is known as "hedge" accounting which lets companies tie together the value of financial instruments being used to protect or hedge against swings in the value of other items a company making potato chips for example might buy a contract to lock in the price it will pay for potatoes for the next year so if there is a sudden increase in prices its costs dont soar under normal accounting rules the company could post losses on its potato chip sales because costs have risen so much and could post gains on its hedges because their value which is tied to the price of potatoes has gone up under hedge accounting standards these gains and losses are supposed to offset each other and the bottom line isnt affected it still isnt certain that the financial accounting standards board will change the rule known as fas nor is it clear what form any changes could take the discussions mark the first time the board is considering a serious overhaul of the standard which was issued in and went into use in and already two factions have emerged within the body over how to proceed "the question is whether we do anything broadly with fas and if so what would we do " said robert herz fasb chairman he said the review was prompted by the numerous complaints about the rule and uncertainty among companies over how to apply it the accounting standard has led to more than restatements of companies financial results in the past two years according to a recent report by glass lewis &amp co a proxy advisory and accounting research firm critics say the standard which is backed up by about pages of guidance is simply too complex to follow the problem that companies face is they must document each and every hedge position and continually monitor them to make sure they are still acting as hedges this is an expensive and time consuming process sometimes companies can avoid these requirements using an approved "shortcut" if certain criteria are met but companies often err when applying the shortcut the usual result a restatement the standard is "more than complicated it is convoluted " said alex pollock a fellow at the conservative think tank the american enterprise institute and a former chief executive of the federal home loan bank of chicago "it confuses documentation with accounting and the expense associated with it is an enormous deadweight for companies " the accounting standard was at the heart of accounting scandals at mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac regulators later determined that fannie incorrectly applied fas to boost earnings leading in part to a massive restatement there are two schools of thought within fasb on how to revise the standards some members favor cutting some documentation and monitoring requirements others advocate changing how companies assess the relationship between a financial instrument that is being used to protect or hedge against changes in the value of another item such a change would effect situations where a company looks at the market value of the financial instrument being used as a hedge but only a portion of the market value of the item that is being hedged sometimes a company that buys a bond with a floating or variable interest rate might want to protect itself against swings in rates so it enters into a contract to swap out the floating rate for a fixed interest rate when it comes to accounting for this swap which is a hedge the interest rate component is hedged but not the underlying bond some fasb members want to change this so that the companies would no longer be able to slice and dice the underlying instrument into component parts like the bond and the interest rate instead they would come up with a market value for the whole bond and compare this to the market value of the hedge that would possibly subject companies to more volatility because the bonds value can be affected by credit quality as well as interest rate changes but it would also simplify the accounting because there is less slicing and dicing and it would allow firms to escape a lot of documentation and monitoring that should reduce the risk for companies of being second guessed by auditors and regulators said fasb member thomas linsmeier
