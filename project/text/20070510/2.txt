an all but the kitchen sink staging new york gluck wrote "orfeo ed euridice" as a "reform" opera that would get rid of the excesses of baroque opera it is the most streamlined work imaginable ninety minutes long with three characters a chorus and dancers it traces a dark journey into mourning and death and the redemptive power of music and love ironically the new metropolitan opera production which opened last wednesday is all about excess a vast jumble of ideas and visual cues that threatens to overwhelm david daniels an orfeo of wonderful power and integrity how to count the oddities theres the contribution of mark morris as director and choreographer his dancers plus four from the mets ensemble do trademark morris moves and look like contemporary folks off the street in the elysian fields seemingly by way of connecticut they are all in white and appear to be playing tennis then theres allen moyers large curved bleacher like set that holds three tiers of choristers about strong each one attired by costume designer isaac mizrahi as a "witness from history " this is a huge distraction since its hard to stop tallying them up marie antoinette gandhi joan of arc mark twain and many more mr moyer must have been seduced by the mets vaunted stage capabilities stagehands shove the bleachers around a fire escape like stairway descends from the flies to take orfeo down to hades the turntable brings the back of the set around to the front creating a glittery black wall slashed by a passageway that spirals upward a peek a boo path for the hero to lead his bride back to the world lighting designer james f ingalls obligingly provides gloom and spotlights and for the final triumph of love daylight to illuminate the newly colorful costumes of the dancers in the middle of all this activity was the countertenor david daniels got up to look like elvis or johnny cash in a black suit slicked back hair and a guitar with a rhinestone studded strap he wasnt given much of interest to do except sing but he did that gloriously capturing the full measure of orfeos agony and hope the best aspect of the elaborate set was that mr daniels could sing the operas most famous tune "che faro senza euridice " far downstage with that black wall behind him thus projecting his voice splendidly into the house mr daniels understands the subtlety of this role which dominates the opera the point is not to wow listeners with tricks but to draw us into sympathy with beauty and naked pain the same could not be said for his musical colleagues as eurydice who has only one scene the duet in which she begs orfeo to turn and look at her as they ascend from hell soprano maija kovalevska seemed to think she was singing puccini pouring on the volume and the creamy tone with no phrasing to speak of as amor heidi grant murphy was lowered from the flies wearing a pink polo shirt and a butch blond wig and looked like an androgynous teenager she must have been directed to play the role for laughs and that unfortunately included some broad vocal scooping that would have fit well on "american idol " james levines vigorous conducting never got to the heart of the piece it was just one more element in a collection of unrelated bits that had little to do with "orfeo " "the tristan project " performed at avery fisher hall last week paired a concert performance of wagners "tristan und isolde" by esa pekka salonen the los angeles philharmonic and vocal soloists with a video evocation of the opera by bill viola director peter sellars is credited as "artistic collaborator " all the singers wore black and were occasionally positioned in the balconies there was some rudimentary stage movement but the idea seemed to be that the audience would focus on the video and the sound rather than the physical presence of the singers its a compelling concept since "tristan" is a long opera with very little action in over four hours of music the two title characters drink a love potion by mistake are betrayed to king marke who is isoldes husband and tristans friend and tristan is wounded and dies what is more its principal singers by virtue of their voice types tend to be bulky and not very mobile mr viola centered his video on images of water and fire act i which takes place on the ship in which tristan is bringing isolde to cornwall to marry king marke began with footage of the sea and then shifted to a kind of ritual in which two ordinary looking actors a man and woman slowly stripped naked and were immersed in water in act ii tristan and isoldes love scene the video tristan walked through fire and the isolde lit hundreds of lamps and candles at the climax of their love duet as the singers declared that they are one the video images melded underwater in act iii the dying tristan hallucinates that isolde is coming to him he dies just as she arrives her figure standing before a wall of fire falls backward into water and the fire and water meld the dead tristan lies on a bier and as isolde sings the "liebestod " the final expression of love equating death the figure spirals up through the water in a gentle apotheosis the elements fit together the best in act iii act i is basically an angry rant for isolde in act ii the lovers engage in a long discussion about the relative merits of day and night before they actually get to the love duet it takes great singing to pull this off well and soprano christine brewer as isolde had power and steel but not much warmth while tenor christian franz as tristan was coarse and imprecise about pitches the most beautiful singing came from anne sofie von otter as brangane isoldes companion john relyea was effective in king markes lament in act iii however mr franzs vocal limitations expressed tristans own failing powers ms brewer discovered a new vein of tenderness for the "liebestod " and the hallucinatory images complemented the musics yearning and sorrow together with mr salonen and the orchestras generous detailed yet unsentimental reading of the score act iii achieved that magical weightlessness so seldom accomplished in the real world of wagner performance we could see the music as well as hear it ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
