business day sign up for the e mail here nearly equal to the federal reserves antipathy toward inflation is its dislike of surprises and most of all any provided by the central bank itself but that hasnt dimmed wishful thinking among investors who hope the makers of monetary policy will suddenly reverse course and lower the cost of borrowed money yesterdays fed statement was a study in bland affirmation of what fed policy makers have told the world to expect there were only two linguistic changes from the statement it released in march and neither suggested a change in the feds world view a depiction of economic indicators as "mixed" evolved into one slowing economic growth and readings on core inflation that "have been" somewhat elevated became core inflation that "remains" that way for some time now the fed has said it expected last years healthier pace of economic growth to moderate in part as a result of "adjustment in the housing sector " but that the increase in consumer prices is still too fast to be downgraded as the primary economic threat the bottom line yesterday isnt a new one while the fed still expects inflation pressures to moderate over time it remains fearful that they wont especially with the economy currently employing such a high level of available workers thus the fed left its benchmark target for overnight lending rates between banks at where it has been since last june the economic data supporting that view are also widely known as the wall street journal notes the feds preferred price index came in at a annual rate in march uncomfortably hot as far as fed policy makers are thought to be concerned and economic growth has indeed slowed sharply this year reaching an annual pace of in the first quarter the slowest in four years while job creation last month showed the smallest increase in two years as the new york times points out the latter explains why theres so much clamor among investors for a rate cut while the former makes clear why no one should be expecting one and yet there remains widely shared disappointment in the markets that the fed isnt going in that direction the factor blamed for the temporary dip in stock indexes yesterday following the fed meeting inherent in all outside and internal interpretations of the feds actions is the zero sum tension between inflation and growth that all central banks struggle to balance the bank of england and european central bank were scheduled to make interest rate decisions today as well and neither of them operates outside this environment or the political world around

september since it reauthorizes user fees the fda gets from the pharmaceutical companies and makers of medical devices and the wall street journal says the senates vote gives the bill strong momentum for the eventual negotiations with the house which hasnt yet passed its version the bill would bring what the new york times notes is a "fundamental change in the philosophy and operations" of the fda
