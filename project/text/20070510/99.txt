suit details how j&amp j pushed sales of procrit documents in a lawsuit filed against johnson &amp johnson by two former salesmen show how the pharmaceutical giant sought to boost sales of its blockbuster anti anemia drug procrit by offering contracts that fattened doctors profits and urging its salespeople to push higher than approved doses the documents provide a rare window into the complex case that is adding to the legal problems piling up on the health care giant j&amp j is answering questions in multiple federal and state investigations and in whistleblower suits alleging illegal marketing or pricing of its products concerns are rising about marketing of the anti anemia drugs as questions emerge about the safety of high doses for cancer patients today a food and drug administration panel plans to consider whether to add new restrictions on the drugs dosing or types of eligible patients dean mcclellan who worked for years at j&amp js ortho biotech unit selling procrit saved pages of company memos contracts and other work related documents in a storage unit and shed he built off his garage he says he was forced to retire in because the company told him his sales increases werent high enough he believes the company wanted him out because of his age which was at the time angry he agreed to join a whistleblower lawsuit by another former procrit salesman mark duxbury a brief filed by j&amp j says mr duxbury was fired in for racial and sexual harassment through his attorney jan schlichtmann mr duxbury says he was a star salesman for ortho whom the company turned on after he told the truth about their business practices at a court ordered deposition a spokeswoman for j&amp js ortho biotech unit says the company doesnt comment on matters of pending litigation the suit was filed in u s district court in boston the u s attorney in boston has filed an amicus brief in support of the suit some of mr mcclellans documents reviewed by the wall street journal indicate that ortho biotech created complex purchasing programs offering doctors discounts and cash rebates on procrit which would increase the doctors profits procrit is an infused drug which is administered by a doctor unlike pills sold by pharmacies infused drugs offer profit opportunities for doctors who can buy the drugs administer the infusions in their offices and collect the payments from insurers or the government drug companies can fatten the doctors margin using discounts and rebates to lower the price the office of inspector general of the health and human services department put out new compliance guidelines in saying that marketing the spread may be in violation of anti kickback laws the justice department has been investigating drug companies for such marketing practices resulting in big settlements of &# million for tap pharmaceuticals in and &# million for astrazeneca in after extensive debate congress overhauled the medicare reimbursement system in to prevent such practices but drug companies continue to offer large buyers big rebates which they say are legal mr mcclellans documents on the marketing of procrit show that in after amgen inc s competing drug aranesp came on the market j&amp j made offers that would allow buyers of procrit to receive discounts off an already reduced price as well as rebates for example an internal company memo calculates that a physician who bought nearly &# million of procrit over months would get a check for &# back or another j&amp j program offered hospitals an incentive to buy procrit and shun aranesp discounts on purchases from across johnson &amp johnsons product line including some huge selling drugs and medical devices sold by different subsidiaries if the hospital used procrit at least of the time when prescribing anti anemia drugs in addition j&amp j created a "right of first refusal" contract for doctors requiring them to allow ortho biotech to make a counteroffer if amgens aranesp price undercut procrit mr mcclellan also alleges the company pushed doctors to prescribe a higher dose years before it was approved as safe and effective by the fda for years the company focused on educating health care providers on procrits medical benefits he says but in the mid s at a national sales force meeting an ortho executive announced that the division was moving to promote what it called "qw dosing " switching patients from three unit doses a week to a single unit dose in cancer patients mr mcclellan says at that time that dose wasnt approved for cancer patients many years later the fda approved the dose in cancer patients but before then pushing the unapproved dose would have violated fda rules initially "doctors werent buying into it " mr mcclellan says in some cases because they worried medicare wouldnt reimburse an unapproved dose to persuade them mr mcclellan says he was told to pitch the regimen as more convenient for patients and give doctors free samples of procrit he says that at one time he was given roughly cards to give to doctors for free "trial" samples worth &# in procrit to persuade them to try the higher dose regimen when the arizona cancer center ran into resistance from medicare over reimbursing &# million for the unapproved dose of procrit an ortho biotech official drafted a letter under the name of the center director to medicare arguing the appropriateness of the dose says mr mcclellan he adds that he brought the letter to daniel von hoff at the time the hematology oncology director for his signature dr von hoff now at the translational genomics research institute declined repeated requests for comment through an assistant a spokesman for the arizona cancer center said she wasnt familiar with the matter the company also urged doctors who were still using three times a week dosing to enroll patients in "mini" trials that used once a week dosing of a higher quantity of the drug the doctors were given the drug free for those patients mr mcclellan says doctors also got other financial support mr mcclellan says he says the arizona cancer center one of the larger clinics in his sales territory in received &# to train to j&amp j employees with a series of lectures given by the centers doctors a spokesperson for the center said she couldnt confirm whether it received the &# payment from ortho biotech but said the center does provide classroom type training to junior drug company employees in the center announced in its newsletter that j&amp js ortho biotech unit had donated &# to the center to "provide salary support" for a hematology oncology fellow asked if these payments from j&amp j could pose any potential conflicts of interest thomas miller a professor at the arizona cancer center who was involved in the j&amp j training and director of the fellowship program said of the fellows "i dont think they know where its coming from " he added "i dont remember from one year to the next where the moneys coming from " he said that unlike doctors in private practice who purchase drugs and seek reimbursement for them the doctors at the center dont profit themselves from the drugs "ive never written a prescription for procrit ever " he said mr mcclellans allegations echo some of those in other lawsuits and investigations into pricing and marketing practices at other j &amp j subsidiaries sales practices around other top selling products anti psychotic risperdal sold by j&amp js janssen drug unit topamax an anti seizure medication sold by j&amp js ortho mcneil pharmaceutical unit heart drug natrecor sold by the scios unit have drawn federal probes last june the justice department issued a subpoena to j&amp js depuy unit asking for documents on the
