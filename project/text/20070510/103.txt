the daily fix at end of trying day fisher rescues jazz online edition on wednesday derek fisher flew with his family from new york where his month old daughter tatum underwent successful treatment for a life threatening form of eye cancer to salt lake city where his utah jazz were playing the golden state warriors in game of their western conference semifinal series within minutes of arriving at the arena mr fisher was being greeted on the court with a standing ovation from fans who mostly didnt yet know tatums plight then he rewarded the crowd by helping the jazz stave off a warriors rally with their starting point guard in foul trouble and his backup in the hospital mr fisher handed out three assists scored five points defended capably and filled nearly minutes of point guard play in regulation and overtime as the jazz held off golden state to take a series lead "if you believe in good karma coming to a deserving soul this was an occasion for you " gordon monson writes in the salt lake tribune adding "it was as though all the jazz were buoyed by fisher their suffering teammate and his rejoining the fold " the warriors were gracious in defeat embracing mr fisher after his trying day "by games end derek fisher just wanted to reach out to anyone " bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "after all hed been through a soothing word from a fan or teammate would have sufficed he had an even better option though jason richardson was standing right there extending an arm to his good friend former teammate and at the moment a beaten man fisher got a warm embrace in return thats part of the warriors character seeing the bigger picture recognizing heart and soul when it passes their way " this series is far from settled the next two games will be played in oakland where raucous fans cheered the warriors to three victories in three tries by a combined points in the first round against the dallas mavericks golden state has "arguably the best home court advantage in the nba today " chris mannix writes on si com mr mannix also points out that the jazz have the fourth best home record in nba playoff history but have won just percent of their away playoff games including just one of four this spring before last nights game sports illustrateds jack mccallum called the warriors the most frightening team left in the playoffs "friday night brings oracle arena that sound none of us can forget and a sense once again that anything might happen " mr jenkins writes "welcome to the festivities mr fisher you just joined the best show in the nba " if the washington posts michael wilbon had his way the show mustnt go on he suggests the nba follow the lead of the other major pro leagues and re seed the playoff matchups after the first round which would have had the warriors playing the phoenix suns in this round with the jazz matched up against the san antonio spurs "you want to avoid at all costs a rigid structure forcing the two best remaining teams in a conference spurs suns in the west pistons bulls in the east to go against each other before its time " mr wilbon writes the nhl semifinals begin tonight with buffalo facing ottawa for the eastern conference title tomorrow the anaheim ducks visit the detroit red wings in game out west los angeles daily news columnist paul oberjuerge hopes local fans finally embrace the ducks who have now reached the conference finals in three of the past four seasons "fun to watch when we bother to try when were able to find them on television and you couldnt last thursday night unless you get the versus network and if you know someone who does youre one ahead of me " mr oberjuerge writes "thats a big part of the issue exposure and lack of same the sport itself is another aside perhaps from the wayne gretzky era with the kings years ago ice hockey has been a niche sport in this market a passion to the few a mystery to the many " as noted by the fix on monday roger clemens will be paid &# million per month or more than the entire tampa bay devil rays roster to pitch for the new york yankees will other aging pitchers hold out for concessions such as those clemens extracted from the pitching starved yanks "i smell a trend " george willis writes in the new york post "clemens signed a &# million prorated contract to make pitching for the yankees seem like a part time gig the classified ad would have read something like this work once every five days visit the kids between starts come and go as you please no locker room presence required just win a few games the precedent is set and you can bet everyone else in the something club of pitchers took notice " philadelphia inquirer columnist stephen a smith says major league baseball shouldnt allow contracts that let pitchers show up only for games "commissioner bud selig should have stepped up to the plate and reminded the players union and the yankees that while there isnt a rule against such deals they are highly inappropriate and in violation of professional ethics " mr smith writes "specifically when it comes to our national pastime " mr smith also makes the credible case that such concessions would spur an outcry if granted to stars in other sports "terrell owens looks pretty darn good today so does allen iverson say what you will about their bravado their penchant for trying to get their way but they work under the same rules and regulations as their contemporaries neither had the audacity to contractually circumvent basic team etiquette with league consent " the opposite of the yankees its the washington nationals who have sliced their payroll to near tampa bay levels and not coincidentally lost of their first games washington post columnist thomas boswell resists the urge to unequivocally rip club president stan kasten noting that nearly every player subtracted from the nats debut roster has declined since leaving the nations capital "if were candid well probably conclude that the nats were doomed to a period as the nls worst team before they could rebuild " mr boswell writes "such a conclusion however only partially soothes the aggravation of waiting years to endure a team " but appeasing fans is an intangible but nonetheless crucial goal for a new franchise argues the veteran columnist who personally waited out those years "the nats local support may have shallower roots than the stunning attendance of would indicate generations grew up here without the sport and the local media through nobodys fault still knows far more about icing goaltending and pass interference than the infield fly rule " diego corrales a boxer who won titles in two weight classes died monday at age after crashing his motorcycle into a car two years to the day after his memorable comeback victory in a bout against jose luis castillo "in the th round chico was floored twice both times emphatically " matthew aguilar writes in the el paso times "but he got up mustered grit and courage from who knows where and stormed back to knock castillo out in the same round you can watch the critical th round here they talked about oscar de la hoya and floyd mayweather saving boxing on saturday night but corrales and castillo already had done that " "according to his promoter gary shaw corrales was an often reckless fighter who lived his life in similar style " the guardians john rawlings writes "a hard drinker he appealed to fans across the world for his readiness to go toe to toe with his opponent and take as much punishment as he was delivering " tip of the
