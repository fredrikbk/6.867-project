readers react to the news that murdoch is at the journals gate the article "ex dow jones executives oppose murdochs bid" marketplace may diplomatically but accurately captures my concern about the journal coming under the ownership of rupert murdoch james h ottaway jr puts it very well when he says "rupert murdoch comes from a very different tradition of australian british media ownership and editorial practice in which he has for a long time expressed his personal political and business biases through his newspapers and television channels " news corp officials are in denial of their bias and it is unsurprising that they dispute mr ottaways perception the day the journal sells out to "fair and balanced" journalism is the day i cancel my subscription i would be very sad to leave the news feed that has been my companion since from the position of one lone subscriber when mr murdoch comes i go william d cattey woburn mass i have been appalled watching the attempted takeover of the journal by mr murdoch i fell in love with the journal in college and have read it daily for years i deeply appreciate the separation between news and editorial and enjoy both if the quality and quantity of the news declined however i would cancel my subscription in a minute i believe that im in the quiet majority of the readership of the journal a thoughtful and politically moderate reader who deeply appreciates a deeper dive into the news rather than the surface skimming approach offered by so many alternative news sources tv is a news wasteland with no time dedicated to presenting contrasting views or a broader understanding of the news of the day and the broader changes in society that drive the news i hope that the bancroft family and other investors choose to focus on the long term value proposition and not get caught up in the short term cash out value offered by mr murdoch long live the wall street journal aaron booker bellingham wash those who own the journal that tireless champion of the virtues and realities of capitalism suddenly dont like capitalism very much what was the reason they expected any investor to buy their stock for the same reason an investor buys any other stock to realize a gain in exchange for his risk but when the owners happen to not like the business practices of the man who is offering a stunning premium to the share price a deal any investor would drool over then suddenly the wondrous virtues of capitalism that the journal has been trumpeting since its inception go out the window sure i love the journalistic independence and excellence of the journal i adore it and id hate to see it significantly undermined but at the end of the day it is a business not yellowstone park something truly never ever for sale if youre going to talk the talk then walk the walk joe goldman chicago i am confident that many of your readers and subscribers feel as i do that the journal is "a pillar of american democracy " you must not sell out yours is more than a business more than a newspaper yours is a sacred moral obligation chuck clevenger west chester ohio i wish to express my firm support to the bancroft family to encourage them to reject mr murdochs bid i believe that flagship papers such as the journal and by extension the bancroft family through its stewardship of the journal perform an important lead role in enabling the public access to relatively unbiased information thus allowing americans to uphold their civic responsibility to be informed w charlie phelps washington if rupert murdoch gets you maybe youll change your open borders policy and ill continue to subscribe tom sciance austin texas dow jones has unique franchises on which millions of people rely for unbiased apolitical thoughtful and comprehensive news coverage to think that a publisher of mr murdochs bent could begin to understand the non monetary value of dow joness enterprises is to engage in self delusion mr murdoch may be good for a bottom line but the bancrofts surely have a higher calling as proved by their superb publications please add my small voice to what i hope is a growing chorus of "nays" to the bid and offer my encouragement to the bancrofts to stay the course judith press new york see related letters "letters to the editor whats so bad about murdochs offer " wsj may
