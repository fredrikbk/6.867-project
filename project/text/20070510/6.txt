what rupert murdoch would do if he controlled the parent of the wall street journal but a separate proposed merger the impending &# billion deal between reuters group plc and thomson corp could have an impact it could make some lesser known but currently more profitable elements of dow jones key factors as the companys controlling shareholders weigh mr murdochs offer the proposed tie up between reuters and thomson surfaced just days after mr murdochs bid became public such a deal promises to change the landscape for financial news and data in particular it presents a challenge and an opportunity to dow jones newswires which is part of the companys most profitable unit the enterprise media group as financial information has become common on free web sites real time news and sophisticated financial data sold to wall street traders brokers and institutional investors are a lucrative niche of the media world that is what is spurring the merger between reuters and thomson two of the four big players in the industry along with dow jones and bloomberg lp the thomson reuters deal also highlights some of the challenges faced by many smaller media companies including new york times co washington post co and dow jones as they compete against an array of increasingly powerful rivals including news corp google inc and time warner inc indeed mr murdoch has argued that news corp s deep pockets would enable dow jones to compete more successfully globally and on digital platforms shares of dow jones fell more than on the new york stock exchange yesterday after mr murdoch put a damper on talk he would raise his bid saying the &# a share price was a "full and more than fair price" and warren buffett once again dismissed talk he might seek to buy dow jones there was also speculation in the market that mr murdoch was losing confidence that his bid would succeed the thomson reuters deal risks putting dow jones newswires at a disadvantage compared with larger rivals in particular a combined reuters thomson dow jones newswires publishes business news and data but unlike reuters or thomson doesnt distribute it directly to institutions for that it makes use of third parties like reuters and thomson which are the two largest distributors of dow jones newswires content bloomberg the leader in the field also sells its content directly to clients through its bloomberg terminals clare hart president of dow joness enterprise media group said clients have always chosen dow jones newswires despite other offerings and that shouldnt change "clients have had the option through reuters and bloomberg and thomson for many years to take that news over dow jones and they havent done so " ms hart said "the value of dow jones news is recognized across the world " there are other potential negatives for dow jones thomson doesnt have a news service with reporters all over the globe sending thousands of headlines and stories a day but reuters would give it one a combined reuters thomson could offer special deals and packages to clients that include the reuters news service with reuters newswire added to its stable thomson could be less likely to distribute content from dow jones "unfortunately theres a downside for dow jones " said david anderson an independent industry analyst who edits inside market data reference "suddenly thomson which was a good distribution channel for dow jones will become a less good one " but dow jones argues that "the vast majority of newswires revenue comes from clients under contract directly with newswires " indicating that those clients will want dow jones content regardless of how it is distributed "were not going to speculate on any thomson reuters hookup " a dow jones spokeswoman said in an email "the vast majority of our contracts are based on longstanding and direct relationships with clients " furthermore the lack of a single distribution channel for newswires gives dow jones the ability to distribute its products to other outlets not controlled by bloomberg reuters or thomson the companys newswires and other data services are far more profitable than the flagship newspaper last year dow joness consumer media group which includes the journal barrons and marketwatch generated &# billion in revenue and &# million in operating income the companys smaller enterprise media group which includes dow jones newswires dow jones indexes which oversees the dow jones industrial average and other indexes generated &# million in revenue but produced &# million in operating income and had operating margins of last year the company took control of factiva a specialized aggregator of business news and information that customizes databases and search for its clients dow jones had controlled half of factiva but in december purchased the half of it the company didnt already own from reuters that purchase which promises to add an additional &# million in revenue to the enterprise
