fda delays approving cancer vaccine dismayed prostate patients to launch flood of protests a question of efficacy patient activists stunned by a food and drug administration decision to put off approval of a promising new prostate cancer vaccine vowed to shower the agency with protest emails as part of a continued push for early access to the experimental treatment the fda late tuesday asked dendreon corp to provide more data to support the claim that its prostate cancer vaccine called provenge works to prolong survival the company has a patient study now under way to answer that question but fdas so called approvable letter could mean another two years at least until the product reaches patients "my mind is bouncing around i feel very very let down " said steve fleischmann a seattle businessman whose diagnosis at age launched him on a career in advocacy that began in his hospital bed as he recovered from prostate surgery his activist group survivors celebration raised &# million in research funding for the nonprofit prostate cancer research institute "what does this say to men who have prostate cancer and want to stay alive " mr fleischmann asked the decision was a bitter defeat for patient advocates many of whom attended an fda advisory panel on march wearing blue lapel ribbons a symbol of prostate cancer activism to speak in favor of the vaccine their presence was credited with helping win over the panel which voted in favor of recommending approval even though evidence from two clinical trials was weak in showing benefit mr fleischmann called on every man with prostate cancer to send an email to the fda to protest its refusal to go along with the panels recommendation prostate cancer is expected to strike american men in and to cause an estimated deaths in the u s provenge is designed to treat a subset of men estimated at to with advanced cancer that is spreading and is no longer responsive to hormone blockers the main alternatives include radiation and taxotere a chemotherapy drug but these treatments generally are considered to have limited duration and harsh side effects prostate cancer advocates seized on provenge as a hopeful new approach and one they wanted to see available even after only limited study their efforts echo growing calls by patients with a range of afflictions for quicker access to promising medicines when lives are at stake the argument goes patients cant afford to wait for enough data to be gathered to do a rigorous analysis of risks and benefits groups advocating for alzheimers disease patients are similarly planning campaigns to press the fda to move quickly to make drugs for that debilitating condition available the strategy recalls campaigns by aids patients in the early s that successfully persuaded regulators to make aids drugs available much sooner than conventional standards for approval would allow but a resurgence of patient activism comes at a time when the fda is also under pressure from other critics who believe it has been too quick to approve drugs and too cozy with the industry it regulates in the case of provenge both of the studies submitted to make the case for approval failed to meet their primary "endpoints" the target findings that would have proven the vaccine slowed the growth of the tumor and while the panel unanimously vouched for the safety of provenge the agency was concerned about hints of an increased number of strokes among patients taking the vaccine but an analysis that wasnt planned at the start of the study and was thus akin to moving the finish line after the race was over suggested patients taking the drug lived months longer than those who didnt to scientists the analysis was neither reliable nor statistically valid but advocates seized on that number to advance their position in support of approval provenge is the first candidate in a new approach to cancer treatment called immunotherapy it is referred to as a "vaccine" because it is intended to marshal the bodys immune system into attacking the tumors in sanibel fla prostate cancer advocate jan manarite who leads an advocacy group called raise a voice and whose husband is battling advanced prostate cancer vowed to redouble her educational campaign she said raise a voice is evaluating in the next day or so whether to join mr fleischmanns email campaign and is planning other actions including press releases and meetings with other activist organizations "were open to anything that serves these men with prostate cancer " she said in an interview "our commitment is unwavering " but their push for expanded access to provenge will leave many empty handed for now dendreons ceo mitchell gold calling the fda move "extremely disappointing " said the company will move to finish its patient study the only way patients can get access for now asked whether dendreon will offer compassionate access to nonstudy participants dr gold said "no the company does not have that kind of resources we look forward to completing the trial and working with the fda to bring the drug to patients that way " dr gold said he expects an interim analysis in with final data in volatile dendreon stock which has traded in the &# to &# range over the past year had surged after an fda advisory panel recommended that the agency approve licensure based on early data yesterday shares plunged to &# on the nasdaq a major point of tension in the deliberations over provenge was the companys claim that the drug added months of survival "a month life extension probably doesnt sound like a lot to those of you who are blessedly healthy " joel novak of brooklyn n y testified at the advisory panel hearing "but to me this is a extension of my life expectancy " critics pointed out that the problem with dendreons claim was that it came from an unplanned analysis of a patient study that failed to meet its primary goal such "sub analyses" arent generally considered to be statistically valid one panel member prostate cancer researcher maha hussain of the university of michigan during the panel hearing called it "incredibly under powered " after the favorable panel vote howard scher a prominent prostate cancer researcher at memorial sloan kettering cancer center new york and a panel member who voted against approval wrote a letter to fda officials urging rejection of the provenge licensing application the letter leaked to the cancer letter an influential newsletter prompted furious protests in emails posted on blogs and web sites "we want provenge to work thats our raison detre " dr scher said in a recent interview but "they need to complete the study " yesterday following word that the fda essentially followed his advice dr scher said "i think that was the correct decision at the end of the day its the data and the evidence its not an emotional decision " paul goldberg editor of the cancer letter said "fda didnt have much of a choice " basing decisions on reliable evidence he added is also "patient advocacy this is just another form of it through science " none of this assuages mr fleischmann the father of two children ages and he recently experienced a return of his cancer "im on seven weeks of radiation starting june " mr fleischmann said "lets say i get my cancer back again then my options are chemo or provenge " he added "i dont want to go on a study i dont want a placebo i want the drug " taking action some available treatments for advanced prostate cancer radiation therapy chemotherapy mainly taxotere hormone blockers
