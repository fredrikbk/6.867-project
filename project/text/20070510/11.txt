britain after blair today tony blair is expected to announce he will step down as prime minister on july after more than years at downing street he will leave behind a britain that has bolstered its standing in europe solidified its role as one of americas closest allies and built london into a global financial hub his labour successor will be hard pressed to do as well the tendency of postwar british governments has been to unravel the policies of their predecessors tony blair broke with that tradition he endorsed most of the economic reforms implemented by the conservatives from to even proclaiming himself an heir to the thatcher legacy it is a measure of mr blairs success that the current tory leader david cameron feels compelled to distance himself from lady thatcher to differentiate himself from new labour never before had labour won three straight general elections yet many on the british left have never been comfortable with mr blairs realignment of their party for some his moves toward the center were a betrayal of principles his opponents in the party and british media have tried to reassure themselves by attributing recent election defeats to the unpopular iraq war that might soothe their consciences but last weeks poor showing in local contests four years after the iraq invasion and with a labour succession in sight could be read more as an indictment of the partys future prospects than of its past in any case we think history will judge mr blair favorably on foreign policy including iraq churchill was also felled by popular ingratitude for his difficult decisions few seem to recall mr blairs pivotal role in stopping slobodan milosevics rape of the balkans when the rest of europe was wringing its hands and america was still reluctant to intervene his finest moments have come since september the prime minister has been an eloquent and farsighted proponent of resisting radical islam even as much of the free world prefers not to face up to the threat he is at present the last conviction politician in europe now he is being followed by a man whose convictions remain a mystery after a decade at treasury gordon brown will take office between general elections and most likely without facing a rival for labour party leadership yet with one foot in the door of downing for months he has failed to explain how he would deal with foreign policy as well as such domestic issues as rising crime and islamic extremism immigration health and other failing public services yes there have been press leaks the independent reported tuesday that mr brown plans to distinguish himself from mr blair by "engaging" with iran but isnt that what britain as part of the so far impotent eu has been trying for some time consider how little we know about mr browns noneconomic policies compared to those of nicolas sarkozy who had to argue his ideas before an engaged public to win the french presidency on economics at least chancellor brown does have a clear record much of it good his early move to make the bank of england independent and focused on inflation is a new labour triumph the economy has been a star in europe with steady growth yet rapidly rising public spending fueled by increases on just about every tax but the top income rate means the state is consuming ever more private resources in late march the treasury released long sought documents showing that mr brown raised taxes on pension plans in despite ample warning that it would leave a huge funding hole this "pensions raid" has left an estimated gbp billion shortfall in private retirement plans damaging mr browns image as an economic steward a strong britain is vital to both europe and america as much as continentals dont like to hear it the british economy is a model for the european union britains openness has made it a winner from globalization and along with that comes a responsibility to continue its leadership whether it is making the case for freer trade or keeping eurocrats focused on economic reforms rather than political projects like the failed constitution the eu is better when the u k keeps a hand on the steering wheel london will also remain washingtons most trusted interlocutor with the old world for all the anti americanism in the british press britain is still spiritually closer to the u s than angela merkels germany or mr sarkozys france the popular branding in britain of mr blair as president bushs "poodle" willfully misrepresents the bipartisan esteem for the special relationship in washington thanks to gordon browns reticence no one knows how well hell meet this challenge he did have an excellent instructor for the past years assuming mr brown was paying attention see related letters "letters to the editor heres to tony he was our friend in need" wsj may
