last hurrah for harry offshoots as series draws to a close market for related books may well spike then fade when j k rowlings "harry potter and the deathly hallows" hits bookstores july it will as virtually everyone knows mark the end of a year run of seven books that have made publishing history but the series has spawned a whole literary ecosystem with new offshoots expected to spring up as never before during these next few months hordes of adventuresome publishers are out there already and others will be trying to cash in with books that predict what could happen in the final potter title provide behind the scenes analysis or just plain ride piggy back at least a dozen new or updated harry potter related titles will likely be published this year according to cambridge information group inc s r r bowker these arent the kind of faux potter fantasy tales that are posted on the web though there are plenty of those one site harrypotterfanfiction com says it holds more than stories and receives in excess of million hits a month rather these are works of nonfiction fueled by online harry potter communities that have kept the faith since the publication two years ago of the most recent book in the series "harry potter and the half blood prince " they include titles such as "the making of the potterverse a month by month look at harrys first years" by edward gross and george beahms "muggles and magic an unofficial guide to j k rowling and the harry potter phenomenon " in the fall readers will also be offered tere stouffers "the complete idiots guide to the world of harry potter " already there are more than harry potter related titles in print according to r r bowker among the more unusual "if harry potter ran general electric leadership wisdom from the world of wizards" by tom morris published in theres also "harry potter and torah " which dov krulwich self published late last year mr krulwich who works in the high tech industry in israel describes the book as "jewish perspectives on harry potter themes" and says it is aimed at teens and young adults the recent titles that mainly speculate on how the whole series will end will be so much "worm food in the landfill" as soon as "hallows" hits the stores says john granger who has written several harry potter related titles including the recently published "unlocking harry potter five keys for the serious reader " one key literary alchemy "j k rowling said in that she read a ridiculous amount about alchemy before she started writing the books " mr granger says "hermione means mercury for example and sure enough her parents are dentists and her initials are h g hg is the chemical symbol for mercury on the periodic table of elements " but the likelihood of a short shelf life isnt stopping publishers from moving quickly while interest is still high "my suspicion is that there will be a rush of books after the series ends " says daniel nexon an assistant professor in the government department at georgetown university who co edited "harry potter and international relations " published last year by rowman &amp littlefield publishers inc "having the final book out will generate a lot of buzz and theyll look at that frenzy as one last big marketing opportunity " book retailers are also mindful that nothing drives traffic to their stores like harry potter borders group inc the nations second largest book chain has struck exclusive deals to sell two related potter books "the great snape debate" and "the unauthorized harry potter " the first has a gimmick that harks back to the early days of science fiction the book must be turned upside down in order to read the counter argument regarding snapes allegiances the second title offers a broad perspective on various subjects ms rowling has raised in her six published books borders also has a harry potter page at the social community site gather com one topic in particular "severus snape friend or foe " has generated more than comments some are as basic as "yeah there is going to be a major plot twist " but others provide lengthy thoughtful analysis "this is the last hurrah for fans " says anne roman a borders spokeswoman "when will they ever get to enjoy this level of interest again " much like george lucass "star wars" films and dan browns "the da vinci code " the harry potter books are whales to which many barnacles have attached themselves scholastic corp which publishes the series in the u s says there are million harry potter books in print with another million set to be published july the harry potter franchise has also benefited from four successful movies the fifth "harry potter and the order of the phoenix " will open july there are limits copyright law will prevent other authors from offering new titles using ms rowlings characters and settings unless theyre obvious parodies "boundaries exist " says david s korzenik a publishing attorney with the firm miller korzenik sommers llp "characters can be copyrighted and settings can be protected " he says "but if you are doing a parody you can go forward with the understanding that the parody wont be book eight or nine of the series but rather is trying to deliver something very different or transformative " most authors dont challenge amateur authors who write tales about favorite characters as long as its not commercially distributed he says while its technically a copyright infringement "fan fiction" is usually perceived as a way for fans to enjoy themselves while creating further interest in the original work "nobody views it as a substitute " says mr korzenik guidebooks and predictions of future events are protected as well as long as authors dont borrow too heavily from ms rowlings work ms rowling will come under significant pressure from fans if she doesnt wrap up all the various plotlines she has created since the first book "harry potter and the philosophers stone " was published in in the u k "theyll be clamoring for more " says literary agent ann rittenberg whose year old daughter gracie has already expressed regret that the series is coming to a close what will ms rowling do next efforts to reach her werent successful however last august she gave a reading in new york city and later answered questions from the audience at one point when asked about her future she replied "i have a shorter mercifully book for i think slightly younger children that is half written so i may well go back to that when harrys done " its likely that all related corners of the thriving potter publishing industry will eventually slow once the final harry potter adventure is published "well probably see fewer titles the energy that comes from a release of a new book in the series will be over " says roger scholl the editorial director of bertelsmann ags currency doubleday business imprint who edited tom morriss "if harry potter ran general electric " still some caution against underestimating the passion of harry potter readers mr granger an english teacher at valley forge military academy in wayne pa says academics will attempt to fix ms rowlings place in the cultural firmament much as they continue to do so for such writers as charles dickens and agatha christie "im fairly certain potter mania will not go the way of disco and the hula hoop " says mr granger who is currently working on "harry meets hamlet and scrooge " that will explore harrys literary antecedents
