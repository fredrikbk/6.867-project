inflation risk keeps fed on alert central bank isnt likely to raise or lower rates in the foreseeable future washington the federal reserve signaled continued wariness on inflation leaving interest rates unchanged and giving no sign it is inching toward an interest rate cut the fed said after its policy meeting yesterday that its "predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate " the central bank made very few changes to its postmeeting statement after surprising investors in march by weakening its "bias" to raise rather than lower interest rates in coming months some on wall street had expected the fed to acknowledge that core inflation which excludes food and energy declined in march after ticking higher in january and february at marchs meeting it had said "recent readings" on inflation were somewhat elevated yesterday though it dropped the reference to recent readings it reiterated "core inflation remains somewhat elevated " the wording suggests the fed has looked through monthly fluctuations in inflation and instead focused on the fact it has been at or above for several years now though fed officials have no agreed upon target most consider or lower to be preferable in march core inflation was measured by the feds preferred price index as widely expected the fed left its target for the federal funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks at where it has stood since june stocks declined modestly on the announcement but ended higher for the day bond prices fell slightly nudging their yields higher the futures market continues to anticipate one quarter point rate cut by the end of this year little changed from tuesday yesterdays statement reinforces other messages from fed policy makers that the central bank is on hold unlikely to raise or lower rates in the foreseeable future that position results from the fed being pulled in opposite directions by different risks on the one hand economic growth has been sluggish for a year falling to a four year low of at an annual rate in the first quarter business investment has weakened after housing demand stabilized late last year it may have experienced another downdraft after the subprime mortgage meltdown cut off credit to many potential home buyers on the other hand the fed is reluctant to cut interest rates while inflation remains higher than it prefers for the fed its not enough that inflation not rise it actually has to fall the longer it stays above the greater the risk the public will come to expect a higher inflation rate making it far harder for the fed to get it lower the feds view is that inflation will edge lower over the next year and a half due to slackening pressure from home ownership costs and last years run up in energy costs it also expects slower growth to open up spare capacity and limit wage and price pressures but obstacles to this scenario remain the gradual decline in unemployment in the past year despite an uptick in april shows labor markets are tightening and as a result wage gains have accelerated slightly productivity growth also has slowed making it harder for firms to absorb those wage increases without raising prices other inflation risks come from rising energy costs and a drop in the dollar which could nudge up prices of imports economists believe it will take a significant weakening in growth and the job market to shift the fed off "hold " though nonfarm payrolls rose just in april the lowest in over two years monthly gains "need to drop consistently below before the fed judges the labor market is weak enough to need a rate cut " paul ashworth of consulting firm capital economics said in a note to clients he predicted that would happen and the federal funds rate would fall to by years end but scott anderson senior economist at wells fargo &amp co said the fed is "willing to tolerate slower growth for the meantime in order to give inflation time to moderate "
