lyods tip businesses should assess terror risk potential corporate losses from terrorist attacks and political unrest are growing but companies understanding of the risks isnt keeping pace thats the upshot of research released by the lloyds insurance market and researchers from the economist intelligence unit in london businesses are the target of nearly of international terrorist attacks according to the report board level executives at companies world wide were surveyed more than one in five said they had no business continuity plans in place and less than a third said they had a strong understanding of their exposure to political risk lloyds chairman lord peter levene discussed the issue and report with the wall street journal excerpts follow wsj how would you summarize this reports message lord levene there is a certain amount of confusion out there there are some businesses that take it very seriously and put disaster recovery plans in place some take out insurance but this report isnt a great selling campaign on our part the real issue were talking about is awareness of this risk and the idea that companies need to consider and plan for these risks if nothing happens at least you looked at your business and risks properly insurance isnt the answer to all of it wsj tallies of international and domestic terror attacks have fallen in recent years if iraq statistics are netted out according to the report is that why some businesses havent paid much attention to the risk lord levene i dont quite go along with that idea numbers may be lower outside iraq partly due to greater vigilance but will they stay lower who knows wsj terrorism coverage is increasingly available whats driving that lord levene before terrorism coverage in the u s was few and far between then we had this terrible attack after which there was a knee jerk reaction with higher rates and different types of coverage now things have calmed down a bit and this is starting to become another risk that can be insured like others wsj but theres less data for terrorism and attacks are hard to predict so its difficult to write such policies right lord levene that is true but not just for terrorism last year there was enormous historical data on hurricanes we paid hurricane forecasters a fortune to tell us what would happen in they told us with absolute authority that would be not quite as bad as in but quite nasty what happened nothing past experience with terrorism is somewhat limited but thats of little comfort to someone who needs coverage
