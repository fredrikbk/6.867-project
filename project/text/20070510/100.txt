the afternoon report sales lose their hop online edition april has turned out to be a cruel month indeed for many of the nations largest retailers but the cruelest days may still be ahead as climbing gasoline prices appear to be squeezing household budgets receipts looked ugly from top to bottom discounters were pummeled as wal mart posted a drop in sales at its stores open at least a year while chief rival target watched such sales drop lower income consumers are highly susceptible to swings in fuel prices and when expensive gas is combined with the recent turmoil in the subprime mortgage market and in the housing market as a whole many shoppers risk having their legs swept from under them on the way to the checkout line but sales also deteriorated at chains that serve shoppers who are better insulated from the day to day gyrations at the gas station federated department stores which operates macys and bloomingdales booked a drop in comparable sales and said that sales next month will be flat to lower by gap which has been struggling to get its product mix right said its same store sales dropped by a dizzying even teen oriented chain abercrombie &amp fitch generally a big winner in the monthly sales sweepstakes reported that its same store sales plummeted and issued guidance below expectations as is often the case when the chain stores lay an egg a cluster of one off quirks shouldered most of the blame according to several companies the primary villain this time out was an early arriving easter which had pulled many holiday sales into march analysts saw that excuse coming but even so results taken as a whole were far more gruesome than had been expected according to thomson financial of retailers missed mean wall street forecasts to be sure that may say as much about the quality of the forecasts as it does about the sales results but it is also certain to raise concern that growth prospects for the second quarter arent rosy the economy grew at a paltry pace in the first quarter and that looks likely to be revised lower by a substantial margin after a large widening in the trade deficit in march and the hope is that that figure represents the nadir of the current cycle but if consumer spending keeps tightening up such hopes may be dashed its in that context that the weak sales results from wal mart may prove especially worrying the worlds largest retailer like so many of its peers said that the early easter and some colder than normal weather during the early part of the month restrained sales just the same april still made for the worst month that the company has seen in years along with the rise in gasoline costs shoppers are drawing less equity out of their homes amid the slowdown in the housing market and together those two factors are helping to carve a sizable chunk out of discretionary budgets that means that economists are pinning hopes on the labor market to keep wind in consumers sails and on that front there were some more encouraging numbers the labor department reported that initial jobless claims last week dropped to the lowest since the middle of january still the claims numbers are volatile and investors may want to see more data before giving consumers a clean bill of health retail returns trip up stocks the weak retail results seemed to be giving some stock investors pause as the dow jones industrial average fell about points to that is the biggest decline the blue chip average has seen in a while but its still a drop of only about the nasdaq composite index declined about points to and

democrats seek answers from gonzales attorney general alberto gonzales was back on capitol hill today to answer questions about the firings of eight federal prosecutors this time around from the house judiciary committee democrats pressed the attorney general on the dismissals seeking more answers to questions about whether the white house had ordered the termination of prosecutors who were found insufficiently loyal to the bush administration but mr gonzales who has faced repeated calls for his resignation didnt offer up much new "my feelings and recollections about this matter have not changed " mr gonzales said referring to his appearance last month before the senate judiciary committee republican lawmakers in a contrast to the senate republicans who gave the attorney general a much more difficult ride said they thought it was time to bring the matter to an end "the list of accusations has mushroomed but the evidence of wrongdoing has not " said rep lamar smith the committees senior republican but chairman rep john conyers said until "we get to the bottom of how this list was created and why " doubts about the justice departments independence will persist blair

parliamentary constituency of sedgefield "in this job in the world of today i think thats long enough for me but more especially for the country sometimes the only way you conquer the pull of power is to set it down " mr blair led his labour party to landslide election victories in and and a narrower victory in his first term was notable for several important shifts including giving the bank of england the power to set interest rates policy makers raised the benchmark rate to today and the granting of regional governments to scotland and wales he also won praise for helping to broker a landmark peace settlement in northern ireland but his decision to involve britain in the war in iraq proved to be unpopular and led to an erosion of support for his party labour has consistently

interest rate to from the move brings interest rates to a six year peak as policy makers try to get a leash on consumer inflation which is running at its hottest temperature in more than a decade and
