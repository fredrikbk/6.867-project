the expat life white rice and mickey ds life of an nba exile in china online edition there are many different expat communities in china ranging from students to retirees setting out on second careers one of the most interesting and unusual is also one of the smallest the chinese basketball associations foreign players their position in society is rather strange at once profoundly engulfed in chinese culture and living on its fringes they are extreme expats often living in smaller cities in the chinese interior isolated from communities of fellow americans and highly dependent on one another all but one of the cbas teams have two foreigners the champion bayi rockets represent the peoples liberation army and have no outsiders they are almost all african americans most of whom speak no chinese and have little outside support systems in the country they live in hotels while their chinese teammates bunk in dorm type accommodations and make from &# a month plus lodging and a modest food per diem unlike american professional sports leagues the cba doesnt seem to have a lot of leaguewide standards so the foreign players living conditions and day to day quality of life vary widely from team to team the foreign players include several who have played in the nba and quite a few college standouts looking over the list i focused on god shammgod whom i fondly remembered as a quick gutsy point guard who led the providence friars team to the ncaa tournaments elite eight he was playing in taiyuan shanxi province one of the most polluted cities in the world i traveled to the dusty dingy burg and found god in the second rate hotel across the street from the arena where the team stayed on game nights his regular residence was in a nicer hotel across town but in either place he spent most of his time with his best friend his apple laptop if shamm as he prefers to be called is in china and hes not playing ball hes likely online downloading nba games or highlights talking on skype emailing or iming with his wife kids and countless friends including nba stars chauncey billups and kevin garnett like those old pals mr shammgod makes a living playing basketball but they dont have to endure hours of repetitive endurance test practices or wade through cigarette smoke clogged hallways to enter their locker room or stay in hotels without shower curtains and with old cigarette butts on the bathroom floor obviously this wasnt what mr shammgod had in mind when he went pro after his sophomore year of college he was drafted in the second round of the nba draft by the washington wizards played games and was cut the following year he thought he would be back in the league before long but instead has been on a decadelong international journey that has taken him to china poland saudi arabia and now back to china where he played for the worst team in a mediocre league yet i found the year old new yorker in good spirits keeping his eyes on the prize making some money then returning home to continue his quest for one last shot at the nba "this would have made me crazy when i was younger but now i know you cant control everything and you dont get anywhere pounding your head against the wall " said mr shammgod the two foreign teammates are often each others best friends and support systems mr shammgod however spent much of the season as the lone american on shanxi because foot tall rashid byrd clashed with management and left for the u s only to return a month later "i cant handle this situation " said mr byrd shortly before heading home the first time "this is my first time outside the u s and it might be my last after this " jason dixon shakes his head when talking about mr byrds struggles a funny quiet center mr dixon is an eight year member of the guangdong tigers "its their country their league and their game and you cant change it " he says "the sooner you understand that the better off youll be ive seen so many guys come over here and fight the system instead of making peace with it " it can be a lot to grapple with the owner of mr shammgods team instructs the coach from the bench at home games and over the phone for away matches the two foreign players can only play a combined five quarters per game leading to bizarre substitution patterns in the middle of the past season the cba took a day break so the national team could practice for the asian games the rest of the players practiced daily for the entire period mr shammgods team allowed him to return to new york for a day visit with his wife and three kids other teams made their foreign players stick around food is another constant concern mr shammgod tries to eat all of his meals at pizza hut or mcdonalds taiyuans only two western establishments we ate at mcdonalds three times during my hour visit my first visits to a chinese mickey ds when he cant make it to one of those places he sticks with rice and fresh fruit even mr dixon who speaks some chinese and is fairly well assimilated tries to avoid local cuisine "they eat too much weird stuff " he says noting that he follows the lead of a muslim teammate at team meals because he wont eat dog "beijing and shanghai are nice " said mr shammgod "living there would be easy they have t g i fridays outback steakhouse and all kinds of american restaurants " i caught up with mr shammgod a few weeks later when the team played beijing and all of those western outfits seemed far far away the team was staying in a ramshackle sprawling hotel near the arena on the citys far western fringe close to an hour from the central business district he had been there for two days with no internet access and no acceptable food living on white rice and coke it was just the latest insult in a year gone bad the team was on its fourth coach mr byrd was gone for the second time and the season was winding down to a record mr shammgod dominated the action in the run down arena scoring points and handing out about assists but his team still lost by a point after a series of last minute calls against them this is standard practice in china where the home team hires the referees after the game we piled into a chinese friends subcompact and headed downtown in search of a restaurant that was still serving food at sunday night i made a few phone calls and fridays said they were open until midnight over a plate of chicken wings and fried shrimp i asked mr shammgod if he had any thoughts about where he might be playing next year "hopefully the nba " he dunked a wing into a dish of hot sauce "and if not well see what works out but ive been saving money and making good investments id really like to stay in the u s " share your thoughts about this column or any other aspect of expat life with alan and your
