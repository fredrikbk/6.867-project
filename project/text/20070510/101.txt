the blair record london if ever there were a political conundrum this is it today tony blair is expected to announce his resignation as leader of the labour party and set his timetable for departure from no downing street he does so only days after dreadful results for labour in the scottish welsh and local elections mired in the "loans for peerages" scandal which may yet lead to criminal charges against some of his closest aides who arranged seats in the house of lords for leading labour backers and overshadowed by the dark cloud of iraq yet extraordinarily after such a politically turbulent decade a poll last week showed that of voters think that prime minister blair has done a good job overall whats the blair attraction the prosaic answer is that enough people feel reasonably affluent after years of labour rule to give the departing british leader his due but not their adoration too much that was promised on may as britain savored mr blairs first landslide victory has not been delivered the "new britain" of his early rhetoric a modernized version of labours ancestral dream of the "new jerusalem" where schools hospitals transport and welfare services would match continental european levels simply did not materialize mr blair understood in many cases what had to be done but too often the story was too little too late nothing at all or public spending bonanzas unaccompanied by reform in public policy the dominant narrative of the blair years was one of lost opportunity he was right in my view about the war on terror and in his unflinching support for americas efforts in the mideast but never persuaded the british public the voters came to regard "iraq" not as a war that had to be won but as a metaphor for all that disappointed them about mr blair yet on the spectrum of political sentiment disenchantment is a long way from loathing however deep their grievances about britains antiquated public services and scandalous transport infrastructure however profound their contempt for this governments addiction to spin and its alleged lies about the case for war in iraq however sharp their sense of dashed expectations and unfulfilled hopes voters believe theyve been reasonably well served by the economic policy of the blair era mr blair is richly entitled to feel that his chancellor of the exchequer rival and now formal heir gordon brown failed to support and often thwarted his reforms of education and the state run national health service but mr blair owes his chancellor a huge debt for granting independence to the bank of england in and for refusing to take britain into the euro currency on these two pillars has economic stability been built which is one of many reasons why the brownites feel that their mans turn at the helm is long overdue such policy audits however do not do full justice to the cultural and psychological impact a politician of tony blairs stature can have upon his times he was often accused of vapidity of a tendency to the trite and the glib his detractors hated his embrace of popular culture the verbless sentences in his speeches and his insistence that he was a "pretty straight sort of guy " it was said that with this prime minister you had to "take the smooth with the smooth " true enough but the terrible error of the blairophobes was always to underestimate his political powers his capacity to connect with the public and his unexpected reserves of determination he won elections on a scale undreamed of by previous labour leaders chalking up an aggregate of parliamentary majorities that surpasses even margaret thatchers mighty record he did not match the iron ladys transformation of the country but he restored two party democracy to britain he inherited a party that had just chalked up its fourth successive general election defeat and bequeaths one that might yet win a fourth successive victory he dominated his era spectacularly even those who hated him could not avoid his gravitational pull and were forced to define themselves in relation to this singular politician the legendary charm faded inevitably but even at the last it was doing its work as mr blair on tuesday put the finishing touches on a remarkable power sharing deal in northern ireland between once sworn enemies the hard line unionist ian paisley and the former ira commander martin mcguinness for as long as he was labour leader he was the magnetic north of british politics the fixed point that set the trajectory of friend and foe alike he saw off four conservative party leaders john major william hague iain duncan smith michael howard none of whom came close to a truly effective anti blair strategy the answer as the present tory leader david cameron has grasped was to give up that particular battle as lost absorb the lessons of blairism and look beyond it mr cameron is happy to style himself as "blairs heir" another english public schoolboy with a talent for communication a gift for reassurance and a whiff of generational change about him and march toward the center ground of british politics which has been so successfully colonized by new labour for more than a decade small wonder then that so many senior blairites find the tory leader more appealing than they do the grim scot wholl be the next pm if recent history has one indisputable lesson it is that reconstruction is harder than regime change after many bursts of "shock and awe" attacks subverting mr blair through his allies or plotting to remove him mr brown has at last seen off his old rival the so called "september coup" last year finally did the trick when rebellious labour backbenchers forced the prime minister to promise to leave by this summer and mr blair will soon be gone the cold war standoff of the blair brown rivalry a factional impasse in the labour party when the tories were largely irrelevant is going to be replaced by something much more fluid much more bitter and much less predictable three forces will be vying for position the brown government the neo blairite insurgents and the cameron conservatives it will be an ugly conflict the outcome of which is unknown but one thing is for sure mr brown had better brace himself for a wave of blair nostalgia before too long and the sound of mournful voters singing "tony we hardly knew ye " mr dancona is editor of the spectator
