auto supplier beats detroits odds american axle profits with help from the uaw but key talks loom american axle &amp manufacturing holdings inc has shown some of the bigger detroit manufacturers how to get the most from a unionized work force regaining profitability even as other traditional midwestern auto parts makers have skidded into bankruptcy but the companys strategy faces a critical test next year born in when an investor group bought unwanted factories from general motors corp american axle has worked with the united auto workers union over the years to improve productivity and the quality of its axles and drivelines essential parts connecting a vehicles transmission and wheels last year it reached a buyout and early retirement agreement with the union that was accepted by workers the cutbacks combined with earlier efficiency gains and a new launch from major customer gm have propelled american axle back in the black after posting its first annual lost last year first quarter net income was up from the same period last year to &# million and american axles stock is up since the start of the year this despite the fact that of its sales last year came from gm which has cut back north american production in an effort to stanch big losses the quick payback from last years actions has whetted investor appetite for more labor savings in when the company is scheduled to negotiate a new master contract with the uaw covering about hourly employees even beyond the uncertainties surrounding the talks keeping on track could be tricky american axle is the sole supplier of axles for gms large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles which remains a high volume wide margin program despite a drop in popularity meanwhile other parts makers such as dana corp that are reorganizing under bankruptcy court protection could emerge as tougher lower cost competitors "they started in the s with manufacturing facilities that needed a radical dramatic change and that hadnt had modern manufacturing techniques and equipment " said lehman brothers analyst brian johnson "now having done that i think the challenge is getting to a new all in cost thats on the level with competitors like dana " mr johnson says danas labor rate already is lower than american axles and could be even lower when it emerges chapter in part because it is seeking to reduce labor costs american axle could look for labor cost savings either through the master agreement next year or through agreements with local unions at individual plants before then american axle employees covered by the master contract currently receive an "all in" hourly rate including wages and benefits of &# to &# an hour which is high in the supply industry new hires earn a lower rate that the company wont disclose american axle chairman and chief executive richard e dauch said the company which has a &# billion market capitalization and the union have a good history of reaching deals and he is confident heading into the talks but he already has demonstrated he is willing to feed more business to new and growing operations outside the u s overall it says american axle has a &# billion backlog of new business through business mr dauch can award based at least in part on how much uaw locals cooperate the uaw has been stung by losing the chevrolet camaro axle program to american axles mexico plant one concession the company may seek is changing the supplemental unemployment benefit it pays to idled workers who keep much of their salary and benefits even if they arent working uaw vice president james settles jr who leads the unions talks with american axle said hes "very very disappointed" that the company will build camaro axles in mexico gm will build the camaro in oshawa ontario and american axle has a plant in buffalo n y with idle capacity still mr settles characterizes the unions relationship with the company as "decent" and said hes keeping an open mind heading into the talks he said the union understands the business realities while at the same time wants to preserve u s jobs "every company always talks about taking work abroad its something you have to go through " he said mr dauch "is a businessman at the end of the day we have to work out some kind of agreement that will satisfy both parties " mr dauch said the company had to quickly transform its practices and thinking since it was founded "the facts are these original assets couldnt make a plugged nickel " he said "and the facts were that quality was abysmal the delivery was spotty the technology was aging and the work force was of high anxiety not a pretty picture " mr dauch who was manufacturing chief of chrysler corp during the auto makers s recovery said he met "eyeball to eyeball" with workers in each plant and worked hard to change what he called the industrys "entitlement mentality " management drove productivity and quality improvements but at the same time spent heavily on new equipment training and education for workers mr dauch said he is comfortable working with the uaw and "nobodys looking for a suicide mission here " still the company is dealing with a union smarting from a roiling domestic supply industry as u s auto makers continue to lose market share and suppliers cut jobs american axle is idling capacity that makes parts for gms midsize suvs those vehicles have lost ground to what are known as crossover vehicles which are also roomy but more fuel efficient because they are built on car chassis mr settles said the union has worked with american axle to make it more profitable as it deals with industry changes he cited the lower tier wage for new hires and the early retirement and buyout program that allowed the company to reduce its costs to laid off workers he said the union also is working on job classification changes to further improve efficiency some union workers in buffalo are frustrated because theyve "done what theyve been asked to do" and yet their future is in jeopardy said george jemiolo shop chairman of uaw local in buffalo he gives the company credit for investing in equipment and workers he said the union is willing to make changes "but lets make some reason out of it "
