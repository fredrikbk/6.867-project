pound foolish borrowing binge fuels u k economic worries consumer debt soars as mortgages rise banks draw the line london to understand why economists are increasingly worried about britain it helps to look to adam smith not the th century scottish philosopher but rather a year old cheltenham mortgage debt collector who shares the famous name last june mr smith was in debt to the tune of &# like many british consumers who are even more leveraged than americans he had been borrowing largely to cover his rising living expenses struggling to keep up with credit card and loan payments on his &# monthly salary he sought protection from creditors "i was just trying to live an independent life away from my parents purse strings really " says mr smith a chipper man with a scruffy beard and a pierced tongue he recently moved in with his mom with inflation at a year high and interest rates set to rise as soon as today from their current concerns about britains borrowing binge are gathering momentum personal insolvencies in england and wales last year hit a record up almost from in the first quarter insolvencies totaled a seasonally adjusted up from a year ago treasury officials announced in january that theyre considering a nationwide financial education program the consumer squeeze is particularly worrying for the british economy reliant as it is on consumption for nearly two thirds of its output "we see the potential for a significant slowdown primarily via the housing market and the consumer " says danny gabay a director at london based fathom financial consulting such a slide in one of the developed worlds most robust economies would be bad news politically for prime minister in waiting gordon brown the man who as chancellor of the exchequer has overseen much of britains economic expansion to be sure many in the past have predicted that rising debt would tamp down the british economy now the worlds fifth largest and yet it is in its th year of uninterrupted growth and the u k has in recent years weaned itself from some of its dependence on the consumer as business investment growth has far outpaced consumption growth says ross walker an economist with the royal bank of scotland in london the international monetary fund earlier this year forecast that the economy will grow by this year not sizzling but still the fastest pace in the group of seven and yet at the same time a number of the economys mainstays may be buckling immigration which has helped propel growth is set to slow the governments six year spending spree is about to end and cracks are showing in the property market debt has helped power the british economys ongoing success and consumers have spent even as growth in their disposable income has stagnated debt however is at the heart of the present uncertainty and debt levels in britain are certainly eye catching personal debt has reached a record &# trillion according to the organization for economic cooperation and development u k household debt as a percentage of annual disposable income hit in the last year for which data is available compared with in the u s british banks lost a record &# billion to bad consumer debt last year and are tightening their lending standards market leader barclays plc says it now declines half of all credit card applicants such forced belt tightening may be working for the first time since the early s credit card spending last year fell by from the previous years level skyrocketing home prices have in effect force fed the debt home prices have more than tripled over the past years in the first quarter of this year britains ratio of average house price to mean income reached the highest since records began in according to lender nationwide building society major mortgage lenders have been doling out mortgages at up to six times a credit worthy customers annual income thats comparable to u s standards for high quality borrowers still with homeowners stretched home repossessions in jumped to hit a six year high of thats still low by historical standards but experts expect the number to rise "more and more of peoples money is tied up in servicing mortgages " says chris tapp associate director of credit action a debt education nonprofit in lincoln "that means people are having to borrow more and more for just ordinary day to day living expenses " there are other dangers a big public sector spending spree thats been greasing the economys wheels is ending from to boosts in public sector employment and wages brought average public spending growth to an inflation adjusted more than double its long run average the government plans to halve that rate in coming years but even as public spending growth slows taxes will remain high further squeezing consumers to finance its largess in recent years the government has "been looking to raise any tax they could think of " says michael saunders an economist with citigroup in london ticking off rises in sales property and energy taxes among those pinching consumers pocketbooks a slowdown in immigration may also weigh on future growth when the european union expanded eastward in france germany and others made it difficult for citizens of the new eu member states to enter their labor markets britain by contrast along with ireland and sweden opened its doors a sudden influx of some immigrant workers from eastern europe particularly poland propped up growth it also helped the housing market the british government however has said it wont welcome immigrants from the newest eu members romania and bulgaria as easily in recent quarters national statistics showed work force growth slowing a potential sign that the net inflow of immigrants is leveling off alongside this the british housing market may already be starting to sputter some surveys have shown a small downturn in the pace of home price appreciation though rates remain in double digits februarys new buyer inquiries a leading indicator for many analysts dropped to their lowest level since october according to the royal institution of chartered surveyors kelvin davidson a property analyst with capital economics in london says he expects rising interest rates to take property price increases down to around by year end but unless interest rates spike above or the economy slides suddenly he says "itll be an appreciable slowdown not a crash " people like drama teacher andrew hodson may help spark that slide the year old father of two owes about &# on two apartments he had hoped to rent out to subsidize a paltry state pension but rising interest rates on his variable rate mortgage and a glut of supply mean rent for his flat in the northern city of leeds falls some &# short of his monthly mortgage payments future interest rate increases will push those payments higher still "im just doing my best to keep my head above water now " says mr hodson who is married to a theater director last week he applied to change to a fixed rate mortgage if that fails he says he may have to sell one of the flats mr hodson is part of the u k s so called buy to let revolution the phenomenon took off in with a law that made it easier to buy property to rent out since then red hot housing price gains shaky government pension plans and the promise of a steady supply of tenants in the form of immigrants or young professionals priced out of the property market have made buy to let landlords a fundamental feature of the housing market today buy to let owners make up of mortgages outstanding by value last year they accounted for more than of total mortgage lending the vast majority of this army are amateur landlords like mr hodson if they start selling it could trigger the long feared house price tumble in the broader british housing market some are already jumping ship london where house prices have more than tripled over the past decade has been the fulcrum of the property boom in recent years now in parts of the citys gritty immigrant heavy east "to let" signs are as common as kebab shops testament to an apartment glut outlook property real estate agent daniel barbanel says many of his clients in the area worried prices have peaked are selling "theyre just thinking id better cash in on this now " home prices are already slowing in many of the countries that share the euro currency but signs of a global slowdown arent swaying other british borrowers early last year stephen holdway a year old production worker at a gillette factory in the southeastern town of reading took a &# weekend course run by property investment company inside track seminars last spring he and his wife ann refinanced their own home and signed on for three buy to let properties one in birmingham one on a spanish golf course and another in orlando fla the couple who together earn some &# a year owe a total of about &# million in mortgage debt and hope the three flats will help fund their retirement mr holdway whos never been to the u s or spain believes any property price slowdown will be short lived "occasionally you have a blip " he concedes "but you just have to weather that storm " other borrowers are already in trouble the volume of calls to britains largest debt advice charity the consumer credit counseling service increased by nearly from to almost last year some of the recent spike in british personal insolvencies may come from an april law change that shortened the amount of time people spend in bankruptcy from three years to one but increasing numbers of struggling britons still recoil from bankruptcys stigma they are opting instead for an individual voluntary arrangement introduced in the s ivas were originally designed for small business owners the practice lets borrowers write off as much as of their debt and pay back the rest over five years they are attractive also because they stay behind the lace curtain and arent public local newspapers routinely write up news of bankruptcy filings as debt levels have risen so too has the popularity of ivas last year they totaled more than of individual insolvencies despite british banks increasing reluctance to sign off so much bad debt analysts say they expect the iva numbers to continue rising in the first quarter of this year iva totals in england and wales rose by almost compared with the same period last year bankruptcies rose in the scruffy east coast hamlet of barton upon humber truck driver steve bagshaw is a poster child for the iva he entered into one last june when a bank turned him down for a personal loan to cover his debts for years mr bagshaw had kept retailers and banks happy by living it up on credit cards on a truck drivers income he made frequent jaunts to jamaica and spain &# impulse jewelry purchases for his girlfriend and took scuba diving lessons by last year he owed creditors nearly &# an internet search led him to thomas charles &amp co one of many firms that
