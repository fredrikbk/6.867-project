snack attack as child obesity surges one town finds way to slim somerville mass goes beyond schools to push exercise good eating somerville mass most people think the battle against obesity takes willpower but the town of somerville knows it takes the will of an entire community sparked by a desire to curb childhood obesity this town of has undergone a subtle yet dramatic transformation in the past five years restaurants have switched to low fat milk and smaller portion sizes the school district has nearly doubled the amount of fresh fruit at lunch the town just outside boston has repainted crosswalks to get more people walking to work or school the numbers suggest it works during the school year somerville schoolchildren gained less weight than children in two nearby communities used as a control group according to a report published today in the medical journal obesity the difference was statistically significant and translates into preventing about a pound of excess weight gain among children who lean toward the heavy side the report says the somerville study is believed to be the first controlled experiment demonstrating the value of a community wide effort its only a small dent but slowing the pace of weight gain among kids is the key to conquering childhood obesity says lead author christina economos an assistant professor at tufts university "it could be the difference between graduating overweight and graduating at a normal weight " she says "we need to think about how it plays out long term " the somerville program designed primarily by dr economos and fellow researchers at the tufts friedman school of nutrition offers a surprising blueprint it didnt force schoolchildren to go on diets instead the goal was to change their environment with small and inexpensive steps dr economos a specialist in pediatric nutrition and the mother of two school age children has long believed that the battle against obesity cant be fought at the dinner table alone but requires social and political changes for inspiration she turned to other successful social movements of the past years analyzing tobacco control seat belt use and breastfeeding all were thorny public health problems lacking a quick fix yet significant progress was made on each in the centers for disease control and prevention awarded dr economos a &# million grant to find out whether the same social forces could work in nutrition the goal of the researchers shape up plan was to have somerville children burn more calories through exercise and take in fewer with a healthier diet for a total benefit of calories a day what was missing from the program at first was a community champion someone like c everett koop the surgeon general who railed against tobacco or ralph nader in the battle over car safety "i knew we needed a sparkplug " says dr economos she found it in somerville mayor joseph curtatone a lawyer and volunteer football coach at the local high school mr curtatone says he had gained weight on the campaign trail and was hoping to shed a few pounds when dr economos walked into his office to talk about her hopes for a community based obesity intervention in somerville "i bought into it right away because i could see the potential " says mr curtatone he figured projects to encourage exercise and good eating could make the city a better place to live regardless of how the experiment turned out "were here to improve the lives of everybody in the city " says the mayor "its not about an individual getting a gym membership " shaping up somerville wasnt going to be easy only of the citys square mile territory is open space thousands of cars roar through somerville every day on their way to boston making streets less than friendly for walkers and cyclists among the towns first second and third graders were already overweight or considered at risk of becoming overweight based on their body mass index according to dr economos thats above the national figure of about though somerville isnt among the more affluent boston suburbs mayor curtatone quickly figured out that the type of changes dr economos envisioned didnt cost a lot of money for instance many people couldnt find crosswalks because the paint had faded the city switched to a longer lasting reflective paint it redeployed school crossing guards to areas where children were most likely to walk to school and the tufts team gave parents maps of which routes were staffed the moves resulted in a increase in the number of children who walk to school according to jessica collins a former tufts project manager who now directs a somerville community health program separately the tufts researchers helped the city win a grant from the robert wood johnson foundation for a bigger ticket item an extension of a bike path that will eventually go all the way to boston "this little experiment that came here is now tied to many other decisions we have made " says mr curtatone many of the efforts didnt even focus on children the tufts researchers held parent meetings in english portuguese haitian creole and spanish to explain the goals of the shape up plan tufts workers organized city hall health fairs a pedometer giveaway and a community fun run that the mayor joined as the spirit caught on the city council came up with its own ideas reimbursements on gym membership for city employees and dozens of new bike racks for schools and streets twenty one area restaurants received designation as shape up partners in exchange for making small menu changes such as using low fat substitutes and offering smaller portions beth ann dahan co owner of soleil cafe &amp catering says she was happy to participate because it was good for business "when shape up first started i remember people would tell me we came here because you were on the list " she says at the somerville schools food service director mary jo mclarney decided the best way to change the eating habits of the districts schoolchildren wasnt to focus on calories but to improve the taste and quality of the food served in school with help from the tufts team she replaced some frozen foods with fresher choices such as pizza made with fresh french bread to boost fiber intake cafeteria workers put cheeseburgers on whole grain rolls mixed whole grain pancake batter and shelved french fries in favor of baked potato wedges with the skin left on the shape up grant from the cdc paid for refrigerated display cases food processors and fruit juicers to make serving fresh fruits and vegetables easier for the kitchen staff dr economos persuaded a whole foods store to donate about &# in fresh produce now children are allowed to eat as much fruit as they want one day the mayor joined schoolchildren in the cafeteria to make fresh squeezed orange juice "its a balancing act because it doesnt serve any purpose for us to produce meals nobody will eat "" says ms mclarney "its about giving them the most nutritious highest quality meal were able to and its probably more balanced than theyre able to bring from home " in classrooms teachers taught a nutrition and exercise curriculum designed by tufts one part focused on a fruit or vegetable of the month and children took part in taste tests during cucumber month they munched on cucumbers and ranch dressing and dill pickle spears january was bean month beans are a healthy fiber rich food but they can be a tough sell with kids somerville children sampled bean and cheese quesadillas red beans and rice hummus and vegetarian chili and voted on their favorites quesadillas won hummus lost "the voting alone encourages kids to try the item " says ms mclarney "kids wanted the chance to have their voice heard so they would try a food just for the chance to put a little piece of paper in a box " not every effort succeeded the food service department held a contest seeking healthy recipes from parents and the winner was a salad that included chopped cucumbers tomatoes low fat cheese and beans it tasted good to contest judges but didnt draw eaters when placed in large bowls in the cafeteria the children still grumble about the switch from french fries to potato wedges the school district even lost a little money for a while when it eliminated chips cookies ice cream and sports drinks from the snack foods sold at lunch given the choice of milk or juice or sherbet once a week many kids opted to buy nothing but then a funny thing happened says ms mclarney forced to go without a fatty or sugar rich snack more children and teachers started buying the healthy lunch food the schools are selling twice as much fruit in their lunchrooms as they did five years ago she says "everyone was unhappy "" concedes ms mclarney "but we just decided it was in everybodys best interest kids have &# in their pocket and theyre choosing between a sundae powerade and a bag of chips or a salad or sandwich what do you think theyll pick " outside of the cafeteria even art teachers got into the act by encouraging children to paint fruits and vegetables the tufts team created an after school curriculum that included yoga dance and soccer ruth grossman a sixth grader at benjamin g brown school says her teacher used to hand out candy bars as a reward for doing well now the teacher hands out passes that allow children to skip homework or a test question ruth says she used to snack on potato chips but has switched mostly to fruit she also started taking a fitness class and her mother took up rowing "i learned that eating the right foods helps you do things " says ruth "eating a good meal before a test helps you focus better and last longer " celia taylor a second grade teacher at arthur d healey elementary school said she started taking yoga classes after teaching the shape up curriculum and the lessons prompted her to change snack time in her classrooms in the past children brought whatever snack they wanted now the class has a group snack brought in by parents and selected from a list of healthy options like cheese and crackers or fruit all the efforts translated into a modest but significant difference after eight months of the shape up program researchers in may and june measured the height and weight of first second and third graders in somerville they compared the results with children in two nearby towns that werent part of the shape up program they took the childrens body mass index and calculated a "z score " a measure of how much they differed from the typical child of their age and gender in the two control towns the "z score" barely budged according to the report in obesity in somerville the z score fell significantly suggesting the children were moving closer to a healthy weight the average somerville second grader gained about four pounds while a similar child at other schools gained about five pounds earlier efforts to reduce childhood obesity usually focused solely on the school day while some have produced modest results most have failed to lead to measurable changes in body weight a cdc task force recently concluded that theres insufficient evidence to determine what type of school based interventions are effective against childhood obesity dr economos hopes somervilles changes will be sustainable because they involve the entire community not just the schools after the initial &# million grant expired the tufts researchers helped somerville secure an additional &# million in new grants to keep up the effort today a department of homeland security grant is providing fitness equipment at fire stations and chefs to train the firefighters about nutrition and healthy meals a doctor now sponsors the community fun run the city council is discussing whether to give some workers bicycles instead of government funded cars now dr economos is working with the save the children foundation to adapt and test some of the shape up initiatives for rural schoolchildren in the mississippi delta appalachia and californias central valley "a lot of people making a few small changes added up to this huge thing " says dr economos "we couldnt go to the kids and say you have to change your lifestyle we had to change the environment and the community spirit first "
