kkr allows first data covenant other firms are watching to gauge credit sentiment as deal enters final stage kkr has blinked kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co now appears willing to make concessions to investment banks arranging the &# billion in debt for its purchase of first data corp according to people familiar with the matter specifically the private equity firm appears willing to agree to a covenant that places a performance criteria on first datas debt these people said making it easier to sell the debt to investors leery of the potential risk as a result the sale of the debt financing is expected to be launched by midweek these people said the drama over kkr and first data now moving into its final stages is being closely watched as a test of debt market sentiment amid worries over risk and market liquidity the first data deal is part of a roughly &# billion pipeline of financing for deals around the globe deals agreed to when investors were more willing to shoulder such loans with little protection for them the banks have claimed they would face losses of as much as &# billion if the terms werent substantially altered kkr previously said it was unwilling to make the sort of concessions that would deny it flexibility in the way it manages first data late last night kkr seemed willing to agree to one covenant on the bank debt in this case an agreement to maintain a certain level of earnings before interest payments depreciation tax and amortization in relation to the senior debt people familiar with the matter said one issue that isnt on the table these people said is the possibility of raising the interest rate to entice buyers to buy the debt backing the deal that means first data wont face any additional interest burden beyond what it originally expected to pay the stakes are high for both the private equity firm and the banks to get the &# billion deal done kkr has reached out to its own investors for part of the equity component and it stands to pocket as much as &# million in fees from first data for getting the deal done at the same time kkr is paying the banks &# million to &# million in fees "it is to everyones benefit for the syndication process to move smoothly " says one person who worked on the deal "and it benefits both kkr and the banks for the debt to trade well " even with the covenant banks likely will still take a loss from the debt sale reflecting market problems rather than first datas health bankers say that with the credit markets spooked it is practically impossible for any loan to be sold at cents on the dollar no matter how healthy the underlying company as of last night people familiar with the matter said some portion of the senior debt or bank loans likely will be sold to investors at cents or cents on the dollar and that some of the debt will go onto the banks balance sheets high yield or junk bonds that are part of the financing package wont be sold to investors until later kkr already had expressed willingness to make other minor concessions first data will likely retain the right to not make cash interest payments if for any reason it encounters economic head winds kkr generally has been unwilling to agree to terms for deal financing that limit its leeway as owners of a company in order to help the banks avoid an accounting loss according to people familiar with the matter they say kkr has argued that it has been paying out fees to the banks for years and that the banks have never before had to make good on commitments to provide standby financing first data is a greenwood village colo credit card processor that kkr is buying for &# a share in the case of this deal the banks had some leverage because they give the credit card processor a lot of business kkr "recognized that the relationships with wall street are ongoing " says a person involved in the negotiations "this way the company is set up to succeed " now the ability to sell this debt will depend in part on how much investors themselves will be able to borrow hedge funds with an interest in buying the loans associated with the deal typically have sought to borrow &# for every &# of their own cash bankers and hedge fund managers say that sort of arrangement common just a few months ago no longer is on offer the reduced hedge fund buying power has led to a certain disconnect within wall street firms debt market people say the huge deal related backlog will be placed in an orderly fashion in coming weeks and months but the prime brokers at these same firms who arrange hedge funds borrowing lines have been drastically cutting back without the borrowing facilities investor demand is likely to fall far short of supply the same dynamic is true for managers of what are known as collateralized loan obligations these managers buy up pieces of loans that come along combine them and then sell slices that have higher credit ratings this market which depends on the extensive use of borrowed money has slowed markedly with little leverage now available where the money will come from to absorb all that debt is an open question complicating the talks between private equity firms in various pending buyouts and the banks financing their deals is the fact that the banks themselves arent united other private equity firms are watching closely what happens with the first data deal it isnt clear whether being the first in the queue is an advantage or disadvantage the founders of some private equity firms worry that first data may suck all existing demand out of the market and the next deal that comes to market will fare more poorly
