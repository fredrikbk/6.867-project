new rules for picking a bottom the stock market has been seeing exceptional volatility lately of a kind that in the past sometimes signaled that stocks were getting ready to rally trouble is some analysts worry that the rules may be different this time because the heavy and sometimes frantic trading practices of some hedge funds are skewing market behavior the fear is that the data may be signaling something very different than in the past this concern has taken on urgency after fridays point plunge in the dow jones industrial average to another day of unusual trading activity that spurred fears that stocks have farther to fall the question on everyones mind is when will the market hit bottom analysts who dissect market movements have many theories about how to pick the bottom one that has been effective is to look for days of exceptionally heavy selling followed by days of exceptionally heavy buying the logic when stocks are approaching the end of a decline investors tend to be in a panic and their sell orders dominate trading then once the selling runs its course bullish investors step in with heavy buy orders that dominate trading and in turn signal the beginning of a rally lately that combination of heavy selling followed by heavy buying is exactly what the market has seen on steroids "we have been getting these days at the rate of one every days and thats just crazy " says paul desmond president of research service lowrys reports in north palm beach fla who has done extensive research on the subject "we dont have anything like that anywhere in our history" of data going back to he says heavy volatility can excite investors when markets are rising but it is scary when markets are disturbed as they have been lately the trick is to figure out when the down volatility is running its course and that is what seems to be getting harder to do to identify one way days mr desmond looks at total trading volume for all stocks that finished up and for all stocks that finished down he also looks at the total price moves in dollars for those two groups the days to watch are those on which of volume was in the same direction and of price moves were as well on the friday before the crash of volume and of price movement were accounted for by declining stocks according to mr desmonds data on monday oct the crash day trading was even more heavily centered on decliners but that was the low point of the selling on oct of stock volume and price movement was up indicating the worst was over similar days occurred at the bottom of the bear market there was only one such day at the bottom but several such days hit a few months later in when the u s invaded iraq and stocks fell almost to the low after that decline stocks entered the bull market that has continued until now since there have been few big declines and few heavy one way trading days in total from through the only significant grouping occurred in mid just as the market suffered a sudden slide and then recovered so the signal seemed to be working a year ago now the pattern of one way trading has returned since stocks peaked on july there have been nine such days six down and three up four down days came from july through aug then there were three up days in mid to late august and two such down days including a down day on friday that represents more such swings than in before and after the crash but other market indicators arent nearly as shaken up as in the dow industrials and the standard &amp poors stock index are down less than from their highs in the past they would be down more than before seeing so many heavy swings something isnt right "i am not sure you can jump to the conclusion" that all this activity is signaling anything at all about the likelihood of a stock recovery says brian luedtke head of technical analysis at brokerage firm piper jaffray in minneapolis he and other analysts think the sudden increase in market volatility could be due to the growing role of hedge funds and other fast trading investment vehicles which on some days account for of trading or more some hedge funds use computers to trade millions of shares at a time others trade heavily in exchange traded funds which affect broad baskets of stocks if several huge hedge funds using lots of borrowed money to expand their impact and following similar strategies use computers to make similar trades at the same time that can create huge one way days without signifying a lasting change in market sentiment ned davis research in venice fla has long tracked what it calls nine to one days based simply on trading volume days when of the shares traded move in the same direction there has been so much volatility of late that the firm has adjusted its system for up days it now counts only to one days because there are simply too many nine to one days "this used to be a good signal of a major bottom " says tim hayes ned daviss chief investment strategist "now it could be turning into a signal of the end of a less significant market correction or it could be turning into an inconsistent signal" that simply means investors are anxious mr desmond of lowrys was optimistic about the markets direction a month ago but he now has turned more pessimistic other performance indicators he follows involving the number of stocks that are rising and falling over longer periods and the strength of the markets recent efforts to rally suggest to him that stocks may have farther to fall because other indicators are looking somewhat negative mr desmond thinks the recent surge in days could be a false signal for that he blames in part the securities and exchange commission in early july the sec eliminated a rule that restricted a practice known as short selling in which investors borrow stock and sell it in hopes of profiting if the stocks price declines the old rule instituted after the crash and aimed at preventing floods of stock selling generally allowed short sellers to sell borrowed stock only on an uptick after a purchase had sent the price up now short sellers can sell at any time some academics sec officials and short sellers have said that the rule change isnt having a significant effect on stocks and there was no reason to restrict short sellers but many traders blame it for making it easier for hedge funds to sell stocks massively in a downturn after which they have more stock to buy back when they cover their bets helping push stocks higher during an upturn mr desmond says he fears that the recent volatility will scare off ordinary investors leaving the market increasingly dominated by hedge funds "now when we are in a dramatic period of speculation the sec is saying lets speed this up some more it seems irresponsible " mr desmond says
