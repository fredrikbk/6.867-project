china investment fund may tread softly beijing its hard to stay under the radar when you have &# trillion thats why chinas plans to adopt a more aggressive approach to investing some of its vast foreign currency holdings have created such a stir in global financial markets in recent weeks rumors have zapped around the globe naming china as a potential buyer of stakes in everything from retailer wal mart stores inc to a british natural gas concern politicians from washington to berlin have fretted about possible chinese purchases of strategic assets but people involved in planning chinas effort say its new investment style is likely to be more conservative and less disruptive than some observers expect for years chinas investments have been mostly a force for stability in financial markets the country has plowed huge sums of foreign currency earned from its exports into u s treasurys and other safe assets in the process it has helped the u s finance its yawning trade deficit but as its reserves surpassed &# trillion beijing decided it could afford to seek higher returns on at least some of that money by pursuing riskier investments like stocks so earlier this year it announced plans to form a state investment company to be capitalized initially with about &# billion people involved with the planning say the new company could be formally established as soon as this month though it may not happen until later this year the new company is expected to be among the largest of what are called sovereign wealth funds pools of money amassed and managed by governments to achieve high returns chinas entry into the game has added to the enormous sums controlled by these often secretive sovereign funds china kicked off its new approach to investing with a bang in late may it agreed to pay &# billion for just less than of blackstone group lp just weeks ahead of the u s private equity firms initial public offering the deal an unusually bold one for chinas government fueled expectations of all kinds of similar investments but the blackstone deal was an anomaly say people familiar with the preparations for the new investment company they say the company is unlikely to spend its money buying up large equity stakes in foreign companies instead it is likely to farm out much of its investment to professional money managers especially in its early years in what could be a boon to big private sector investment companies the company will be "a passive investor the mission for this company is purely investment return driven " says jesse wang a senior chinese financial official and member of the companys preparatory group "i think most of our money probably will be invested through outsourcing to fund managers instead of that kind of direct investment " the plans reflect the many constraints surrounding the company as a state institution in a still nominally communist country for example it may have limited ability to offer the kind of salaries that would lure away experienced private sector fund managers some critics in china have labeled top executives at state owned chinese banks who make &# a year or less as overpaid even though their paychecks for those positions are relatively small by international standards politics also argues against big direct investments in foreign companies officials in several countries have voiced concerns about the actions of sovereign wealth funds in general and chinas in particular the european commission the european unions executive arm is scheduled to discuss the issue of sovereign wealth funds this month and some in congress have raised concerns about chinas investment plans the chinese companys planners are sensitive to those concerns and are eager to find investment strategies that avoid aggravating them say people involved that approach also makes sense to outsiders watching chinas plans "limiting political opposition argues for avoiding large stakes and instead betting on the broad market the size of the funds that china needs to place argues for a similar strategy " says brad setser a former u s treasury official now at roubini global economics there are also internal differences that need to be resolved before the investment company can fully pursue its mission for one thing it hasnt been formally named the new entity was to be called the state investment co but people close to the fund say that could be scrapped in favor of something like china investment co the company has also been the subject of contention between different parts of the bureaucracy one proposal is to let part of the money allocated to the fund be used to invest alongside big chinese state owned companies if they make overseas investments but it isnt clear how much money would be available for such plans indeed the company is likely to have significantly less cash to play with at the outset than headline figures indicate of the &# billion in initial capital it ostensibly will receive &# billion is slated to go almost immediately to purchase central huijin investment co an agency under the central bank that controls most of the states holdings in lenders like industrial &amp commercial bank of china ltd a significant share of the remaining two thirds of the fund possibly tens of billions of dollars is expected to be used to recapitalize other big state banks the companys preparations are being overseen by lou jiwei a year old former deputy minister of finance known as a savvy but understated technocrat mr lou has made it a point to solicit advice from outside experts including two foreign management consulting firms singapores state investment firm temasek holdings which has long pursued a strategy of buying strategic stakes in major companies outside the city state has sometimes been cited as a potential role model for the new chinese company but people close to the planning process say a more appropriate model might be a university endowment fund like those of yale or harvard which also tend to place much of their money with professional fund managers another reason chinas fund may avoid big direct investments in foreign companies its preliminary efforts so far havent been a big success blackstone shares have lost nearly since they listed chinas stake in blackstone which is to become part of the investment companys assets was purchased at a discount to the ipo price but now is far below its initial value that has triggered some criticism from the chinese public although people involved with the deal point out that it was always intended to be a long term investment
