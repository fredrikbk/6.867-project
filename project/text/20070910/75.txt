schumer wants to soften limits on fannie freddie washington amid a worrisome slump in the u s housing market democrats are stepping up efforts to increase the flow of funds into home mortgages by expanding the authority of fannie mae and freddie mac despite white house efforts to limit the companies roles the latest move comes today as sen charles schumer plans to introduce a bill that would temporarily loosen growth constraints on the two government sponsored investors and increase the size of mortgages they can purchase in high cost areas "this is what fannie and freddie were designed for " the new york democrat said "to have the public purpose and use private sector knowledge and dollars " prospects for mr schumers bill would have been slim several months ago but credit market turmoil has led many democrats and some republicans to call for the companies to step up their activities as worries about defaults and a weak housing market keep other investors on the sidelines fannie and freddie buy mortgages and repackage them as investment securities but are bound by limits on size and types the bush administration has opposed changes similar to those proposed by mr schumer but white house and treasury officials have been under growing pressure to address the market turbulence last week at a hearing in the house of representatives democrats repeatedly challenged the treasury undersecretary for domestic finance robert k steel to reverse the administrations stance regarding the companies mr schumers bill would also allow the companies for one year to purchase loans of as much as &# in high cost areas currently they arent allowed to purchase mortgages above &# democrats have argued that fannie and freddie should be allowed to purchase more expensive mortgages to provide liquidity to a broader group of housing markets because of past accounting problems fannie and freddie arent allowed to expand their portfolios beyond strict limits set by their regulator the office of federal housing enterprise oversight until they finish overhauling internal controls fannies portfolio is capped at &# billion and freddies at &# billion though freddie mac can increase its portfolio a year mr schumers bill would also allow the companies for one year to purchase loans of as much as &# in high cost areas currently they arent allowed to purchase mortgages above &# democrats have argued that fannie and freddie should be allowed to purchase more expensive mortgages to provide liquidity to a broader group of housing markets it is unclear how senate banking committee chairman christopher dodd d conn and house financial services committee chairman barney frank d mass feel about mr schumers proposal but the two chairmen have argued that fannie and freddie should begin playing an expanded role in mortgage markets immediately last week mr frank said he planned to introduce an amendment that would also dramatically raise the loan limit he said the amendment would be attached to a bill supported by the white house that would give the federal housing administration more flexibility as an insurer of mortgage loans some republicans argue that allowing fannie and freddie to purchase high cost mortgages would distract them from their mission to support affordable housing the house passed a bill earlier this year that would revamp oversight of both companies it would also allow the companies to purchase more expensive mortgages in high cost areas of the country though not by as much as mr schumer has proposed
