investing in funds a monthly analysis etfs seek room in your k they are pushing hard for coveted space but mutual funds arent welcoming them exchange traded funds seem to be everywhere these days but as the industry seeks to maintain its rapid growth there is one area where the products are struggling to make headway k retirement plans etf providers have been waging an uphill battle to persuade the biggest retirement plan sponsors and administrators to offer their products access would provide the etf industry with a huge new pool of investor money to tap and a steady stream of profits the k market helped boost the profile and earnings of mutual fund companies and some say it could provide the same ride for etfs if only someone would hand them a ticket what is holding them back etf providers blame mutual fund companies some which run some of the biggest k plans saying their resistance stems from fear of competition etfs in general charge lower fees than average mutual funds mutual fund purveyors see it differently they say that they already offer plenty of low cost mutual funds that track stock and bond market indexes as most etfs do and that some of the most heavily touted features of etfs such as tax efficiency and flexible intraday trading offer few advantages in k plans which already are tax advantaged and geared toward long term investing "weve had virtually no demand from our plan sponsors for etfs " says jennifer engle a spokeswoman at mutual fund giant fidelity investments which runs about &# billion in k accounts clients are satisfied with the array of low cost index mutual funds currently available she says the logistics of offering etfs also complicate things etfs can be bought and sold on exchanges like stocks but most k programs arent set up to process the trades and because they trade like stocks etfs charge commissions costs that can diminish the returns of workers who make small regular contributions to their retirement accounts "its an extremely large and embedded process that theyre trying to crack through and getting into those plans is very cumbersome " says scott ebner senior vice president of the etf marketplace at the american stock exchange which lists hundreds of etfs while plan sponsors are thinking about offering etfs they "move pretty slowly and dont make changes that are this fundamental" overnight says david wray president of the profit sharing k council of america a nonprofit association of companies and retirement plan participants the k angle has been a hot topic at recent etf conferences a presentation at an industry gathering this summer for example was dubbed "etfs and k plans retirement plans the pot at the end of the rainbow " to gain a foothold many etf providers are either building computerized "platforms" to support trading of etfs within k plans or forming partnerships with companies that are some firms are devising solutions to minimize etf trading commissions aggregating trades across investor portfolios for example to limit the role of stockbrokers and other middlemen because mutual fund giants such as fidelity and others generally dominate k administration at the nations biggest companies etf providers are taking aim at retirement plans at small to midsize firms where employees sometimes have more expensive or less efficient investment choices "you can be a hero" in such markets benefitstreet inc a retirement plan platform maker says in a marketing presentation benefitstreets etf partners include barclays global investors or bgi a unit of britains barclays plc "its on the agenda in nearly every provider meeting" that advisers and retirement plan record keepers want to be able to use etfs for k portfolios says robert nestor head of new business strategy at bgi named after a section of the internal revenue code k plans let investors set aside income for retirement while deferring taxes on both the contributions and investment earnings until the money is withdrawn employers often match workers contributions which helps savings grow faster the plans held an estimated &# trillion at the end of representing about of the overall u s retirement market according to the investment company institute a mutual fund industry trade group about half of retirement money is held in defined contribution plans which include k s and in individual retirement accounts according to the ici the other half is in government pension and private sector defined benefit plans as well as annuities just over half of the money in k plans was invested in mutual funds as of the end of last year ici statistics show followed by investments in products offered by insurance companies banks and other institutions the &# trillion of mutual fund money in k accounts represented about of total mutual fund assets in the u s at the end of last year while assets in etfs have more than quintupled to about &# billion since less than of k money is estimated to be in the products firms like benefitstreet are trying to narrow that gap the san ramon calif company which runs about &# billion in retirement money for more than plans started offering etfs from barclays global investors and others in june on a k platform it sells to client companies its approach involves aggregating etf trades among say hundreds or thousands of employees to diffuse commission costs it eventually aims to send trades directly to stock exchanges bypassing floor brokers another small firm invest n retire llc in portland ore already trades directly with exchanges and has a patent pending on the method rather than bundle the trades invest n retire processes them throughout the day with an automated system that executes them for a few cents a share rpg consultants of new york offers a system that places orders to brokers in bulk daily to help keep costs low etf firms themselves are developing trading and administrative systems as well as other approaches to expanding use of their products state street global advisors a unit of state street corp has a project under way to figure out the best approach to the k market for etfs says jill iacono director of national accounts wisdomtree investments inc s sales force is targeting retirement plans for a k platform it plans to roll out in october the etf provider in april created a division focused on the retirement business some etf advantages relative to mutual funds line up nicely with a push by the u s labor department and other federal agencies to improve fund and fee disclosure for individual investors etf providers say the labor departments employee benefits security administration was recently taking comments on the best ways to improve k plan administrative and investment related fee information because etfs track indexes data on their holdings are available at all times while many mutual funds run by managers who pick stocks are required to disclose their holdings only periodically throughout the year u s diversified stock etfs on average charge of assets as an annual expense while comparable mutual funds charge but even that isnt enough to win over many employers says rick meigs president of khelpcenter com llc a web site providing information to sponsors of and participants in k plans "most plans dont see a distinct enough advantage to them" over low cost mutual funds which already offer a "broad array of choice " he says one way etfs may wind up in more k programs is through the booming category of target date funds these funds automatically shift to more conservative holdings from more aggressive ones as the investor nears retirement the "target date" of the fund the pension protection act of is helping expand k default investment options to include such funds in general these investments are "funds of funds " meaning they invest in a range of mutual funds or etfs rather than individual securities etfs are the underlying investments in a growing number of target date products target date funds offered by federated investors inc j &amp w seligman &amp co and others have included broad market etfs such as bgis ishares s&amp p or ishares msci eafe xtf lp a new york financial services firm developed target date mutual funds this year that include etfs one drawback is that target date funds may be pricier than individual etfs since they may include fees for both the underlying funds and the manager who packages them ms gullapalli is a staff reporter in new york for the wall street journal she can be reached
