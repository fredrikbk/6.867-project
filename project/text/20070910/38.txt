investing in funds a monthly analysis exchange traded funds behind all the etf trading exchange traded funds change hands a lot why heres everything you need to know true to their names exchange traded funds trade a lot while etfs are akin to index tracking mutual funds the biggest difference is they are bought and sold on exchanges like shares of a stock the two best known ones the spdr which follows the standard &amp poors stock index and the powershares qqq which mimics the nasdaq regularly top lists of the most traded securities in the u s they change hands more often than the behemoth stocks that make up the dow jones industrial average or highflying technology names like yahoo inc and intel corp growing numbers of mom and pop investors have been attracted to etfs for their tax efficiency and razor thin expense ratios in comparison with the fees charged on average by conventional mutual funds but popularity with individual investors doesnt explain the high trading volumes that etfs regularly produce how much of etf trading comes from small investors what role do hedge funds those largely unregulated investment pools for institutions and the wealthy play in the trading frenzy can massive trading by big players hurt small buy and hold types etf trading can be extremely complicated here in simplest terms are the most important questions and answers for small investors and their financial advisers q who are the traders a as fund companies have launched new etfs that slice the stock market into sometimes tiny segments vanguard group inc founder john bogle among others has complained that the products contradict the original goal of index funds broad diversification and long term investing etfs the critics say encourage small investors to try to beat the market by betting on particular sectors or countries at particular times something that is extremely difficult to do with regular success etf trading may be capturing the imagination of some individuals but for now little guys remain a relatively small piece of the action big institutional players dominate since the spdrs launch in pension funds hedge funds and wall street trading desks have used etfs both as parts of complex financial bets and for some relatively simple purposes a mutual fund for example may park cash in s&amp p linked etfs while the portfolio manager scouts for investment opportunities while some of the largest single trades may be placed by institutions like pension funds hedge funds make up a big portion of daily trading volume perhaps as much as says mike crinieri head of etf trading at goldman sachs group inc which acts as broker to large institutions q what kind of trades do hedge funds make a these lightly regulated investment pools are notoriously secretive but in general hedge funds use etfs to make bets on swaths of the market among other things hedge funds are known for "shorting" etfs or selling borrowed shares on the assumption that if prices fall these shares can be replaced later with others bought at cheaper prices q what effect does etf trading by institutions and hedge funds have on small investors in the same funds a it shouldnt hurt small investors at all this may seem counterintuitive because regulators who probed trading in conventional mutual funds earlier this decade alleged that rapid in and out moves of favored big investors hurt small buy and hold types by driving up transaction and other costs etfs are an entirely different animal because their creation process serves to protect small investors from such trading costs etfs are created when a trading firm such as a securities brokerage or specialist assembles baskets of stocks that match an index or represent an industry country or other specific theme the trading firm then exchanges these stocks with a custodian who in return issues etf shares that the trading firm then can either hold or sell to smaller investors those etf shares can be resold any number of times among investors on an exchange without the underlying stocks being touched similarly when a trading firm opts to take etf shares off the market usually because demand for the underlying securities has gotten greater than demand for the fund it hands over the etf shares to the custodian and gets the underlying stocks in return as a result of this process the cost of buying and selling hundreds of individual stocks to create and eliminate etf shares is borne by the trading firms not the fund itself as for all the trading of the etf shares among investors once they are created strong volume is generally seen as a healthy sign just as it is for most stocks of individual companies in fact some financial advisers steer clear of the most thinly traded etfs an etf market with lots of people willing to buy and sell throughout the day helps to ensure that investors will get a price that closely reflects the etfs underlying "net asset value " the per share price of all the securities represented by the fund thinly traded etfs may rely on the good offices of specialists firms charged with ensuring that buying and selling can take place in an orderly fashion at all times when a buyer or seller for a particular etf is hard to find one of these firms may step in to act they also provide "seed capital" for new funds ensuring there is at least a small supply of etf shares available for the funds first day of trading lately with dozens of new etfs hitting the market and electronic trading taking away business from specialist firms etfs have been forced to launch with smaller and smaller amounts of seed capital a potential problem q doesnt rampant short selling of etfs by hedge funds hurt small investors somehow a it shouldnt when a companys shares are shorted managements often cry foul because the appearance of large sell orders can put downward pressure on a companys stock price that shouldnt happen with an etf any sudden downward pressure on an etfs price due to shorting would likely make the etf cheaper than its underlying stocks other short term traders would see that situation as an opportunity to buy the fund at a discount with buyers rushing to the scene the price of the etf will soon get driven back up if for some reason it isnt the buyers know they can always exchange the etf for the underlying stocks with the custodian making a profit that way q how exactly does this redemption creation mechanism work a institutional traders scour the markets for discrepancies between the price of an etf and its underlying stocks if the etfs price gets a little higher than the underlying stocks these arbitrageurs often will do two things they purchase the individual stocks while selling the expensive etf shares on an exchange and pocketing a profit equivalent to the price difference the flurry of sell orders tends to drive the etfs share price back in line with the underlying stocks then the traders can deliver their basket of newly purchased stocks to the etf custodian and receive fund shares bringing their portfolio of holdings back full circle this arbitrage trading often is overseen by computer programs says mike woods chief executive of xtf global asset management llc an asset management firm that in the past has acted as an etf arbitrageur price discrepancies often reflect corporate events such as stock splits dividends or mergers which may affect the price of individual stocks before they affect the price of the etf firms race to make a profit on the discrepancy but rewards are small unless they trade a huge number of shares thanks to the etf creation redemption mechanism it has been rare for an etf to spend a single day at more than a discount to its nav thats a big point of difference between etfs and that other type of mutual funds that trades on an exchange closed end funds closed end funds have a fixed number of shares and so often trade above or below the value of the securities they own q havent there been some instances of etfs deviating widely a yes it can happen from time to time especially to international funds as recently as friday aug for instance a number of international funds finished trading at prices far above their net asset values the ishares ftse xinhua china fund ended the day above the value of its underlying stocks spdr s&amp p china fund was ahead and the slightly broader focused spdr s&amp p emerging asia pacific fund what gives as it happened that was the day the federal reserve decided to address the recent turmoil in the credit markets cutting the discount rate at which it lends money to banks the feds move sent the dow jones industrial average surging points for the day however the feds decision wasnt reported until about a m eastern time on friday morning etfs traded in the u s that represent stocks of chinese and other east asian companies surged with the rest of the u s market but the overseas stocks that those etfs represent had already closed for the day these stocks didnt make up the lost ground until monday the temporary discrepancy meant that u s investors that sold their investments friday got a few bucks extra based on the funds reported net asset values those that bought then had to pay a few bucks extra the same phenomenon can work in reverse on feb a sell off in china prompted stock markets around the world to post big losses after markets in china and other asian markets closed traders in the u s and europe got spooked and began a selling spree that ultimately sent a number of international etfs much further south than asian traders had sent the underlying stocks u s investors who wanted to get out of their etfs on that day would have had to take a haircut a similar albeit smaller phenomenon can happen with u s stocks major u s exchanges end their regular trading session at p m weekdays but many etfs trade until p m meaning these funds have an extra minutes to drift above or below their stocks closing prices q can any large investor create and redeem etf shares a in order to trade directly with a fund a firm must sign an agreement to become an "authorized participant" and trade in large lots often etf shares according to the american stock exchange there are authorized participants across the etf industry including brokerage dealers like those of goldman sachs and merrill lynch &amp co and specialists like kellogg group llc and susquehanna international group llp while some hedge funds or proprietary traders may have the ability to create and redeem shares on their own many authorized participants act more like brokers aiming to profit from buying and selling etfs for slight mark ups with their customers for them the creation and redemption process serves as a way to manage their etf inventory the ability to exchange etf shares for the underlying stocks at any time gives brokers confidence to trade etf shares in large volumes as demanded by their customers without the fear of getting stuck with a big trove of etf shares they would have trouble reselling q how many authorized participants do most etfs have a big etfs may have a dozen or more authorized participants that traffic in their shares the spdr the largest etf has small or recently launched etfs may have just a handful including the specialist firm charged with overseeing orderly trading in the fund according to the amex while most small etfs trade without a hitch at least a few have faced hurdles when claymore macroshares oil up fund which tracks the price of oil diverged sharply from its underlying value last december observers cited the fact that it had only one authorized participant as a contributing factor claymore securities inc managing director william h belden says the unusual trading activity primarily reflected the funds novel legal structure the fund isnt technically an etf but a variant but mr belden adds that relying on just one authorized participant didnt make matters easier "it was soon after the product launched and we were in the midst of adding new authorized participants as this was happening " he says the fund has since signed up several more it is better for a fund not to be "beholden" to any single one he says q where can small investors check out the number of authorized participants for any given etf a while investors should be able to get this information from fund companies or the exchange that supervises trading in the fund it isnt easy to find in marketing materials industry analysts suggest that small investors instead focus on overall trading volume as a guide to which etfs would be expected to trade at prices closest to the value of the underlying holdings q how about bid ask spreads what are they a they are yet another wrinkle on the trading front investors buy an etf share like any ordinary stock sold on an exchange at the "ask" price usually representing a slight mark up from what the seller thinks the security is worth and they ultimately sell at the "bid" price usually a slight mark down these extra costs known as the "spread " typically amount to just pennies per share however small that may seem all trading costs add up so in general an investor wants as small a spread as possible as with stocks the more heavily traded an etf the narrower the bid ask spread tends to be investors can visit xtf global asset managements free web site xtf com to learn more about bid ask ratios for individual etfs the site reflects the bid ask spread as a fraction of the etfs price over the past six months and ranks each etfs bid ask ratio against other funds in its category mr salisbury is a reporter for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j he can be reached at ian salisbury dowjones com
