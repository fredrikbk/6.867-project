investing in funds a monthly analysis mixing it up all weather portfolio this combination of mutual funds is designed to deliver good returns through market ups and downs feeling nervous about your investments amid the recent market volatility if so you may want to consider reducing your riskier holdings thats the message from financial advisory firm brouwer &amp janachowski inc in this column we ask prominent financial advisers who invest in mutual funds and exchange traded funds for their clients to share their model portfolios with us kurt brouwer and steve janachowski have been advisers for years and their tiburon calif firm manages &# million for individuals and institutional clients like the stanford business school alumni association and the foundation for child development in new york here they share the details of their growth and income portfolio meant for people in retirement or close to it they call it an all weather portfolio one that will generate good returns through market ups and downs the advisers like to invest with fund managers who have successful long term track records and plan to hold these funds for as long as possible they dont make bets on what type of investment will be in favor at any point such as large or small company stocks or those of companies with rapidly expanding earnings versus those of companies with steadier but less flashy results "were not very good at timing the markets " says mr brouwer the portfolio currently holds funds here are the details u s stocks the two largest holdings are the primecap odyssey growth fund to which the advisers allocate of their portfolio and the selected american shares fund at both funds invest in u s large company stocks but with slightly different approaches selected american shares is run by chris davis and ken feinberg who look for good quality companies whose shares may be selling at low prices temporarily the advisers have held this fund since and have found it to be a "steady performer" in all kinds of markets mr janachowski says in general growth stocks can be among the priciest around because investors are willing to pay more for companies whose earnings are expanding at above average rates but the stock pickers at the primecap fund look for shares of fast growing companies that may be out of favor while the fund has been around only since the managers have been advising funds offered by vanguard group for many years mr brouwer and mr janachowski also have of their portfolio in the primecap odyssey aggressive growth fund which has a similar investing style but ends up buying many smaller companies like the primecap funds many of the other growth funds in the portfolio are very "value conscious " says mr brouwer an example is the chesapeake core growth fund to which the advisers allocate of their portfolio the funds managers look for companies that have some internal catalyst that will drive growth but that the market hasnt recognized yet making their shares relatively cheap the advisers say the recent market volatility which has featured several days in which the dow jones industrial average fell by triple digit amounts could be a boon for the growth stock funds they hold as there are many stocks that dropped to levels the fund managers might consider cheap the lower prices could also be a boon for value oriented fund managers like those at longleaf partners fund to which the advisers allocate fund managers mason hawkins and staley cates look for dirt cheap stocks and often favor what the market seemingly hates the fund is currently closed to new investors another value fund in the advisers portfolio is the wintergreen fund which they first invested in last year it now accounts for of their portfolio wintergreen manager david winters previously worked at franklin mutual advisers mutual series funds which the advisers had invested in before and so when he launched his own fund in "we were ecstatic to start working with him " says mr janachowski "our emphasis really is in finding funds before they really become widely known " he adds the fund has a wide latitude in investing including buying bonds and foreign stocks and engaging in currency transactions currently the advisers are keeping a close eye on two funds in the portfolio because of concerns about their performance oakmark select managed by bill nygren and legg mason value trust run by bill miller mr nygrens fund which has a allocation in the advisers portfolio has lagged behind the standard &amp poors stock index since however the advisers are sticking to it because they like mr nygrens investing discipline and expect it will work in the long run mr nygren makes big bets on a few stocks which means that the fate of those stocks can affect the funds performance significantly one way or the other says mr janachowski in an aug note to shareholders mr nygren dubbed the funds recent performance "dreadful " he believes his teams analysis will prove correct over time but added "the waiting part can be frustrating " the legg mason value trust beat the s&amp p for consecutive calendar years through but fell behind the benchmark by percentage points in the advisers worry that the funds big size &# billion may hinder its performance even more in commentary to shareholders earlier this year mr miller attributed the streaks end to specific investment mistakes not size but the advisers still like mr millers approach they recently trimmed their value trust holdings to of their portfolio to invest in a smaller fund that he manages legg mason opportunity trust this fund which makes up of their portfolio can invest in stocks and debt instruments and can even sell shares short giving mr miller more flexibility in management two funds in the portfolio that invest in small to midsize stocks are westport select cap and fpa capital with a allocation to each the westport funds managers seek to buy cheap shares of companies that they feel are poised for a turnaround while fpa capital manager bob rodriguez looks for beaten down stocks and will hold cash for months if he doesnt find good opportunities both funds are currently closed to new investors bonds for years the advisers have held the pimco total return fund which invests in intermediate term bonds as a core bond fund holding "theyve never really given us pause " says mr janachowski the portfolio currently invests in the fund the other bond funds in the portfolio at each are western asset core plus bond which also is an intermediate term fund but differs from the pimco fund in the way it evaluates the market and the fpa new income fund which buys a variety of bonds including high yield or junk bonds and convertible securities which are debt like holdings that can convert into common shares "its important to have diversification " says mr janachowski in case the investment strategy of any given fund doesnt work in current market conditions foreign holdings the advisers dont target a specific allocation for foreign stocks but look for successful international managers currently their core foreign holdings are the harbor international fund at and the third avenue international value fund at both funds look for cheap foreign stocks while harbor buys large company stocks the manager of the third avenue fund looks across all sizes the third avenue fund is currently closed to new investors other the advisers also allocate to the merger fund which buys and sells short stocks of companies that are in merger and acquisition transactions the advisers consider this as an alternative to their fixed income holdings because like bond funds the funds "returns are not highly correlated with the stock markets " says mr janachowski the portfolio also holds a real estate fund the third avenue real estate value fund which currently invests half of its assets in foreign securities it stands at of the portfolio ms
