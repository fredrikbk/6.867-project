sugar rush ethanol giants struggle to crack brazil market family owners hesitate to sell out to big players visit from google guys ribeirao preto brazil nowadays plenty of investors want to talk to cicero junqueira franco together with two sons and numerous cousins he controls a great deal of something the world wants ethanol mr junqueira franco a founder of companhia acucareira vale do rosario a steam belching mill that crunches sugar cane into sugar and ethanol has received offers from several suitors these include a &# million bid for his company from new york based commodities giant bunge ltd but mr junqueira franco whose family arrived in brazil in the s and still owns prime tracts of sugar cane land in sao paulo state says hell never sell "why would i " asks the year old mr junqueira franco his shirt partly untucked and face flushed after a big lunch with his family thanks to high oil prices and worries over global warming multinational companies are straining to find ways into brazils booming market for biofuels renewable fuels made from crops such as corn and sugar cane the u s and other countries hope to substitute as much as of domestic gasoline for ethanol over the next decade with ample land low production costs and ethanol production experience brazil is viewed by many as the country best able to sate world demand a clutch of potential investors have descended here including commodities giants hedge funds and energy companies even the founders of google inc came to have a look but the global millions are colliding with an earthy reality families like mr junqueira francos that have controlled brazils sugar cane wealth for decades even centuries many dont want to sell others are asking sky high prices for operations riddled with problems the standoff is preventing some big foreign players from getting into brazils promising ethanol market through acquisitions forcing them to develop their own projects from scratch yet resistance to outsiders could affect how quickly larger amounts of cheap brazilian ethanol can begin flowing into the worlds auto fleet big companies which have better access to credit and capital could also help consolidate modernize and expand brazils ethanol industry frustrated investors are easy to find archer daniels midland co the largest u s ethanol producer has been shopping here for more than three years global sugar traders such as australias csr ltd and germanys sudzucker ag have met with high prices and lengthy negotiations indias largest sugar and ethanol maker bajaj hindusthan ltd announced plans a year ago to spend &# million to acquire mills after several months of courting mill owners at their expansive ranchlike fazendas the company has struck out "i have been to a lot of nice houses " says prem bajaj a bajaj business development executive many family owned mills appear to be troubled the domestic sugar and ethanol industry is informally managed and highly fragmented making it less than ideal for outside investment often millers dont have reliable accounting books and are plagued by tax disputes and debt mr bajaj and other investors say such issues can be difficult to resolve in brazils slow moving legal system labor and environmental pitfalls also loom for outsiders most sugar cane is still cut by hand grueling work that has enriched mill owners for centuries but could expose international companies to liabilities global bank hsbc holdings plc got unwelcome publicity for loans it had made to para pastoril e agricola sa a mill in the state of para that was raided by a government antislavery task force earlier this year according to brazils ministry of labor officials "rescued" workers laboring under "degrading" circumstances that included hour work days and poor sanitary conditions an hsbc spokesman says the bank "is committed to social responsibility " but declined to comment on any specific clients officials at the mill known as pagrisa have denied wrongdoing both publicly and on their web site brazils millers face some political pressure not to sell if foreigners or large companies gain leverage brazils traditional sugar producing regions stand to reap less from an ethanol boom aloizio mercadante a powerful senator from sao paulo recently called the action of millers whove sold "incredible and incomprehensible " despite the many hurdles foreign biofuels companies like adm believe that getting into brazil is still a must u s corn ethanol which is less efficient to make has been competitive with gasoline due to a cent tax credit on each gallon and both adm and competitor cargill inc faced narrowing profit margins in their u s ethanol operations last year due to leaping corn prices a side effect of greater demand for corn from ethanol producers by contrast brazils sugarcane ethanol can comfortably compete with costly oil even if oil trades in the low &# per barrel range adms ceo patricia woertz says she believes brazilian ethanol operations would provide "an opportunity for profitable growth" regardless of what happens in the u s market although a stiff import tariff of more than cents per gallon currently makes brazilian ethanol costly to import to the u s brazilian ethanol could dominate other markets in asia or europe analysts say brazil needs billions of dollars in investment to expand production and to build the pipelines ports and other infrastructure it needs to become the worlds ethanol supplier there are roughly companies running sugar and ethanol mills the five largest players generated about of the countrys ethanol production last year brazils ethanol industry is "very disorganized and consolidation will help " says clayton hygino de miranda president of the sugar and ethanol division of brazilian construction conglomerate odebrecht sa in the u s where ethanol is made from corn any company can build a refinery and buy corn on the open market but because sugar canes heft makes it costly to transport and its sucrose content degrades quickly crops are always planted close to the mills that process them that makes it difficult to sidestep people like mr junqueira franco who owns acres of prime plantation land sugar barons control over the ethanol industry could impede brazils effort to create a global market for ethanol japan for instance has been in talks with brazil since to sign a long term ethanol contract but the japanese officials have wavered expressing concerns as to whether brazils sugar families can furnish steady supplies of ethanol in the s local producers chasing high sugar prices created an ethanol shortage that left brazilian drivers of all ethanol cars without fuel having large companies that are focused on ethanol rather than sugar could help prevent supply shocks in the future brazil has been using ethanol since the s when the government decided to support the fuel as a way to limit the countrys reliance on middle eastern oil over the decades the vast nation managed to gradually lower the cost of making the fuel but gasoline was so cheap in the s that the effort almost died when oil prices began their steady climb in however sugar cane ethanol became cheaper than gasoline ethanol is also winning followers because it contributes less to global warming than gasoline while burning either fuel produces similar amounts of carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas ethanol crops such as sugar cane reabsorb carbon dioxide each time they are replanted some foreign investors have decided to create new cane plantations or "green fields " far from areas of sao paulo state where brazils powerful sugar cane families dominate investor george soros and texas hedge fund hbk group are plowing more than &# billion into such efforts as is brazilian renewable energy co or brenco a start up backed by u s billionaire ron burkle and venture capitalist vinod khosla but its a lengthy process taking at least six years before the ethanol is flowing fully that makes green field projects unattractive for many investors and its difficult to do henri philippe reichstul the former ceo of petroleo brasileiro sa brazils national oil company who now leads brenco says industry experts are reluctant to leave family companies where theyve worked for decades "for them its treason " says mr reichstul who says hes been hiring some former oilmen instead adms chief strategist steve mills said his company needs to capture know how for growing and processing sugar cane "the one thing we do know here is that were going to have to acquire some expertise in the area " says mr mills brazils milling families insist they are no roadblock to progress they note that planned expansion projects the majority from traditional companies would ramp up ethanol production by in five years to billion gallons annually an amount of energy greater than whats generated by americas largest oil field prudhoe bay in alaska others however say the industrys structure holds back bigger gains the industry currently invests far less than the u s in research while the u s department of energy will spend &# million on funding next generation ethanol plants the state of sao paulo responded by funding a competing program with just &# million the best positioned of brazils proud sugar cane kings see their own chance to become global players yet they are wary of giving up on generations of family work or ceding total control of their companies to avoid a takeover brazils largest sugar cane miller publicly traded cosan ltd recently announced a complex restructuring designed to keep founder rubens ometto silveira mello at the helm other companies open to the idea of taking on minority investors are also trying to quickly restructure marc mccarthy who follows cosans stock at bear stearns in new york says the move reflects a reality of the market "if he gave up voting control boom they would get taken out " buyers are watching the situation closely global sugar and ethanol prices slumped this year and local millers who have borrowed heavily from banks to fund expansion plans may be forced to start selling perhaps no mill has been more coveted than vale do rosario the hulking facility was built in after the biagi family heirs of an italian industrialist convinced the blue blooded junqueira clan that sugar cane could be a profitable use for their land mr junqueira francos family sold head of cattle to raise cash for the mills costly crushers and distilling tanks like other brazilian sugar cane mills vale do rosario inherited a weakness an unwieldy co operative structure that had grown with each generation with more than relatives holding small percentages of shares "its like dallas " says former shareholder marcelo junqueira referring to the s era television drama about a scheming texas oil family dissent grew as investors began flooding into brazil last year some shareholders wanted to cash in and began shopping their shares to potential buyers amid such fissures u s based commodities giant bunge offered to buy the operation for &# million last july according to people familiar with the situation like rivals adm and cargill bunge has begun pouring money into corn ethanol plants in the u s and was hungry for a foothold in more efficient brazilian sugar cane a bunge spokesman declined to confirm the &# million figure but vale do rosarios board rejected the offer mr junqueira franco whose two sons run the mills day to day operations says it was because bunge wanted outright ownership cargill inc which flirted with the idea of buying of the company according to people familiar with the negotiations was also turned away "we didnt want anyone to take charge of us " mr junqueira franco says a spokeswoman for cargill declined to comment the next takeover bid wasnt friendly it came from cosan brazils largest producer and led by mr ometto scion of a competing sugar family secretly negotiating with mr junqueira francos relatives by january of this year cosan had inked agreements with shareholders representing of the companys votes and formalized a takeover bid valuing the company at around &# million even after bunge offered to match cosans bid a group led by mr junqueira franco and three biagi brothers still didnt want to sell "capital has a hegemonic idea to own but we had a different idea " luiz biagi reflected recently while relaxing on a couch in his plantation home surrounded by his family the biagis and mr junqueira franco had one defense under the co operatives complex bylaws even the smallest shareholder had days to equal any takeover offer over hours of hurried negotiations in mid february the biagi brothers offered up their own santa elisa mill to secure a &# million credit line from brazils largest private bank bradesco the money was used to buy out family members who wanted to sell vale do rosario and santa elisa have since agreed to merge and their simplified structure control rests with the biagi brothers and mr junqueira francos family is already attracting capital in late july goldman sachs said it would invest &# million in the renamed milling company
