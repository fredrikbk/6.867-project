yahoos cautious course how now sacred cow lack of major overhaul poses test investors who have grown impatient with yahoo inc may have to wait awhile longer to see any pop in its stock the internet company replaced its chief executive in june and this summer kicked off a strategic review to better position it for a changing online advertising market and compete with the likes of google inc now partway through yahoos strategic soul searching people familiar with the matter say a major overhaul appears unlikely when the sunnyvale calif company announced lower second quarter profit and dropped its forecasts in july co founder and new ceo jerry yang told analysts that he planned to spend roughly the next days crafting a long term strategic plan and making any necessary changes to the companys staff and organization in recent years yahoo has been eclipsed by the success of googles search advertising fueled growth faced criticism for a lack of management focus fumbled some opportunities to capitalize on the latest high growth internet areas such as video and social networking and saw its revenue growth rate fall as advertisers expanded their online spending on other sites its share price has dropped about in the past months and in p m composite trading friday on the nasdaq stock market the stock was down or cents to &# "there will be no sacred cows and we need to move quickly " mr yang said in july he promised a progress report this fall and then ducked out of public sight declining even to give the standard postearnings media interviews the people familiar with the matter say that over the summer mr yang did actively assess one major sacred cow the web search advertising business it built up at great expense in recent years under the scenario discussed by top executives yahoo would have outsourced that search advertising activity which places small text ads next to web search results to either google or microsoft corp the people say one of these people says yahoo raised the idea with google such a move would likely give yahoo an immediate revenue bump representing hundreds of millions of dollars annually because google for one generates about more revenue for each consumer search than yahoo according to majestic research corp in new york it could also bring in additional one time payments from any outsourcing partner and would reduce some of yahoos operations costs and capital spending but one of the people familiar with the matter says mr yang concluded that yahoo needed to be the "marketing operating system " providing advertisers with a full menu of online ad options yahoo would have a hard time doing so if it outsourced search advertising which represents roughly of the u s online ad market one person says any discussion of outsourcing search ads has now cooled the people familiar with the situation say the dim prospects for such a major strategic change have tested some investors patience "after meeting with management in august we decided that the management isnt considering the kind of transformational changes that would be required to improve their position in the market " says glen kacher managing director of menlo park calif investment fund integral capital partners which has more than &# million under management mr kacher who believes that outsourcing search advertising could tap "massive earnings power " said integral sold its entire yahoo holdings following the mid august meeting with yahoo president susan decker and chief financial officer blake jorgensen he declined to specify the amount of those holdings "jerry yang and sue decker are committed to making significant changes to the way yahoo operates and to sharpening its focus on key initiatives that will enable the company to improve its performance and strengthen its position as the most open vibrant online marketplace for consumers advertisers and publishers " said a company spokeswoman in a statement in the absence of bold strokes mr yangs other moves are likely to seem much more mundane the company has hired san francisco consulting firm stone yamashita partners to help guide its strategic deep thinking and bring its new management team together top executives have convened for friday off site meetings over the summer and joined committees on issues such as corporate culture as part of that strategy consulting process the people familiar with the matter say mr yang has internally played down the significance of the day timeline and that no big strategic announcements are planned at the end of that period next month other likely outcomes from yahoos process the company slims down some of its activities its yahoo music service which has about to staff is among those expected to be trimmed and its fee based subscription music offering overhauled or shuttered overall the company plans to move staff around and freeze some positions though significant layoffs arent expected people familiar with the matter say some expect mr yang to increase available resources to activities that attract users from the outside such as the home page email and its finance information site as opposed to activities such as its news site which are more reliant on people linking there from other parts of yahoo yahoo executives have been signaling that it plans to add social networking features to its popular email service as a way to increase use yahoo mail with about million users is "one of the webs largest dormant social networks and one that we are aggressively pursuing ways to activate " ms decker told analysts during a postearnings conference call in july some other changes already have been announced such as the ascension of former knight ridder executive hilary schneider to oversee advertising sales and the combination of yahoos search and graphical display ad sales teams yahoo last tuesday announced plans to buy online ad network bluelithium for &# million in a further move to extend its display advertising reach online some investors are still holding out hope they believe that there is little long term downside to investing in yahoo the anticipated changes and a greater focus on operational execution could eventually yield financial improvements the long awaited overhaul to its search advertising system dubbed project panama is boosting the amount of revenue it generates for each consumer search yahoos million users world wide at the end of last quarter represent a massive audience it can tap for ad dollars "we believe that yahoos shares represent an attractive risk reward for investors willing to wait for yahoos growth initiatives to deliver positive results " concluded bear stearns &amp cos analyst robert peck in a report last week others are betting on a deal in that scenario these investors believe the shares will slide and become cheap enough to attract an acquirer willing to pay a significant premium to the current price mr peck highlighted a possible deal premium as a factor in reiterating his "outperform" rating on the shares and cited microsoft as a potential yahoo acquirer yahoo in recent years has had conversations of varying intensity with microsoft time warner inc news corp and ebay inc about combining at least some of their activities without reaching any deal people familiar with the matter say such talks dont appear to be currently active says one person familiar with the matter
