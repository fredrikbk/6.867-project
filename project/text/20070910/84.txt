with lawmakers deviated little from the script the top u s commander in iraq told a house panel that the military strategy launched in february which brought additional troops to iraq had succeeded in meeting its goals "in large measure " in a presentation replete with charts and maps gen petraeus admitted that security progress throughout iraq has been uneven in the months since the "surge" began

country they want " as had been anticipated beforehand gen petraeus indicated that some of the additional u s troops committed during the surge could begin leaving by december with the entire contingent to follow by mid eventually leaving troops in iraq "i believe that we will be able to reduce our forces to the pre surge level by next summer without jeopardizing the security gains we have fought so hard to achieve " as envisioned by gen petraeus during the hearing the drawdown would begin with departure of a unit of about marines later this month followed in mid december with the departure of an army brigade numbering about soldiers but given the rancorous tone of recriminations with which day began prompted by a full page newspaper ad from moveon org in which gen petraeus was
