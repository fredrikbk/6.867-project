the doctors office retail clinics put pressure on doctors online edition an uninsured patient came to my office recently after a weekend visit to the emergency room at the local hospital he had gone to the er complaining of dizziness an earache and generally not feeling well the er staff looked him over cleared out his impacted earwax and referred him to a mental health clinic for depression afterward the hospital presented him with a bill for &# an er isnt the best place to get basic care its expensive for the patient and inefficient for the hospital my new patient would have been better and more cheaply served with an office call or a visit to a retail clinic the possibility of a retail clinic in the towns only grocery store has the local docs fighting mad clinics in drug stores and other retail settings started out catering mostly to the uninsured but or more of the care given at the clinics these days is covered by insurance companies a trade group for the clinics says the doctors who oppose retail clinics say they are cherry picking the best business easy and profitable visits for sore throats and sinus infections break up an otherwise grueling day of time consuming patients ill with diabetes dementia and heart disease to fight the planned retail clinic the local doctors have threatened to stop referring patients for surgery and specialized care to the big multi specialty group from out of town thats looking to open it the business the group would lose by offending the local doctors could offset any gain from a retail clinic so far no clinic has arrived elsewhere in illinois and across the country retail clinics are coming doctor groups arent happy about them the illinois state medical society for one is pushing for such strict regulation of clinics that theyll be hard to set up or operate profitably i think thats a disservice to uninsured patients who cant easily access or afford health care it also doesnt acknowledge patients interest in quick convenient care for uncomplicated conditions my response to the outcry from my colleagues is when all else fails improve the product my traditional practice has always tried to be flexible in serving patients my partner and i offer everything from obstetrics care to geriatric services we carve out time or work through lunch to offer same day appointments local hmo patients rated us above average in ease of getting an appointment and time spent with the doctor my home number is listed in the phone book and i take calls after hours and on weekends for emergencies were adding another doctor to the practice this year so we can offer some evening hours and saturdays still the profitability of our practice is gradually declining due to rising costs and flat reimbursement from the government and private insurers medicare cuts are on the horizon for our elderly patients initiatives from insurers and government to track quality are poised to drive up our overhead without any real pay increase to cover the extra expense seeing more patients to increase revenue sometimes works against us instead of spreading our costs across more patient visits every complex or high risk patient we see drives up our liability insurance expenses decreasing profitability yet these are the patients who need care the most on a recent day in the office i figure that of the patients we saw could have been treated in a storefront clinic i think its time to beat the clinics or join them so im hedging my bets and planning to open one in a small town about miles from my main practice ive been seeing patients in the same town about one day a week for years by renting space in another doctors now im in the process of setting up a one room office between two pharmacies on the same street the rent will be &# a month instead of the &# month we pay each month for a full service office i plan to staff it with nurse practitioners from a m to p m weekdays and a m to p m on weekends if they see more than patients a day well be in the black i think a retail clinic will have better operating margins than our office especially with financial pressure mounting on traditional primary care practices and i think it will help meet the needs of patients in the area a storefront clinic wont solve all the problems facing our practice or the health care system but it could help prevent &# earaches due to his schedule and the volume of email he receives dr brewer may not be able to respond to all reader email he does participate in his forum where readers are urged to post his email address is thedoctorsoffice wsj com
