investing in funds a monthly analysis real estate investing homesick star manager sees steep price declines looming for once hot regions but no u s recession this summers big story strikes all too close to home the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the impact on real estate values across the country to make sense of the tumult we turned to kenneth heebner who since has managed the &# billion cgm realty fund it has the best year record of all real estate focused mutual funds up an average a year during the past decade according to morningstar inc we first spoke to mr heebner in july when he predicted that a swelling number of homeowners would default on risky mortgages causing a "loud pop" in parts of the country so how does mr heebner now view the landscape the bad news is that he is sticking by one of his predictions that has yet to materialize price declines in some of the once hottest regions the good news he doesnt see a recession ahead thanks to strong global growth mr heebner is well positioned to talk about prospects for the housing sector his fund views its mission more broadly than most rivals so he feels no pressure to make do with the best of a bad narrowly defined real estate lot his fund for instance owns more coal mining stocks than real estate investment trusts these days coal companies own a lot of land aided by this broader perspective his real estate fund is the best performer in its category year to date up through aug while the average real estate fund has shed mr heebner also runs three other mutual funds including the top performing cgm focus fund so he spends a lot of time looking at the broader economy as he seeks stocks for these portfolios here are excerpts from our conversation the wall street journal what do you make of the subprime mortgage market collapse do you still see declines as steep as you predicted last summer mr heebner whats happening here is that weve seen subprime mortgage defaults on a broad scale and its spreading to second mortgages and payment option arms adjustable rate mortgages i dont think therell be a consequence outside the u s within the u s youre going to see a very big acceleration in foreclosure activity the resulting sales will exacerbate the already existing decline in house prices on the financial side the vulnerable mortgages are not held on a broad scale by the banking system but instead are held by pension funds hedge funds for institutional accounts and wealthy individuals and foreigners there could be some effect on the manhattan and the greenwich conn economies where many hedge funds are based but no broad effect on the u s economy on the housing side last year i talked about a decline in the inflated coastal markets i think we will get there if you listen to home builders conference calls when they talk about the concessions they make in the form of extras at no cost to the buyer they can be to of the house price so we may not see the full show up in the s&amp p case schiller u s national home price index because it may come in other forms i think the decline in housing prices will be broader and deeper than i originally thought i have been surprised to see how weak the housing market in detroit has gotten we didnt realize the extent to which exotic mortgages have been used to finance houses in about of the mortgages were broadly defined as exotic including pay option arms second mortgages or subprime in the next six months i think there is going to be another meaningful leg down in housing builders need to sell about one house a week to stay cash flow positive so theyll just cut the prices additionally foreclosure activity hits the market with a lag weve got to bring house prices down to the level where buyers who would use traditional mortgages can buy them the need for housing has not gone away its just that going back in time from the low to the peak in there has been increasing activity with exotic mortgages which got people to bid the prices up to where the traditional mortgage buyer could not participate wsj it all sounds so negative yet you dont see a u s recession mr heebner most people were not using their houses as piggy banks a lot of them have paid off their mortgages a lot of them do not consider their houses as critical to their spending habits those for whom it was important their spending may cease and there could be an impact on a small portion of the population there could be a negative impact on consumer confidence because it is a new development and there will be a lot of negative publicity associated with it i think the worst that will happen is that consumer spending will level out in the u s for the u s stock market i believe that on balance what is happening in the mortgage crisis and housing industry will be positive because you will see action by the federal reserve to offset the financial crisis i do not think the global economy will be impacted there is strong growth driven by high growth in china india latin america and europe look at china of exports come to the u s go elsewhere if growth in u s consumer spending slows it wont have enough impact on chinas exports to the u s to slow the chinese economy in the past the u s consumer was the driver of the global economy i dont think thats true anymore i think that the u s stock market will be higher six months from now than it is today wsj what other repercussions do you see from the subprime mortgage meltdown good or bad mr heebner i think that the proliferation of exotic mortgages and liberal financing in residential mortgage backed securities and the cdo collateralized debt obligations market corresponded with the liberalization of standards in other credit markets so youre going to move back to a more sane environment for lending but not one thats going to hurt growth if there are going to be more repercussions it may be in the hedge fund area where hedge funds have been using extreme leverage to generate high returns but i dont think a contraction in the hedge fund industry is going to have an impact on the global economy or the u s economy wsj what is in your real estate fund these days mr heebner we have about of the fund in reits that have specific factors helping them the biggest concentration is in global mining companies given the valuations on these stocks which in many cases are very inexpensive relative to the strong growth we see in the next year or two we think they offer more compelling valuations than a lot of reits the balance of the fund is distributed in a mixture of companies which were repositioning now and which i dont want to discuss wsj how should small investors approach real estate for now mr heebner i think the public should approach real estate cautiously having said that there are a lot of specific situations in real estate and opportunities are going to be created wsj what sectors are big in your other funds mr heebner i think brazilian banks and certain companies in russia are attractive including cellular companies oao vimpel communications and oao mobile telesystems the strength of the global economy is causing strong earnings growth in companies that produce raw materials for the building markets copper iron ore coal nickel it also is creating opportunity in construction companies that are involved with infrastructure companies that build refiners and electric power plants such as fluor corp mcdermott international and foster wheeler ltd and its supporting elevated oil prices creating positive earnings patterns in select oil companies and oil services companies high oil and gasoline prices are creating accelerated demand for ethanol which is driving up corn prices and spilling over to soybeans so that the agriculture business is booming around the world ms maxey is a special writer for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j she can be reached at daisy maxey dowjones com
