investing in funds a monthly analysis fundamentals of investing passage to asia four fund managers discuss strategies for playing it safe in a region with a history of volatile stock movements after taking a serious hit last month from the u s subprime mortgage crisis many asian markets are rebounding are investors safe to continue pumping money into asian focused mutual funds or was the downdraft a signal of problems ahead "the markets are taking global risks seriously which is very healthy " says mark headley portfolio manager of the matthews pacific tiger fund since he says the august selloff took stock valuations in asia from "very expensive" to "quite reasonable " making him more inclined to start new positions in places such as china and india but while he believes the bull market is "quite intact in asia " he cautions those considering an investment ease in dont jump "it isnt a fantasy land " he says he should know he has been focused on investing in asia for almost years through all kinds of tumult including the asian financial crisis that began a decade ago this summer when the thai government broke the bahts peg to the u s dollar while the u s mortgage mess has largely overshadowed the year anniversary of that crisis which spread from thailand across almost all of asia he and other money managers who lived through it say past crises hold key lessons for todays investors the august selloff is a reminder that "if there is a shakeup in global stock markets you cant expect asia to escape that " says edmund harriss a london based portfolio manager for guinness atkinson china &amp hong kong fund since april and guinness atkinson asia focus since december asian markets as measured by the msci em asia index plunged as much as in mid august before recovering to end the month down they are up almost this year through aug asia focused mutual funds have averaged annual returns of over the past five years according to morningstar inc thirty one asia focused mutual funds were launched in the past year alone bringing the total to with &# billion under management according to lipper inc thats up from funds and &# billion in assets at the end of we asked mr headley and three other asia focused fund managers about the dangers investors face in asia today and the strategies the managers are using to avoid getting hurt here are some of their observations all eyes on the u s the managers are watching closely to see if u s consumers hurt by the subprime mortgage mess and falling house values will cut spending causing a drop in asias export volume a pullback during the christmas season for example could pour cold water on asia "though asia is less dependent on that source of growth than it used to be " there would be an impact says madelynn matlock who has managed huntington international equity fund since she says her fund aims to avoid taking new positions in export focused stocks until the situation becomes clearer location location in a failure to anticipate currency losses hurt many u s investors thailands decision to break the bahts peg to the dollar inspired partly by a widening trade deficit sparked a one day drop in the baht against the dollar among the victims of the move foreign investors whose assets were slashed in dollar terms and thai companies that had borrowed in foreign currencies and were hit with ballooning interest payments international investors fled causing thailands stock bond and real estate markets to plunge fund managers say they are pickier now about the countries in which they invest looking for those with big current account surpluses stable politics and tame inflation and then searching for stocks within those countries one way fund managers can gauge if problems are looming is to monitor how much of a stock markets return comes from u s dollar depreciation as opposed to price appreciation tied to strong corporate earnings investors need to be wary of markets that have "excess currency appreciation " says donald elefson portfolio manager of excelsior emerging markets fund since january because a currency "can go down as fast as it comes up " china south korea and taiwan are among the countries he has viewed as low risk in recent months mutual funds arent required to break down how much of their return is due to currency movements investors may be able to glean some information by looking at the dollars performance against the primary currencies represented in a mutual fund says jeff tjornehoj senior research analyst at lipper eggs in many baskets thailands woes years ago drove home how easily a crisis can spread to protect against that some managers bank on shares of companies that stand to benefit from domestic growth the thinking is they are less vulnerable to downdrafts in other countries companies serving the emerging middle class in asia financial services firms makers of branded consumer products and health care businesses are favorites for matthews ms matlock invests in companies that sell multiple products and operate in several countries or regions to reduce exposure to a crisis in one particular nation too good to be true in the s family controlled companies often tied to governments dominated asian markets many were empire builders financing acquisitions with cheap credit and paying little attention to cash flow generation when the crunch came they didnt have the cash to make interest payments when evaluating a stock today mr harriss focuses on a firms ability to generate cash willingness to pay dividends and return on new projects investors may have a tough time determining how thoroughly their mutual funds examine financial statements they can look for words like "fundamental research" or "detailed company research" in the section of the funds prospectus that explains how managers make investment decisions "but you dont really know if the managers are actually doing that " ms matlock says if the prospectus says a fund uses "quantitative methods" or "macropolicies " that might mean it isnt spending a lot of time analyzing the nature of a companys expansion she says other clouds "i dont see any great looming risks in asia but bear markets can start for many many reasons " mr headley says among them an unexpected political crisis trade tensions or much higher oil prices ms matlock frets about the potential unwinding of a practice of arbitrage by hedge funds and other big players known as the "carry trade " under which they borrow in lower interest rate currencies like the japanese yen and invest in higher rate markets like new zealand or iceland with little known publicly about the size of the trades ms matlock calls the matter "a gorilla in the room " meanwhile a dramatic strengthening of asian currencies could spark a bear market by making asian products uncompetitive in the u s if that happens asia focused funds may win on the currencies but lose on the markets ms
