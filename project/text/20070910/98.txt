tweaking titaniums recipe firms pentagon search for new way to make metal as demand surges titanium is the worlds ninth most common element but a wide range of companies and the u s government worry they cant get their hands on enough boeing co for example recently finalized a joint venture with russias vsmpo avisma corp to build a titanium forging factory by in russia to ensure adequate supplies for its new jetliner the tough yet lightweight metal makes up about of the contributing to the overall fuel efficiency that has made the plane a hot seller "in aerospace supply is getting to be quite an issue " says russ young a spokesman at boeing as titanium prices rise and the u s increasingly relies on overseas sources dupont co and several start up companies are working with the department of defense to find a new way to produce the metal investments are modest at this point but proponents say a breakthrough could transform the premium hard to make metal into a commodity much as smelting technology revolutionized and streamlined the production of aluminum a century ago it is unclear whether current efforts will pan out if they do manufacturers of everything from military and civilian jet aircraft to medical devices to bicycles could benefit meanwhile current titanium manufacturers would have to adapt "its certainly a game changer if you can lower the cost " says kuni chen a metals analyst with bank of america in new york titanium commonly found trapped in sands rocks and the earths crust is more corrosion resistant and has a higher strength to weight ratio than many other metals it also is compatible with composite material making it ideal to use in building aircraft as well as other products such as building materials desalination plants and parts of automobiles but making titanium metal is complicated the current method involves extracting titanium minerals from beach sands found in places such as africa and australia and separating the heavier titanium bearing sands from the lighter sands companies process the sand through a multistep method using chlorine carbon and magnesium to make a hard porous material called sponge the sponge is then melted in furnaces to produce titanium ingots the titanium ingot is forged into semifinished round or square products called billets then made into titanium plates sheets bars or other products the new methods of making titanium would bypass one or more of those steps they use different chemical process technologies to reduce the titanium sand into a pure titanium powder rather than sponge the powder can be directly compressed into metal parts eliminating the need to make an ingot the proponents say the new methods will eventually expand titanium supply and bring down titanium prices "it is our intention to substantially reduce the cost of titanium " said leo christodoulou who heads the materials science programs at the pentagons defense advanced research projects agency or darpa "our goal for the program is for the cost of titanium to eventually be less than &# a pound in the primary billet form " that is about one half to one tenth of the current price depending on the grade being sold it could also reduce u s dependence on imports the u s imported roughly metric tons of titanium sponge in according to the u s geological survey double the domestic capacity to make sponge and double the level of imports from although the tonnage of titanium imports seems small its dollar value is hefty while basic steel generally costs less than &# a metric ton titanium sponge costs more than &# per metric ton according to the survey the material science division of darpa has doled out more than &# million in research grants to the various projects the organization which acts as a venture capital agency of the government gave a &# million grant to start up international titanium powder llc in to reduce titanium to a powder metal in it gave major titanium producer titanium metals corp or timet &# million for researching its method which it eventually shelved a joint venture between dupont and start up mer corp of tucson ariz to make titanium powder received &# million in itp is in the early stages of commercialization making and selling several hundred pounds of titanium per month at its pilot facility in rockport ill taras lyssenko director of government relations and business development for itp said his company hopes to make million pounds of titanium annually in five years "our objective is to make titanium a commodity " he said dupont of wilmington del is a major producer of titanium dioxide pigment used for paints plastics and other products the new processes dont apply to that business which is a separate industry but since it mines and buys so many titanium minerals it hopes to become a larger raw material provider to titanium makers and possibly a metal or metal products producer itself "we believe that if we can make titanium metal parts available at lower costs the market will grow " says michael hyzny titanium venture manager for dupont the company opened a titanium metal plant with honeywell international inc late last year in salt lake city to convert titanium sponge into metal powder major u s titanium producers have benefited from the boom timet for example saw its net sales rise in from and saw its net income nearly double to &# million in still it isnt as active in the darpa research efforts timet president chuck entrekin said his company had pursued a new technology with a darpa research contract that ended in but declined further comment darpa says timets project wasnt as competitive as the others in development timet is the largest u s titanium sponge producer at present with metric tons of sponge making capacity per year but could be surpassed by allegheny technologies corp of pittsburgh which plans to expand its sponge making capacity next year to metric tons up from this year the other large titanium metal maker in the u s rti international inc of ohio isnt a major producer of titanium sponge executives at allegheny technologies declined to comment executives at rti international werent available one smaller titanium producer says the new processes are generating a good deal of buzz but doubts the "titanium revolution" will take hold quickly "i dont think its the holy grail " said frank perryman a partner in houston pa titanium producer perryman co "its in the right direction theres not going to be one home run there has never been a home run in any metal it takes little baby steps " corrections &amp amplifications international titanium powder llc is based in lockport ill an article on yesterdays corporate focus page about interest in new ways to make titanium incorrectly said the company is in
