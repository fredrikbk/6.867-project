the daily fix federer claims th grand slam redskins packers eke out wins online edition roger federer claimed his fourth straight u s open championship last night despite the absence of his "a" game beating novak djokovic that marks federers th grand slam title leaving him just two behind pete samprass career record of major titles and federer is just the year old mr djokovic who beat federer in montreal in august will mourn missed opportunities he led in each of the opening sets and had five set points in the first and two in the second none of which he converted considering federer the san francisco chronicles bruce jenkins writes that "he was wearing black tuxedo shorts proving that such a thing actually exists complete with a satin stripe down the side perhaps next time he should go with the full ensemble right down to a really ponderous pair of wingtips things might be a bit more fair that way for roger federers play once again has soared beyond the ordinary he really does appear to be playing an alternative sport at times choosing from an arsenal all his own calling up his best material when it most crushes the opponents spirit " mr djokovics sense of humor and impersonations of his fellow players made him a crowd favorite and a thoroughly likable foil for federer something espn coms bonnie d ford writes has been lacking in mens tennis "most players would have been daunted by the help wanted ad " she writes "seeking attractive articulate multi lingual player with a keen sense of humor and obvious joy in his work appealing family and struggles in early years preferred must be capable of reaching late rounds of grand slam events ability to attract celebrities to his players box for big matches a plus then out of a country much of the world associated with war and sadness came novak djokovic who seemed to fill the bill in every way " there was less drama on the womens side saturday night as justine henin routed svetlana kuznetsova for her seventh major title the fix will go back to mr jenkins for analysis of ms henin whom he says "plays the game fashioned by long ago legends and perfected by the likes of billie jean king and martina navratilova its all about variety court coverage and textbook form although she is primarily a baseline player the signature strokes of her victory covered the spectrum leaping backhand volley feathery touch forehand drop shot blazing forehand winner off a bullet first serve classic one handed backhand the essence of her repertoire drilled with topspin crosscourt " thursdays colts saints tilt was a teaser on sunday the nfl arrived in force the washington redskins needed overtime to beat the miami dolphins behind a tendonitis slowed clinton portis yards td and antwaan randle el yards in the washington post thomas boswell writes that the skins are like a lot of nfl teams "somewhere in the vast vague middle of the pack clawing every week in games usually decided by a touchdown or much less for them all that matters is if they win not how not whether they play by the book " having won mr boswell writes the skins can see their glass as half full they "can look at quarterback jason campbells performance and see a productive for for yards rather than recall his two ugly interceptions both on unnecessary first down throws into coverage they can praise the fine blocking of pound rookie tackle stephon heyer from maryland rather than obsess about what will probably be a season ending ankle injury to the man he replaced distinguished jon jansen " in the miami herald dan le batard ponders the dolphins glass perhaps seen by some extremely optimistic dolphin diehard as one eighth full "the miami dolphins are footballs version of the movie groundhog day without anything nearly as interesting as bill murray to dilute the redundancy " he writes "weve been watching the dreadful game we saw sunday for more than five years now it is fatiguing enough to be bad but on top of that the dolphins keep stacking a forever growing pile of boring too " at lambeau field mason crosby hit a yard field goal with seconds left to give the green bay packers a win over the philadelphia eagles the rookie kickers points gave brett favre decidedly not a rookie his th career victory tying him with john elway in philadelphia the grumbling is about dropped punts by greg lewis and j r reed learning on the job after jeremy bloom was cut in the daily news rich hofmann tries to redirect the anger where he thinks it belongs aimed at coach andy reid "lewis and reed did not lose that game yesterday for the eagles with their slapstick the coach and the organization lost it by forcing two novices into this position in the first place " he writes "they tend to be such a cautious careful franchise but this whole business was the height of carelessness that the eagles had no backup plan when they cut bloom was organizational negligence that they then decided that it would be a swell idea to open the season with lewis back there who had never done it and with reed back there who had never done it it was borderline arrogance " the detroit lions won ok they only beat the oakland raiders but it counts and the game was an example of how lousy football can be wildly entertaining the lions led but oaklands josh mccown a former detroit backup led three touchdown drives to give the raiders a lead with less than eight minutes to go but detroits john kitna answered with a drive of his own and two late turnovers sealed the raiders fate in the detroit free press drew sharp writes that the raider comeback raised "the prospect of another heart bleeding loss attributable to the lions merely hoping theyd persevere instead of knowing that theyd endure but they found resolve this time rather than praying for rescue if adversity teaches the strongest lesson the lions learned a little more about their character success is always tempered when winning a beauty contest among lepers because the actual value of first prize is always open to interpretation but the way in which the lions won offered the first discernible proof that perhaps rod marinelli grasps whats required of a head coach " the chicago bears followed up their super bowl appearance by falling on their faces offering up four turnovers in a loss to the san diego chargers who had two turnovers of their own yecch "an offseason of despair has spilled into september " mutters jay mariotti in the chicago sun times "on a day when ladainian tomlinson passed the football better than rex grossman we learned many more inconvenient truths about the bears including the harsh realities that poor mike brown cant stay healthy and a rexually dysfunctional offense has no chance of rallying when trailing but the most telling development was attached to a weird decision made by gm jerry angelo not long after losing super bowl xli " in the san diego union tribune tim sullivan focuses on a non call in the third quarter when the bears tommie harris forced a fumble with the chargers on the yard line mr harris was offsides but got away with it leaving the chargers seething "the bolts were beside themselves and then some screaming arguing gesturing and completely justified " mr sullivan writes adding "temporarily unglued the chargers might easily have unraveled reprising the poise problems so prominent in last seasons playoff loss to new england but if this was to be the defining moment of the season opener local fans can find that definition under perseverance rather than panic " found a good column
