to understand sheiks in iraq marines ask mac self taught he serves as corps tribal expert a generals outburst fallujah iraq earlier this summer william "mac" mccallisters marine corps bosses asked him for help selecting gifts for tribal sheiks who had teamed up with u s forces to fight radical islamists mr mccallister the marines resident expert on tribal culture settled on the perfect gift a mameluke sword the swords which all marine officers carry date back to when a marine lieutenant led a group of arabs in a successful attack on pirates and was awarded a sword by an ottoman pasha there was only one problem the swords were banned as gifts because their value exceeds the government limit of &# so mr mccallister launched an impassioned campaign to obtain a waiver sheiks who see themselves as products of a warrior culture would love the swords he insisted in an email to his bosses every time the sheik carried one it would remind his constituents of their special "warrior bond" with the corps he wrote expertise in year old tribal customs has given mr mccallister a position of some importance in the u s effort to pacify iraq the year old retired army major has spent the past four years in iraq studying the tribes myths histories and ancient legal system although hes completely self taught his ideas have helped shape the marine corps strategy in western iraq which calls for forging alliances with tribal sheiks to drive out radical islamist fighters the success here in anbar province contrasts with more mixed results countrywide and is likely to be a big part of a much anticipated status report by gen david petraeus the top commander in iraq due out today "mac has been worth his weight in gold to us " says marine brig gen john allen deputy commander of u s forces in western iraq "most of us are no better than observers of tribal society mac is one of the few experts " tribal affairs expert is a job that until recently didnt exist in the military even though iraq has tribes and some three quarters of iraqis belong to a tribe mr mccallister says he first saw the need in when as an active duty army major he was ushered into a meeting with an influential fallujah sheik the tribal leader began to warble a song about the different kinds of pain a warrior feels when he is wounded by different weapons like a sword a knife or a gun "anyone who sings about that stuff has a different take on the rules of warfare " he says he quickly concluded "if you dont approach them correctly you can kill or of them and they wont submit " mr mccallister began to search the military command in iraq for someone who was an expert on tribal affairs there were none "when i suggested we find one people looked at me like i had something growing out of my head " he says today forging alliances with tribal leaders is seen as essential "it was so simple yet it was very hard for us to fully grasp how important the sheiks are out here " says maj gen walter gaskin the commander of all forces in western iraq in recent months the army has followed the marine corps lead and assigned an army colonel to serve as its tribal affairs expert in baghdad last year the army hired montgomery mcfate a cultural anthropologist with a doctorate from yale to help it draft its new doctrine for battling insurgents dr mcfate who has helped mentor mr mccallister says "mac does exactly what good anthropologists do he enmeshes himself in foreign societies and attempts to see the world from their point of view while retaining his own objectivity " mr mccallister is lanky with a scruffy red and white beard an outward expression of his personality which is loud gregarious and quite often profane his computer screen saver says "back off b " in july when he thought commanders in baghdad were making decisions that failed to take into account subtleties of iraqi tribal politics he shot them a furious email the response he says he received said his behavior "straddled the line of expected professional decorum " one of mr mccallisters chief criticisms of the u s military is that the cultural training it offers focuses too much on telling troops what not to do u s troops are told not to show the bottoms of their feet which is an insult in arab society not to eat with their left hand and not to talk to arab women the advice is ok he says but the intense focus on not offending iraqis who are products of a passionate volatile and violent tribal culture makes u s troops look passive mr mccallister says "the iraqis expect the grand gesture its one of their rituals " says mr mccallister "you show them no respect when you dont offend " he compares discussions among tribal sheiks to symphonies they often begin quietly he says then they grow hotter often elevating into screaming matches before the debate calms down again the marines say they have emulated this in meetings with tribal and government officials in june gen allen who says he prides himself on not losing his cool was meeting with the governor of iraqs anbar province in a hotel restaurant in amman jordan with security improving gen allen told the governor he wanted his help to reopen anbars criminal courts which had been shut down after threats of violence caused many of the judges to quit the governor was noncommittal gen allen says he slammed his fist on the table causing silverware to clang and heads to turn "you have got to want these courts to open more than i do " he says he yelled "we are going to have the first trials in anbar by aug " today thanks to the governor pushing the trials have started the anbar governor regularly refers to the conversation with gen allen as a turning point at first u s commanders incorrectly assumed that sheiks ruled as dictators mr mccallister says but a sheiks power is actually defined by his ability to "attract others to him " he says in meetings with tribal leaders mr mccallister frequently "sits in the corners watching the key actors and calculating their true tribal throw weight based on where they sit when they speak the energy and forcefulness of their interventions " says gen allen he says mr mccallister can lay out "with uncanny certainty" how a discussion with a group of sheiks will go mr mccallister was raised in germany the son of a native german who married an american soldier he moved to the u s in his teens and enlisted in the army at growing up in two cultures "gave me the ability to step outside my own surroundings " he says when on leave in a foreign country he likes to sit at an outdoor cafe have a couple of beers and watch the traffic "how people settle traffic disputes tells you a lot about how they settle bigger differences " he says in his s the army paid for him to go to college and eventually he became an officer serving with special forces in egypt greece and africa in as an active duty soldier he began pushing the u s to use the tribes to stabilize iraq at the time the u s led coalition provisional authority which ruled iraq saw the tribes as an anachronism mr mccallister insisted the tribes were essential to stability in iraq "coalition attempts to bypass traditional tribal authorities and deal with the local population will fail " he wrote in a september memo to his military bosses his ideas were ignored he says and he retired to be with his family after three months home in florida he felt restless unsure what to do after the military so he returned to iraq in working for two private contractors he continued to study the tribes reading books and whenever he got the chance quizzing sheiks about their tribal rituals songs and laws like anyone who wants to penetrate the military bureaucracy he wrote a powerpoint brief it summarized how the tribal system worked in february mr mccallister walked gen allen through his powerpoint presentation at a green zone coffee shop gen allen offered him a six month &# contract to serve as the marines tribal affairs expert in fallujah "virtually everything mac said added context to things we had been learning ourselves " says gen allen who holds a masters degree in government from georgetown university the marines are still considering mr mccallisters recommendation on giving earlier this year he recommended a range of gifts including medals marine corps knives and mameluke swords that could be presented to iraqi allies initially the swords were rejected because at about &# each they exceed the governments &# limit on gifts but gen allen has asked his staff to rethink whether its worth requesting additional funds in special cases mr mccallister remains hopeful "it is really going to help the fight out here " he says
