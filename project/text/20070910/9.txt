casio chief may pick successor outside family tokyo the four kashio brothers believed that it took the particular talents of each of them to turn casio computer co the japanese electronics company they founded years ago into the &# billion conglomerate it is today the oldest of the four tadao kashio was the financial wizard who ran the company as its president until a few years before his death at age the second oldest toshio kashio casios year old chairman is the inventor behind many of casios hit products including its first an all electric compact calculator the third oldest brother kazuo kashio is the sales and marketing expert who took over as president after tadao retired and yukio kashio is the production chief kazuo says an innate trust and respect for each others abilities in their areas of expertise helped the brothers make the bold decisions that were crucial to casios growth from a small calculator company but now that the three surviving brothers are getting old kazuo says he is open to choosing a nonfamily member as his successor even though each of the brothers has a son who works at the company "the job needs to go to the most capable person " says kazuo "if a kashio could do the job that would be great but if he doesnt have the ability then it cant be helped " kazuo says he plans to retire when casio hits an operating profit margin of the company aims to achieve that goal in the business year ending march its operating profit margin was in fiscal kazuo says he hasnt decided yet who will succeed him still his determination to hand over power to the most qualified candidate is part of a growing shift in thinking in japan where businesses have often been handed down through the founding family without a second thought while it is difficult to know how many more businesses are kept within the family here than in the u s management experts say japanese companies value family bonds much more than western concerns do one of japans best known companies canon inc for example is run by fujio mitarai the nephew of its founder keeping a business within the family does provide leadership stability when things are going well but such executives are often risk averse and act too slowly with competition increasing world wide fueled by new rivals in emerging markets like china and india adhering to tradition has become much riskier "japanese companies were comfortable having a caretaker in place but thats changing " says c j wilson founder of global alliance a tokyo merger adviser typically founding families in japan have been forced out of management only when things have gone terribly wrong toshimasa iue the grandson of sanyo electric co s founder was pushed out of his role as president in april after the consumer electronics company was hurt by an accounting scandal and poor earnings the fujii family lost control of fujiya co one of japans major bakery chains this year when the company was found to have used expired dairy products in confections for casio the big challenge is finding a forceful and decisive candidate after the family has led the company for so long in family run companies "the internal bench of candidates is usually pretty limited " says paul meehan a tokyo based consultant with bain &amp co who advises companies in japan on management strategies the new president will have to contend with his predecessors legacy especially if kazuo stays on as an adviser or chairman which is typical in japanese companies there is no obvious heir apparent at casio but the natural candidates are on the companys board of directors the highest ranking executives after the brothers are yozo suzuki the head of sales and fumitsune murakami the head of development still some analysts say they believe the job will end up going to year old akira kashio the oldest son of the oldest brother and a managing director in charge of domestic sales kazuo the president says he wants his successor to have enough ambition and drive to want to double or triple casios current business but at the same time he says he hopes to leave behind a company with strong business divisions that could run themselves casio in many respects is a very traditional japanese company office walls are adorned with plaques featuring the corporate creed "creativity and contribution " in bold calligraphy strokes its employees recite the casio motto "improvement every day " before starting meetings but a big part of the kashio brothers legacy is also their unusually practical approach to management since the company was founded in the kashios have been almost obsessive about putting their business interests ahead of their personal ones all of the brothers for example receive the same salary except toshio everybody agreed he should get more because of the contributions he has made with his inventions when tadao the eldest decided to retire in it was kazuo the third brother not toshio the second one who became president because the brothers agreed that kazuo was the most qualified the kashios get along so well that when they were younger they played a round of golf together every morning before going to work but when it came to business toshio and kazuo used to fight often about differences in strategy kazuo stresses that he doesnt care what the next president does if it will benefit the company but he has set high goals he expects his successor to maintain a minimum operating profit margin of in an industry where one half that size is considered an accomplishment
