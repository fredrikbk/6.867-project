amds new chip is vital to turnaround barcelona to compete against intels xeon rivalry wins cheers with a long awaited product launch today advanced micro devices inc has a chance to prove its not a one hit wonder in chips for server systems amds new microprocessor code named barcelona is crucial in the companys fight against intel corp in providing calculating engines for the midsize machines that run web sites and other key business programs intel had all but owned that market until april when amd launched a chip called opteron that steadily gained market share until intel counterattacked in mid with faster products the stiffer competition and execution miscues have stalled amds advances and contributed to a &# million net loss in the second quarter barcelona to be formally called the quad core amd opteron processor is seen as important not only for an amd turnaround but also for server makers who want to play chip vendors off each other to get lower prices and higher performance "choice is a wonderful thing " says mark barrenechea president and chief executive of rackable systems inc a fremont calif company that plans to use chips from both companies "a stronger amd is a stronger rackable " how much stronger is barcelona the point is hotly debated amd of sunnyvale calif has managed to squeeze four electronic brains on one piece of silicon intel by contrast packages two dual processor chips together in theory the barcelona design improves communication between processors earlier dual processor opterons already had advantages in fetching data from memory chips and the new model has improved circuitry for complex chores called floating point calculations but the chip arrived later than the company had hoped amd chief executive hector ruiz has conceded and operates at a maximum frequency of gigahertz slower than initial expectations though amd executives vow to add faster models quickly intels xeon chips now have advantages in running the most widely used business programs argues tom kilroy an intel vice president who jointly runs the companys digital enterprise division still barcelona already has customers server makers expected to add barcelona based models and participate in todays launch event in san francisco include international business machines corp hewlett packard co dell inc and sun microsytems inc the texas advanced computing center affiliated with the university of texas in austin plans to install a massive cluster of sun servers each with four barcelona chips giving the supercomputer processors in all says tommy minyard assistant director of the center one attraction is power consumption a key factor in many computer rooms barcelona has a series of power saving features and uses an older more power efficient style of memory chips than intels xeon "amd i would say is greener than intel and that benefits us " said nicolas keller director of platform products at rackspace managed hosting the san antonio texas company runs servers for other companies and plans to give customers a choice of barcelona based machines as well as intel based servers as part of the barcelona launch amd is adopting a scheme to measure the average power consumption of its chips in addition to providing numbers about the maximum power they draw the new approach which is closer to the way intel rates its chips is designed to help customers compare the two companies products said randy allen an amd corporate vice president and general manager of its server and workstation division pricing is another reason computer makers root for amd when opteron entered the market intel was selling xeon models that listed for as much as &# each now the fastest model of its four processor xeon line lists for &# a reduction dean mccarron an analyst at mercury research estimates that the average selling price for both amd and intel server chips is now between &# and &# compared with more than &# when the opteron was introduced "the market has been completely altered by the presence of a second supplier " mr mccarron says amd which now lists high end opterons for up to &# wont have such lucrative models ready until the fourth quarter a two gigahertz model will list for &# with low end versions starting for as little as &#
