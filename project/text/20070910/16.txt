end of boom for housing hits title firms recent jump in claims drop in new business pressures the insurers problems confronting title insurers may offer fresh clues about economic stress points in the nations housing market title insurers issue policies that essentially guarantee a homebuyer is the rightful owner of a property the industrys fortunes are closely tied to the health of the real estate industry and some major firms are seeing claims rise sharply particularly on policies issued during recent boom years one of the nations largest title insurers first american corp recently said paid claims jumped in the second quarter compared with the same period last year rising title claims are significant because they can be a broader sign of economic pain than foreclosures claims are often filed even in the absence of a foreclosure and they can be triggered not only by homebuyers but also by complaints from another party such as a subcontractor who has filed a lien for unpaid work on a house claims data also can include commercial properties "in times of economic loss title claims go up " says theodore l chandler jr chief executive of landamerica financial group inc another big title insurer based in richmond va there was a severe spike in claims for instance during the recession in the early s moreover some title insurers are reporting a drop in new business while that might not sound particularly surprising given the real estate slowdown it could be a glimpse of more trouble ahead title search orders usually come at least several weeks before a buyer takes out a mortgage "if you want to know whats going on with mortgage activity you look at title orders " says nik fisken an insurance industry analyst at stephens inc first american says average daily title orders were down in july from june and that preliminary results indicate another drop from july to august fidelity national financial a major title insurer based in jacksonville fla says there was a nearly decline between april and june fidelity national hasnt disclosed additional data about more recent months but chief financial officer anthony park says "its slowed down considerably particularly in the month of august " by comparison the mortgage bankers association has forecast a drop in the value of mortgage originations in the third quarter people in the industry are quick to caution that in terms of capturing whats going on in the housing market data on title claims and orders cant replace widely watched indicators such as the foreclosure rate or the number of housing starts moreover title insurance claims and orders arent disclosed weekly or monthly on an industry wide basis unlike some other key indicators but title data can flesh out the picture of a market in trouble the housing market is plagued by rising delinquencies and foreclosures particularly in home loans made to borrowers with subprime credit ratings housing sales also have been falling recently and prices are dropping in much of the country in discussing the claims they are getting for instance first american and landamerica both pointed particularly to claims on policies issued between and in those years investors and homebuyers were gobbling up houses and lenders were shoveling out loans in some cases to buyers who provided little or no documentation of their assets or ability to pay "it appears that many of these claims involve fraud forgery and other factors often seen where loans are made to borrowers in financial distress " first americans ceo parker kennedy told investors last month title insurance claims generally arise when there is a challenge or a question about the owners right to a property claims are much lower than for other types of insurers because title insurers try to identify any problems during the title search before issuing a policy claims can occur for a number of reasons for instance when the housing market is booming a growing number of transactions often need to get done in a short period of time which can increase the potential for mistakes during the title search process any title problems are more likely to come to light when the real estate market is weak title problems can turn up during a foreclosure so if foreclosures are rising claims can follow many title insurance policies are held by lenders and they sometimes file claims during the foreclosure process but claims can also turn up in the absence of a foreclosure the costs associated with claims can rise if title insurance agents who are generally independent are under economic stress and dont pass along premium payments properly because the insurer still must honor the policies and even in the absence of a foreclosure people facing financial difficulty may have an incentive to look for problems with the title "everybody looks for the deep pocket to get them out of a bad deal " says jim maher of the american land title association a trade group many of those claims are legitimate he says but might not have been pursued if home values were shooting up the headwinds facing title insurers have had a significant impact on some of the industrys largest players including in some cases steep drops in earnings deep staff cuts and double digit declines in their stock prices first american for instance swung to a loss of &# million in the second quarter after recording net income of &# million in the same period last year the santa ana calif firm last week said it will cut jobs this quarter after shedding in the second quarter shares in landamerica have fallen by more than since hitting a recent closing high in june while shares in fidelity national are down about and first americans are down more than
