why wednesdays are must try tv networks use night to launch hot new shows for the broadcast television networks the most heart pounding nail biting hour of programming this fall will be wednesday nights at nine in that ordinarily prosaic prime time slot the networks have scheduled some of their most promising new shows creating a dramatic five way race for viewers attention the collective heat from so much new programming could lead to a breakout hit or maybe a meltdown with many shows premiering next week networks and advertisers will be paying close attention to how viewers react to wednesdays overstuffed menu at p m eastern and pacific time p m central and p m mountain time which features more freshman shows than any other time period thursday night traditionally gets all the glory in broadcast tv thats when the networks schedule their heaviest hitters and its favored by advertisers wanting to reach viewers before they do their weekend spending on new films cars and other products if thursday is blockbuster night wednesday is next years blockbuster night if a new show survives its wednesday initiation it might wind up on thursday the following season but wednesday has become increasingly significant because each network is anxious to burnish its particular identity in the cluttered media landscape "wednesday at nine is a potential microcosm of the season " said kelly kahl the senior executive vice president of programming for cbs "its representative of each networks big picture strategy each network is putting its best foot forward there " news corp s fox has "kitchen nightmares " a reality show starring the demanding chef gordon ramsay the star of another hit reality show on fox walt disney co s abc has "private practice " a spinoff of that networks breakout medical drama "greys anatomy" and aimed at the networks core upscale female audience nbc universal a subsidiary of general electric co has "bionic woman " a sci fi drama in the mold of last years "heroes" and targeted at the same audience of young men the cw co owned by cbs corp and time warner inc has "gossip girl " a hair pulling high school soap opera aimed at young women cbs which won the time slot last year with around million viewers a night is keeping the procedural "criminal minds" in place but that shows continued success isnt a sure thing in a last minute switch the network was forced to replace the shows star mandy patinkin with a new actor joe mantegna "its a lot of good material in one slot and it is a little daunting " said mike darnell the executive vice president of alternative programming for fox "you assume by the time youre four weeks in the good ones really exist there and the ones that arent good will have started to die " until then and especially during the first few weeks of the season when viewership levels are high with audiences sampling the new offerings the wednesday night launch pad is appealing to advertisers "its good for television " says john swift executive vice president and managing director of media communications firm phd north america who says that when a lot of good varied programming ends up on the same night it draws more viewers to the set with the exception of fox all the networks say they scheduled wednesday night without paying much attention to the competition the result is four dramas up against one reality show in the slot some industry executives believe that counterprogramming is a dated idea because people have so many options in the vast tv landscape that its no longer possible to compete against one or two other networks "long gone are the days when you could say oh nbcs putting on a show thats really strong with young adults lets put on matlock " said jeff bader the executive vice president in charge of scheduling for abc entertainment abc has scheduled three new shows for wednesday a rarity in television where despite digital video recorders and tivo machines networks still bank on strong lead ins from established shows fox however concedes that it is still engaging in counterprogramming it originally scheduled "bones " a procedural show about a forensic anthropologist this year returning for its second season in the nine oclock spot but after sizing up the competition the network swapped it out for "kitchen nightmares " "we thought it was a little looney tunes for every network to put a drama there " said preston beckman foxs executive vice president of strategic program planning "we looked at all the pieces and said hey heres a classic example where counterprogramming could actually pay off for us this is a situation where blinking made the most sense " unlike other days of the week right now no single network dominates on wednesdays sunday belongs to abc with "desperate housewives " which averaged million viewers a night last season according to nielsen media research monday is cbss province with the comedy "two and a half men" and "csi miami " which attracted some million viewers per episode last year fox rules tuesday thanks to "house" thursday is the high stakes standoff between abcs "greys anatomy" and cbss "csi " both with more than million viewers a night the former show leading slightly viewership levels drop off friday and saturday nights to the point where those nights are practically irrelevant in todays broadcast world in the past however different networks have ruled on wednesdays in the s wednesday was arthur godfreys night when the famous radio host and his pals sang and danced and raked in advertising dollars for cbs mr godfrey gave way to the wild west with wednesday loaded with wagon train dramas in the s cbs maintained its hold over the night with an all star prime time lineup "the beverly hillbillies " "the dick van dyke show " "green acres " "gomer pyle u s m c " "lost in space " the s brought "hawaii five o" and "medical center" for cbs the s were all about "dynasty" on abc "wednesdays been the heart of the week practically since the beginning of television " said tim brooks an executive at lifetime who had a long career in the research departments of nbc cbs and others it is in the s that wednesday at nine went up for grabs "beverly hills " "party of five " "the west wing " "dawsons creek " "alias " "deal or no deal " "the bachelor" and "the o c " have all done time in that slot this years crop of shows however wont have long to prove themselves after three months foxs blockbuster "american idol" and abcs hit "lost" come off break and are likely to return to wednesdays and dominate the night as they have done in the past
