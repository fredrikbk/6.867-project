a mother takes on mit how universitys privacy policy complicated sue kaytons search for her missing son on april sue kayton learned that her son a year old senior at the massachusetts institute of technology had gone missing four days later a student at virginia tech killed people on that campus the following week while virginia tech was being criticized for withholding information about the gunman due to its privacy policy mits own privacy policy was leading it to reject ms kaytons requests for information she believed would help her find her son the administration refused to allow ms kayton access to her sons dorm room or to his computer files it demanded a subpoena even after her son was listed in a national missing persons database mits position "added to the anguish level immeasurably " says ms kayton who traveled to mits cambridge mass campus to search for her son daniel barclay herself mits administrators "didnt want to deal with me " school officials say they acted appropriately "privacy is important " says mit chancellor phillip clay he says mit protects student privacy not only because its the law but because it is central to maintaining students trust "different students will do different things that they absolutely dont want their parents to know about " he says "students expect this kind of safe place where they can address their difficulties try out lifestyles and be independent of their parents " the virginia tech massacre raised national awareness of one of the thorniest aspects of the relationship between colleges and parents student privacy for decades colleges were legally considered to be taking on the responsibilities of parents then a series of court decisions starting in the s amid the womens rights and civil liberties movements awarded students more legal rights now the pendulum is swinging back as the generation that fought for students rights becomes a generation of parents mr clay mits chancellor says students have a much closer relationship to their parents than or years ago hes noticed more parents coming with their children to attend the schools april tour for admitted students he says he has even seen parents accompany their children to dentist appointments at the campus health clinic in mits staunch defense of student privacy came under scrutiny after the death of student elizabeth shin ruled a suicide by the medical examiner her parents later agreed to a settlement from mit after complaining officials should have alerted them to signs of their daughters distress in the wake of the much publicized case and settlement mit has overhauled the way it deals with students mental health the school wont say whether the shin case affected its privacy policy for all its students the family educational rights and privacy act or ferpa bars schools from sharing information in a students record without that students permission but the law provides several exceptions among them if theres a "health or safety emergency" or if the student is declared a dependent on his or her parents taxes daniels parents declared him as a dependent on their taxes but mit only recognizes the "health or safety emergency" contingency a situation it said didnt apply to daniel despite his being declared a missing person as a result mit made its campus police obtain a subpoena before releasing his electronic records including his email records theres now debate over whether ferpa should be changed last month the virginia tech review panel issued a page report it recommended university policy recognize that law enforcement has an educational interest in student records the report also recommended that the department of education "allow more flexibility" in defining an emergency exception in reaction to the report an mit spokeswoman said the school reviews "all of our policies and procedures periodically every university across the country is likely to take a renewed look at their policies given the events of virginia tech and the content of the report " legal experts say college campuses vary in their approaches to interpreting ferpa while many schools in liberal massachusetts wont immediately turn over student information to the police others in the south strongly support police intervention says peter lake director of the center for excellence in higher education law and policy at stetson university college of law in gulfport fla after virginia tech "people will go in a direction of safety over privacy " he predicts growing up in the affluent silicon valley suburb of menlo park calif daniel barclay was a skinny brainy kid he loved to read and was something of a local celebrity leading his team to victory four years in a row on the san francisco area trivia tv show "quiz kids " he was shy with few close friends a computer consultant who eschews makeup and favors jeans and t shirts year old ms kayton is an mit graduate herself she is articulate and direct with a

as a bachelors and a masters in political science all in four years socially awkward he had few friends his first few years at college the second semester of his sophomore year daniel took off he stopped living in his dorm and dropped out of contact with his parents for several weeks although he continued attending classes sporadically and emailing friends ms kayton says she called mit repeatedly requesting that someone locate her son who as it turned out was living in classrooms and the library she says mit administrators found daniel and recommended he receive counseling at the mental health center or leave school daniel chose counseling she says mit declined to comment ms kayton says the counselor initially rebuffed her efforts to speak to him but daniel gave her and her husband permission to speak to the counselor after they warned their son they would otherwise cease paying his tuition she says she was told that "they saw no sign of depression or mental illness they said they saw a kid who was physically sick and he needed to fatten himself and get some sleep " ms kayton says daniel later attributed his disappearance to a girl who was harassing him at his dorm even jumping in the shower naked with him mit declined to comment citing privacy issues when he became a junior daniel joined the schools debate team and began to make close friends at mit for the first time when she saw him last march ms kayton says daniel "was just steaming with happiness " just a few weeks later some of daniels new debate team friends noticed he had skipped a seminar and a debate meeting and had failed to show up for his favorite class three times for days he hadnt answered his cellphone or returned emails the last day daniels family heard from him was sunday april he posted a cryptic "away" message on his aol instant messenger program "dan has to meet with some sketchy people he thought hed never have to deal with ever again " when daniels sister asked him about the message he told her that he had to go to east cambridge to see "very sketchy" people on thursday night april a friend named michelle zimmermann called daniels parents and told them his friends were worried because they couldnt find him she also reported daniels disappearance to the mit police which gets its law enforcement authority from the state the police began interviewing other friends and checked mr barclays empty dorm room the next day ms kayton called some of daniels friends one of them then freshman leslie nachbar was worried daniel had recently admitted he had a crush on her she had explained to him that she didnt share his feelings and they argued she said a draft of daniels masters thesis was due that day but he didnt surface although she says her son hadnt used his school identification card since april ms kayton says the police and barbara baker mits senior associate dean for students told her it wasnt unusual for students to take a break from school or drop out of communication to study she says ms baker offered to help with hotel arrangements if ms kayton chose to visit but ms kayton says school administrators citing privacy policy refused to allow her access to daniels dorm room or his computer files "they were convinced he was gone to stay with friends and what was the big deal " she says undeterred and convinced something was wrong ms kayton boarded a red eye flight from san jose calif on saturday she says she was armed with two lock picking kits and special software designed to crack computer passwords on sunday as a noreaster raged outside ms kayton entered her sons room she declines to say how and searched for clues daniels friends stopped by to help in a pocket of a blue blazer ms zimmermann discovered a receipt for &# from a wal mart store in nearby lynn mass among the items a &# inflatable boat an oar two packages of nylon cord a sleeping bag a folding knife a flashlight black dress socks and a pound bag of cat box litter daniel did not own a cat ms kayton headed toward daniels desktop computer the weekend of april he had reviewed maps of the boston area she says in his last search she says he checked the weather ms kayton says she contacted all of her sons instant messenger chat buddies as well as people he had emailed and friends listed on his facebook page she says she obtained his cellphone records by filling out a california subpoena form herself and sending it without a judges signature to his cellphone provider she says she called everyone he had last called no one had seen daniel or knew where he might be some of ms kaytons tactics made daniels friends uncomfortable "all of us felt weird she was going through his instant message conversations " says linda fang a senior at the time "it was as if because she was his mother she had a right to them " on her sons computer ms kayton also found a odd page journal it contained real and made up conversations quotes from movies expressions of his feelings for ms nachbar and a to do list that mentioned a meeting with people in east cambridge ms kayton shared her discoveries with the mit police requesting that mr barclay be listed as a missing person two days after they learned he was missing mit police say they listed daniel in the national missing persons database at this point he had been missing one week the next day monday april came the virginia tech massacre early that week ms kayton says she asked mit for access to the files her son had stored on the schools server she was told she would need a subpoena with the help of her attorney husband ms kayton filled out another california subpoena form herself and sent it to mit without a judges signature the school rejected it ms kayton says she was angry and frustrated "theyre protecting the privacy of someone whos been gone a week " she says meanwhile the mit police led by lt al pierce were conducting their own search contacting police departments of local municipalities and inquiring at all local hospitals at their request the state police asked the coast guard to search boston harbor no one turned up any clues on tuesday april the mit police asked the district attorney in cambridge for a subpoena for mr barclays electronic files and on wednesday april the district attorneys office faxed it to the school while it is difficult to generalize a number of campus police chiefs and prosecutors say it is unusual to subpoena a school for a students records in a noncriminal investigation ms kayton sent an email to the universitys president susan hockfield complaining that she was being stonewalled ms baker the associate dean called ms kayton and told her that the school was doing everything it could on thursday afternoon an mit deputy general
