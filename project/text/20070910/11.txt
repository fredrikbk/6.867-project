congress and recession fridays report that the economy lost jobs in august for the first time in four years sent wall street reeling and some are calling it a harbinger of recession we think thats far from inevitable however if the financial classes keep their wits and democrats on capitol hill rethink their antigrowth agenda the jobs decline of was rooted in the continuing housing bust big losses came in construction and manufacturing areas related to housing the rest of the private economy added jobs though not enough to offset a decline in government payrolls and while the jobless rate stayed at a low that was only because the labor force shrank the rare good news in the august report is that wages rose by or from a year ago which is consistent with income gains during the supposedly halcyon days of the late s meanwhile the credit woes of august continue to afflict the banking sector were told the federal reserve performed open market operations three times on friday a rare occurrence as it continued to supply emergency liquidity bank stocks are taking a special beating bear stearns and lehman brothers in particular because investors arent sure how much the subprime fiasco will hit third quarter earnings the global banking sector has more than enough capital to absorb the coming losses but the trick for investors is guessing who are the biggest losers canadian banks are having to pay a notable premium for their commercial paper in one sign of where investors fear some of the losses are buried on this score some wisdom was expressed last week by josef ackermann the chief executive of deutsche bank in urging his financial industry brethren to fess up as soon as possible about their losses "the crucial question in the next few days and weeks is how do you mark the positions " mr ackermann told the financial times "i can only hope that we do not muddle through that we mark them to market " this is a crucial point because bank obfuscation over losses will only extend the uncertainty and make it harder for markets to clear and confidence to return some banks will want to delay the public admission of pain but the economy will be better off the faster everyone shows their losing cards the all but universal consensus is that the fed will now surely reduce interest rates at its next meeting on september at least this will be in response to general economic conditions rather than to the pleading of wall street and homebuilders to rescue them from their bad lending decisions the fed has been right to be wary of the appearance of being pressured by politics rather than the facts and it need only look at fridays news to see why the dollar sank and gold surged above &# an ounce on expectations for more fed easing one reason were in this housing mess is the subsidy for debt that the fed created with its excessively easy policy of recent years so restoring the feds credibility has to be part of its policy thinking now in any case monetary policy by itself isnt some magic elixir that can always save the day the politicians also have a role to play here especially the newly dominant democrats new yorks chuck schumer wasted no time friday calling the jobs report "a punch to the gut of our economy " but his own party is preparing to deliver more blows any hint of a growth agenda has vanished since democrats took congress trade expanding deals with latin america and south korea are stalled and every week brings a new proposal to restrict trade with china on fiscal policy democrats have proposed or discussed raising taxes on cigarettes oil and gas companies hedge funds private equity capital gains dividends the u s subsidiaries of foreign companies and individuals earning more than &# a year which includes millions of small businesses filing under subchapter s add the promise of every democratic presidential candidate to repeal the bush tax cuts if he or she wins in and no wonder investors are growing more cautious six years into an expansion and with the fed having limited flexibility congress and the white house should if anything be talking about another tax cut on this point wheres treasury secretary hank paulson when you need him hes tried to be reassuring about the overall economy which has its place but sooner or later he has to spend some of his political capital and do something other than mumble about the policy risks to growth coming from congress his support for a corporate tax cut on competitiveness grounds with the rest of the world is useful but itd have more power if he linked it to a u s expansion that is already long in the tooth and could use some new incentives for that matter theres an opening here for the republican presidential candidates imagine if the economy began to sour nine months after the gop took congress and bill clinton were still president do you think hed be sitting quietly as tom delay blamed democrats for job losses and home foreclosures the resilient u s economy may well ride out the current housing woes without a recession but its far more likely to do so if someone starts pushing back against job and investment killing policies
