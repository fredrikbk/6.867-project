investing in funds a monthly analysis workers gripe about high fees limited choice at some k s peter ching landed a job as a programmer at a new york software company this summer but he had second thoughts when he saw the menu of mutual funds in the companys k retirement savings plan "the options are awful " he vented recently on the personal investing chat room diehards org describing them as mutual funds with "atrocious" fees the replies came fast and furious "awful does not properly describe this plan " one person wrote another added "i would seriously start looking for another job " the most comforting comment "your plan is not as craptacular as my spouses plan " these spirited conversations highlight another wrinkle in the debate over the disappearing traditional pension plan as workers are being forced to fund their own retirement many are up in arms about workplace savings plans that for all their tax advantages saddle them with high fees a limited range of investment choices and inadequate disclosure about costs and performance by limiting employees choices to a few mutual funds with high fees companies can reduce the amount they have to pay fund firms for administering retirement plans but such savings can be shortsighted because they can hurt employee morale and may even hinder recruitment efforts merriman capital management a fee only financial planning firm in seattle that last year merged to become merriman berkman next inc concluded in a survey that many big companies "shortchange" employees by offering expensive mutual funds or by failing to provide ready access to a wide variety of asset classes the company says that its survey of large employers in the northwest found k plans "loaded" with domestic large company growth funds which have mostly been relative laggards over the past seven years "i was stunned " says merriman financial planner tom cock "weve told workers were not going to provide pensions but the choices we give them in k plans are poor " similarly christopher davis an analyst with chicago research firm morningstar inc wrote last fall that retirement plans were "overly focused on large cap domestic stock mutual funds " giving higher performing small cap and international funds "short shrift " merriman also criticized the fees plan participants were paying for example amazon com inc offered funds in with an average expense ratio the percentage of assets taken out of an investors account annually of merriman said the average annual expense ratio for all u s stock funds is according to russell kinnell director of mutual fund research at morningstar amazon com spokeswoman patricia smith says that since the company has switched administrators for its k plan to "provide a greater diversity of investment options for our employees at lower costs " a recent study by plan administrator transamerica corp suggested that employers often underestimate the importance of retirement benefits to prospective employees transamerica a unit of dutch insurer aegon nv asked workers and companies whether employees would choose a "higher salary over excellent retirement benefits " some of employers answered that workers would opt for the higher salary but only of employees said the same "it kind of brings to light" that individual employees may be analyzing retirement plans "more than is expected " says d j lucey an analyst for cerulli associates a boston financial services consultant some companies are capitalizing on such research international business machines corp considers its k plan which gives employees access to more than mutual funds a recruiting tool says clint roswell a company spokesman ibm needs to offer employees an appealing k since the company is phasing out its pension plan starting in january "we need to help them make this transition " mr roswell says but plenty of other companies still have unappealing plans so what can employees do if they are dissatisfied financial planners are loath to suggest that employees walk away from participating in workplace retirement plans the pretax savings are hard to replicate in other investment vehicles workplace plans let investors defer taxes on the money put into the plan and its investment earnings plus if the employer provides a matching contribution not participating in a workplace plan is like leaving "free money on the table " writes mr davis of morningstar some analysts suggest that employees who meet the income qualifications for a roth ira can use that investment vehicle to plug gaps in their k plans assuming they have spare after tax money to invest a more direct approach is to vent to the boss "if the plan really stinks put some pressure on the employer " says jill schlesinger a fee only financial planner and radio show host in providence r i she says that "a lot of larger employers and midlevel employers will respond " smaller companies are less likely to alter their plans thats because the more employees a company has participating in a plan the more leverage it has with the fund provider so a bigger employer may be able to offer lower cost funds or a greater range of funds without incurring a substantial increase in what the company pays the firm that administers the plan last year the tennessee consolidated retirement system greatly expanded the number of funds available to state employees after it received repeated calls requesting that certain funds be added says beth chapman the systems director a free web site khelp com owned by merriman berkman next provides sample complaint letters to send to trustees of company retirement plans requesting that low cost index funds be added to the menu mr ching the new york software programmer says his employer doesnt provide a matching contribution he knew that when he took the job but he didnt know what the fund fees would be he says he has mutual fund options in his retirement plan the funds he named all have expense ratios of at least and several are above mr ching went to the companys human resources department to request a plan with better choices to no avail he says he was told that his employer which he declined to identify plans to evaluate other providers "down the road " but wasnt sure "if and when" the switch would occur he expects to contribute to the plan so he can get the tax benefits but he says "discovering the details of the plan really hurt my morale and enthusiasm " ms levitz is a staff reporter in boston for the wall street journal she can be reached at jennifer levitz wsj
