the morning brief parsing one more milestone in the evolution of a war online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here the day of gen david petraeuss reappearance on capitol hill is here at last and his congressional interlocutors arent likely to be surprised by an expected advocacy for keeping more u s troops in iraq than were deployed last january or a timeline for success thats well over the horizon the commander of u s forces in iraq wrote to his troops on friday conceding that the political progress sought through the surge of american forces this year "has not worked out as we had hoped " though he said the military front had achieved "tactical momentum " the new york times reports this message is likely to be echoed during the first of two days of testimony in which gen petraeus is expected to discuss his recommendation to president bush that about troops could be withdrawn in mid december and that enough forces could depart by next august to leave about troops in iraq the pre surge force level "but the general has also said that it is too soon to present recommendations on reducing american forces below that level because the situation in iraq is in flux " the times reports "he has suggested that he wait until march to outline proposals on that question " but "even as american commanders plan to reduce the overall force they have stressed that the troop reductions could be adjusted or delayed if violence increases " the paper adds as tough as gen petraeuss case may be before a congressional majority that opposes the bush administration strategy in iraq his fellow witness has a tougher sell the washington post notes ambassador ryan crocker will have little good news to offer about "how the iraqis have used the political breathing space that bush promised his war strategy would create " the post says the u s political aspects of the war are just as tenuous two years and two white house strategies after mr bush offered a "plan for victory " messrs petraeus and crocker will have to acknowledge that the presidents goals remain distant the times notes and the administration plans to keep the commander in chief in the background until a planned national address later this week in the address mr bush will offer a "revised plan picking a course that the white house hopes will end the unusually public disagreements among the presidents military advisers about how much more effort and blood to invest in the war " the times says officials say it could be akin to president nixons "peace with honor" speech under pressure from congressional opposition to the war in vietnam but its uncertain how much the petraeus crocker testimony and any new landmark presidential address will ease such pressure today writing in the new yorker george packer sees this weeks push as "the kind of short lived event on which the administration has relied to shore up support for the war the mission accomplished declaration the deaths of uday and qusay hussein saddams capture the transfer of sovereignty the three rounds of voting the plan for victory the death of abu musab al zarqawi " and he argues that "every new milestone however illusory allows the administration to avoid thinking ahead to the years when the mistakes of iraq will continue to haunt the u s " despite the increased willingness of some democrats and republicans to find a compromise in the senate that could promote a quick withdrawal the wall street journal points out that "lawmakers in both parties now acknowledge that with congress unlikely to muster sufficient votes to force a sharp reduction in troops the decision on how and when to disengage from iraq will almost certainly fall to the next president " still political support for prolonging the war continues to ebb a new york times cbs news poll indicates only of americans trust the bush administration to resolve the war compared with that would trust congress and that would most trust the military that last statistic however may not benefit gen petraeus as an advocate for the white house of respondents to a usa today gallup poll said they expect him to deliver "a biased report that reflects what the bush administration wants the public to believe " back in iraq even as focus of the iraq debate turns to washington politics in the region could be further complicating any formulation of new policy the anti u s cleric moqtada al sadr who ordered a temporary freeze of his mahdi army militias activities last month has asked mahdi commanders "who distinguished themselves fighting u s troops in to screen fighters weed out criminals and assume key positions in an effort to build a more disciplined force " two of his key lieutenants tell the associated press the wall street journal reports that "the pentagon is preparing to build its first base for u s forces near the iraqi iranian border in a major new effort to curb the flow of advanced iranian weaponry to shiite militants across iraq " and an official iranian delegation at a diplomatic conference in baghdad warned "that if the iraqi government could not stop militants from crossing into iran and carrying out attacks the iranian authorities would respond militarily " the new york times reports on another issue inseparable from the military side of the conflict petroleum the washington post says the u s is preparing for a possible iraqi oil revenue sharing law by "seeking an international legal adviser who is fluent in arabic to provide expert input when requested to u s government agencies or to iraqi authorities as they draft the laws and regulations that will govern iraqs oil and gas sector " and the journal adds that "hunt oil co has struck a deal to explore for oil in iraqs semiautonomous kurdish region signaling a new willingness by some large western companies to bypass the fractious government in baghdad and deal directly with regional authorities in the war torn country " a short stay in pakistan like many an expats visit home former prime minister nawaz sharifs return to pakistan today was all too brief and not without tension about four hours after his plane landed in islamabad pakistani officials tell the associated press mr sharif was deported to jidda in saudi arabia where he has lived during much of the time since being ousted by gen pervez musharraf in a bloodless coup in mr sharif who still leads the opposition pakistan muslim league had tried to fire gen musharraf as army commander before the coup and once in exile he was sentenced in absentia to life in prison on corruption and other charges but the pakistani supreme court which has itself clashed with gen musharraf this year ruled last month that authorities couldnt prevent mr sharif from returning to the country that order seems to have been ignored today another exiled former premier opposition leader and political rival of mr sharif benazir bhutto has been negotiating a possible return with representatives of gen musharraf in a deal that would also be aimed at keeping him in power despite the rising tide of opposition to his possibly extra constitutional rule todays treatment of the increasingly popular mr sharif seems likely to further inflame an already incendiary political environment for gen musharraf a man the bush administration has made a pillar of its global counterterrorism policy meanwhile the new york times reports that western authorities view the accused conspirators of a german bomb plot arrested last week as part of a "small but growing flow of militants from germany and other western countries who are receiving terrorism training at camps in pakistan " disney to begin its own toy testing walt disney today plans to tell mattel and other toy manufacturers licensing its characters that disney will begin its own testing of such toys for unsafe levels of lead paint the new york times reports the tests which will include random testing of products already on the market are aimed at sending the message "that we are looking over their shoulders " disney consumer products chief andy mooney tells the times the decision follows three separate massive recalls by mattel of lead tainted toys made in china and the plan marks what the times calls "a significant shift in the toy business " where big licensing companies like disney and warner brothers have left quality control up to the manufacturers the major retailer toys "r" us has also told manufacturers it will no longer rely on manufacturers testing and has hired engineers to test the products they find at toys "r" us stores meanwhile the u s national highway traffic safety administration plans to sign a cooperation agreement with a chinese counterpart that could help resolve disputes that have slowed inquiries like one that recently led to the recall of tires usa today reports the recall was delayed "because there was a delay in getting the information from china " nhtsa chief nicole nason says and the company involved blamed a chinese manufacturer that refused to hand over data that would have helped find the trouble sooner nhtsa and chinas national development and reform commission now intend to share more research and information but usa today notes such accords arent panaceas and that the consumer product safety commissions "memorandum of understanding" with its chinese counterpart three years ago hasnt prevented lead tainted toys from reaching u s shelves also of note wall street journal the stock market has been seeing exceptional volatility lately of a kind that in the past sometimes signaled that stocks were getting ready to
