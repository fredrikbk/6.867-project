politics &amp economics in little havana cuba si obama no mr sopo discovers support of democrats call to ease u s embargo stirs a generational rift miami giancarlo sopos grandmother was horrified when the barack obama campaign invited him to ride in the official motorcade during a swing through miami late last month the year old walked to her bureau and handed mr sopo a small palm frond crucifix and a picture card of jesus for divine protection "be careful my son " she warned him "there are many crazy people out there who may want to harm you and the senator because of your opinions " the crazy people she was talking about are fellow cuban americans the opinion she was talking about is sen obamas view that the u s should take small steps to ease its economic embargo of the island just days before he rode in the motorcade mr sopo had created a small cuban american group called unidos con obama united with obama his grandmothers worst fears havent come to pass but mr sopo is discovering that being a fan of the illinois democrat in miamis little havana can mean a break from old friends and acquaintances "if you deviate slightly from what is the traditional hard line approach to the castro regime they will publicly call you a communist on local radio and tv stations humiliate you and your family and accuse you of terrible things " the year old says for decades u s presidential candidates from both parties have made pilgrimages to miami to pledge their toughness toward fidel castro hoping to score cuban american votes in when a few hundred ballots in florida determined the presidency both republican george w bush and democrat al gore came out against the clinton administrations decision to take a motherless year old boy elian gonzalez away from his miami relatives and return him to his father in cuba in a forum of democratic candidates on spanish language univision last night new york sen hillary clinton one of mr obamas main rivals for the nomination said the cuban people "deserve liberty and democracy " but avoided any suggestion that she would tinker with the trade embargo mr obama for reasons of principle policy and politics is betting that a younger generation of cuban americans might go for a candidate promising new tactics when it comes to cuba a situation made even more urgent by the declining health of mr castro in a recent miami herald op ed mr obama said he wants to relax rules that limit how much cuban americans can travel to the island and how much money cuban expatriates can send back to their relatives "my policy toward cuba will be guided by one word liberty " mr obama told supporters at a little havana rally last month but he stopped short of calling for an end to the u s economic embargo until change comes to cuba in his op ed mr obama wrote that "it makes strategic sense to hold onto important inducements we can use in dealing with a post fidel government for it is an unfortunate fact that his departure by no means guarantees the arrival of freedom on the island " mr sopo was at the little havana rally with his sister mother and grandmother compact earnest fiercely admiring of warren buffett and other captains of capitalism mr sopo says in elementary school he memorized jfks "ich bin ein berliner" address and gordon gekkos "greed is good" speech from the movie "wall street " mr sopos anti castro pedigree is impeccable his grandfather was a cuban navy officer who died in a cuban prison after the revolution his father edgar who had studied at georgetown university was jailed by the castro regime in but he fled to miami after a friend secured his release in florida he joined fellow exiles plotting mr castros overthrow and went ashore in cuba with an infiltration team ahead of the failed american backed bay of pigs invasion in he escaped capture by taking refuge in the venezuelan embassy in havana felix rodriguez the central intelligence agency operative who was present in bolivia at the execution of mr castros argentine comrade ernesto "che" guevara was on edgar sopos team during the bay of pigs invasion and spoke at his funeral the younger mr sopo was proud to shake mr bushs hand at a campaign rally in but the war in iraq soured him on mr bush and in he worked on democrat john kerrys presidential bid he first heard about mr obama in and volunteered to do low level campaign work earlier this year the eureka moment however came in a movie theater when mr sopos blackberry buzzed with an internet alert notifying him that mr obama planned to propose easing travel and remittance restrictions to cuba the next day he decided to organize cuban americans and other hispanics to support mr obamas presidential bid within a few days he had members and was holding forth on channel a local spanish language television station he was also attracting the attention of those for whom relaxing the embargo is considered a betrayal of the cuban cause the first call came from his friend melanie de armas a year old student at florida international university who works a day job in a mortgage company "hey mr obama " she said in a message left on mr sopos voice mail according to mr sopo "i saw you on the news i want to talk to you about this " when they did speak mr sopo brought up a recent florida international university poll showing that more than of cuban americans in miami support freer travel and remittances he said he disagreed with those who call mr obama naive for thinking that more contact between the u s and cuba will loosen the regimes grip ms de armas responded that she doesnt believe the polls "i wasnt polled and nobody in my family was polled " she says radio host ninoska perez castellon a fixture among miami exiles went on the air to condemn mr obamas cuba stance adding that it was a "provocation" for the candidate to schedule a rally in the same little havana auditorium where ronald reagan gave a famously anti castro speech in ms perez castellon had called edgar sopo a "cuban patriot" in a radio broadcast after his death the following year ms perez castellon giancarlo sopo his mother and his little sister were among the cuban americans who gathered around the elian gonzalez house to try to prevent him from being sent to cuba but ms perez castellon whose husband spent years in a cuban prison has nothing good to say about the younger mr sopos alliance with barack obama "if giancarlo feels that way its fine and even though its a totally opposing view from what his fathers view was thats fine " she says "but does he represent the majority of this community no " the conflict was evident at mr obamas little havana rally outside the auditorium mr sopo wearing a white guayabera with his year old sister giannina and their young allies waved signs that read "cuban americans support obama " on the other side of the street were a few dozen older protesters waving signs that read "helping castro is a crime" and "cuba si obama no " inside the auditorium the candidate vowed to fight for freedom in cuba in his own way "until theres justice in cuba theres no justice anywhere " mr obama said the sopos gave him a standing ovation afterward giannina gestured across the street at the angry anti obama demonstrators "theyre too old to change " she said see related letter "letters to the editor gop needs to update its outlook on cuba" wsj september
