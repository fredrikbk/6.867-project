marketing a bed wetting product to kids to sell boxer style pant kimberly clarks ads strive to reduce stigma marketing products to deal with embarrassing ailments from hemorrhoids to erectile dysfunction or unsightly toe conditions has always been a challenge but what if youre trying to talk to kids introducing a product for bed wetters this month kimberly clark is aiming to win over not only parents of the sufferers but the children themselves but because many bed wetters are so sensitive about their condition they wont wear a product to help them at night kimberly clark is adopting special euphemistic tactics in both product design and marketing sales of training and bed wetting pants which typically fetch a premium to the price of standard diapers are increasing in the otherwise stagnant u s diaper category which has been pressured in recent years by high pulp costs last year sales of training pants in the u s garnered &# billion up from according to euromonitor international sales in the overall diaper market in totaled &# billion down from &# billion in kimberly clark is considered the leader in the disposable training pants category which it launched in with a pull on diaper called huggies pull ups it expanded its training pants business with the launch of goodnites which targets children who suffer from bed wetting last year goodnites posted sales of about &# million in the u s up from &# million in according to euromonitor procter &amp gamble which remains neck and neck in its longtime race with kimberly clark for leadership in the diaper aisle entered the training pants category in with pampers easy ups but still lags behind kimberly clark p&amp g doesnt make a product specifically intended to help children who suffer from bed wetting kimberly clarks new product designed for children and adolescents who wet the bed at night is a line of boxer shorts styled after the short pajamas many children like to wear the boxers sold under the goodnites brand act as a disguise for the diaper lining the shorts are made of paper a version of the paper drapes and surgical gowns made by kimberly clarks health care division modified to crinkle less loudly some kids are resistant to pull ups adamant theyve outgrown diapers whether kids will be swayed by the new boxer shorts blue for boys and pink for girls remains to be seen bed wetting affects an estimated five million to seven million american children each year according to the national kidney foundation for both kids and parents it remains one of the most stigmatized childhood conditions "often theres a family history of bed wetting " says leslie spry a nephrologist and spokesman for the national kidney foundation kimberly clark has gone out of its way to reduce the embarrassment factor associated with buying bed wetting products consumers will have the option of buying single pairs of the boxers in a cardboard tube with a peel off label so children can conceal its contents multiple pairs will be available with regular packaging "we really do have to appeal to kids as well as parents " says gary keider vice president of kimberly clarks baby and child care business "the product isnt called bed wetting pants for a reason we increasingly understand the need to focus on the positive here " mr keider says ads for the new shorts aim to be discreet past ad campaigns for kimberly clarks bed wetting products highlighted the anxiety the problem brings and the relief the product offers but tv ads for goodnites boxers which will target tv shows popular with mothers such as "dr phil" and "oprah " as well as programs on abc family channel avoid discussing the problem instead they highlight the comfort of a normal bedtime routine such as stories and star gazing and use the tagline "you have better things to talk about at bedtime than bedwetting " kimberly clark is using the web to take the campaign directly to kids the company has ramped up the childrens section on its goodnites web site offering basic information about the problem and a chat room for children to exchange bed wetting tips success stories and advice on dealing with slumber parties in store marketing also takes a covert approach since many parents with bed wetting children no longer shop in the baby care aisle kimberly clark plans to post information about the product in the laundry detergent section "when we talked about some of the obstacles to using goodnites one is awareness " says tom smilanich a kimberly clark marketing director "parents kept saying they were doing an awful lot of laundry " one ad for the detergent aisle features a little boy peering through the window of a washing machine along with the tagline "lighten the load " the boxers are the latest attempt by kimberly clark to overcome resistance to the goodnites product since introducing goodnites pull ups in the companys product developers have tried to make the product less diaper like by streamlining its design and adding graphics so it more closely resemble childrens underwear usually the goodnites brand is accompanied by the pull ups name but conscious that children today may associate the pull ups brand with diapers kimberly clark decided to remove mention of the pull ups name from packages of the new goodnites boxers
