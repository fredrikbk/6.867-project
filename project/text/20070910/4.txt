"our site is a digital velvet rope " says mr lannung who has rejected more than half of the more than people who have attempted to register so far its this promise of exclusivity that is drawing sponsors to the site among its high profile marketing partners eccentric fashion design house heatherette diesel jeans and luxury jeweler piaget like other professional social networking sites that have sprung up for people in fields ranging from medicine to advertising modelshotel aims to make money by selling access to its relatively tiny target audience while traditional ads are sparse on the

advertising on modelshotel though mr barton says he would consider working with the site again in the future models spend a lot of time in isolation traveling from casting to casting often in cities where they dont know anyone else but like shannon rusbuldt a year old model with elite models many fear exposing themselves to unwelcome solicitations from wannabe photographers agents and suitors mr lannung who is represented by ms rusbuldts former agency persuaded her to join by assuring her that his site is similar to other social networks "but without the creepy people " applicants dont have to pay anything to register but they must first be given an invitation key mr lannungs year old partner frank "superfrank" copsidas late soul singer james browns former manager says he also sees opportunities in creating micro communities for other fashion professionals such as stylists and photographers who are considered influential in fashion circles these sites could theoretically give users the option to open their profiles to other professional networks one problem such narrowly targeted sites face is that their small size can limit marketing opportunities for the sites owners says samir arora chairman and chief executive of glam media inc a network of mainstream and niche internet publishers that focus on fashion beauty and design "the smaller and more restrictive you are the more qualified an audience you will have " mr arora says "but you have all the problems of leverage and reach because you are so small " but modelshotel has managed to attract the interest of businesses outside the fashion industry too david barton gym a chain of luxurious fitness clubs is now offering a free trial membership to modelshotel subscribers a cosmetic dentist is offering off

challenge for many professional networking sites and modelshotel has been no exception mr lannung personally vets each applicant he calls agencies and asks registrants to "name their bookers " he says a time consuming process that has made it difficult for him to continue modeling in spite of his vigilance he admits that several impostors have sneaked through most have been booted off the site mr lannung says "i had a feeling it was going to be rough to get approval " wrote one male applicant in an email plea to mr lannung after his profile was taken down "i had to stop modeling for some personal issues but i plan to get back into it " he said adding that his girlfriend is also a professional model the verdict access denied
