real time pondering a new pc after five years with the same computer a columnist considers new possibilities online edition "i need a new computer" isnt the kind of thought that just arrives out of nowhere instead it has a way of sneaking up on you arriving after months or even years of annoyance and rarely is there a specific reason beyond a slow build up of dissatisfaction the computers symptoms are generally vague pokiness memory problems and the like combined with a straw and camels back succession of whizzy new things you know you cant do im not a bleeding edge techie i tend to lag a bit behind the curve until the bugs are worked out for the most part i generally tolerate errors and annoyances dropped network connections printing woes as long as things mostly work the iphone aside i usually dont hunger for the latest greatest gizmo by way of proof my current pc is a dell dimension from five years is an eternity in the tech world by now my dell is what most techies would call a boat anchor still until recently my boat anchor and i were doing just fine the programs that get the most use on my pc are word itunes excel photoshop elements and firefox with an increasing amount of what i do blogging and email for instance accomplished through the browser elements is slow but otherwise those programs seem to work just fine on my elderly pc and i work even better since i set up my machine to run two monitors if you frequently find yourself alt tabbing between applications or copying information between programs i cant recommend two monitors enough it was easy to do and life changing a marvelous combination that can be elusive in technological matters but little by little my machine has begun showing signs of technological rust theres been a gradual increase in programs encountering a problem needing to close and wanting to tell microsoft about it theres been the slow creep of messages informing me that virtual memory is too low which means the ram has been maxed out the computer has borrowed hard drive space and now doesnt have enough of that this is the pc equivalent of muscles drowning in lactic acid and means "reboot " there have been more and more cases of browsers getting stuck big files opening sluggishly or not at all and other signs of a pc wheezing to keep up with the demands being placed on it these things seem to happen a lot less with windows xp than they did with previous operating systems but theyre still happening then there was the question of games i fancy myself a videogame fan despite the inconvenient fact that i basically never play them it used to be different once upon a time id binge on videogames every six months or so id pick a game stay up until all hours playing it for a week or two and then get back to my regular life as discussed in this real time i havent done that in years but theres a difference between no longer doing something and resigning yourself to never doing it again where videogames are concerned i havent quite reached the latter point but my pc has last spring i readied myself for one more videogame binge settling on "far cry" as the game id indulge in my computer couldnt handle the game though i gave up after enduring stuttering graphics and video and too frequent crashes determined to binge i tried "knights of the old republic " an older title my pc couldnt even load it even for someone who rarely plays them games can be a useful measure of a pcs capabilities and last years abortive binge was yet another sign that mine had long since fallen by the technological wayside but however little i wanted to admit it i knew that didnt really matter between fatherhood and work the free time i had five years ago has been drastically reduced nowadays instead of binging a game catches my eye every so often and i read about it wistfully before giving up any thought of playing it recently the game ive admired is "bioshock " greeted by gamer outposts like the second coming i read about the game watched the trailer and even toyed with the "bioshock" site knowing full well i couldnt play it only this time that annoyed me why should i be like the worlds oldest urchin staring into the brightly lit toy store window of videogames before i quite knew what was happening i was thinking about a new pc and all the pcs ive left behind my first computer was a hand me down from my parents that went to high school to me in the mid s it was an ibm pc portable the last word seriously bending a definition this "suitcase" pc weighed pounds and would just fit under an airplane middle seat i know because i actually used to drag my pc portable back and forth from massachusetts to florida still i used it for seven years and it handled all the word processing i could throw at it im vaguely nostalgic about that vanished portable i miss its easy on the eyes amber screen and while lugging it around on planes seems insane now i still use the apparently indestructible ibm bag it came with after college i switched to a surplus laptop of my dads which i adapted to use a little clip on trackball it wasnt until that i got a full fledged desktop pc with a color monitor and everything a dell i upgraded to windows if memory serves that pc was replaced by a machine that ran windows nt and then windows me which i recall as a parade of blue screens of death separated by brief intervals of work and then gave way to my current xp based pc for a while it seemed like my personal pc upgrade cycle was accelerating but then my current pc broke the trend a startling deceleration that i ascribe to a combination of computer innovation moving out from the pc to web based services xp being much more stable than its predecessors and my more complicated more adult life leaving less room for fretting about the imperfections of computers after a couple of years i stopped looking at dell catalogs best buy circulars and all those periodic dispatches from the pc front lines now im finding myself paying attention again only this time theres a difference my old recipe buy a reasonably current dell minus accessories no longer holds much interest and thats because of apple the windows and apple worlds practically matter and antimatter not so long ago now coexist and overlap in all manner of ways moreover since apple has pushed its way into my technological life with the ipod and itunes leading the way for the airport express that connects my pc and my stereo and fueling my desire for an iphone having become used to apple products i find myself wondering if it would be fun to play with iphoto imovie or even garageband and why not the windows apple wall has crumbled to a few scattered stones easily stepped over this by the way is exactly what tim hanrahan and i saw coming in late and in discussing my options with friends and colleagues ive found several others also mulling leaving windows behind so maybe ill get one of those gorgeous new imacs or maybe the mac mini is the way to go for a potential windows switcher like me or perhaps i should leave my pc alone for now and instead consider an xbox for scratching that occasional videogame itch whatever i decide ill find myself in a new technological world so any thoughts on what my next pc should be windows people have your attitudes about apple changed what would make you switch if youve already switched how did it go join me and other online journal readers in the real time forum or write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
