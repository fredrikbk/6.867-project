on investing how safe is the safe part of your portfolio like the stock market the bond market had a jittery week that makes this a prime time for investors to review the risks they are taking in whats supposed to be the lower risk part of their portfolios on tuesday as stocks suffered their biggest one day drop in more than five years and worries about an economic slowdown grew some professional bond investors sold bonds with lower credit ratings that included high yield or "junk" bonds from below investment grade companies emerging markets debt from developing nations and some lower rated mortgage backed issues there was a corresponding surge of dollars into supersafe treasury bonds the money flows nudged down the prices of higher risk bonds and nudged up the prices of treasurys in the odd math of bonds where yields move in the opposite direction to prices the yields on higher risk bonds rose and those of treasurys dipped the difference in yields between high risk bonds and treasurys widened although it is still low by historical standards lower rated bonds could sag further in an economic slowdown notes robert millikan who oversees bond investments at raleigh n c based bb&amp t asset management there could be an increase in the number of borrowers defaulting and just the fear of default can tank junk bond prices as investors demand higher yields for taking risk "right now you ought to stay with the highest credit quality " mr millikan suggests check whether your bond mutual funds own mostly top quality securities or whether they have reached lower on the credit ladder for yield youll find more lower rated bonds in funds with "high income" in their names since those bonds pay the juiciest interest whether you should sell such investments is an individual matter hinging on your risk tolerance and time horizon most professionals advise against sudden sweeping changes in your holdings unless for instance youll need the money soon to pay the kids college bills "the returns average fund investors get are less than the average returns of funds because individuals often make poor timing decisions " notes art steinmetz manager of oppenheimer strategic income fund amid last weeks market melee many people fled to the safety of triple a rated u s treasurys most bond funds dont invest purely in treasurys though they generally blend treasurys with highly rated mortgage and corporate issues and other bonds risk averse investors in higher tax brackets also should consider funds that own tax exempt municipal bonds munis arent as attractively priced as they were a few years ago but they pose almost as little default risk as treasurys and they pay interest thats mostly exempt from federal income tax while high quality bonds involve little repayment risk they can still tumble sharply in price if interest rates in the marketplace climb one way to trim that risk stick to intermediate term or shorter maturities which dont fluctuate as much in price as longer bonds think twice about junk bonds fund managers say oppenheimerfunds mr steinmetz has been whittling holdings of such bonds because he thinks defaults will rise and he believes some non u s bonds offer better value high yield bond funds have performed very strongly in the past year though last year investors received nearly in total return from the combination of price appreciation and fund distributions tops among major taxable bond categories tracked by lipper many fund mangers also are wary of some emerging markets issues including dollar denominated government bonds after a torrent of money poured into that sector over the past three years the yields on those bonds dont compensate adequately for the risk they pose pros say some bonds that yielded as much as percentage points more than treasurys about four years ago now yield as little as two percentage points more another market that deserves caution is mortgage backed bonds such bonds are backed by pools of home loans and as the loans are repaid that money is passed along to bondholders the risk is that flows will ebb when some homeowners cant make loan repayments however mortgage bonds are designed to withstand a certain level of defaults in recent months defaults have surged for so called subprime loans or those to high risk borrowers many fund managers doubt that such problems will spill over widely into the broader mortgage bond market because subprime comprises only about of the &# trillion mortgage sector but mortgage issues are widely held by bond funds sometimes in those with "government securities" in their names its important to look at what a fund holds as shown by its average credit rating says james kauffmann head of fixed income at the u s investment arm of netherlands based ing groep "mortgages by and large are a triple a asset class " he says "if a fund has an average rating much below triple a there could be a lot of risky things in there "
