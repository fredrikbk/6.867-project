getting going when the wolf is polite enough to knock you have been warned like a thunderclap in the distance tuesdays point plunge by the dow jones industrial average served notice that rough markets may lie ahead i have no idea whether well get those rough markets but consider tuesday to be a great gift you have been reminded of your risk tolerance and should you decide to lighten up on stocks you still have the chance to get out at lofty prices to be sure share prices dont seem that lofty standard &amp poors stock index is at times s reported earnings not much above the historical average of a little under times earnings valuations also appear reasonable relative to bonds lately year treasury notes have been yielding around meanwhile in the s&amp p companies are expected to pay dividends equal to of todays share prices on top of that investors in the s&amp p have a shot at some share price appreciation as long as we get at least moderate earnings growth and as long as the s&amp p continues to trade at or close to times earnings it shouldnt be too tough for stock market investors to beat todays treasury yield yet despite all this theres good reason to be worried when we look at the s&amp p s earnings we might be looking at so called peak earnings in other words we may be near the top of the economic cycle and corporate profits could stagnate or fall from current levels any slowdown in earnings would likely prompt investors to dump stocks and yes there are signs the economy is struggling on tuesday the commerce department announced that januarys durable goods orders had dropped from decembers level suggesting that businesses are becoming cautious about their capital spending on wednesday the commerce department said real gross domestic product had grown at a annual rate over the three months ended dec that was substantially lower than the initial estimate released in january to make matters worse when we analyze the s&amp p were looking at one of the markets tamest sectors valuations in other market segments dont seem nearly so sensible consider two examples one from the stock market and one from the bond market among stocks possibly the hottest sector in recent years has been equity real estate investment trusts which make their money by renting out offices apartments shopping malls warehouses and other buildings reits have generated dazzling gains over the past seven years but that long bull run has stretched valuations driving equity reit yields down to at the end of february versus at year end we have also seen a growing appetite for risk among bond investors the hunger for higher returns has spurred investors to bid up the price of high yield junk bonds leading to lower yields as a rule junk bonds are a good buy when yields are five percentage points or more above the yield on year treasury notes conversely when the yield gap is closer to three percentage points junk investors really arent getting adequately rewarded for the risk involved and they could be in for rotten returns where do we stand now as of late last week the spread was right around three percentage points with junk yielding versus for year treasurys and junk bonds and reits arent the only sectors that appear pricey volatile markets such as emerging markets stocks and bonds and small company shares both here and abroad have posted handsome gains in recent years make no mistake just seven years after the great s bull market came to a screeching halt investors have once again been walking on the wild side getting nervous dont be too alarmed it is highly unlikely we will see a replay of the bear market valuations today are far less frightening than they were in in fact while the dow recently hit an all time high the s&amp p is still below its march level and the nasdaq composite index remains mired at roughly half its peak "its like in that people arent thinking about the downside " says minneapolis financial planner ross levin "there are pockets of the market that are clearly overpriced reits are a great example of that but the overall market isnt nearly as expensive as it was in " the bottom line a or stock market decline wouldnt be at all surprising after the strong gains of the past four years but if you have a long time horizon you are diversified and you are reasonably tenacious i dont think there is much reason to fiddle with your portfolio what if your time horizon isnt so long what if you discovered during tuesdays point plunge that your appetite for risk isnt nearly as great as you imagined its your lucky day the dow jones industrial average has posted huge gains in recent years and even after tuesdays selloff it is still just below its all time high the implication if you decided after the past weeks turmoil that you have too much in stocks and you ought to lighten up this isnt a bad time to be selling if you want to calm down your portfolio tuesday offered a great lesson while the dow industrials tumbled more than that day some intermediate term bond funds were up and many long term bond funds gained over to reduce your jitters consider moving maybe or of your portfolio out of stocks and into bonds "you dont want to react to the decline by getting out totally " mr levin says "but it isnt a bad time to look at your portfolio and say how much capacity for risk do i have if you decide youre taking too much risk take a little off the table and put the money into certificates of deposit or treasurys today you can get yields close to with cds and low cost money market funds
