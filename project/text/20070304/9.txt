real time mightier than the pen never mind cursive will children still write in an era ruled by computers and pda online edition my four year old son is starting to get interested in making letters beginning naturally with writing his own name he even makes some of the letters backwards which i confess i thought only happened when adults imitated kids writing watching joshua train his hand to make an s though got me thinking in our technological age how much use will he get out of this particular skill will keyboards and touchscreens render pens and pencils specialized implements with my kid never using a pen for anything much longer than a post it note i grew up in a pen and paper world but joshua is growing up with computers and pdas that will shape his daily life in ways ill struggle to grasp but hell take for granted thats not new ive written about how tivo has left my son baffled by commercials and by the idea that sometimes he cant watch whatever he wants or immediately see something that just happen again ive also pondered how hell likely never answer a ringing phone thats not supposed to be for him im sure something similar will happen with printing and handwriting something routine for him but very strange to me but what technological extrapolation is dangerous particularly when youre touching on things to which people have an emotional connection but ill try certainly my kid will grow up far more familiar with keyboards than i was i taught myself to type when i was mostly because i wanted to write short stories on my folks new ibm pc joshua was fooling around with making his name appear on a computer screen before he ever tried writing it with a crayon he doesnt use computers yet though he does like looking at pictures of animals and hearing audio clips of them before too long hell want to do that by himself and before im ready hell want his first cellphone i cant know what kind of cellphone hell use when hes older but given technologys march im sure itll be one with all the functions of a pda i also bet hell never have to learn the bizarre tap tap tapping of converting a telephone keypads trios of numbers to text messages as iphone style touchscreens become widespread and predictive text improves that particular skill will probably become a parlor trick retained by todays teens and twentysomethings the aughts version of being great at morse code touchscreens detractors think the lack of tactile feedback will prove a problem for typists if so itll be interesting to see those who type on such screens at an early age will have difficulties i can easily imagine my kid carrying a cellphone pda a distinction which hell find odd with him everywhere he goes and or a laptop in class as students in both colleges and high schools increasingly do personally i doubt tablet pcs will ever take off i think theyll be caught from behind by pdas between pdas and laptops assuming the two dont merge wheres the need for pen and paper as a kid i was inordinately proud of my printing but its decayed precipitously in adulthood and its no mystery why i take notes in meetings and when out on a story and occasionally scribble a note for my wife or a to do list for myself but mostly i type emails stories memos reminders of things i need to do when i get home or return to work all typed looking at the pen and paper writing i still do i notice a lot of it remains because of habit and technological limitations those to do lists to myself would make more sense on a pda im constantly copying unfinished tasks onto new bits of paper i refuse to use a pda for fear of becoming a blackberry zombie and because i hate those little keys as for notes to my wife whats more reliable a text message sent to a device she always has with her or a scrap of paper left in the tacitly agreed place by the dishwasher and remember im a pen and paper baby joshua is beginning from a very different starting point on a visceral level its distressing to imagine our children barely writing by hand the thought feeds our fears that technology is turning us into eloi lacking coherent attention spans and basic skills never mind that few of us would survive very long in the woods a measure of basic human competence not so long ago emotional pull aside does print whether its block letters or cursive have a value we should be wary of losing an argument for cursive which id wager also applies to printing letters versus typing them is that it reinforces the basic lessons of good reading writing and spelling by concentrating the mind for instance this washington post article mentions a vanderbilt experiment in which first graders instructed in handwriting got better at expressing complex thoughts and sentence construction in nine weeks interesting stuff but i cant help noting that children change a lot in nine weeks anyway or wondering if you could get a similar result with any exercise that forced kids to bear down on expressing their thoughts is the secret the pencil or the concentration im more suspicious of appeals to the emotional pull of printing or handwriting thats certainly there but its also easily exaggerated particularly among those of us who grew up in an era we see vanishing as a kid i loved to draw and i was disturbed that joshua primarily made collages out of animal stickers "wheres the creativity in that " i asked my wife her response "next time hes doing stickers listen to him " so i did and found myself eavesdropping on a grand narrative of animal adventures that my son was making up as he went there was plenty of creativity going on but id missed it because i was worrying about why my son wasnt using a crayon ive read heartbreaking accounts of families keeping cellphone accounts active so children can hear a lost parents voice or of soldiers in iraq talking about how much it means to them to be able to exchange email with their families daily my grandfather sent me typed letters when i was a boy and i cant imagine theyd mean any more to me if theyd been hand written i keep a folder full of old emails from friends that made me laugh or smile and what would letter writers a century ago have made of the idea that teenage boyfriends and girlfriends would one day thrill at shared silences during late night phone calls there is something appealing about words made by a human hand and i hope calligraphy survives as an art form to be admired but writing words by hand isnt what makes us human and in worrying too much about form we risk forgetting how adaptable the heart is at investing our communications with feeling is writing by hand disappearing is anything lost if it does write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
