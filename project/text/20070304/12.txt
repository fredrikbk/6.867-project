year to date the dow is down and the nasdaq is down the rough week is a wake up call for investors who have piled into riskier areas of the market such as expensive small cap shares and emerging market funds its also a reminder that in tough periods many riskier investments move down together surprising those who figured they were diversified last week everything from shares of u s lenders serving riskier borrowers to shares of latin american telecommunications providers fell sharply now its time to focus on high quality investments that tend to not drop as far in bad times for the market those include large cap companies in developed markets especially health care shares as well as top rated corporate bonds says richard bernstein chief investment strategist at merrill lynch stocks with generous dividends also should do better than others if the market weakens he says it may also be time to trim holdings of stocks from developing nations "we recommend that u s investors take some profit from the emerging markets and deploy the cash into large cap u s stocks " says joseph quinlan a market strategist at bank of america his favorite sectors now defense energy industrials and materials he also recommends that investors reduce their exposure to riskier asset classes like "junk " or below investment grade bonds but dont make any rash moves peter andersen a portfolio manager at dreman value management in jersey city n j says "a slide is like a cut that takes at least a couple of days to heal dont contemplate any major decisions until then " still he says the recent downturn serves as a warning about the risks of both stocks and bonds of emerging markets which are prone to severe selloffs and are appropriate only for investors with a hearty appetite for risk tuesdays big drop in u s stocks was partly a reaction to an drop in shanghai stocks mr andersen of dreman says if the u s market goes down further it could signal a new period of volatility as hedge funds and others who sometimes make sharp short term changes in their holdings scramble to adjust their portfolios "i tell clients to expect more swings like this because there are more aggressive hedgies in the market now and they operate differently " mr andersen says "so brace yourself " if the market takes another leg down and the drop turns into a correction mr bernstein of merrill lynch says investors should try to avoid reacting to the move "we always suggest that investors adjust their portfolios by time and not by reacting to events " he says "adjusting at regular time intervals is one of the simplest methods of being a more disciplined investor " he cites academic studies showing that reacting to market moves is less successful heres more proof of the folly of trying to time the market even experts get it wrong mark hulbert of hulbert financial digest tracks the recommendations of investment newsletters his data show that in recent weeks these newsletters were urging their readers to boost their exposure to the market rather than reduce it on the heels of the markets tuesday tumble they have begun to urge caution but for their readers it might be a little too late "as far as i can tell no one gave a sell signal monday " says mr hulbert "had they really felt that this was coming they wouldnt have been building back their exposure " hulbert financial digest is owned by marketwatch which like the wall street journal is a unit of dow jones paul desmond president of lowrys reports a market researcher in north palm beach fla says the fact that tuesdays losses were so harsh and that at least of the days trading volume took place on falling stocks might actually be a good sign "historically when thats happened the resulting decline is usually very short lived and is generally followed by higher prices its a fast nasty short term correction but it generally does not lead to an extended market decline " if mr desmond is wrong and stocks do keep falling further the best strategy is to assess whether something has changed in the outlook for profits and interest rates the keys to the long term performance of stocks for stocks to enter a bear market typically defined as a drop it likely would take signs of a serious downturn for earnings or higher interest rates last week reports on new home sales and durable goods orders were
