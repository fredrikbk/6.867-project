love &amp money family vacation what price convenience what price do you put on convenience that question is on my mind these days as i plan a family trip to disney world it all started when i told my wife amy about the great airfare i had found a bit more than &# round trip per ticket to orlando she was pleased and then she asked "is that nonstop " well no she was no longer so pleased the prospect of turning a two hour flight into a five hour plus marathon with a layover all with two kids in tow is no way start a vacation she announced but what if the layover saves the family more than &# as it does in this case isnt that worth it i asked lots of spending decisions we make as parents are rooted in convenience when it comes to our kids thats particularly true on vacation you book a more expensive hotel because it has a nicer pool to entertain your kids you pay for a car service to ferry you from the airport to the hotel because the thought of schlepping your brood on far cheaper mass transit is enough to incite panic where though do you draw the line when is the price of convenience not worth the cost and what happens when you and your spouse draw the line in very different places when im traveling alone or its just me and amy transportation is often by foot or subway or local trains despite the struggles that can arise in unfamiliar countries and cities we frequently eat at random holes in the wall to trim costs on my own ill often stay at downscale out of the way hotels throw kids into the mix though and the equation changes were almost always taking cabs or renting cars and upgrading to nicer hotels that are more convenient and have nicer restaurants offering a broader selection for the kids finicky palates but everyone has their own breakpoint to use the example at hand it seems worth it to me to save &# for the inconvenience of three extra hours in travel time through atlanta however to my friend erik who happens to live in atlanta "&# is worth the convenience of a nonstop flight " "what if the first leg of the flight is delayed and you end up missing the second leg " he says "and what if the next flight out isnt for three hours with young kids the flight delays and figuring out ways to kill time in an airport can be a recipe for crabbiness that has the potential to derail the first couple of days of your vacation " erik says that every time he and his family plan a trip "we have the opportunity to find cheaper flights with layovers ten times out of i will choose to buy the nonstop flight " even if it costs more "i dont know if its a sad testament to my life or life in general today but convenience drives many of our familys decisions simply because time together has become a very precious commodity " a lot of the people i talked to felt the same way up to a point laura a woman i know in baltimore who says she is "doomed to cheapness by both nature and nurture " gasped when i told her the price difference on the tickets but then she added that "i have actually come around more to convenience of late because there is nothing like a second kid and two full time jobs to teach you the magic of convenience " "if i am traveling with two kids i will absolutely pay more for nonstop flights though i think id max out at maybe a &# or &# upcharge per ticket then again if i were traveling alone with them all bets are off " another friend on the east coast says that when he travels with his young daughter he often books a hotel room on the "club level " where guests are treated to a breakfast buffet and evening hors doeuvres in the club room "i would never pay the extra money for the club level when im alone " he says "but its just so much more convenient when shes with me to have breakfast down the hall and hors doeuvres for dinner its exciting to her and gives her more time to go swimming ultimately its more expensive but the price is well worth it " there is a cutoff though he says "would i spend &# extra per night for three or four nights probably not but i would spend an extra &# a night " disney is perhaps the quintessential example of parental convenience chasing so much about the place lends itself to inconvenience there are the monotonously long lines for the most popular rides there are the interminable waits to hop aboard one of the buses shuttling you between the park and the remote hotels there are crowds to get into restaurants in short theres a lot of hurry up and wait that happens at disney that leads parents to pay for convenience where they can find it maybe its paying more for a hotel on the disney property maybe its springing for a pricier room at a hotel along the monorails route to mitigate the inconvenience of waiting for cramped buses maybe its eating at a more expensive and less crowded restaurant or maybe its paying more for a nonstop flight amys position on the flight is simple she will be the parent stuck entertaining our restless year old daughter who gravitates toward mom over dad "i really dont want that hassle " she told me "what if the flights are delayed " i understand her concern i know how antsy our kids get but i keep coming back to one number &# thats almost as much as the total cost of our hotel and park passes for four days at disney i just cant get my head around paying such a large added expense to simply minimize the inconvenience of potentially crabby kids or a missed flight for that kind of money amy can run and hide in the atlanta airport and ill duct tape the kids to their seats still in the spirit of compromise i spent the next several days trolling the airline web sites looking for other solutions ultimately finding a flight that has a layover on the way to orlando but is nonstop on the way back when everyone is tired and ready to get home its still more expensive but substantially cheaper than amys desire for nonstop both ways thankfully she is again pleased my wallet is feeling some relief too jeff d opdyke
