sophistication" to invest in the funds setting aside the question of whether greater wealth equals greater sophistication the sec rule has outraged some millionaire investors who are being excluded from joining the coveted hedge fund club some attorneys for hedge funds which could lose investors have also taken up the charge arguing that the haves should be allowed to invest with the have mores "this is a ridiculous limitation " says ron geffner a new york securities lawyer who represents hedge funds and wealthy investors "i accept the need to account for inflation but this goes way beyond that " the sec web site has been barraged with hundreds of comments from irate investors saying the new definition is elitist ross g kaminsky an investor in colorado who qualifies under the old sec rule but says he wouldnt make the new cut said the sec should reconsider the proposal "many of us have heard the expression the rich get richer " he wrote on the sec web site "part of the reason that
