weekend journal taste houses of worship armageddon and the mahdi there may be sound strategic reasons for the u s and other permanent members of the united nations security council to recommend new sanctions against iran after all iran continues to defy u n demands to suspend nuclear enrichment but it may well be that president mahmoud ahmadinejads fiery religious rhetoric in the past is working against his country too take for example mr ahmadinejads frequent invocation of the mahdi the twelfth imam or divinely inspired leader of shiite islam who went into hiding in a d known as the "hidden imam" and "imam of the age " the mahdi is expected to reappear as a messianic figure at the end of time to establish the ideal islamic society that shiites believe never crystalized after the prophet muhammads death in a d mr ahmadinejad made a stir in september when he called for the mahdis return in his first appearance before the u n general assembly "o mighty lord i pray to you to hasten the emergence of your last repository the promised one that perfect and pure human being the one that will fill this world with justice and peace " many have interpreted this and similar utterances by mr ahmadinejad as an invitation to apocalypse when you throw in his call for the destruction of israel and think of irans nuclear ambitions it is easy to see why such end of the world talk worries so many westerners yet the return of the mahdi is central to shiite belief and isnt in itself a cause for alarm in fact the phrase "may god hasten his return" is a common shiite refrain heard nearly as often as "peace be upon him" after the prophet muhammads name "if you go to a shia mosque almost without exception when they recite the ziyarah a prayer for saints they end by saying may god expedite his return " explains hamid mavani a professor of islamic studies at claremont graduate university who was trained at shiite seminaries in iran in its millenarian tendencies shiism is not all that different from christianity or judaism echoing the book of revelation indeed elaborating on it according to some scholars it teaches that the end time or the rapture in the christian vernacular will be foreshadowed by chaos and injustice in the world then will emerge the one eyed dajjal the islamic equivalent of the antichrist and an army will sink into the earth among other tell tale signs rising up either in mecca or in the vicinity of karbala iraq the mahdi will then battle the forces of evil alongside jesus christ before ushering in a brief reign of peace and justice in the world this is one area in which shiite beliefs differ from those of the sunni branch of islam which the majority of the worlds muslims follow while sunnis await the coming of a mahdi who will bear witness before god on judgment day they do not accept the shiite doctrine that one has already been born in islam as elsewhere however messianic movements can take different forms and need not be radical according to a popular shiite hadith a saying attributed to both the prophet muhammad and the imams "the best form of jihad for my community is awaiting the reappearance of the mahdi " to the pious majority this has always meant a life devoted to quiet prayer and good deeds in anticipation of the mahdi much as a christian awaits the second coming of christ "if you ask a shia or a christian theyll say it is part of what they believe " notes ervand abrahamian a city university of new york professor and the author of several books on iran even so he adds "i dont think a normal shia or christian does his weekly calendar on the return of the mahdi or christ " yet mr ahmadinejad may not be normal in this respect such is his reputation for zealotry that when he was mayor of tehran in for instance many iranians believed a rumor that he had asked the city council to prepare a route in the capital for the mahdis return the iranian press has reported that after his election in the president got his cabinet to sign a secret "pact" with the mahdi and to donate &# million to a mosque shrine to the imam of the age critics at home winced when he declared in a speech that iran should base its policies on the return of the mahdi no wonder many iranians suspect that mr ahmadinejad once belonged to the hojjatiyyeh a secretive religious society dedicated to the cult of the mahdi although this group was disbanded in the s and theres no proof that ahmadinejad ever was a hojjati the majority of ordinary shiites and clerics such as iraqs grand ayatollah ali sistani have embraced a "passive" view of mahdism one that paves the way through prayers and good deeds for instance yet a small but extremist minority have adopted what claremonts mr mavani calls an "activist" attitude popularized by the late ayatollah khomeini this view holds that passivity defeats the purpose of mahdistic expectations to religious ideologues such as mr ahmadinejad and irans ruling clerics believers have a duty to actively work toward the establishment of a just islamic society that will welcome the mahdi while this doctrine runs counter to centuries of quietist shiite teachings theres nothing even in the activist belief system that would compel mr ahmadinejad to hasten armageddon and no evidence that they actually are trying to but the president shouldnt be surprised if his incendiary rhetoric quite possibly exaggerated by him for political effect is leading the world to misread his religion mr farivar is a reporter for dow jones newswires
