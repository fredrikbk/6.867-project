secret signals ex telecom ceo fields black box trial defense qwests nacchio to fight insider trading charge cites classified dealings nearly five years after he left the former telecom highflier qwest communications international inc joseph nacchio is set to go on trial for insider trading the government claims he sold &# million of qwest stock in while knowing that financial woes were mounting at the company he led as chief executive jury selection starts monday in denver federal court but what seemed a straightforward insider trading case now is looking more like a spy saga mr nacchio while acknowledging he sold shares right before the stock plunged in amid poor financial results maintains that he actually was personally upbeat about qwests prospects while he was cashing out his reason he had classified information about big national security related federal contracts that he thought qwest would win these "black book" contracts as theyre known in the industry would have kept its results in line with expectations his lawyers say in pretrial filings there is evidence mr nacchio had access to the highest levels of government to that point court filings show that mr nacchio met in the white house with such high level figures as condoleezza rice and richard clarke in early about telecom related national security issues the defense may bring up the meeting at the trial government lawyers representing four clandestine agencies so secret their names cant be mentioned in court have aggressively fought the release of much of the classified material sought by mr nacchio prosecutors say the whole national security aspect of his defense is a smokescreen with no relevance the stakes are high for mr nacchio a charismatic and brash telecom veteran now years old if convicted on many of the insider trading counts he could conceivably face life in prison legal experts say a maximum of years would be more likely given how judges interpret sentencing guidelines in such cases he also could face forfeiture of nearly &# million the value of the stock sold other legal proceedings against mr nacchio including a securities and exchange commission civil fraud suit against him and six other former qwest executives are on hold until after the trial the nacchio criminal case is among the last of a string of high profile prosecutions of corporate brass brought earlier this decade it comes at a time when theres been a shift in attitudes toward white collar crime since the white house formed a corporate fraud task force in july amid the enron corp and worldcom inc debacles some of the tough tactics used by the justice department have come under criticism in recent months the justice department has reinforced protections for white collar defendants that had been eroded "the qwest investigation started in the whirlwind of the corporate fraud cases " says jacob frenkel a defense lawyer at shulman rogers gandal pordy &amp ecker in rockville md "now the winds are changing " qwest sprang up in the mid s formed by railroad magnate philip anschutz who in put mr nacchio in place as ceo to take the business public qwest soon took over a baby bell u s west and set out to build a fiber optic network to carry internet traffic world wide but many others had the same idea spending billions to string fiber and when demand didnt match their dreams the telecom bubble burst and start ups hit hard times amid their woes they sometimes pumped up revenue by swapping fiber optic capacity and interpreting accounting rules so they could recognize revenue for the capacity they swapped amid exposure of this maneuver and the general telecom slump qwest nearly slipped into bankruptcy court mr nacchio resigned in and the next year qwest restated two years of results eliminating &# billion of revenue for and mr nacchio was indicted in december the u s has had mixed results in prior prosecutions of former qwest executives it has charged six besides mr nacchio with insider trading or accounting related crimes and won plea deals from four but none got prison time those four are cooperating with prosecutors in the nacchio case the two others were acquitted for mr nacchios case everyone from attorneys to the judge to a court reporter has had to get high level security clearance the government has redacted pages of material mr nacchio wants to present some are so heavily censored they look blank before reviewing classified materials mr nacchio and his lawyers must ask the judge for permission a process that has essentially revealed the defenses strategy to prepare and review court filings he and his new jersey based lawyers have repeatedly traveled to washington to review classified information in a sensitive compartmented information facility or scif these facilities are generally steel lined and protected with copper foil and other materials to block transmissions lawyers must check their computers and phones at the door they must draft any legal briefs concerning the classified material on an old government issued laptop and hand them over to a security officer who files the pleading under seal when the prosecution files response papers the defense team has to travel to an assigned scif in washington or another scif in denver to review them its possible all the jostling over classified material could end up amounting to pretrial gamesmanship in the runup to the recent perjury trial of former dick cheney aide i lewis libby the parties fought over the use of classified documents but when the defense didnt put mr libby on the stand the judge curtailed the use of the information mr nacchios lawyers have also raised more traditional defenses their filings say that what he knew about the companys finances when he sold stock wasnt "material" information requiring disclosure to investors the defense also is expected to argue that mr nacchio sold stock for personal reasons having nothing to do with any confidential information he had he and his lawyers are navigating murky legal terrain outlined in the classified information procedures act that federal law lays out procedures for courts and lawyers to follow to access classified files congress enacted it after some government officials had evaded prosecution by threatening to reveal classified information at trial a practice known as "graymail " prosecutors have said in pretrial maneuvering that the national security elements of mr nacchios defense are a red herring in part because qwests revenue from government contracts was too small to offset other problems mr nacchio knew were mounting at the company moreover prosecutors say any classified contracts qwest was working on would have been included in its reports and financial projections under the broad category of government revenue mr nacchios court filings say he couldnt share his optimistic outlook with his underlings because they didnt possess the same security clearances information about whether the contracts ever materialized is elusive court hearings where that information could have surfaced have all been closed mr nacchios state of mind which includes whether he believed the contracts were coming is a crucial component to the insider trading charges the judge has ruled mr nacchio a grandchild of italian immigrants to new york got into telecommunications in with an engineering job at the old american telephone &amp telegraph co he rose to chief engineer and was part of a plan to upgrade at&amp ts national network with fiber optics eventually he became president of the companys consumer unit where he stood out for marketing a popular pricing plan before mr anschutz hired him to lead qwest mr nacchio helped catapult qwest from an unknown private business into a major phone company with the acquisition of u s west as he pitched his plan for a world wide fiber network to investors and potential customers mr nacchio also shopped it around washington mr nacchio did obtain some government contracts for qwest in the late s according to defense filings the filings say mr nacchio discussed qwests business including possible contracts for secret equipment hubs and plans for classified networks in the middle east with key government officials if the government offered qwest contracts along these lines evidence to this effect isnt in the public domain at this point in the first half of the period when mr nacchio was selling tens of millions of dollars of qwest stock he was a member of the presidents national security telecommunications advisory committee a group of technology executives that discussed security matters he had security clearance and the defense maintains that he learned through his membership that the government wanted to shift its classified communications to fiber networks to avert cyber terrorism in march according to the defense mr nacchio met in the white house situation room with ms rice then president bushs national security adviser and mr clarke then chief counterterrorism adviser on the national security council the filing says mr clarke asked if it was possible to create telecom infrastructure for the government that wasnt connected to any public networks according to a defense filing "nacchio responded that not only was it possible but that he had already done it " says the filing which consists of notes of a federal investigators interview with a former qwest manager mr nacchio "went on to describe how he would do it and there was a debate on the subject " according to the notes at the time in early qwests finances were floundering the telecom bubble was bursting and qwest had begun accounting moves for which it later drastically restated income according to federal prosecutors mr nacchio had begun selling stock in january even as another qwest executive warned him about the companys financial problems mr nacchio has said in pretrial filings that he believed those warnings to be wrong because he thought qwest was in line to receive lucrative government contracts that his fellow executives didnt know about in may mr nacchio completed the stock selling that the government labels insider trading two months later at the national security telecommunications advisory committee mr nacchio was officially named vice chairman a year later amid probes of qwests accounting and bleak financial results qwest directors asked for and received his resignation as ceo in his criminal case secret federal agencies have repeatedly objected to handing over material to mr nacchio saying that to do so would cause "exceptionally grave damage " according to the trial judges notations in one filing one clandestine agency argued that giving up the material would create "diplomatic tensions which would adversely affect the nations foreign relations " the filing said last august the defense team was asked to leave a hearing while representatives from one agency and the prosecution discussed the material according to a court transcript during the hearing the federal judge in denver edward nottingham became frustrated with the governments demands for secrecy "im unhappy with this agency very unhappy " said judge nottingham according to the transcript "if it is so important and so top secret and so critical why is it in here why am i even looking at it " he added "thats the trouble with all of these secret proceedings everybody thinks theres a lot there and there really isnt " because of the national security angle the case is being watched closely in some washington circles mr nacchios lawyers roiled government officials last year by alleging that as qwests ceo mr nacchio had refused a government request for access to qwests customer phone records the case is also attracting attention in denver qwests hometown although the company is still operating thousands of employees lost their jobs and pension savings in the aftermath of its sinking fortunes and cratering stock some locals have vilified mr nacchio who even while heading the denver company kept his main residence in new jersey "he came into town on his high horse telling everybody what he was going to do and what happened obviously was the company went down the sewer " says nelson phelps executive director of the association of u s west retirees and a longtime critic of mr nacchio whether mr nacchio will testify is unclear the sec civil complaint describes him as having an "explosive temper" that some legal experts say could hurt him on the witness stand the sec filing in federal court in denver quotes an executive as saying "people were just afraid of the man " friends and former co workers say he was merely an aggressive and extremely driven boss mr nacchio is deeply involved in his own defense poring over documents and offering suggestions to his legal team friends of his say the possibility of losing his liberty has taken a toll on his health they say adding that mr nacchio has sought medical treatment for several stress related health issues a devout catholic he has turned to his faith for solace says a onetime college roommate david miller the trial is scheduled to begin on the feast of st joseph a catholic holiday that has special resonance with italians and for mr nacchio who shares a name with the saint friends say mr nacchio considers this a positive sign
