in breakup ceo of cadbury faces his biggest deal parting of firms candy and drinks businesses may put both in play todd stitzer has spent more than years building up cadbury schweppes plc through a series of acquisitions now the ceo is looking to do his biggest deal yet splitting up the british candy and soda maker shareholders had long pushed for a breakup of cadbury in the belief that its two parts could be worth more separately those parts a candy company and a u s beverage business which includes up and dr pepper have little synergy partly because of their vastly different production and distribution networks yesterday mr stitzer who had long resisted pressure to break up cadbury laid out a breakup plan for the company mr stitzer said in a conference call that he had lately come to favor that option but that he was forced into an early decision by market speculation surrounding u s financier nelson peltzs announcement tuesday that he had bought a stake in cadbury breaking cadbury in two makes both new companies the candy company and the beverage business potential acquisition targets analysts and investment bankers said while any split wouldnt likely happen for months the companys brands could draw the interest of some of the worlds leading food and beverage companies such as hershey co and kraft foods inc as well as private equity bidders the cadbury candy company could also become an acquirer possibly buying another midsize food maker with gbp billion &# billion in total sales cadbury is the worlds largest candy company but it is a distant no in the u s soft drinks market behind coca cola co and pepsico inc the cadbury candy business which includes trident and dentyne gum and cadbury dairy milk chocolate is valued at about gbp billion or about &# billion analysts say the drinks business which also includes snapple iced tea and motts juice is valued at about gbp billion their combined estimated value of about gbp billion substantially exceeds cadburys market capitalization of gbp billion shortly before mr peltz announced his stake mr stitzer in an interview laid out three options for the u s beverage business one is to become a stand alone public company a second scenario cadbury schweppes would float only a minority stake in the drinks business and over time sell the remaining shares or it could sell the business he declined to say which was most likely stating that the board will weigh the options private equity firms have approached cadbury in recent months to ask about the drinks business a person familiar with the matter said cadbury said it will provide additional details of its plans june mr stitzer said yesterday that he changed his thinking about a breakup toward the end of last year when he felt that improvements that management had made to the drinks business such as buying some of the bottlers that make its soda brands had positioned it to compete on its own he said that before mr peltz came on the scene he had planned to present a breakup plan to the board at the end of this month mr peltz has used his hedge fund trian fund management lp to shake up companies most recently by buying stakes in ketchup maker h j heinz co and jeweler tiffany &amp co he was expected to push cadbury management to consider spinning off the drinks brands which derive few benefits from being allied with the candy business yesterday mr peltz said cadburys businesses would be better positioned as separate companies and both could "thrive independently " through a spokeswoman he declined to comment further it isnt clear what mr peltz plans to do with his cadbury stake possibilities include selling it or gathering investors who might be interested in buying the drinks business mr stitzer said mr peltz hasnt made his intentions known cadburys american depositary shares which rose tuesday when mr peltzs stake was made public continued to rise wednesday and yesterday on the prospect that the company could be worth more split up and sold to outside buyers in p m trading on the new york stock exchange the shares were up &# or at &# under the breakup plan mr stitzer will oversee the confectionary business while gil cassagne president and chief executive of the u s beverage business will oversee the drinks side mr stitzer a year old american joined cadbury schweppes north america in as assistant general counsel after spending several years at a mergers and acquisition lawyer in new york later he switched to the beverage business he played an important role in cadburys decision to buy dr pepper and up in in he drove the once sleepy london based company to make an even bigger leap buying a clutch of candy brands from pharmaceutical firm pfizer inc including dentyne bubbaloo and trident for &# billion the move created the only major company that owns gum chocolate and sugar confectionery mr stitzer could still have the chance to pull off additional deals as ceo of the candy company after the breakup he could look to acquire other companies or brands industry executives have long suggested that midsize food companies like cadbury need to consolidate increasingly global retailers are demanding ever greater economies from their suppliers that only companies with big portfolios can provide at the same time some of the middle players are looking readier for deals because they have pared their own portfolios of brands to focus on more desirable products cadbury for example built up its gum products an area that is growing faster than chocolate as consumers try to eat healthier snacks cadbury has also invested in research and development to come up with new features for gum like trident with a hard shell and two flavors later this year when the candy business is expected to be on its own hershey could be a possible buyer or a merger partner analysts and investment bankers said alternatively cadbury could make a friendly bid for hershey they said hershey is weak in europe and emerging markets where cadbury is strong hershey already distributes cadbury brands in the u s however an acquisition would dilute the ownership of the hershey trust that controls the chocolate maker analysts and bankers cited kraft as another potential acquirer kraft recently spun off from former parent altria group inc now has more freedom to pursue an acquisition they said a person familiar with the matter said it was highly unlikely that nestle sa would make a move on cadbury because antitrust regulators would be unlikely to let it keep both its own and cadburys chocolate businesses and it would be too complicated to just keep the gum business coke and pepsi also would be likely to encounter antitrust obstacles to buying the drinks brands analysts and bankers said private equity firms are considered the most likely bidders representatives for hershey kraft coke and pepsico declined to comment
