were in a struggle for our very future in regard to "the weekend interview with ayaan hirsi ali free radical" by joseph rago editorial page march were there more courageous people like ayaan hirsi ali the west might not be in the mess its in today while the left in europe and america continues to call islam a "religion of peace" soiled by a few bad apples ms hirsi ali gives voice to those of us who believe that islam is itself the primary threat to our way of life a dangerous consuming ideology totally inconsistent with both modernity and the fundamental values of democracy as ms hirsi ali shows so clearly it takes courage to see the tenets of islam for what they really are rather than what the multicultural apologists want to believe islams treatment of women is of course instructive in its sanctioning of domestic violence murder and genital mutilations among other heinous acts what kind of religion condones such behavior toward its own believers a religion that sees the end pure submission to allah as more important than the means it employs to achieve them make no mistake ms hirsi ali understands that we are in a struggle for our very future against a growing global movement that will stop nothing short of achieving its true endgame the elimination of the "infidel" from the face of the earth kenneth davenport fort collins colo ms hirsi alis compelling life story reinforces my belief that religious dogma is at the core of much of the worlds misery with absolutely no evidence or proof for the existence of a supreme being or creator historys most brutal tyrants have used their positions of power to design versions of a deity capitalize on a vast human ignorance and become gods themselves lenins declaration that "only when the last king is strangled in the entrails of the last priest will we have freedom" bears some contemporary reconsideration robert morgan emerson anacortes wash unfortunately there seems to be an unholy alliance between the liberal left and fascist islam the liberal breast beating crowd is bending backward to accommodate and minimize the effect of islamic terrorism in the name of western tolerance and political correctness and thereby tightening the noose around their own necks to put the issue in a historical context this is but another phase of the attempt of islam to subdue the entire world for the glory of muhammad and to re establish the caliphate world wide this struggle has been going on since the inception of this religion in the seventh century it has taken different forms and used different methods from outright military conquest to intimidation and now terror murder and beheadings ms hirsi ali has my full admiration for her courage and and eloquence edward ovadia new york see related letter "letters to the editor gut wrenching quote " wsj march
