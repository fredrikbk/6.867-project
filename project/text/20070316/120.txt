weekend journal review theater lives of noisy desperation new york twenty years ago eric bogosian was one of the hottest young guns in american theater a performance artist whose blisteringly intense one man shows were must see events now hes a regular on "law &amp order criminal intent " was he really as good as he seemed back in the days when "drinking in america" and "sex drugs rock &amp roll" were the talk of the town second stages wan revival of "suburbia " mr bogosians play about life among the slackers heightened my retrospective suspicion that he was more a magnetic performer than a convincing writer and so ive been anxiously awaiting the broadway revival of "talk radio " whose original public theater production remains one of my most vivid theatergoing memories now that ive seen it i can report that "talk radio" makes the same impression today that it did in which isnt entirely good news barry champlain liev schreiber the antihero of "talk radio " is the motor mouthed host of wtlks "nighttalk " the most popular late night call in show in cleveland "you call it well talk about it" a sour ex hippie who gulps jack daniels on the air and snorts coke during the news barry loathes his callers and himself not necessarily in that order the action of the play consists of an episode of "nighttalk " interrupted by three monologues in which barrys boss peter hermann operator michael laurence and lover stephanie march tell the audience about their relationships with him at evenings end barry spews forth a frenzied monologue of his own in which he informs his listeners that theyre whats wrong with america "im here to lead you by the hand through the dark forest of your own hatred and anger and humiliation your fear your own lives have become your entertainment " that doesnt sound like much of a play and in truth it isnt the interpolated monologues are an amateurish momentum killing blunder a more experienced playwright would have known to leave barrys backstory untold rather than dumping it in the audiences lap as for barrys long over obvious climactic harangue donald fagen made the same point with witty economy in a single stanza of his song "the nightfly" "so you say theres a race of men in the trees youre for tough legislation thanks for calling i wait all night for calls like these " what works in "talk radio" are barrys contemptuous exchanges with his desperate callers all of which are portrayed with the cruel brilliance i remember so well from mr bogosians one man shows mr schreiber who proved himself a master of vituperation in the revival of "glengarry glen ross " is no less potent as barry champlain though his performance is a good deal slicker than the rough edged but totally believable one given in by mr bogosian who seemed to be an inch or two away from committing suicide right before your eyes robert fallss staging is good but not great partly because the proscenium arch of the longacre theatre is too high to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of a radio studio and partly because nobody else in the cast is as good as mr schreiber ms march is downright forgettable the six offstage actors who play barrys unseen callers turn them into overly broad caricatures which i suspect is mr fallss fault as is the fact that mr schreiber pulls off his headphones more than once while talking to them on the air had he done that in real life he wouldnt have been able to hear what they were saying part of what propelled the production of "talk radio" was the sheer novelty of its subject matter the medium itself had been around for years but it was strictly a local phenomenon rush limbaugh didnt go national until the following year and mr bogosian was well ahead of the curve today "talk radio" is a period piece as is the clunky film oliver stone made out of it in but it remains a solid vehicle for a charismatic actor and mr schreiber fills the bill august wilson was a major playwright who went off the rails somewhere in between "fences " which won the pulitzer prize in and "gem of the ocean " his next to last play whose broadway premiere was a high minded snoozefest now that ive seen the signature theatre companys revival of "king hedley ii " first performed in i understand more clearly what went wrong with wilsons "pittsburgh cycle" of plays about the black experience in th century america he stopped showing and started telling if you were to chop all the get the point speechmaking and bloviatingly self indulgent prose poetry out of "king hedley ii " itd be a half hour shorter and twice as good "king hedley ii" is the last of the three plays in the signatures current all wilson season and this production directed by derrick sanders is comparable in quality to the exceptionally fine stagings of "seven guitars" and "two trains running" that preceded it all six actors are outstanding but stephen mckinley henderson who also appeared in "seven guitars" and played stool pigeon in the broadway production of "king hedley ii " outdoes himself as elmore giving a performance so concentrated and exact that i can still hear him delivering the monologue in which he tells what it feels like to kill a man "the bottom had fallen out of everything everything i had ever done in my life seemed small " for all the myriad flaws of "king hedley ii " its worth seeing just to hear mr henderson give that speech not coincidentally "radio golf " the th and final installment in the pittsburgh cycle is finally set to open on broadway in may two years after it started making the regional theater rounds i look forward to seeing whether wilson who died seven months after its yale rep premiere managed to pull out of his career closing slump mr teachout the journals drama critic
