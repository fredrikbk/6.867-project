the afternoon report ghosn away online edition nissan and renault chief carlos ghosn had once been cast as savior to detroits ailing auto giants but the japanese auto makers struggles suggest that some of the big threes rust has rubbed off on the man with the midas touch nissan announced that mr ghosn would be relinquishing his post as chief of the auto makers north american operations as part of a wider management shake up that will also see chief operating officer toshiyuki shiga focus solely on the japanese auto makers ailing domestic business the brazilian born mr ghosn who is also the chairman and chief executive of french auto maker renault ascended to celebrity status in the auto industry by salvaging nissan the company had piled up billions in debt and was making money on only a handful of models by the late s but soon after he took the reins in mr ghosn had returned the auto maker to profitability and was hailed as a turnaround whiz ever since management changes had been foreshadowed last month however as nissan reported a earnings dip and ratcheted down its annual outlook due to weak sales in north america and japan some investors complained that mr ghosn had spread himself too thin and he promised to "introduce new energy into the management " nissan denied that the changes were made in response to the criticism that mr ghosn was overextended the company stressed that he will still be in charge at both nissan and renault and is now also taking on oversight of the companys treasury functions a chore that makes him nissans de facto finance chief nonetheless that the auto sectors biggest star despite his considerable energy has handed off north american responsibilities suggests just how arduous that huge but tough auto market has become just months ago billionaire kirk kerkorian attempted to bludgeon general motors into a union with nissan and renault hoping that some of the old ghosn magic might help rescue the detroit giant but the alliance talks eventually crumpled and so far as the shareholders of all three auto makers are concerned that might have been just as well if piloting nissan through treacherous north american straits and pulling renault up by its bootstraps has proven a stout order for mr ghosn its not hard to imagine how winded he might have become after adding gms massive restructuring to his to do list all those changes at nissan will keep business card printers in tokyo busy for a while but just what the managers themselves will be up to remained unclear the company was tight lipped about what its redeployed executives would be doing to enhance the companys recently quite weak performance similar to its rivals in detroit nissan placed major bets on large pickup trucks and suvs in recent years but its u s sales dropped in the nine months ending in december with fuel prices rising again its quite unlikely that a new wave of demand for trucks will soon materialize that may mean that nissan will be forced to realign priorities in much the same way that the big three are though with less drama since the auto maker doesnt face the same long term structural issues such as health and pension
