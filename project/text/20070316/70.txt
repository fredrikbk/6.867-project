now let me tell you about real tax relief your feb editorial "irs to the rescue" is way off base first its completely wrong to say the internal revenue service "strikes a blow" against the recent changes to the tax subsidy for u s citizens who work abroad and for employers who send employees to work overseas the irs wouldnt be able to provide relief for high housing cost locations in the absence of congressional direction to do so congress recognized the issue and gave the irs the authority to do exactly what its doing second its incorrect to claim that it is my "grand idea" to tax u s citizens who live abroad the united states has taxed its citizens regardless of where they live since the income tax began in the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of this taxation in im a senior member of congress but not that senior third even with the new provisions americans working abroad still receive very generous tax treatment compared with americans working in the u s those working here in the u s are not allowed to exclude any compensation or deduct any personal housing costs the changes came at the recommendation of the nonpartisan staff of the joint committee on taxation in its report on ways to improve tax compliance and expenditures congress took that recommendation and improved it by giving the irs the authority to make adjustments for varying housing costs around the world these changes helped congress extend lower tax rates for capital gains and dividends and provide relief from the alternative minimum tax for million taxpayers thats a true rescue sen chuck grassley r iowa ranking member committee on finance washington
