starr chamber eliot spitzer has moved to greener pastures if thats what you call albany but there are still a few messes to clean up from the new york governors stint as attorney general such as the truth about some of his prosecutorial targets one of those is maurice "hank" greenberg whom mr spitzer drove from his job as head of aig while branding him a criminal one of his smears accused mr greenberg of bilking the starr foundation a new york charity a report released this month by an independent committee exonerates mr greenberg of that charge even as new facts have emerged about mr spitzers nasty prosecutorial methods recall that mr spitzer revealed his starr accusations in december after a year in which mr greenberg had insisted on fighting the unrelated aig charges rather than accept a settlement mr spitzers starr "report" claimed that mr greenberg had benefited from "self dealing" in handling the estate of cornelius vander starr aigs founder the accusations dealt with year old transactions that every relevant authority had approved at the time including the then attorney general the irs and a new york state court mr spitzer filed no official charges he simply dumped his smears on the media which gave them prominent play we now know this was merely one more hardball attempt to bludgeon mr greenberg into settling the unrelated aig charges sources who were part of the discussions at the time now say that mr spitzer made clear that unless mr greenberg admitted guilt in the aig case and personally wrote a check for north of &# million the ag would go public with the starr allegations mr greenberg refused and the starr smear was released a spokesman for mr spitzer says "we categorically deny that mr spitzer attempted to blackmail mr greenberg or his legal team into a settlement " well let our readers decide whom they believe for its part the starr foundation board asked a three person committee including two former judges not affiliated with the foundation to evaluate mr spitzers charges its page report released earlier this month concludes that "the allegations against mr greenberg and other executors are unfounded " in fact thanks to the starr foundations investment in aig stock its assets have grown to more than &# billion today from &# million in this report and other legal fees cost starr &# million which is more than the philanthropys annual administrative expenses and millions less than it spends on grants to improve new york city few of our readers will be surprised to learn that the committees exoneration of mr greenberg received far less publicity than the original accusations mr greenberg is fortunate in that he is wealthy enough to defend himself and is also at the point in his life when he has little to lose from fighting a legal case to restore his reputation many of mr spitzers other targets werent so lucky and had no choice but to settle or risk ruin mr spitzer and his former gang of bully boys in the ags office owe mr greenberg and the starr foundation an apology
