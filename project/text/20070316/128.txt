weekend journal the home front the museum next door for arts sake owners redo barns add wings ovitzs floating walls richard gluckman designed the museum of contemporary art san diego and the deutsche guggenheim in berlin so the architect wasnt surprised when he was recently commissioned to create a new home for works by julian schnabel jeff koons and jean michel basquiat what was unusual was the venue a backyard barn after the square foot structure is transformed at a cost of more than &# million it will serve as a private gallery for newsprint manufacturing executive peter brant and his wife former model stephanie seymour the space on the couples acre property in greenwich conn will house parts of their extensive collection including an installation by mike kelley nine "planets" made of stuffed animals clustered into balls and hung from the ceiling that they recently bought for &# million mr brant says he commissioned the renovation of the early th century stone barn after admiring mr gluckmans design for the gagosian gallery in manhattans chelsea neighborhood the soaring art market is creating a new architectural niche private collectors are hiring brand name museum and gallery architects to design homes to showcase their outsize damien hirst sculptures and matthew barney installations the projects run the gamut from revamping existing spaces to building new residences from the ground up and can include all of the trappings of professional grade museums soaring ceilings high tech temperature and humidity controls and state of the art lighting systems the spike in these "art houses" comes as auction houses reported record sales last year and galleries across the country say buyer waiting lists are growing it also dovetails with a museum building boom in recent years including projects by star architects that have attracted media coverage as well as the attention of high end collectors indeed several of the recent commissions have come from museum board members and wealthy patrons while these aficionados say their aim is to create dynamic environments for their collections some people wonder if that will translate into fewer important works being accessible to the public mr brant says he decided to create his own gallery because pieces he and his wife had given to large museums werent being displayed "id donate artworks and never see them on the walls " he says "its frustrating " the renovated barn will include two exhibition spaces and a pound capacity freight elevator to handle large scale works when the project is completed early next year mr brant says he and his wife plan to invite friends art patrons and curators to view the collection thirty to works will be displayed at a time he says and changed every nine months architect mr gluckman says his manhattan based firms residential commissions rose by a third last year compared with a year earlier with new homes completed for collectors in texas florida and new york miami architect rene gonzalez designer of the wolfsonian museum in miami beach and interiors at the miami art museum had eight residential commissions from private collectors last year up from one or two in previous years los angeles architect michael maltzan created the temporary outpost of the museum of modern art in queens and the redesign of the hammer museum on the campus of ucla his latest project the beverly hills home of former movie agent michael ovitz ovitzs rauschenbergs mr ovitz and his wife judy have been collecting modern and contemporary art since the s and now have "several hundred" works including pieces by ellsworth kelly jasper johns and robert rauschenberg as well as african antiquities and ming dynasty furniture the couple decided more than four years ago to build a new house and chose mr maltzan to take on the challenge of combining an art collection with residential design "a common disease of collectors is to try and hang your entire collection " mr ovitz says "we wanted to strike a delicate balance " mr maltzan designed a square foot modernist structure clad in glass and perforated metal due to be completed early next year to avoid an institutional feel he hid commercial grade lighting fixtures used to spotlight artworks in cuts or slots in the ceiling similarly he installed "floating" walls large slabs suspended from the ceiling and anchored to the floor with thin metal rods in the master bedroom and living rooms the walls which open up the spaces and let light flow through are outfitted with reinforced plywood studs to secure heavier art pieces and allow art to be hung anywhere on the plane mr ovitz declined to say how much the project cost for a marthas vineyard vacation home commissioned by a chicago collector seattle architect rick sundberg also used techniques typically reserved for museums to minimize direct sunlight mr sundberg set inch deep niches into some of the walls to hold large scale photographs some of them up to feet tall and installed commercial grade windows with heat sensitive shades that automatically raise and lower to block out ultraviolet glare in addition he put in &# worth of heating cooling and humidifying systems to maintain a "tight range of temperatures" so that works arent damaged mr sundbergs firm olson sundberg kundig allen architects has also seen an increase in the number of commissions from private collectors in the past months after designing museums in seattle and tacoma wash miami real estate developer and art patron craig robins says he considered expanding his square foot home to accommodate more of his piece collection which includes works by richard tuttle joseph beuys and john baldessari ultimately though he decided against it "i tend not to load things up " says mr robins who has about paintings and sculptures displayed in his mediterranean style house "it can be a bit overwhelming inside a home and actually serve to weaken the strength of some pieces of art " coffee and gouache while architects in general may charge a lump sum for a design or bill by the hour museum specialists like other top designers typically collect a to commission on the total cost of a residential project they usually handle other elements of the design as well from interiors to landscaping and review a clients collection early on in the process recommending where pieces should be installed in some cases they even serve as art consultants tom green a former general counsel at dell says he tapped mr gluckman to design his square foot austin texas home after seeing the architects plans for the austin museum of art mr gluckman worked out floor plans and schematic designs for the &# million plus tri level residence which was completed last year he also recommended several art purchases that would fit well with the design of the house including paintings by brazilian artist tunga and a large canvas of silver and gold painted wood panels by american painter charles mary kubrichta one of the most ambitious works a by foot black gouache mural by scottish artist richard wright that was commissioned for the home he traveled to austin to install it in a stairwell specially designed for it that runs from the houses lower level to the main foyer the artist "spent weeks here working on it " mr green says "id make him coffee in the morning and hed have lunch with the building contractors " frick goes public interest in these gallery like homes comes amid a booming market for contemporary art after climbing steadily for nearly three years it ballooned in as prices soared and museums and galleries expanded christies says it sold a record &# billion worth of art in up from a year earlier sothebys says it brought in a record &# billion at auction last year and more collectors are creating private museums to show off their extensive holdings mera and donald rubell in miami for example and billionaire industrialist mitchell p rales in potomac md creighton gilbert an art history professor at yale university says some in the institutional art world have expressed concern that as a result many important works will remain hidden from the public view but prof gilbert says history suggests otherwise and cites private collections that ultimately became public such as the frick in new york city says charlie wylie a curator of contemporary art at the dallas museum of art "when people go through this degree of effort and financial outlay for their collections its not something they want to hide away " he points to philanthropists and art patrons howard and cindy rachofsky the couple commissioned richard meier to design their dallas home in the late s to show off their art collection which included significant works by donald judd bruce nauman and sigmar polke two years ago the rachofskys donated the entire collection house included to the dma the square foot residence is currently being used for tours and educational events artful designs
