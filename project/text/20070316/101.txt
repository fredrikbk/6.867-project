the joys of workaholism i recently had a bout of workaholism lets call it an episode i binged on work for about four months and while im not yet ready to attend a step wa meeting i am concerned about how easily i fell into a workaholic trance it was a delicious mix of adrenaline caffeine self importance and a heady rush of focus gone was the indecision suddenly i was a verb and not one passively constructed i was all action it was invigorating to be riveted to a single purpose like a rock climber without ropes according to a recent gallup poll of americans consider themselves workaholics while im not a slacker if i had to choose between slacker and workaholic on a survey id go with slacker let me explain although i am a writer and creative director at an advertising agency i have managed to avoid working more than a couple of weekends in the last years i cook dinner for my family three or four times a week i rarely miss one of my kids lacrosse or baseball games i play basketball squash and poker regularly and i write pieces like this usually two or three per month for newspapers and magazines at least i did until i succumbed to workaholism a few months ago i have always looked down on people who are addicted to work as a group they dont admit to being happy they tend to look a little pasty they always say they wish they had more time for their families a sentiment of americans expressed in a recent survey but theyve never seemed wholly convincing to me in their unhappiness and now i know their secret theyre not unhappy at all theyve discovered a way to reduce one of the most stressful aspects of modern life having to make a seemingly unlimited number of choices barry schwartz a social scientist at swarthmore makes the case in his book "the paradox of choice" that unlimited choice produces genuine suffering the more choices we have to make the less certainty we seem to have when we have kinds of cookies to choose from in the grocery store how can we be sure weve picked the right one and thats just cookies when faced with seemingly unlimited choices that have significant consequences like which stocks to invest in which career to pursue or even which person to marry many people become what professor schwartz calls "maximizers" people who relentlessly search for the best option these people spend a great deal of time and energy on choices that will never satisfy them workaholics are choosing to spend less time making choices by choosing to work so much and let me tell you its quite a relief during my work binge i avoided considering hundreds of choices each day for example in my normal semi slacker state i start each day reading the paper and trying to find a subject to write about the choices are almost limitless and i spend many mornings in a miserable state of ambivalent non decision but as a workaholic its easy i immediately know what to write the ad thats due tomorrow a video script a presentation work does me a favor by choosing for me as a binge worker i was too busy to cook dinner most nights so my wife would buy prepared food thus saving me the agony of hundred choices romaine or arugula organic or regular beef chicken or pork what about lamb chops or ground pasta or rice and then basmati or jasmine my wife also took over the social calendar deciding what movie to go to can take me most of a saturday but fortunately in my new life as an important person i had to work on saturday and when i got home my wife had already chosen the movie prior to becoming a work junkie i had planned to buy an ipod an act which leads to an almost infinite number of decisions including figuring out what music i actually like i dodged that bullet remaining ipodless i also put off making a will and changing the allocations on my k during my four month work orgy being too busy to read i was freed from the heart rending decision of choosing which book to spend the next month with in fact now that my life is returning to balance i find myself getting anxious questions big and small abound whats for dinner whats the purpose of my life thank god i have to get back to work mr sollisch is a creative director at an ad agency in cleveland
