weekend journal bookmarks in the country of men by hisham matar dial press pages &# libyas decision in late to dismantle its nuclear weapons program was the first hopeful announcement to come out that country in about years before then and alas since libya has often played the international oddity thanks to its self appointed "guide " moammar gadhafi whose ludicrous pensees and poncherello sunglasses can make him seem at times more buffoon than danger occasionally his genuine danger posed by libya flashes beyond libyas borders as with the murderous bombing of pan am flight over lockerbie scotland in but to the libyan people who live under the constant threat of mr gadhafis regime he has created a nation of fear hisham matar depicts this terrified climate in his semi autobiographical debut novel "in the country of men " at the age of in when mr gadhafi had been in power for a decade mr matar fled libya to safety abroad and has returned home only through the writing of this book the novel tells the story of suleiman a young boy whose parents exile him to safety in what amounts to a libyan kindertransport after the mokhabarat mr gadhafis secret police tortured his father and executed a neighbor "in the country of men" is a poetic and powerful account of the days of dread that suleiman and his mother endure while pockmarked government agents stalk their small family in ever tightening circles in scenes reminiscent of the universal literature of political oppression we meet underground sympathizers well connected neighborhood collaborators and dignified citizens who are ground into quivering submission but far from marching predictably across the page mr matars characters display the complicated particularity of libyas islamic bedouin culture mr matar narrates the tale through year old eyes and refuses to flinch from suleimans own betrayals and cruelty the fit of petty spite in which he divulges evidence of his fathers dissidence to the police the reckless insouciance with which he tosses a rock at a friend with hemophilia only in an epilogue do we learn of suleimans ultimate escape to egypt and safety the atmospheric reality of mr matars portrait speaks to me with particular intensity though born in ireland i grew up in libya during the period described by mr matar my father worked in the oil business and my family lived in marsa el brega a wellhead on the coastal road from tripoli to eastern libya we stayed there until two years after mr matars own departure from libya the reason for my evacuation the gulf of sidra incident in which two u s fighter jets shot down a pair of libyan ones was more a matter of international relations than political dissidence and my familys expatriate life was vastly different from the matar familys experiences as subjects of the state nevertheless i found mr matars prose resonant with the details of a libyan childhood he writes of oppressive "heat and the brightness" that all of us dodged with daily siestas the ubiquitous loudspeakers with the call to prayer grown ups illicit swilling of alcohol suleimans mother buys hers under the counter from her baker while my father distilled his own the havoc of the pitiless sahara desert on car tires and paint jobs neither mr matar nor i have returned to libya in the quarter century since our hurried departures but whatever homecomings might lie ahead i suspect that mr matars moving portrait of a libyan childhood may offer the most vivid glimpse i will ever have of my own william birdthistle
