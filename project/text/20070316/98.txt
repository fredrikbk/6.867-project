swiss gift household carry trade low rates set scenario like the one for the yen home buyers rush in frankfurt historically switzerlands currency has been the strong silent type the tiny nations steady economy and peaceful geopolitics have long lured investors to the swiss franc in times of global economic turmoil lately the swiss franc has started behaving more like the japanese yen a darling of currency speculators who use it to fund risky investments across the globe the reason switzerlands extremely low interest rates of currency traders are borrowing massive amounts of swiss francs and then investing that money in countries like iceland where the money earns higher interest rates of a maneuver known as the carry trade switzerlands low interest rates are also luring individual home buyers across eastern europe and as far away as greece to take out swiss franc denominated mortgages swiss national bank officials have been worrying out loud about carry trades lately if interest rates and investor sentiment change these often complex carry trades could sour quickly and roil the economy of switzerland and perhaps elsewhere last year when japan indicated it might raise its super low rates the announcement rattled global markets as traders tried to adjust their strategies yesterday the snb raised its base interest rate by a quarter point to the snb targets a range for the three month franc london interbank offered rate and aims for the midpoint of the range now to low borrowing costs still swiss borrowing costs remain the second lowest in the industrialized world after japans rate the low swiss interest rates according to the bank are still stoking growth in the domestic economy where annual inflation in february was zero but the carry trade raises concerns that local inflation could start galloping higher that is because one byproduct of the carry trade is to weaken the swiss franc compared with other currencies a weaker currency means swiss companies and consumers must shell out more francs for imported goods the carry trade weakens the swiss currency because essentially speculators are selling it in order to buy say icelandic kronur all that selling pushes down the francs value indeed despite a strong swiss economy the franc is hovering near eight year lows against the euro it has also fallen nearly against the dollar since putting the value of one swiss franc at about cents a weak franc is good news for swiss exporters because it makes their products more affordable to buyers in other countries there are also concerns that the currency speculation could destabilize economies in eastern europe where the sale of franc denominated mortgages is booming the risk is that any rise in the value of the franc would increase the debt burdens and mortgage payments for people whose earnings are in say the hungarian currency the forint "weve tried to say dont assume its always going to be this way " says philipp hildebrand a member of the swiss central banks board of the low rates and benign market conditions underpinning the carry trades popularity in addition swiss franc loans often offer floating interest rates which means debt burdens will spike if swiss interest rates do mr hildebrand noted that the franc recently bounced back a bit against major currencies a small warning of what can happen if worried global investors continue unwinding their currency bets market estimates of the yen carry trade typically start around &# billion and increase from there though experts say the franc trade is smaller in part because swiss interest rates are higher few doubt that hedge funds and currency traders could lose billions of dollars if the yen or swiss franc suddenly rose in value pain of franc spike a spike in the franc also could break many ordinary borrowers backs with interest rates in the euro zone and many eastern european countries outpacing switzerlands banks outside the country increasingly offer loans in swiss francs "its like a carry trade for the household " says michael saunders a citigroup economist in london he warns that typical carry trade investors are steeped in the complexities of currency risk and far more likely to protect themselves when engaging in currency bets than ordinary borrowers according to the bank for international settlements which collects data from central banks the value of swiss loans granted to companies or individuals outside switzerland rose to &# billion in the third quarter last year from &# billion in the same period of economists suspect much of that increase was accounted for by these so called household carry trades austrians who have been borrowing in swiss franc since the mid s held billion euros &# billion of foreign currency loans last december several banks in greece started offering swiss franc mortgages last fall both austria and greece belong to the euro zone where interest rates hit last week and are likely to rise to at least this year eastern europeans with historically volatile currencies have also recently embraced the franc hungarian households held about billion euros of swiss franc debt last december a jump of from much as switzerlands central bankers might like to raise interest rates further to make the carry trade less attractive they are limited in what they can do the bank targets a medium term inflation rate of and inflation is at zero the banks most recent forecasts released yesterday show inflation nearing the target again in and markets expect another rate increase to at the banks meeting in june but with interest rates in many major economies high or rising as well the swiss franc looks unlikely to lose its allure for foreign borrowers anytime soon dollar rises against yen in bumpy but tight trade meanwhile in new york trading the dollar was higher against the yen in a bumpy but range bound session that shadowed u s equities and paid little attention to a spate of mixed second tier data investors nervous over u s subprime mortgage weakness and the u s economy in general failed to make any big moves "there was limited participation as the choppy moves of the last couple days discouraged people from being overactive in currencies " said sophia drossos currency strategist at morgan stanley late in new york the dollar was changing hands at yen versus
