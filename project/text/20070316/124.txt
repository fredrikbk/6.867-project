weekend journal taste huffing and puffing on monday a coalition of clean lung groups confidently announced that the next day hollywood would agree to get tougher on smoking in movies notably by slapping an r rating on any film that showed anyone using tobacco in any form unlike most movies though this story delivered a third act twist the mpaa stood fast on the issue causing the smokeless screens crowd to mutter of perfidy and vow to redouble its efforts acting much like lex luthor being led off to prison expect a sequel as a film critic id be happier if the studios banned comedians in fat suits is smoking the most dangerous activity on display at the manyplex in the past few months major studio movies about teens and young adults have demonstrated such pastimes as racing sports cars down a winding mountain road by "drifting" with tires perpendicular to the direction of the car "the fast and the furious tokyo drift" holding up convenience stores at gunpoint "freedom writers" and being locked upside down in glass tanks full of water "the prestige" none of these films was rated r other recent pg films have shown us children drinking wine "a good year" sleeping in the bathroom of a mass transit station "the pursuit of happyness" and marrying into a strange family of doomed frenchmen "marie antoinette" shouldnt teens be fenced off from the temptations posed by these horrors too thats only the tip of the marlboro though if every piece of filmed entertainment featuring tobacco usage is to be slapped with an r the ratings board might want to borrow a trick from the kids and call in a few pizzas and some kegs of red bull theyll have to either airbrush or give the scarlet r letter to the entire marx brothers oeuvre and the bob hope and bing crosby pictures also out will be "meet me in st louis " "lady and the tramp " "e t " bugs bunny cartoons "the parent trap " "chariots of fire " "superman " "the chronicles of narnia " "elf" and the world series which should be banned for its tediousness not its players incessant tobacco chewing christmas wont be the same without you frosty unless you replace your corn cob pipe with a stick of dentyne and some grinch had better get to work ridding every childrens library of its copy of "a visit from st nicholas" "the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath " do films about real people count if so i guess well all benefit by seeing less documentary footage of puffers fidel castro josef stalin and sean penn but it looks like our kids will soon be learning even less about good nicotine lovers like macarthur churchill and fdr what about movies where smoking is given negative associations cruella de vil is despicable in " dalmatians " so should we prevent kids from witnessing her cigarette holder wielding deviltry or instead applaud the film as useful propaganda for our clean lunged crusade what should we do about "the aviator " a pg movie in which alec baldwin who played the quiet but dastardly rival to hero howard hughes tormented the anguished tycoon while puffing away contentedly on a pipe besides what is the point of banning smoking from kids movies when its all over kids tv in "the simpsons " the most prominent smokers are krusty the self hating clown and the scheming harridans patty and selma bouvier does showing smoking for satiric purposes count for anything on the other hand if they were starved of moving pictures kids might be forced to do something drastic such as read yet so much smoking goes on in "huckleberry finn" and "the catcher in the rye" that there should be ample reason to ban them all over again you can go ahead and pulp every high school copy of "great expectations " "war and peace" and "a separate peace " too oh and cancel that field trip to see "the iceman cometh " with all of its talk about "pipe dreams " unless kids have changed a great deal since i was when my friends and i used the hbo guide as a road map to the films that promised maximum gore and gonads an r rating is not actually going to stop many kids from seeing a film its just going to make it that much more delectably forbidden anyway dont we want our teens to start absorbing some life lessons more complex than the ones offered by "shrek " should we stop a year old from learning about the importance of tolerance toward gays in the r rated "brokeback mountain" just because according to scenesmoking org a site which obsessively logs tobacco usage in movies the movies characters turn to tobacco more than times and isnt brokebacks unsafe sex a more dangerous example than the smoking unofficially of course the anti smokers have already won despite their warnings that cigarettes are everywhere in the movies smoking on screen today is largely the habit of jerks losers and fringe characters the james bond franchise went smoke free last fall with "casino royale " the film version of christopher buckleys satire of tobacco lobbyists "thank you for smoking " might as well have arrived wrapped in one of those motel sashes that reads "sanitized for your protection " although the film was praised for its supposedly devilish political incorrectness no one in it is ever seen smoking the problem with those who like to ban things is that their mission of human improvement can never be complete take ko ko the lord high executioner in "the mikado " whose "little list" starts out with "society offenders" but hurries on to include "the people who eat peppermint and puff it in your face " "the lady from the provinces who dresses like a guy" and even "all funny fellows comic men and clowns of private life " theyd none of em be missed new yorkers have a ko ko for our time in mayor mike bloomberg whose comprehensive smoking ban was just the overture for more bans starting with the forthcoming one on trans fats which come to think of it could easily be picked up by the movies so long "nacho libre " mr smith is a film critic for the new york post he has never smoked a cigarette
