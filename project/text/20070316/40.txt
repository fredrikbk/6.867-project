face the music hip hop makes the hall of fame samples are part of a self conscious genre but sense of history isnt unique to rappers online edition the first time i heard grandmaster flash and the furious five i think i was riding on a bus with the members of my high school cross country team when our squad won we would typically celebrate with good music and bad dancing this was around rap was new to most people but it was already familiar to many of us i memorized the lyrics to grandmaster flash and the furious fives "the message" soon after i heard it years later i dont remember much about whom we beat or how much we beat them by but i can still feel the beat of that boombox at the back of the bus blaring out our victory songs earlier this week grandmaster flash and the furious five became the first rap act inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame and museum they were part of a class of inductees that included alternative music godfathers rem and rockers van halen the old school rappers are now enshrined alongside such hall of famers as the beatles jimi hendrix and buddy holly "every break dancer every graffiti artist every mc every deejay were here " grandmaster flash shouted from the podium as he was inducted for hip hop it was a long trip from the mean streets to the halls of glory the induction of grandmaster flash and the furious five is a noteworthy moment in the history of a genre thats always been conscious of its own history and heritage part of raps foundation is sampling the art of taking snatches of oft recognizable songs and using those bits to construct a new musical piece some rap songs now sample the rap songs of yesterday puff daddy who now goes by diddy drew from "the message" for his hit song "cant nobody hold me down " and many of todays rappers such as nas pay tribute to the rappers of the past in their lyrics from one point of view hip hop is nostalgia set to a beat rap was initially seen by many as a passing fad a symptom of the streets a flashy phenomenon that lacked deep meaning and strong roots now decades after the form was first popularized in the s it has found a featured place in the musical establishment seemingly as all american as apple pie or rock and roll "thirty years later rappers have become rock stars movie stars leaders educators philanthropists even ceos " rapper mogul jay z said in an induction speech for grandmaster flash and the furious five "but none of this would be possible without the work of the men i have the honor of inducting into the rock and roll hall of fame tonight " it often takes decades for a new musical form to gain mainstream respect and recognition in the u s the blues ragtime gospel and rock all had their early critics and some of these genres still have opponents today in the case of rap many of the commonly held assumptions about it are wrong and the career of grandmaster flash and the furious five is a perfect vehicle to examine some of those inaccuracies one reason rappers often pay tribute to their own history is because especially at the beginning nobody else was its a practice that started back when the old school was young and has continued on through today of course shout outs name dropping and glorifying the past goes on in other genres as well as these examples from bob dylan david bowie and stevie wonder show these sorts of songs are part of the reason the rock and roll hall of fame exists it seems that all musical forms with roots in the blues from rock to rap feel a need to justify their worth by honoring their greats perhaps its because so many of those founding blues performers like memphis minnie son house and bessie smith never got the fame and fortune their talents might have merited whatever the reason many musicians long to be respected and understood rappers are still explaining themselves and their chosen medium against an onslaught of misconceptions rap is often seen incorrectly as a purely american art form its true that it was nurtured in the bronx in the s and intimately connected with a whole new culture of break dancing and street art the music drew from the ache of the blues the soul of r&amp b and the bravado of rock and roll at its heart was a radical idea you didnt have to be a musician to make music songs could be composed of bits of other songs lyrics could be spoken without being sung and all one needed to be a star was two turntables and microphone as jay z put it in his induction speech "what les paul and chuck berry did for the electric guitar flash did for the turntable " thats the most commonly told story of hip hops birth and the bronx and new york city certainly played a major role but raps roots were actually broader than the five boroughs the form has international roots as well specifically in the caribbean a few years ago when i was working on a book about jamaican music "before the legend the rise of bob marley " i was struck by how many rap stars originally hailed from the caribbean for example grandmaster flash joseph saddler was born in barbados and moved to the u s when he was young some of the other founding fathers of the form also had island ancestry dj kool herc considered the godfather of rap was raised in jamaica before moving to the bronx last time i saw him a few years ago he was sporting marley style dreadlocks the notorious b i g s mother is from jamaica and the jamaican art of "toasting" or speaking and rhyming over recorded music is seen by many as a precursor to hip hop run d m c once paid tribute to raps caribbean connections in their song "roots rap reggae " violence is something else that some critics commonly associate with rap and clearly its the lyrical focus of more than a few gangsta rappers but some of the pioneers of rap like run d m c built their careers on songs that rejected violence rather than glorifying it grandmaster flash and the furious fives "the message" had a message violence is a dead end and the groups song "white lines dont do it " made clear in its parenthetical title that it was an anthem against drugs rap is a self conscious art form many of the performers in the field are very aware of their images and the state of the industry rappers often beat up on their own genre criticizing it for being too meek or too extreme too commercial or not commercial enough and numerous rap acts it seems have declared the form dead but despite what you might think thats far from unique to rap every indie rock star with a hit album must face cries of "sellout " and rockers when the form was a bit younger also railed against the dying of the light perhaps the greatest misconception about hip hop is that its an exclusively urban phenomenon almost from the start rap had fans in the suburbs i grew up in brockport a small college town in upstate new york and i can testify that many years before they were recognized by the hall of fame a school bus full of suburban kids had already placed grandmaster flash and the furious five in their own personal music pantheon our bus never traveled that fast but it took the rock establishment a few decades to catch
