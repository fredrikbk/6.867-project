navy raises conditions on lockheed contract the government is tightening the screws on defense contractors in an attempt to contain weapons costs and blunt criticism from an increasingly vocal congress the navy yesterday took an unusual step in demanding that lockheed martin corp accept greater financial risk if the company wants to continue developing a new type of warship after the initial vessels cost rose to &# million from a target of &# million on wednesday the coast guard yanked the management of a &# million cutter program from a joint venture between lockheed and northrop grumman corp and toughened the financial terms for shipbuilders who may compete for the new contract in both cases the government wants to shift the financial risk of developing the weapons to contractors and away from the taxpayer by using fixed price contracts normally u s weapons research and development work is performed on a cost plus basis where the government reimburses costs even if they rise and guarantees a contractor turns a profit if it meets certain performance goals cost growth prompted the navy in january to halt work on one of two lockheed built warships known as the littoral combat ship navy secretary donald winter said yesterday that lockheed can resume work if it agrees to "revised contract terms that rebalance the risk of cost growth between the government and industry " if the navy and lockheed cant come to terms by mid april the navy will terminate the companys contract for the ship mr winter said the month long window to renegotiate the complex contract is unusually short he warned general dynamics corp will face the same contract revisions if the cost of its version of the littoral combat ship rises lockheed and general dynamics are developing different designs in hopes of winning a navy competition to build of the small warships which will be deployed in shallow waters close to enemy shores lockheed spokesman craig quigley said "we have agreed to enter into discussions with the customer to better understand their proposal and to identify a solution that best meets the interests of all parties " general dynamics spokesman kendall pease said "we will continue to provide the most affordable capable ships to the navy " a move to fixed priced development contracts is risky in itself because the pentagon often adds requirements as weapons systems are being created and that raises costs
