weekend journal a toast to memories you tasted the family winerys last bottle shared a six liter bordeaux grilled steak in russias wilds readers tell dorothy j gaiter and john brecher their tales from open that bottle night michaela rodeno is the widely respected chief executive of st supery winery in napa valley and a leader of her industry but rarely have the industrys history and traditions been celebrated quite as they were saturday feb ms rodeno her lawyer husband gregory and a large group of friends opened a virtual cellar full of wines including "the chalone pinot noir that bobby got a discount on by purchasing her husband dave shares of chalone stock in the early s" a louis martini cabernet sauvignon "i have always had a special place in my heart for louis p martini a wonderfully wise and kind man" and a rare lokoya wild yeast "sauvage" chardonnay "made by greg upton who died in his s of cancer on thanksgiving day in " added ms rodeno "its now after p m and several people are singing werewolves of london amazing how many of us know the lyrics " ah ooooo from oakville calif to russia to tokyo it was open that bottle night when thousands of people all over the world sometimes in romantic couples sometimes as part of giant parties often at restaurants and even at big fund raisers in vail colo and rochester n y finally uncorked that wine that has always been too precious to open some of the wines were special because of their age like a moscatel de setubal from portugal but others were priceless for other reasons just ask jake kaufman of chambersburg pa at a charity event in he bought a bottle of sangiovese made for the thomas jefferson foundation from the replanted vineyard at jeffersons monticello estate in virginia two years later mr kaufmans house burned to the ground when the salvage crew removed the debris they found five bottles of wine the last remaining bottle was the sangiovese which he opened with friends on otbn "the label was brown but the wine was still good " marveled the host patricia mathews since we came up with otbn every year has offered a small window into the mood of the nation and this year was no different even though otbn took place a few days before the stock markets slide there was a notable restraint this year far fewer showy wines californias expensive "cult wines" were barely mentioned far fewer wacky stories far more tales of quiet celebrations of life and good works the most noted food choice was interesting too it was that elegant comfort food short ribs though not just any short ribs of course in pacific grove calif frances and gary spradlin "marinated beef short ribs in honey cinnamon and three cups of cabernet for eight days in an airtight bag in a cold part of the refrigerator then browned and braised them in the oven for two plus hours " technology was a big subtheme this year its certainly no surprise that weve been in the middle of a technological revolution for some time now but wine is an ancient slow moving thing and it has taken a while to catch up well it has as in years past we received hundreds of e mails about your experiences but this year more of them included photographs and online slide shows of otbn celebrations all over the world wine drinking buddies tom bodley and kyle cheriton celebrated otbn by videoconference on their macs tom in eugene ore and kyle in tokyo they declared both their california and oregon pinot noirs "delicious " in the long run of course its the old fashioned things love family friends that make otbn what it is there are so many memories trapped inside wine bottles and otbn is a time for all of us to let them out tara mcadams of stillwater minn opened the last four bottles she had from the extensive cellar of her father who died years ago the chateau latour was "warm and rich and everything my dad would have loved " she wrote rich steuk of scottsdale ariz opened his very last bottle from his familys winery steuk wine co of sandusky ohio which was founded when ohio was a prominent part of americas wine industry in the th century but closed about a decade ago "i remember my first job at around was to hoe the grape vines row after row for all of cents an hour " mr steuk said he had one bottle left a vidal blanc and "i hadnt the courage to open it or the right occasion " so how was it "our neighbors who are real oenophiles tasted and made some noncommittal but yet gracious comments " he said "i was so delighted that it was actually acceptable to drink and it got better as the night went on " granted some of the wines opened on otbn were subprime but its amazing how much the moment the memories the company and the food combined to make the wine taste much better patricia and bard brown of larchwood iowa opened a carmenere from chile they bought at a fund raiser several years ago "according to our wine snob friends the wine supposedly was at its peak in " they wrote "but we thought it was great in " and consider the experience of joel a cuffman of arlington va at the winery in his mother bought a half bottle of sterling vineyards cabernet sauvignon which she put in the refrigerator when she got home and which remained in the refrigerator until she moved to an assisted living facility last year years later "on open that bottle night my friend leo settler and i drank the plus year old wine " mr cuffman wrote "what a wonderful surprise the wine had plenty of fruit was still well structured and was truly enjoyable " as usual many of the bottles came from trips all over the world from south africa to italy to new mexico to siberia siberia "i was speaker of the florida house of representatives when helen and i were invited to tomsk siberia for a democracy building conference in january " wrote peter r wallace of st petersburg fla for otbn the wallaces and some friends opened several fine old wines and then on a whim finally opened a bottle of liqueur called "golden autumn " they were given on that trip "after years of benign neglect " he wrote "it was warm and flavorful and brought the evening to a fun conclusion " surprisingly that wasnt the only mention of russia in yuzhno sakhalinsk on a frigid pacific island in the countrys far east three couples grilled steaks in degree weather and opened three bottles theyd brought from home "ah an evening spent huddled around a toasty fire away from the siberian night enjoying home cuisine wine and laughter with good friends " wrote john senger whos involved in oil production one of steve kennedys guests in williamsburg va brought a wine from a virginia winery called naked mountain adding "this was special to the mom because they would stop by this winery on their way back from dropping their daughter off at virginia tech each year " mr kennedy and his wife contributed a nonvintage red blend purchased at biltmore estate winery in asheville n c when they were celebrating their th wedding anniversary a few years ago "otbn was the perfect time to open it " he wrote "both the memories and wine were excellent " few could match the winery experience of a guest of chuck and bonny schroyer of pierre s d who have celebrated every otbn with seven or eight couples several years ago one of our faithful had read your column before an upcoming trip to california you had declared a vigil meritage as delicious with an exclamation mark no less he decided to seek out the featured wine and took a mile side trip to what turned out to be a lonely looking place with only one car in the area and where upon inquiry he was told none was available after unsuccessful use of "the poor guy from south dakota who had traveled all this way" approach which is often successful as with only of us most people have never met anyone from our state he offered that his true motivation was to share the wine with his wife on some forthcoming special occasion that approach triggered the desired sympathy factor and the fellow ended up parting with two bottles both of which had been saved by our friend and neither opened until saturday night in toronto joe shlesinger had been keeping around an imperial thats the equivalent of eight regular size bottles of chateau pichon lalande because after all how often do you open an imperial it was shared among six people on otbn "it was great to just go deep into one wine to taste it over several hours it really changed with every hour and to talk about special bottles we have each consumed during our lives " he wrote "we knew it had been a success when our guests left after a m " otbn often brings together diverse groups "a lawyer an auditor a schoolteacher a retired it professional a custom woodworker and the wine manager of a local grocery store " as gail and vincent kashulon of raleigh n c described their guests in westbrook conn bill lee and his wife kate hosted couples who opened about bottles ranging from a chateau margaux to "hooch made by my parents in the s they had a grove of beach plums at their house and would harvest the fruit mix it with vodka and sugar and create beach plum brandy many of the guests knew my parents and it was a nice remembrance of them to share their hooch " at the freedom village retirement community in holland mich a group ate prime rib garlic shrimp and duck a lorange with wines ranging from a year old chianti to a grand traverse riesling from michigan there was also a chardonnay called "a few good men" from south africa "the year old lady who brought it is single but looking " explained one of the organizers martha joynt peter bonafede of beaverton ore and friends also shared a south african wine a groot constantia that was filled with what he called "liquid memories" in the s groot constantia on a tuesday morning at a m sold cases of cabernet shiraz and pinotage at a steep discount to the first in line until the quota was finished i was a student at the time and together with some of my classmates would get up especially early to queue up for our wine when we had sufficient funds for years the groot constantia cab was simply the best and many a memorable evening was spent figuring out our future with our whole lives ahead of us oh the memories the wine had clearly seen better days it had lost its complexity and was somewhat watery but could still be enjoyed for what it was otbn is always a time to look forward as well as back as james a gongola of elkins w va reminded us in he and his wife janice left for europe on a dream vacation on just the second day in paris "the phone rang with bad news from home janices mother had fallen very ill and was not expected to survive after changing our return flight to the next day we spent our last few hours in paris walking the streets of the latin quarter while waiting for our flight to board i noticed a wine shop just down the hall from the gate area featured was a display of three bordeaux reds neatly packed in a wooden case with a handle for carrying on the plane the promotion was to celebrate years of something in bordeaux we mourned the loss of my mother in law and for years after felt bad about not completing our dream we were reminded of this every time we were in our basement wine closet and saw the airport purchase finally for otbn we opened the bordeaux and drank it with a steak topped with blue cheese and asparagus the wine was great and we resolved to adjust our budget so that we could finish our dream trip in the very near future " indeed otbn and wine itself is about so much more than a liquid as marc avni of issaquah wash pointed out i chose a wine from my collection that i purchased years ago at a charity auction i had little hope for this charmes chambertin i was under the impression that a year old burgundy would be well past its prime with very little if any life left imagine our surprise when it turned out to be the best wine of the evening as i was drinking it i thought that it was a great metaphor for old age in people i work as the executive director for a senior center and am constantly amazed by older adults they like old burgundy are often considered past their prime with no life left and little to offer the rest of us in fact the opposite is true i daily experience the vitality and vigor of many seniors and see what they contribute to their community much like old wine dont discard it just because you think there is nothing left open it up and experience something you never expected surprises just ask jim phelps of charlotte n c about that he and his party used glasses and the good china to go through wines from all over the world but the surprise came later just when you think that otbn is over its not because someone has to wash those bloomin glasses and that good china but one of my attendees volunteered to come back on sunday morning to get it done and so for three hours i had a chance to catch up with this person in a way one simply never has time for in this madcap world of ours we covered life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness and the vintages of our lives and the figurative corks weve popped and hope to yet pop in your column and regarding wines in general we talk a lot about the character of a wine its range smoothness and perhaps depth and once in a great while we get to sense that in another memorable no unforgettable melanie grayce west contributed to this article you can contact us at wine wsj com what we drank what did we uncork on open that bottle night chateau meyney from bordeaux the bottle itself doesnt have any great history we bought three of them on june for &# each that was a fine vintage in bordeaux but we think of meyney a very old friend as wine to enjoy regularly not necessarily to age forever we simply never got around to drinking this one and of course at some point it became too cherished to open but now was most certainly the time because is especially meaningful to us at the moment that was the year our first daughter media was born this week she turned we simply cant believe it this was our last open that bottle night before she leaves home for college media has aged beautifully growing up in new york city and attending a very competitive school she has retained her sweetness and grace and the wine it was still vibrant deep and elegant with great bordeaux structure it still has a few years ahead of it it actually tasted like hard candy at some point during the night a good sign and was excellent with dotties roast duck we finished our meal with the very last sips of a bottle of grappa that was given to us long ago by the ceretto family during an unforgettable trip to the piedmont region of italy we have enjoyed a swallow or two of that grappa every winter for many years and finally after all this time we finished it we taste it still and we always will what you drank and ate on otbn readers uncorked a portuguese wine california cabernets from the s and even boones farm "to youth " and paired it with foods from a standing rib roast to pumpkin pound cake for more reader accounts like the ones below plus pictures of otbn celebrations go to wsj com onlinetoday the menu creamy prune tart and sumptuous cheesecake adorned with hand picked huckleberries saved from a summer hike paired with a kopke port "this bottle was given to me by the chairman of the department of pathology at the university of chicago at the beginning of my career after i cared for his wife as a resident it has changed career paths wives and jobs with me over the past years the cork was good the fragrances fine though a bit thin in taste the essence of richness remained " jim and judy wagonfeld tacoma wash the wine  beaulieu vineyard georges de latour private reserve cabernet sauvignon "it was one of the last made by the legendary andre tchelistcheff i had bought it at the winery in as dinner was starting i learned from randy snowden of snowden vineyards that he
