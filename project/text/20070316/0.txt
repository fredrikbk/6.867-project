the free flow of people is a big security risk in regard to the march editorial page commentary "gop protectionists" by jack kemp mr kemp has it backward when he applies his free trade principles and anti protectionist bromides to immigration reform and border security issues contrary to the simplistic economic model that treats labor as only an economic good and ignores the other dimensions of immigration such as language culture and citizenship people are not mere commodities despite what mr kemp would have us believe most fair minded people reject the notion that improved border security and adherence to the rule of law are somehow incompatible with support for free and open markets border security trumps the "free flow of people" in any age but especially when our nation faces very real threats from terrorism and heavily armed criminal gangs organized for the smuggling of cocaine meth and other dangerous drugs mr kemp surely knows that the slogan "comprehensive immigration reform" is the accepted white house euphemism for amnesty legislation which cannot be sold to the american people without subterfuge i would support any genuinely comprehensive program which would necessarily begin with border security as its non negotiable cornerstone anything less is a repeat of the disastrous amnesty legislation indeed i think it is fair to say that most americans believe that a little "protectionism" on our borders might actually be a good thing and that kind of protection has nothing to do with the price of toyotas in peoria rep tom tancredo r colo washington
