futures fight upstart makes a play for the cbot surprise &# billion offer from atlantas ice could derail merger of longtime chicago rivals a high stakes battle is on for control of the vast and lucrative u s futures markets intercontinentalexchange inc a mostly electronic trading market linked to wall streets powerful brokers launched a surprise &# billion stock bid for chicago board of trade parent cbot holdings inc designed to break up that companys planned merger with its longtime rival chicago mercantile exchange holdings inc the cme cbot merger would create a juggernaut that would control about of the market for u s futures contracts that hedge funds and other investors use to manage risks and bet on the future direction of prices of everything from natural gas to japanese yen ices deal on the other hand would create a player with market share leaving the chicago merc less powerful and with an equal market value of around &# billion futures traders saw the ice bid as a bold move by an increasingly key player and its wall street backers to block the futures industrys leading exchanges from expanding their near monopolies in the trading of some derivatives the ices offer was more than cmes original agreement with cbot a deal that was announced in october in response cme said in a statement that it was confident its merger "will create a strong combination and provide significant and unique benefits for shareholders and customers of both companies " cme has also said its cbot purchase wouldnt create a monopoly in a derivatives market defined by strong global competitors the two big chicago exchanges atlanta based ice and wall street firms are all jockeying to become the dominant market for the trading of sophisticated financial products that are a profitable corner of wall street brokerages trade these instruments both for hedge funds and other clients and for themselves some of this business is done off exchanges in trades set up by wall street firms these profits are threatened if a big exchange like the proposed cme cbot is able to steal some of that business away underlying the ice bid is also a concern among wall street firms that a cme cbot combination would give the chicago exchanges a disproportionately powerful perch in the business "its better for the market to have competition " said patrice blanc chairman and chief executive of societe generale sas brokerage unit fimat group "at the end of the day id prefer to have a combo of ice cbot" instead of "a big huge cme cbot " societe generale has an approximately stake in ice ice long has had a close relationship with wall street firms when founded in its early investors included morgan stanley and goldman sachs group inc along with oil companies royal dutch shell plc and bp plc at the end of the last year morgan stanley owned of ices shares and goldman both have been selling some of their holdings in recent months the ice bid comes as exchanges around the world are merging new york stock exchange parent nyse group inc is set to combine with european stock and derivatives powerhouse euronext nv while nasdaq stock market inc had been pursuing a strategy to buy london stock exchange plc many investors bet a bidding war will ensue for the cbot whose shares rose &# or to &# yesterday in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange the deal also triggered fresh speculation that other exchanges such as nyse group or the new york mercantile exchange might get involved by making bids of their own the offer stunned executives at cbot and cme which said it expects its deal to go through despite the ice bid and a continuing review of the deals antitrust implications by the justice department a spokeswoman for the justice department in washington confirmed that its review of the cme cbot proposed deal is progressing but said the department had no further comment jeffrey sprecher ices chief executive said yesterday that subpoenas and affidavit requests sent out recently by the justice department about the cme cbot deal underscored the regulatory risk of that transaction an ice cbot transaction "will solve the criticism about the way the exchanges are rolling up " mr sprecher said either deal could change the way investors trade futures adding new efficiencies in complementary products the mercs interest rate stock index and livestock futures pair well with cbots contracts based on treasury notes soybeans wheat and corn ices big contracts in natural gas oil and sugar also could go well with cbots agricultural products including alternative energy products like ethanol last year cme reported &# million in net income on revenue of &# billion cbot reported &# million in profit on &# million in revenue while fast growing ice had net income of &# million on revenue that doubled to &# million the ice offer came as a shock to the cbot yesterday morning at about a m edt as most executives in the exchange business were waking up to attend a conference in boca raton fla mr sprecher picked up the phone in his hotel room and called charles carey the longtime corn trader who chairs the cbot board "i want to send a letter that i hope youll be interested in " said mr sprecher mr carey who was shaving put down his razor "i have an agreement that i have to honor " but the cbot would consider the deal he told mr sprecher the ice bid highlights the meteoric rise of the company mr sprecher founded in it went public in and its stock is up in the past year yesterday ice shares fell to &# on the nyse but their recent rise makes possible a bid in which ices mr sprecher would remain in charge a former power industry executive mr sprecher expanded the company by pushing faster cheaper electronic trading at a time when its largest rival in energy trading the nymex was relying on floor traders to complete the bulk of its trades ices efforts to gain control of the cbot build on a powerful high tech trading system that it has used to become a global force unlike the human based "open outcry" system that the cme and cbot have used for years ice has a global electronic trading platform that operates as a textbook case of economy of scale recently ice bought the new york board of trade futures exchange which has a traditional trading floor in lower manhattan since january when ice closed its acquisition of that year old exchange ice has put nybots sugar cotton coffee cocoa and orange juice trading on its electronic platform mr sprecher has made commitments to keep the floor open there but if customers choose the electronic option ice may close it yesterday mr sprecher said he was committed to keeping the cbots floor open too most of the trading volume at the two chicago exchanges is electronic but floor trading is still popular among derivatives contracts known as options that convey the right but not the obligation to buy or sell something at a future date many exchanges have been able to grow fast because they have added tremendous volume in trading futures electronically without adding much to costs for ice this has resulted in a wildly profitable business model still ice has a fight on its hands the cbots mr carey and cme chairman terry duffy are both longtime chicago commodities traders and friends and regularly catch up over dinners at chicago steak house gene &amp georgetti the cme cbot deal also has political support in chicago sen dick durbin a democrat from illinois continued his support of that merger yesterday saying in a statement that it "makes sense and is beneficial to all involved " he added that he is confident the cbot leadership will review the ice proposal and "make the decision that is in the best interest of the chicago financial community as a whole " mr sprecher says the new company will be based in chicago where he is also buying a condo in the citys tony gold coast neighborhood mr sprecher says he is open to changing ices name if it helps convince cbot shareholders to support his deal yesterday some experts said the cme still has the inside edge because it could cut more costs out of a combined deal and tie traders together who currently go through the hassle of dealing with two exchanges in markets such as treasury bond and interest rate trading but ice counters that its deal which would give about of the combined company to ice and to cbot will bring more cost savings &# million a year compared with about &# million the cme promised to shareholders and customers as part of its proposal ice which was advised by morgan stanley says its products fit better together the companys new agricultural products such as sugar are a good fit with the cbots mr sprecher said the biggest concern with the cme cbot deal centers around trade "clearing " a part of the futures business in which the exchange takes on the risk that one of the parties buying or selling defaults on its obligation to cover the full value of a traded contract big customers of futures exchanges have argued that the clearing business should be opened up to become more competitive as a condition of the cme deal something that the chicago exchanges have bitterly fought an ice deal will have another twist thanks to its purchase of a london petroleum market part of the business is overseen by regulators in the united kingdom not the u s however an ice spokeswoman says if ices bid is successful the proposed plan calls for cbot to continue to be overseen by u s regulators kate kelly alistair macdonald and ilan brat contributed
