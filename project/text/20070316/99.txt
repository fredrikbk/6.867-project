the art of opposition if president bush is looking for an early christmas present for his top justice appointees he could do worse than sun tzus "the art of war " attorney general alberto gonzaless edition might even be unabridged call the administrations handling of the eight fired u s attorneys what you will and many adjectives come to mind at bottom this is a story of a white house and justice department that have yet to understand how rocked is their world their gop brethren are no longer running congress and the democrats who took over want blood the administration made its first costly mistake by underestimating the opposition democrats cant be accused of the same naivete they understood on nov that their real majority power would rest in investigations and the almighty subpoena sens dianne feinstein and chuck schumer began maneuvering their troops in january a hearing here a press conference there patiently waiting for an opportunity to escalate the attorneys affair they got their opening when deputy attorney general paul mcnulty made the amateur hour error of testifying that the dismissals were performance related that phrase turned what should have been a minor skirmish over presidential prerogatives into a bloody battle over allegations of cronyism and coverups and the real humiliation for the white house is that it never had to be this way presidents yes even president bush have a right to shape a broad prosecutorial agenda and to demand their appointees pursue those priorities this isnt just acceptable its desirable u s attorneys have few enough checks on their power without also laboring under the delusion they dont have to answer to their boss in this case the administration had more than enough philosophical differences with the fired attorneys on issues of voter fraud the death penalty obscenity to justify replacement what it failed to consider was the new political landscape a white house and justice department on their game scanning the schumer feinstein battlefield ahead would have sent mr mcnulty to the hill with a very different script the deputy ag would have laid out the presidents absolute right to hire and fire and pleasantly noted that while the eight attorneys were all fine people the chief was making a change he would also have declined to serve up any gory specifics of the administrations personnel decisions if details had later leaked the administration would have at least staked out a principled position and an honest one at that instead mr mcnultys "performance" line inspired the fired prosecutors to defend themselves namely by dishing up nefarious reasons for their pink slips congressional democrats were able to spin those accusations further after emails blew a hole through mr mcnultys testimony instead of standing on principle the administration found itself defending against allegations it had canned attorneys to stop politically sensitive investigations or to reward cronies with jobs mr gonzales also had to admit "incomplete information" had been relayed to congress that alone was enough to inspire mr schumer and house judiciary committee pit bull john conyers to demand the testimony of top officials and to guarantee many more weeks if not months of a drubbing the genesis of these flubs is still unclear and democrats have their guns aimed at lofty targets namely karl rove but its difficult to see how the competence buck doesnt stop at justice mr mcnulty and mr gonzales are both pleading ignorance and the official rap has so far fallen on mr gonzaless chief of staff d kyle sampson but someone ultimately has to take responsibility for running the outfit mr mcnultys defense as it were seems to be he has no clue about what happens in his own department and admitted as much in sworn testimony yet if anyone should know how dangerous it is to hand democrats an excuse to investigate its mr gonzales he was white house counsel back when the valerie plame affair erupted and presumably signed off on president bushs early and unconsidered remark that a "crime" may have been committed by the time anyone figured out no such thing had happened democrats had hounded up a special prosecutor to turn the case into a three year referendum on the iraq war and scooter libby was on his way to a conviction it was a gonzales mcnulty special that led to the other big congressional meltdown of the past year the fbi raid of louisiana democrat william jeffersons legislative offices the white house showed some early signs of threat awareness after the election when it drafted fred fielding as white house counsel replacing harriet miers mr fielding is a wartime consigliere a veteran of the nixon and reagan years and a man who understands subpoenas yet he only got up and running recently and in any event does not appear to have received the attorney firing memo hes now playing clean up and as part of that duty may want to consider sending a few of his more seasoned pros to camp out at justice and prevent further fiascos especially given how much collateral damage has come from the attorneys flap so far one early casualty has been the presidents right to shape a prosecutorial agenda the administrations ineptitude has given the left an opening to claim the white house is politicizing justice it matters little that many voters put mr bush in office precisely because they expected his administration to take a harder line on voter fraud or pornography rings the administration will now find it harder to maneuver in this area more concerning is the damage to mr gonzales himself the ag is the front man for most of the white houses more vital if controversial anti terror policies from wiretapping to detainees democrats strongly object to many of these programs and know only too well that the more they bruise and bloody mr gonzales in this fight the harder it will be for him to effectively take tough stands down the road theyve already had an early taste of victory when the ag last week agreed to give up his new power to appoint interim attorneys a power designed to aid terrorism prosecutions mr bush is sticking with mr gonzales for the moment and that may make sense for all the noise of this affair theres still no there there and democrats will have to dig up dirtier dirt to force a resignation but if the white house is smart it will learn from this and start taking the opposition to heart write to kim wsj com
