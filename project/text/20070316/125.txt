weekend journal the drivers seat when a car really isnt a car astonishing there is no better word to describe the new mercedes benz cl to someone who hasnt had the privilege of making its acquaintance this isnt just because the luxury coupes price tag carries one more digit than most but because in some ways the cl isnt even a car sure you can drive it around marveling at the power of its horsepower engine while playing with its long list of high tech features you can fill it with gas wash it wax it or pay someone to and admire its powerful lines and considerable presence it will do this automotive duty with aplomb and when you leave the keys with the valet hell be appropriately impressed so will many others but this aspect of cl ownership merely scratches the surface of why people acquire toys of this sort understand to its owners the cl is less a car than a reward a prize won for exceptional performance in the game of life its owner buys it because he can a tangible proof of his own success and a reassurance that he is indeed special and how mercedes says the median annual household income of cl owners is more than &# about times the national average the company sold just cls in the u s in and while this years redesigned car is likely to increase those numbers the cl will remain a low volume model about as exclusive as it gets for a regular production vehicle by comparison the s class the cls sedan sibling racked up u s sales last year of more than this is significant because the s and cl are nearly the same car sharing underpinnings and drivetrain components including a liter v coupled to a seven speed automatic transmission interior finishes and accoutrements are similar both are teeming with opulence and extravagant electronics including the standard and frustrating comand interface that controls the audio climate control and navigation systems but with a &# base price the cl costs at least &# more than the s class a premium the company tries to justify in part by its claim of slightly better acceleration coming mostly from its standard high performance summer tires in a car that offers built in seat massagers the line between novel and novelty is a fine one but there are some stellar bits of engineering in the cl prime among them is mercedess distronic plus adaptive cruise control an option exclusive to the cl and s class when distronic plus made its debut last year on the s class the system was a transcendent advance the technology uses two radar frequencies to keep the car at a safe distance behind the vehicle immediately in front deploying a combination of the throttle and brakes that avoids the need to adjust the cruise control when traffic slows or speeds up and it works with a remarkable degree of accuracy unlike other makers adaptive cruise control it can even bring the car to a complete stop without the driver needing to touch the brake with the launch of the cl mercedes improved the system by enabling it to automatically engage the brakes to prevent a crash even when the cruise control isnt turned on if the car detects a potential frontal collision it will not only sound an alarm but try to stop the vehicle much less impressive is another would be revolution an optional infrared camera system mercedes calls night view assist with a flick of a dashboard switch it causes the speedometer to vanish replaced by a black and white video image of the oncoming road mercedes claims this camera can see more than feet beyond the reach of the low beam headlights but its beyond awkward trying to monitor the grainy screen while driving given that the headlights on the cl are bright enough that you could probably see them from orbit night view assist seems more gimmick than genius this points to the bigger problem with the cl for all its attempted one upmanship it just isnt that exciting of a car at least not among its peers from a performance perspective the portly nearly pound cl doesnt compare with true sports cars like the race bred porsche plenty of lower priced cars can also outrun the cl in a sprint to miles an hour likewise the cls looks will never rival those of exotics like the traffic stopping lamborghini gallardo even among the rest of the mercedes lineup the cl makes little sense the equivalent s class is far more practical given its two extra doors both the retractable hardtop sl two seater and the cls four door "coupe" offer more desirable combinations of style and substance even if all the gee whiz options havent yet trickled down to those models at least in europe the cl is defensible as a modern day grand touring vehicle a luxury performance car designed to take advantage of the more laissez faire approach to traffic enforcement that allows triple digit speeds in the u s such functionality is utterly useless leaving the cl without a clear mission among other cars in its "i can afford to drive anything" class all this isnt to say that the cl is a bad car there can be no argument that it offers plenty of everything comfort performance luxury technology no doubt aimed at helping justify its staggering price to have the room to explain all its engineering and features would require dropping the stock charts from todays paper yet it still seems that the most compelling reason to buy a cl is the ego gratification inherent in signing the check
