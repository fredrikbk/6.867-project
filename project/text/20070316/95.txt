the chirac legacy paris jacques chiracs adieu tour has hit familiar notes from his long run in public life there was in late january the embarrassing diplomatic gaffe followed by retraction when the french leader let slip that the world should be indifferent to a nuclear iran then a lavish party on the riviera with africas francophone strongmen and an impromptu outburst against america delivered at his last eu summit in brussels this time over washingtons missile defense shield on sunday night against a familiar tricolor background at the elysee palace and delivered in his inimitably slow cadence came confirmation of the obvious the two term incumbent now wont seek a third term in aprils presidential elections to serve "this france that i love as much as i love you " "je vous aime nous non plus " came back the front page of next days liberation in a play on a famous serge gainsbourg song rough translation the feeling isnt mutual ends in politics are rarely pretty and mr chiracs is no different a fraction of the electorate in one count wanted the old gaullist to stay the dozen chirac years at the elysee are judged on the right as well as the left a failure his france was marked by upheaval in the streets paralyzing demonstrations against various subsequently abandoned reforms as well as riots in the immigrant projects and stasis everywhere else still mr chiracs looming retirement does bring conflicting feelings here not sadness certainly but nostalgia for one he has been in the limelight for two generations his year career spanning nearly the whole of the fifth republic he held top jobs for each of the four presidents before him from charles de gaulle to francois mitterrand his professional life much of it on film is a mirror to modern france but chiraquisme the man and his method also bewilders the french how did this nervous man full of complexes and with no evident firm beliefs outlast more gifted figures to rule the country so long and accomplish so little he is a mystery "the stranger at the elysee " as in the title of a new popular biography unlike his predecessor mitterrand noted lexpress weekly mr chirac though widely viewed as sympa a nice bloke doesnt "personify the spirit of an era " nor is he a leader the french feel an emotional link with that lets the country off the hook too easily mr chirac is the creation of indeed personifies a post war political system that while a democracy in name is run by an insulated tiny ruling class born into a well off family in the agricultural correze in frances south west mr chirac attended the right schools in paris flirting with socialism and a reputation that would stick into his late years women the summer of at harvard when the young jacques scooped ice cream at howard johnsons and fell in love with a girl over at radcliffe who called him "honey child " was once wrongly assumed to have made him pro american he came home to marry the aristocratic bernadette finish a very respectable th in his class at ecole nationale dadministration the school established by de gaulle in to produce the national elite the so called enarques and go into the civil service budding politicians in france then and now rise up through the state apparatus forget about going into local politics or heaven forbid first making a career outside government to his mentor georges pompidou the thirtysomething chirac stood out not for his brilliance but his work ethic and ambition he was a grind whom pompidou frances second president nicknamed "le bulldozer " he was also according to biographers riddled with self doubt comparing himself unfavorably to his enarque peers who in turn underestimated him at his first cabinet meeting as prime minister in his boss president valery giscard destaing pointedly refused to shake his hand that was caught on camera mr chirac learned to hold grudges and rely on loyal cronies seven years later after breaking with giscard and building a new party and political machine at paris city hall he swung the presidential election to mitterrand he needed to ruin giscards career to further his own even if that brought years of socialist rule at the elysee "chirac kills his enemies " former aide jean francois probst says in patrick rotmans recent french television documentary "chirac " chiraquisme was never about any coherent ideology and especially so once mr chirac made up a big poll deficit to win the presidency on his third try in his secret weapon then was a pledge to heal the "social fracture " a theme borrowed from the far reaches of the left where mr chirac nominally a man of the right always felt at home once in power he blew it by trying to push through a necessary overhaul of the state that he lacked a mandate for massive street protests ensued and the plan was dropped five years ago he promised tax cuts and free market changes only to give up on most of them at the hint of demonstrations by always adapting his positions to the situation mr chirac never won an electoral endorsement for an ambitious governing agenda to be fair anti americanism was a chirac constant for him the war against the iraq war must be the highlight when his popularity ratings eclipsed de gaulles best he revels in the applause of the arab street probably the last place he is cheered "its true that i dont abide the hegemony of companies like coca cola and that i constantly have problems with the americans who always want to impose their point of view " mr chirac says in "the stranger at the elysee " another legacy will be the party financing scandals dating back to his years as paris mayor that will follow him into his new life once his presidential immunity is lifted as a politician mr chirac died in in that year the french rejected his referendum on the eu constitution in reality on him the poor suburbs went up in flames and the president previously a picture of health suffered a "minor stroke like incident " by then some friends and enemies were amazed that a man who fought so hard to win the highest office did so little with it "hes far more preoccupied with the conquest of power than its exercise " philippe seguin a former chirac cabinet minister ventures in the rotman film mitterrand back in offered another explanation "chirac lacks inner peace and perhaps as well real character " in this presidential race the leading contenders nicolas sarkozy the socialist segolene royal and centrist francois bayrou are running against the chirac record all portray themselves as outsiders from a new generation wholl usher in a fresh approach yet the system that brought mr chirac to the pinnacle has not changed and as it happens all three are familiar faces for decades members of the ruling class who adjust campaign pitches with ease and show no appreciable sign of a guiding philosophy or consistent political vision thats no surprise mr chirac may be about to walk into history but chiraquisme is still the exceptionally french model for how to win power as an end in itself and keep it mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe
