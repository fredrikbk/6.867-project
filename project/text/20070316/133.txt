you say middle class is thriving but we dont see it i would like to know where russell roberts is getting the data to support his conclusion that "the american standard of living and the american middle class are thriving" "protectionists never learn editorial page march twenty five years ago my father supported a stay at home wife and three children and could afford a mortgage on a respectable house on a fair sized lot all without a college education now i have a b s and an m b a am forced to live with a roommate to afford rent forget about supporting a family and i couldnt even purchase a condemned shanty in this state im not solely blaming free trade all i know is that salaries and basic living expenses have become severely distorted and i am certainly not better off than the previous generation by any quality of life measure i know of sadly my situation is all too common among many colleagues keith elflein boston if mr roberts were to spend a few days in michigan ohio and indiana he would see that the american middle class is not thriving it is struggling while i agree with mr roberts that protectionism makes for bad economics that doesnt negate the fact that many middle class families are going through a very rough time as they try to adjust and make themselves employable in the evolving global economy free trade makes these growing pains necessary and in the long run everyone should benefit but in the mean time it would be appreciated if politicians and economists would acknowledge the hardships faced by many not everyone is reaping the rewards of an open market jesse pound pontiac mich as a businessman who believes in the virtues of free trade and internationalism properly implemented i was delighted to see mr robertss commentary encouraging protectionists to see beyond the rampant anti china hype most of us know that support for the protectionist agenda increases when the u s economy seems to be contracting or when global competition is intensifying like many things political protectionism is short term focused and does not encourage investment in the education training and research that leads to true american competitiveness in the international arena the other side of protectionism is militarism and a heated debate has ensued over the years between "protectionist" proponents of military power vs "internationalist" advocates of market power even a cursory analysis of this historical debate reveals that protectionist policies undermine multilateral institutions and ultimately undermine americas economic leadership and competitiveness we should forgo politically inspired economic protectionism and the use of military power to enforce protectionist policies in favor of the enlightened vision first expounded by adam smith in the th century clearly the worlds economic vitality depends on our leadership our ability to learn from failed policies of the past and our willingness to compete on the level playing field of the international market warren langley board chairman business leaders for sensible priorities san francisco
