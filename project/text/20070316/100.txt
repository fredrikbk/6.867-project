the evening wrap bank withdrawal online edition the worlds largest retailer it now appears isnt bound to become the worlds largest bank but for its shareholders that could be good news as it may put more dollars in their brokerage accounts wal mart had argued ever since its decision to file for a utah bank charter under industrial loan company provisions that all it wanted was to lower its debit and credit card transaction processing fees and in shelving its plan today the mammoth retailer stuck to that story claiming in a statement that at no point in time did it intend to use the charter "to establish branch banking operations " industrial banks of the kind wal mart was seeking to establish had flowered in recent years and companies as diverse as motorcycle maker harley davidson health insurance giant unitedhealth group and even wal mart discount rival target have them but wal marts application had whipped up a storm of criticism and regulators decided to put a hold on applications amid the widespread outcry the moratorium was just renewed and it appears it was then that wal mart decided to ditch its banking dreams calling the kerfuffle a "manufactured controversy " the company said that gaining clearance would take far too long and that it was pulling its application in order to "focus on other ways to serve customers " for the motley cluster of union groups banking industry lobbyists and assorted other activists who had banded together in an unlikely alliance against the giant retailer that was some welcome news indeed federal officials in charge of the charter process also thought wal marts step back was a fine idea "wal mart made a wise choice " fdic chairman sheila bair said in a statement "this decision will remove the controversy surrounding their intentions " less easily appeased were lawmakers on capitol hill who indicated they had no intention of halting their efforts to keep wal mart from splashing into banking rep barney frank chairman of the house financial services committee said he appreciates "the constructive step by wal mart but it does not in my judgment remove the need to legislate in this area " mr frank and ohio republican paul gilmor are sponsoring a bill that rebuilds the barrier that walled banks off from enterprises like selling patio furniture and building motorcycles "it is critical that we do not create a parallel banking system for commercial firms " mr gilmor said the companys shareholders didnt appear to be terribly broken up about wal marts banking waterloo either and the stock managed to move higher amid a fairly downbeat day for the broader market wal mart has been struggling with sluggish sales amid an effort to draw in more high income customers by remodeling some stores and stocking its clothing racks with trendier fashions and some observers have recently said that management might be better served by pulling back from some of its many political battles over employee wages health care costs and banking charters to focus on recharging a business that climbed to global dominance by demanding large price concession from its suppliers merrill lynch analyst virginia genereux who upgraded wal mart to a buy today wrote in a note that the companys recent move to flexible worker scheduling and reduced maintenance and repair expense could lift its margins she pointed out that recent subprime lending woes disproportionately pinch the typical wal mart customer and that the company is also facing some key legal battles overall however she says more could go right
