weekend journal review television detective stories its always fun when movie stars make a move to tv will they bring big screen magic to the small box or will they look all shrunken and insignificant there in the case of jeff goldblum the star of nbcs detective drama "raines " the answer so far is a little of both thursdays p m et you cant take your eyes off him when hes on screen which is almost the entire hour but he also looks a lot smaller the strapping broad shouldered mr goldblum who played a brainiac eccentric in many movies with so much energy that you forgot he wasnt handsome does not jump out at us on tv in "raines " all he can do is pull us in yet lapd detective michael raines is a brainiac and an eccentric here too when hes on a case he imagines the victims so strongly that they appear to him as walking and talking hallucinations in the first episode thursday night raines investigated the murder of a beautiful young woman while she could converse with him she couldnt help him solve the crime these figments of his imagination only know what he knows ditto the former detecting partner with whom he converses about his cases and the meaning of life at the end of the first episode we learned that the partner is not recovering from a shooting a few months earlier but is in fact also dead and that the cane he limps with on his walks with raines is merely the product of the imagination of a very lonely man this week the whole cycle begins again with the discovery of a mans body in a venice canal is he an illegal immigrant or a hit man sent to kill a local politician or something else entirely like all the other victims he wont stop appearing to raines until his killer is caught all of this might seem silly if it werent for mr goldblum the whole hallucination thing has been done many times now on "rescue me " to give only one example this week another all too familiar device emerges when rainess boss orders him to see a psychiatrist nobody knows that he sees dead people but theyve all heard him talking to himself yet the shrink played by movie actress madeleine stowe seems like a tough cookie so perhaps she will prove capable of peeling back rainess defenses and letting us see eventually what makes him tick or fail to tick because of mr goldblum we do want to know in part its because he like raines looks so wilted and so weary that its impossible not to wonder what has happened to this man hes still capable of emotion breaking down in tears listening to a victims favorite song the fear that he may be going insane and some inner sadness that is yet to be explained make it hard for this character to draw on the life force energy that emanates from mr goldblum in his movie roles yet we sense that it was once there and the writers have given raines the dry sense of humor that mr goldblum delivers so well at one point this week the victim a mexican husband appears next to the detective in his car "this is my life " raines sighs "watching a hallucination do the macarena it doesnt get any better than that " "til death do us part " is a new court tv series in which host john waters introduces us each week to a pair of newlyweds one of whom ends up murdering the other mondays p m unlike the real crimes discussed on the station during and after its coverage of courtroom trials all the murders here are played for laughs court tv says the stories were inspired by true crimes raising the question of how whats not funny in a real courtroom during the day is suitable material for yuks after dark on the same channel the tales this week there are two in a special one hour premiere of the series involve a middle aged dentist who comes to regret marrying a much younger woman and an undertaker who cant stand it when his ugly wife becomes a swan its all done in an over the top low budget sort of way mr waters who appears as "the groom reaper" at the beginning and end of each episode supplies an air of camp to the enterprise but he appears only briefly and sad to say hes not nearly as entertaining as an actor as he is when hes just being himself theres no shortage of nature programs on tv but this week brings a special treat "the galapagos" runs for three hours of spectacular high definition sights and sounds national geographic channel sunday p m not only the giant turtles either but dozens of other extraordinary creatures along with a narrative packed with unfamiliar facts about the islands volcanic emergence from the sea it will we learn be their fate to sink again one day and some are already going down in the meantime these islands so recently famous as pristine and protected examples of natures magnificent bounty are now bursting with people and other nasty results of what used to be called ecotourism all the more horrible to think about since the examples of the plagues humans have unleashed on the islands come only after we have seen natures true beauties there
