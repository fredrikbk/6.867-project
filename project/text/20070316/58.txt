&# to a web based service called mii station www miistation com run by a tokyo entrepreneur which creates look alike game characters for wii based on photos three days later he received a mii with spiky hair and a really big smile that he says pretty much captured his essence "its made playing wii a little more personal " says mr merrill adding that he doesnt have the perspective that graphic artists have to know what facial features to emphasize "that makes a big difference " nintendos wii game console has been a wild success since its launch late last year mainly for its simple controller that can be waved around to simulate swinging a tennis racket or sword now another feature called the mii which lets users create their own game characters using a selection of facial characteristics to appear on the screen is sparking a creative frenzy over the past few months the mii has spawned a fast growing secondary market with more than a dozen web sites selling t shirts beer mugs and statuettes with miis on them or simply sharing mii creations of celebrities politicians and fictional figures like darth vader "people really identify with their mii characters " says michael buckbee who runs a web site called fabjectory www fabjectory com that sells statuettes of virtual objects and has recently started offering five inch customized mii figures for &# mr buckbee

hussein nintendo says it plans to come out with more games that can use miis unique game characters that represent players known as avatars are available in online multiplayer computer games like second life but while the norm for these avatars is to create a fantasy character the wii is the first game system for the mass market to actively encourage players to create characters that look like themselves fans say its the thrill of seeing their clones run around on the screen that gets them addicted "people are vain and they like seeing themselves on tv " says eliza villasenor a year old nintendo fan in danville calif who likes to play the wii tennis game "you get to be in a videogame its a trip and its funny " nintendos character creating software is simple users can first choose
