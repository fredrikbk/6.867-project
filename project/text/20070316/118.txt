weekend journal review film premonition mixes up time logic audience thriller wastes bullock barley strongly evokes bloody s ireland anyone who has seen the overwrought incoherent trailer for "premonition" is bound to have premonitions about the movie after seeing the movie i have postmonitions about sandra bullock how could she have done it and her hapless filmmakers how could they have done it so badly plus one admonition pay real money to see this feeble fiasco only if youre in the mood for "groundhog day" without the laughs "premonition" tells the story of a loving wife and mother linda hanson who comes unstrung because shes living her days out of order why is that you may ask well she just is "i wake up every morning to find my husband has died again " linda tells a shrink thats not quite right though she finds that her husband has died when she wakes up every other morning or maybe its every third morning except during leap weeks meanwhile we come unstrung watching her frantic efforts to figure out whats going on by plotting significant events in her life i e "jim dies " on a big hand drawn calendar theres something mysterious here but it isnt the plot device which is one of those arbitrary notions thats as good or bad as the writer makes it the mystery is that ms bullocks time out of joint thriller arrives in theaters nine months to the day after her time out of whack romance "the lake house " which was just as dumb and confusing except that the problem was lovers struggling with a bi temporal relationship she was living in and keanu reeves was in what is it with sandra bullock and time does she keep yearning in the here and now for the now and then why would an actress who can act as well as she did in "infamous" as nelle harper lee fall twice for dramatic equivalents of droopy dali clocks since those questions are imponderable and since the logic of "premonition" is incomprehensible to the writer and director it would seem as well as the audience i tried to make time pass faster in the screening room by pondering other matters one is a glimpse early in the film of linda smoking a cigarette its her only cigarette from start to finish she doesnt smoke when her husband keeps dying when she discovers that he has a mistress or when her daughter has a terrible accident and the odd thing about this single ciggie is that she takes a single furtive drag then extends her arm slowly so that only her fingers and the object in them disappear off screen whether that constitutes a statement on tobacco pro or con its tempting to imagine the producers all eight of them debating the position of a coffin nail in a movie that makes a muddle of life and death another is an encounter between linda at her most distraught and a local priest who delivers a bizarre lecture on precognition "history is full of unexplained phenomena " he says solemnly and who tells her to fight for whats worth fighting for good advice if a bit tautological but the writing and acting is of such time warped earnestness as to make the scene transcendently dreadful the history of hollywood is full of unexplained folly the wind that shakes the barley the strongest character in "the wind that shakes the barley" is damien a young physician turned guerrilla fighter after being radicalized by the brutality of british troops in the thatched roof ireland of hes played quietly but charismatically by cillian murphy the strongest sensibility in this powerful film is that of the director ken loach who needing no radicalization at this point has made a long and honorable career of naturalist working class drama some of mr loachs earlier feature films have been easier to admire than to enjoy this one which won the palme dor at last years cannes film festival fairly vibrates with dramatic energy by following the men of a republican brigade as they become seasoned combatants the film like a modest irish version of "the battle of algiers " offers yet another telling account of guerrilla warfare taking its toll on uniformed soldiers the director and his writer paul laverty are unsparing in their portrait of the black and tans who inflict a reign of random terror on irelands towns and villages yet "the wind that shakes the barley" depicts just as graphically the ruthless violence that the republicans visit on britains forces most painful of all is the spectacle of irish revolutionists fighting irish turncoats "i studied anatomy for five years and now im going to shoot this guy in the head " damien says in horror and anguish then the physician turned guerrilla turns executioner dvd tip "sliding doors" follows its heroine helen gwyneth paltrow along two different life paths determined by whether she misses or makes a train in the london tube peter howitt directed this stylish debut film from his own original script
