gravity wave study points to the risks of doing big science competition isnt always pretty in the scientific world but its usually effective recall the intense race between the national cancer institute in bethesda md and the pasteur institute in paris during the s to discover the aids virus the labs feuded for years and even went to court over who won but they got the job done unfortunately when science reaches a certain size its hard to preserve the competitive drive this is especially true in fields such as nuclear physics which require a huge investment in experimental devices and an enormous amount of manpower to get even a single data point its difficult for such costs to be borne by one institution alone potential problems are manifold big science projects often have a hard time attracting top scientists who tend to prefer working in small groups requiring less administration some also miss the spark that comes from a race to be first with a discovery scientists also like having it clear who gets credit careers can be made or broken by recognition for important finds individual recognition isnt easy at places like the &# million particle accelerator at brookhaven national laboratory in upton n y where physicists from around the world are collaborating to recreate what the universe was like in the first milliseconds after the big bang each experiment requires more than people to man the control room analyze results and make sure the detectors each one the size of a house are working properly scientific papers from the site have carried the names of hundreds of authors the lab has worked out a plan to identify some scientists as the "principal authors" of papers but what if the project were to earn the biggest prize a nobel the nobel institute wont bestow the award on more than three scientists on any given project the latest big science endeavor to face concerns of scale is one trying to detect gravitational waves a phenomenon predicted by albert einstein when he figured out that gravity was a warping of space and time by matter einstein said any mass changing speed or direction as it moved through space would produce gravity waves like ripples on the water he thought the waves were too subtle to detect but scientists now believe they can measure ones set off by a cataclysmic event in the universe like a supernova or the collision of two black holes since three massive detectors in the u s run by the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory or ligo have been trying to find these waves searching up to million light years away they use interferometers instruments that measure distance using wavelengths of light housed in l shaped vacuum tunnels up to miles long french and italian institutes run a similar facility near pisa italy named virgo but ligo which cost &# million to develop doesnt compete with virgo last month they signed a memorandum of understanding under which theyll work together one of ligos founders rainer weiss an mit physics professor emeritus said he originally hoped the scientists could take the measurements with small interferometers but they ultimately had to resign themselves to having to go the route of big science "most of us like to work with two or three people " he says "not several thousand " ligo scientists say working with virgo allows them the critical ability to compare results from different parts of the planet but they admit to a danger that the results wont get sufficient scrutiny from peers competing in the field because theyre all working together "theres the worry that somebody might unintentionally favor an analysis that finds things that arent really there " says stan whitcomb a caltech physicist who helped design ligo ligo virgo has taken steps to solve the problem by having different groups analyze data in different ways to check each others work the search for gravitational waves already has shown the best and worst that can happen with small competitive projects in renowned university of maryland physicist joseph weber announced he had detected the waves but rushed his findings out a common mistake of scientists eager to be the first with a discovery his work couldnt be duplicated and was discredited then in the mid s a relatively unknown university of massachusetts astronomer joseph taylor and his student russell hulse proved einsteins gravitational wave theory they happened to discover a pair of neutron stars spiraling toward each other so fast they rotated around each other once every eight hours they determined the stars were losing energy in a way that einstein predicted would happen if they were producing gravity waves the scientists won the nobel prize for the discovery in they also demonstrated the kind of serendipity often lost in big science as for ligo virgo the consortium decided that for published papers all the scientists will be listed alphabetically "it seems a little unfair to the people whose last names begin with w doesnt it " dr whitcomb jokes email me at peter grant wsj com
