mortgage woes may help revive fha rising problems for lenders and borrowers in the subprime mortgage market may bolster efforts to revitalize the federal housing administration the new deal era agency that helps low and middle income homebuyers qualify for low interest mortgages but backers of an fha overhaul may have to overcome a perception that the government is taking on too much financial risk and bailing out lenders by stepping in to help consumers hurt in the subprime market which offers loans to borrowers with weak credit for decades the fha was a major backer of mortgage funding for borrowers with poor credit but the fhas share of the market has dropped sharply in the past decade as hordes of aggressive subprime lenders wooed away borrowers with an array of seemingly attractive options including no money down mortgages and interest only payments the subprime players also offered faster approvals instant home appraisals less paperwork and fewer hassles winning over consumers even though subprime mortgage rates were generally higher than rates for fha insured mortgages "subprime loans were quick and relatively easy for borrowers and that made it appealing " says guy cecala publisher of inside mortgage finance an industry publication based in bethesda md "but they came with a lot of strings things that turned out to be not in the borrowers best interest " according to inside mortgage finance subprime mortgage originations or the dollar volume of such new loans nationwide totaled &# billion last year more than triple the volume of &# billion fha backed loan volume fell to &# billion last year down from &# billion in the fha requires borrowers to put down a minimum down payment of at least and pay mortgage insurance premiums that could amount to as much as of the mortgage amount fha doesnt lend money but rather endorses and guarantees loans an fha endorsement qualifies borrowers to receive a lower mortgage rate from a lender than they would otherwise qualify for but the process is time consuming and requires lots of paperwork the fha also cant insure mortgages on single family homes that exceed &# too low for buyers who live in higher cost cities for years consumer activists and fha officials have been pushing the government to revitalize and streamline the fha program to make it an attractive alternative to subprime lenders now that foreclosures are surging and more consumers complain of being victimized by subprime lenders it is likely that modernizing the fha could move up on congress agenda yesterday a coalition of community groups called on the bush administration and congress to permit the fha to refinance the loans of defaulting subprime borrowers who are in danger of losing their homes john taylor president of the national community reinvestment coalition said the federally backed agency wouldnt necessarily buy the defaulted loans but would act as guarantor or servicer of the loan the ncrc is an advocacy group that promotes fair lending practices the majority of loans would remain in private hands but lenders would be more confident they own "a loan thats being paid on instead of one they have to foreclose on " said mr taylor while some funds will need to be created to support the new role for fha he said "thats more cost effective than allowing this disaster to occur dragging down neighborhoods " new york sen hillary clinton told the ncrc yesterday that fha mortgage limits should be increased in high cost areas and outlined a series of proposals aimed at boosting consumer protections "this market is clearly broken and if we dont fix it it could threaten our entire housing market " she said the fha has been trying revitalize its operation for years it has tried to update its technology to eliminate some of its unnecessary processes and is hoping to pass a bill to eliminate the minimum down payment and increase the fha loan amounts which means that more homes would qualify while many experts on housing policy agree that fha overhaul is necessary some wonder if too much flexibility would only exacerbate problems "it would be wrong to suggest that we would not have the present crisis if only the fha had been there in the first place " says michael stegman director of policy at the macarthur foundation in chicago others wonder how much sense it makes to bail out those currently suffering with subprime mortgages partly because the potentially substantial liability the federal government would assume by backstopping defaulting subprime loans brian montgomery the federal housing commissioner who is responsible for overseeing the &# billion fha insurance portfolio defends the fha he notes that in the fha was able to keep borrowers who went into default in their homes through various workouts and estimates that this happens with of defaults for the fourth quarter the fhas foreclosure rate was that compares with a foreclosure rate for subprime loans greg hitt and greg ip contributed to this article
