opec holds steady in test of its clout vienna behind opecs decision to leave oil output unchanged lies a new calculation on the part of the cartel that it has prevailed in its multiyear struggle to regain some control over turbulent petroleum markets in a quick meeting at their headquarters here ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting countries yesterday decided to stick with their current output target of million barrels a day for the members in its quota system the cartels actual output is estimated at million barrels though that still marks a one million barrel decline from september before the cartel began cutting output the world consumes roughly million barrels a day opec is keeping supplies in check even though prices remain at relatively lofty levels because it wants to ensure a low level of inventories in customers tanks and thus buttress its pricing power that stance has raised concern in importing countries that prices may pick up again this summer as they did last year when crude hit a nominal record of &# a barrel yesterday crude for april delivery finished at &# a barrel in new york down cents or opec officials contend their strategy poses little risk to the world economy because the producers group has regained the power to prevent oil prices both from skyrocketing and from collapsing that theory will be tested in coming months as seasonal demand for oil dips early in the second quarter but resumes rising in subsequent months with the onset of the summer driving season starting in the cartel had trouble capping what seemed to be a runaway oil price boom in large part because it lacked enough spare capacity to pump extra crude prompting traders to bid up prices toward the end of opecs spare capacity had dwindled to fewer than one million barrels leaving markets perilously stretched then last autumn after an extended period of pumping flat out prices began tanking when supplies of oil in commercial inventories were soaring opec officials yesterday said the group could easily pump more oil if needed between now and the next ministerial meeting scheduled for sept in vienna oil prices are now close to what many in opec say is an unstated target keeping a barrel of u s benchmark oil near &# a barrel or more indeed u s benchmark crude prices have averaged a shade above &# a barrel since opec decided to start reducing its output in october "we are happy with the opec basket between &# and &# a barrel " said shokri ghanem the head of libyas delegation that translates into a price of &# or more a barrel for western nations because higher quality u s and north sea benchmark oil types typically fetch several dollars a barrel more than the basket of opec crude oils mr ghanem acknowledged in an interview that prices could surge to levels that opec is uncomfortable with "i wouldnt be surprised if the price of oil goes up to &# a barrel this year" if something goes wrong mr ghanem said mr ghanem said he and others in opec begin to fret about negative repercussions when oil prices rise too high "beyond &# or &# a barrel we are worried " he said
