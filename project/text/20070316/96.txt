sideline begging him not to call a timeout " kim baxter writes on espn com "he waved off his teammates sending them to the baseline and out of his way " you can watch the final sequence on youtube "few seniors would have the cojones or the confidence to make such a move with their th seeded teams cinderella life on the line against one of college basketballs most venerable programs " luke winn writes on si com "maynor happens to be a foot pound wisp of a sophomore " he is also a fayetteville n c native who wasnt recruited by duke and other big local programs making his "the perfect march madness script " ms baxter writes now the rams face inevitable comparisons to the team they knocked out last years cinderella seed george mason which advanced to the final four but baltimore sun columnist david steele says the rams werent really an underdog duke may have had tournament wins to vcus one but the rams were the better team "both coaches grant and dukes mike krzyzewski as well as the vcu players mentioned the tradition of the duke program " mr steele writes "in the end there was less to be said for whether this edition of duke was the better team despite its credentials " it was a bad day all around for blue devils the men from central connecticut state the souths seed lost to seed ohio state hartford courant columnist jeff jacobs says howie dickenmans underdogs fought valiantly and to the last breath call them the sparta of college hoops "ohio state coach thad matta shuttled nine players for most of the game big time player after big time player " mr jacobs writes "howie used five but here they were sucking for air dickenman flailing his arms throwing on a press urging his players on during that second half run against the best team in the land thats what well

writes "its as unromantic as going bowling on your anniversary the love is never requited " how soon they forget every seed was competitive in last years tournament the kansas city stars blair kerkhoff suggests the dogs may have their day soon enough "really there doesnt seem to be much difference between a or just a bunch of schools whose nicknames or hometowns become the office trivia question yet times a no seed has pulled off the upset and no s have won four times " two other seeds didnt fare as well as virginia commonwealth getting blown out by seeds in the east george washington was down at halftime and lost to vanderbilt and in the south stanford fell behind by at halftime and lost to louisville "eleven of vanderbilts dozen players scored including a walk on david rodriguez who plays so sparingly his second game ever he didnt even have his name on his jersey " michael wilbon writes in the washington post "and while vandy was shooting percent in the first half to build an insurmountable point intermission lead gws players were shooting as if their hands were lathered in vaseline poor damian hollis had one shot stick between the glass and rim youve never seen such misfiring in your life the colonials needed a flurry to get their shooting percentage above for the game " after stanfords loss coach trent johnson was at a loss even as he took the blame "johnson is a gruff and honest man who likes tough players and strong willed teams " tim kawakami writes in the san jose mercury news "after years when stanford played well but perhaps lacked some steel johnson was supposed to bring that toughness to the cardinal on thursday johnsons squad was the furthest thing in the world from that " canada has its own mens college basketball tournament not
