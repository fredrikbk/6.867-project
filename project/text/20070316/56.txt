controversial bump in mumbai indias biggest city local media and officials have attacked reality tours &amp travels trips through the citys enormous dharavi slum as vulgar "poorism" an invasion of privacy and exploitation of the poor "you are treating humans like animals " said the moderator of a high profile panel discussion about the tours through word of mouth and the internet the tour has become popular with visitors to mumbai and will be recommended in a forthcoming lonely planet guide reality tours founder christopher wray of britain developed the idea for the mumbai slum visit from a favela tour he took in rio once the dharavi tours begin making money he promises to donate of the profits to local charities writes john lancaster who has reported from the region for the washington post the tour guides have apparently cultivated good relationships with the slums inhabitants who number around a million in an area half the size of new yorks central park to prevent the tours from being too intrusive guides wont allow tourists to ask slum residents pointed questions about their lives during a three hour visit tour participants get a glimpse of the slums thriving microeconomy

have weak safeguards made used tires too dangerous according to a road safety research group used tires arent being properly tested for safety thirty million used tires are sold in the u s each year safety research &amp strategies inc says in a new report that vendors rarely do more than take a quick look at tires and examine the treads depth whats more the group says sellers arent providing consumers with a realistic sense of how old the tires are or when using them will become too risky safety research often works with plaintiffs attorneys and played a part in the massive recalls in and of firestone tires which were linked to rollover crashes on ford explorers sport utility vehicles that recall also revolved around the age of tires and whether versions deteriorated with time making them less durable and more prone to blowouts in the wake of the recall ford motor co urged consumers to replace tires after six years citing research that tires degrade over time even when they arent used while consumers are warned to check the age of spare tires little attention has been paid to used tires safety research which has collected a list of accidents involving older tires in the past has recommended that tires be labeled more clearly with their manufacture date instead safety research says that many large tire sellers paint used tires to make them look new tire industry representatives however say stricter standards arent needed and that restricting used tires could lead to even greater safety hazards by limiting supply and driving up prices "motorists at a certain economic level would put off the purchase of new tires until they could afford them " said dick gust a former president of the tire industry association "that in itself would create a major safety problem as those motorists drove on worn tires " tire business march ranching can eating bison be good for humans and bison too is eating an animal the best way to preserve it the bison roaming

inspected slaughterhouses will kill bison this year up from in "vegetarians may argue that no life is better than one cut short at slaughter " but without the demand for bison meat the entire species might not have survived writes mr cloud but there are risks to relying on bison meat to underpin conservation farmers might breed out wilder animals until bison become so docile they barely resemble their roaming progenitors also slaughterhouse killings are more cruel than the methods used by william "buffalo bill" cody who was vilified for mass shootings of bison on the plains in the late s while harvesting bison on the open range costs more mr cloud endorses the approach saying it goes beyond just saving the species to finding a way to respect it too time march see more on our blog at
