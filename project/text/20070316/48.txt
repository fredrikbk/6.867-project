heineken hopes branding will fly at airport bars hong kong heineken wants to bring the starbucks coffee experience to beer a new bar at hong kongs international airport serves up as much heineken bv branding as it does beer bar stools reflecting green neon match the heineken logo t shirts for sale tv screens show heineken ads and sports events sponsored by the company while the bar sells other beers as well as wine and spirits only heineken owned brands are available on tap alcohol marketers have long paid bars to hoist signs push drinks with costumed servers or throw lavish parties heineken europes largest brewery wants to take beer branding a step further creating a chain of heineken bars world wide "with starbucks people are looking for a familiar brand this is what we are trying to roll out for beer " says erik van de ven heinekens manager for duty free and travel retail the idea of brewers putting their marks on pubs isnt new the u k long had a tradition of brewer owned pubs until the government in a bid to break their stranglehold on the market ordered them to sell off large portions of pub estates in heineken is taking a different approach it wont own the bars but rather design establishments that are run by airport food and beverage operators it contracts with the first heineken bar operated by select service partner a company owned by stockholm private equity firm eqt partners opened here this month heineken says others will roll out soon at airports across major cities on five continents in recent years a range of consumer goods makers have tried creating a "brand experience" in retail outlets to exert more control over how their products are presented to buyers in nike inc moved beyond its oregon base to launch an elaborate "niketown" flagship store in chicago after years of selling its electronics through other retailers apple inc in began running its own sleek branded stores and now has around the world weber stephen products co the maker of charcoal and gas grills runs a chain of chicago area restaurants called weber grill where the food is cooked on its own giant grills "social experiences are in many ways stronger than advertising they create an opportunity to showcase your brand at its very best " says tim riches the australia managing director of branding agency futurebrand at interpublic group of cos alcohol brands are trying this too vin &amp sprit abs absolut vodka teamed up with the swedish hotel chain icehotel ab to launch absolute icebars in stockholm milan london tokyo and copenhagen diageo plc installed bars in duty free shops at airports in europe and asia where bartenders hand out free sample cocktails made with its johnnie walker scotch whisky and smirnoff vodka heineken has practice building an experience around its beer in spain the company in introduced la amsteleria a chain of beer bars named after the companys amstel label featuring beer taps at the tables in a country where wine is the big draw heineken found its amsteleria bars sell about times as much beer as the average bar mostly its own amstel and heineken brands although other labels are also offered with the airport bars the companys aspiration is to create a global bar brand "if you enter the heineken bar you enter the world of heineken " mr van de ven says "we chose airports because that international environment perfectly fits the positioning of heineken as the most global beer brand " he says a new wing opening at hong kongs airport provided an opportunity for the first location in the public space before the waiting area for ticketed passengers airports are popular places for alcohol marketers to introduce new products because consumers are generally bored and inclined to try something new the jury is out on just how much advertising bar customers will tolerate while branded bars offer manufacturers the promise of easy visibility they must fill a consumer need in order to survive says john hosking director at u k based marketing consultancy cognosis ltd which has worked for diageo "if you go into this thinking your brand is going to be the experience you are dead in the water " starbucks won over consumers in part because it offered consistent high end espresso drinks a beverage most american consumers hadnt identified with specific brands the challenge for beer is that many consumers are familiar with a wide range of beers and less faithful to a single brand many customers return to starbucks for something else it offers an oasis away from the office or the home for beer drinkers though local bars already serve that purpose heineken believes the bars can fill a niche at airports where beer is the second most consumed beverage after coffee airports bring in a lot of traffic and have less retail competition than bar districts in towns diageos guinness successfully spread its brand with a different approach in it launched an initiative to help local owners open more than irish pubs in countries instead of designing the bars itself guinness offered potential operators advice from how to name and locate the pub to lists of suppliers of irish bric a brac for the pub walls diageo says a major reason it chose not to run the pubs itself is legal restrictions in the u s that prevent alcohol makers from owning and operating their own bars these irish themed bars sell guinness but they arent branded as guinness pubs "the secret is that they created a really strong consumer proposition tying together irish hospitality and service with an environment carefully built for drinking " mr hosking says in the end comparisons with starbucks can go only so far says mr van de ven of heineken picturing bar visitors cheering sports on tv or waiting with friends for a flight he says "beer moments are more social and exciting than coffee moments "
