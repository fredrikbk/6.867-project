with the affluent cleveland the companys headquarters was named the countrys poorest big city by the u s census bureau last year keybank charges up to a maximum of &# to cash payroll and government checks thats below the average that check cashing outlets charge for example for social security checks says the consumer federation of america so far keybanks three year experiment has brought in a nearly negligible sum and future projections still put it at a fraction of one percent of the &# billion in annual revenue from the keycorp unit that includes branch banking many working poor still show allegiance to storefront chains because of their longer hours and willingness to cash more types of checks but bruce murphy keybanks president of community development who oversees business in urban areas calls the push inevitable in neighborhoods with homeowner rates of as low as selling home equity loans for example "just doesnt work " jeanne morton who manages a training center for a cleveland nonprofit housing group said she was initially concerned keycorp might use check cashing to pitch clients on costly accounts but she says shes encouraged to see keybank providing services at lower costs than many check cashing chains mr murphy a native of youngstown ohio came to know cleveland as a child when he visited his grandmother now he says that one of his "formative" experiences as a young african american was witnessing celebrations in when cleveland elected carl b stokes the first black mayor of a major u s city much later overseeing keybanks retail operations in cleveland from to he heard the frustrations of employees who felt they had little to offer the mostly african american residents living near inner city branches the bank subsequently tapped him for the urban development job one day in mid keycorps chairman and chief executive henry meyer iii sat down at mr murphys table in the corporate cafeteria mr murphy told him hed been mulling how to capture fee income from low income customers "henry we think theres an emerging market in the unbanked " he recalls saying the ceo was receptive "im always looking for new things that arent way out there on the risk spectrum " mr meyer says he told him "youve got something here go back and think some more about it " but the ceo says any effort had to make economic sense "bruce doesnt work for the keybank foundation " mr meyer said referring to the banks charitable arm keybank began offering checking accounts with no minimum balance requirements in september of but that initial attempt to reach less affluent customers fizzled other banks had already started doing the same also even with the balance flexibility many people didnt qualify because they had a record with chexsystems inc a network that tracks customers with a history of bouncing checks the high bar turned prospects off said judy lucas who oversaw an area that included urban branches it seemed to reinforce the view of attendees at a bank focus group who had said they didnt trust or respect banks mr murphys team then homed in on a simple idea to offer the service those residents regularly used check cashing it was tough swaying some mid level managers in meetings in early he recalls one employee saying "are you crazy these are the very people were trying to keep out of the bank " security staff also warned that offering check cashing could make branches less safe it suggested putting tellers behind bullet proof glass recalls michael griffin a former housing development advocate who directs strategy for keybank plus as the bank calls its check cashing service "the general sentiment was that we were opening the bank vault and taking cash out of it " said mr griffin diane bujdos a keybank vice president overseeing sales and operations at the branches noted that branch employees pay was tied to their offices performance why should they embrace a program that might attract bad checks and increase losses if word got out that the bank was doing this "we could become a target" of customers trying to cash fraudulent checks she recalls saying the complaints convinced mr murphy that some "myth busting" was in order in april his team flew with marketing and risk management executives to los angeles to visit union bank of california which started its check cashing service in and now offers it at of its branches the group boarded a small bus and toured freestanding branches and one inside a grocery store union bank branches offered check cashing at clearly marked locations people in the check cashing line were pretty much indistinguishable from other clients managers said losses were within expectations as the group gathered that evening over dinner mr griffin mr murphys lieutenant sensed theyd turned a corner "there was a lot of excitement" that the program could be viable he says mr murphys team launched a test of keybank plus at five branches in run down areas of cleveland to reduce risk they limited the service to payroll and government checks personal and third party checks werent accepted bullet resistant glass went up at the st clair branch which had been previously robbed the bank redesigned the pilot branches painting walls in warm mustard hues and hired a nonprofit organization to teach free financial literacy classes at an adjoining education center mr murphy also ordered up a special marketing campaign one was a collage of photographs mostly depicting african americans with a focus on a young man dressed hip hop style in tank top silver chain and cap the program hit some early glitches to verify enrollees employment and home addresses tellers called the customers bosses and landlords ms bujdos the former teller turned executive cringed "it was intrusive to me that says you think im lying " she says she also suspected the cumbersome process was discouraging enrollment to overcome those problems the bank in invested in new technology from valid systems inc that electronically verifies a customers identity using a check of multiple databases upon enrollment required to cash even one check clients present identification such as a drivers license and a thumbprint for imaging for future identification clients said they didnt mind giving a print "it feels safer that way " said pameletta jones years old who cashes her monthly disability check at keybank by the end of keybank plus had signed up more than cleveland check cashing clients the bank now has check cashing in branches in cleveland in mid january it expanded the service to albany n y where it has enrolled about customers at branches denver and portland ore are on the list for later this year when a branch in working class cleveland recently hung a banner inviting customers to cash their tax refund checks the manager of an ace cash express inc store across the parking lot complained to the property owner but eric norrington a spokesman for irving texas based ace a chain with more than stores nationwide said his company isnt worried about the competition he says ace offers extended hours and more flexibility than banks which "dont understand the market " child care worker erika jones cashes checks at keybank but says she still must head to a convenience store to pay her utility bill for a cent fee keybank says it is matching certain conveniences of the check cashers it soon will offer utility bill paying for a fee in its branches and is considering a short term loan service similar to payday loans but at lower interest rates it is offering free money orders as a promotion though it may eventually charge for them the average check cashed in the program so far has been about &# much higher than keybank expected its another possible sign that low income neighborhoods have more money than it appears washington d c based nonprofit social compact jointly funded by the city of cleveland keybank and others recently found that one low income district of cleveland had a cash economy a measure of cash exchanged for goods and services of &# million a year higher rates of owner occupied housing than measured by the census and "relatively stable" businesses keybank has cashed checks totaling close to &# million with what it calls minimal losses from forged or bounced checks although this only brought in about &# before expenses the bank hopes to expand the program and bring in &# million in fees over the next three years it says it aims to convert at least of check cashing clients to other accounts and services compared with roughly of enrollees thus far it has also begun offering a direct deposit account that allows clients to access paychecks with a debit card and it has a program that allows clients with bounced check histories to work their way off chexsystems by paying restitution and taking a financial education class "it takes time to change a culture" founded on using cash says mr meyer the ceo "we hope eventually theyll feel confident enough to understand cash flow the idea of putting some things not too many things on a credit card " he said ms james the nurses aide who switched over from the grocery store aspires to qualify for a mortgage she works evenings and weekends to support two children and takes classes in physical therapy at a community college in hopes of getting a better job yet she remains uneasy with traditional banking as is typical of so called "underbanked" consumers ms james has a checking account at a smaller institution dollar bank that she rarely uses "i just dont like writing checks " she explains she fears she might forget to note the check in her ledger and incur an overdraft fee "i know my system is crazy " she says "but it works for me "
