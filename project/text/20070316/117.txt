weekend journal review books the winding road to the robotic future almost human by lee gutkind norton pages &# robots are wonderful they are tireless obedient machines that take the drudgery out of life we already use them in industry to paint cars and scrub out nuclear reactors robots in the home arent as far along but as soon as they are ready to re grout the bathtub most of us will cheer then again maybe robots are horrible the more powerful and complex they become the more likely they are to mutiny against us their masters and wreak havoc on the world just watch the recent movie "i robot" to see how ghastly things could become about six years ago pittsburgh writer lee gutkind decided to cast those stereotypes aside and see what he could learn first hand about how robots will change our lives he slipped into the robotics department of carnegie mellon university where some of the brightest researchers in this field are based then he watched them trying to build the future what emerges in "almost human" is a fascinating frustrating sad story the carnegie mellon researchers have big dreams they work incredibly hard but the deeper mr gutkind immerses himself in their projects the more he realizes that they arent rolling from one triumph to another instead their labs seem cursed by failure a robotic vehicle designed by a carnegie mellon team enters a contest sponsored by the defense departments advanced research agency the vehicles are supposed to maneuver from los angeles to las vegas off road without any human help none of them make it carnegie mellons entry is a spectacular failure after just miles it catches fire and almost tumbles off the edge of an embankment the militarys organizer is mortified he was set to stage a press conference in a nevada casino to salute the winner little robotic dogs try to play miniature soccer one of them tracks down a ball resting inches from the goal line then we are told it "suddenly completely and illogically whirls around in the opposite direction and shoots it the wrong way " elsewhere a big team of carnegie mellon researchers tries to simulate a reconnaissance mission on mars by bringing a robot to the atacama desert in chile the device is supposed to travel a simple route and poke at rocks looking for signs of life within a few days its clear that the robot nicknamed zoe cant do it totally unaided sympathetic to the researchers mr gutkind tries to portray each project as a partial success the chilean project does make headway in testing remote rocks for lichen the leader of the soccer dog project tells him that within or years robots will be beating humans on the playing field mr gutkind sees no reason to doubt her and on the las vegas expedition carnegie mellons machine made it farther than any other rival mr gutkind points out he doesnt quite say so but perhaps robots that abandon a vegas road trip are showing higher intelligence late in the book mr gutkind starts to analyze why success is so elusive one big set of challenges involves the nature of the projects that the robot makers have picked they are trying to simulate three of the things that humans do rather well seeing navigating and improvising when new data comes in for thousands of generations human evolution has been selecting people who are good at those three things we cant all play soccer like david beckham or trek through the wilderness like meriwether lewis but we can spot patterns in a chaotic vista and react accordingly those skills arent easy for a robot to copy machines fare much better at simple repetitive tasks mr gutkinds second big insight involves carnegie mellons approach to project management its awful goals arent defined interim deadlines arent met crucial subsystems turn out to be incompatible people rely on all nighters to get everything finished such bad habits invite catastrophic blunders by exhausted people whose last minute "fixes" snarl everything else in the most maddening breakdown of all the scientists devising research projects seldom communicate well with the engineers trying to build them even the word "target" becomes a sore spot to scientists it means their working hypothesis to engineers it means the robots physical destination unaware of this gap supposed colleagues get mired in confusing conversations usually mr gutkind sidesteps such ugliness early chapters are filled with humanizing anecdotes about each researcher and they are a zany bunch one man subsisted for a time on cheerios chocolate milk and budweiser another claimed to have wrestled a gorilla on a dare each set of quirks sets the stage for the researcher to explain why his work could someday change the world mr gutkind assures us in his preface that the future of robotic technology is in good hands he likes the carnegie mellon researchers he quickly dismisses the idea of a robot uprising as science fiction nonsense on that score hes almost certainly right but its a pity that he didnt make bigger adjustments in his overall thesis once he had completed his excellent reporting recent advances in robotics including victory in a later scaled down version of the las vegas dash have come from non carnegie mellon labs with more focus and precision if a new robotics age is taking shape it will require pioneers who can get the details right otherwise robots will remain the stuff of dreams and nightmares without ever achieving their potential in real life mr anders is a journal reporter based in palo alto calif
