until later this spring its chief executive reto francioni has repeatedly said he is against breaking up the company but he has seemed more receptive to overhauling its structure lately the idea of a radical overhaul gained momentum after the recent departure of chief financial officer mathias hlubek who opposed such a big change the company hired consultants from mckinsey &amp co to look at options for new legal and management structures unlike other exchange operators such as nyse group inc the operator of the new york stock exchange deutsche boerse offers many services in different

of its shares and have pushed it to find other ways to increase its share price they have forced management to make radical changes including dropping a bid for the london stock exchange plc in the

"immediate separation" of clearstream from the rest of the company it later clarified its comments to say it wants a legal separation of clearstream from the rest of the company which could open the way to put debt on the companys balance sheet and increase shareholder payouts by opting for a legal separation of its units the company could still have the different units work together executives

be forced to break itself up michael long a london analyst at keefe bruyette &amp woods agreed that a breakup would be detrimental to the company "selling off parts of the business like eurex clearing
