why congresss earmark provision is heavily flawed in passing lobbying reform legislation "congress approves lobbying overhaul " politics &amp economics aug congress missed an opportunity to limit the time honored tradition of targeted tax breaks for special interests the bills tax earmark provision requires the senate finance committee chairman or majority leader to certify that "limited tax benefits" in proposed legislation are identified attributed to the sponsoring senator and publicized online unfortunately the earmark provision is heavily flawed first the chairman is effectively wearing two hats he is policing the same bill that he is shepherding through congress second the rule only applies to tax provisions that arent "uniform in application" with respect to beneficiaries tax provisions are almost always "uniform in application " even if they apply only to a handful of influence wielding wealthy individuals or corporations in effect congress has "defined away" potential tax earmarks going forward congress should strengthen the tax earmark rule by transferring enforcement to congresss nonpartisan joint committee on taxation the definition of a "limited tax benefit" should be revised to clarify that any provision affecting or fewer taxpayers constitutes an earmark these two reforms would help make the earmark disclosure provision meaningful and not more empty rhetoric ryan mccormick miller &amp chevalier chartered washington mr mccormick was a tax aide to sen daniel patrick moynihan
