under equality the american dream thrives john morton says "the traditional up escalator may not be working very well" and beverly goldberg claims that people "feel pain and resentment about inequality when they see firsthand what they dont have and dont think they can get" "inequality more than just an obsession " letters aug my family escaped to america years ago with two kids and no money from the soviet "heaven" of enforced equality our children didnt go to summer camps and we could not afford private schools and tutors we were at the economic bottom yet our children did very well in schools and colleges without outside financial help in general our kids did better than those of many rich parents we slowly climbed the steps of economic opportunity we will never be really rich and yet the instinct of envy has been absent and we dont feel any pain watching others prosper to the contrary we are happy to live in the country that offers to those with talent education or just luck all the goods and leisure only money can buy but we felt pain years ago knowing that no matter how hard you work or study one cannot make a socialistic society prosperous hopefully mr morton and ms goldberg will understand this one day matthew jarosinski waitsfield vt
