quiet march these days we something african americans who are not serious contenders for the presidency are increasingly having to explain why weve achieved so little in our own careers thank you barack obama but more seriously thank you america as mr obamas star continues to rise and professional expectations for african americans increase its easy to forget how recently great skepticism abounded about blacks as leaders at least as leaders of organizations populated by substantial numbers of whites just years ago the late los angeles dodgers general manager al campanis speculated to an incredulous ted koppel on nightline that african americans may simply lack the "necessities" for leading baseball teams though he stressed they were wonderful people with other talents swimming he pointed out not among them this from the g m of the organization that had integrated baseball some years earlier by hiring the great jackie robinson and until january when black quarterback doug williams threw a record tying four touchdown passes to lead the washington redskins to victory in super bowl xxii conventional wisdom for many taught that african americans could not succeed as gridiron generals because of both intellectual and leadership deficiencies though not athletic ones now consider how much has changed in two decades african american coaches have led their teams to world series and super bowl championships in recent years and so many black quarterbacks now lead their teams on the football field that its hard to imagine this was unimaginable only a few years ago the new acceptance of african american leadership is still more striking outside the sports world americans warmed to colin powell in a very visible top leadership role during operation desert storm in a decade later condoleezza rice became one of a conservative presidents two closest advisers on national security and foreign policy meanwhile african americans ken chenault stan oneal and dick parsons took the lead of three iconic companies american express merrill lynch and time warner respectively and most conspicuously mr obama has joined an elite club whose members who can be counted on two hands if not one actually have a plausible shot at delivering the presidents inaugural address in washington in january african americans did not begin to assume some of the highest leadership roles in american society because they suddenly acquired the previously lacking "necessities " becoming a leader has always required more than a suite of personal skills and virtues a leader needs followers who accept his or her legitimacy in that role no followers no leader what has changed dramatically in a single generation is that americans of all races broadly accept the legitimacy of african american leaders whose leadership extends beyond the black community and perhaps even to the leadership of america itself to be sure skeptics remain who dispute that the culture has fundamentally changed the black ceos they warn will be gone at the first performance downturn secretary rice they argue has had to toe the conservative line in order to rise professionally and mr obama they are convinced will ultimately fail in his quest for the white house but these glass half empty views miss the point twenty years ago it was almost inconceivable that an african american could be in a position to be fired as ceo of a fortune company the secretary of state job seemed out of reach regardless of ones political views or willingness to conform them to those of a president and being even a serious contender for the presidency was outlandishly farfetched mr obama may or may not become our th president i confess to believing his prospects are as good as anyones but even if he doesnt the enormous achievements already under his belt his competitiveness in the polls against formidable opponents his extraordinary prowess in attracting financial and political support across racial and socioeconomic lines and above all his legitimation as a plausible president mark how far we have traveled as a society and none too soon national leadership index studies published by u s news &amp world report and the center for public leadership at harvards kennedy school of government most recently in october remind us that there is a leadership crisis in this country with americans confidence in our leaders sitting low and declining this comes at a time when the challenges we face as a society are daunting and show no signs of subsiding anytime soon but the good news is that our country unique in its capacity for change has become comfortable with leaders it previously excluded as we confront our challenges our prospects are brighter with doors opened to all who are willing and prepared to lead mr zelleke is a lecturer in public policy at harvard universitys kennedy school of government and co director of its center for public leadership
