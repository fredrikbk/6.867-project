pursuits food &amp drink eating out batalis hollywood stumble the star chefs much anticipated l a outpost makes a splash but our columnist finds it uneven los angeles molto mario batali has gone hollywood big time in collaboration with the celebrated local baker nancy silverton the burly new york based croc shod redheads four week old osteria mozza is the hit of the moment here in la la land actually its the bicoastal pairs second hit since the windfall bonanza of pizzeria mozza next door that prequel to the more elaborate osteria has been keeping valet parkers busy day and night since late last year while foodwise angelenos waited for the main attraction to open on a drab crossroads across from an oil change stop and near to the tattoos and kitsch of hollywood boulevard far from this madding crowd in quiet pasadenas old town where the valet parkers go home at a much less fizzy but no less serious take on the italian food heritage unspools nightly in the sedate dining room of tre venezie which specializes in recreating the specialties of venice and its austrian slovenian hinterland the eponymous three venices that comprise trieste friuli and the german speaking alto adige so the hungry gastronome willing to brave crowded freeways and beavering reservationists at mozza can sample an unavowed clash of two high concepts pitting native italians cooking the authentic dishes of their slavo teutonic homeland against a gifted italo american interpretation of mainline italian heritage foods in sharply contrasting neighborhoods and settings on the pacific rim los angeles benefits from both conceptions of la cucina italiana which epitomize the struggle over transplanting italy to american soil that began with the landfall of genoas impetuous son columbus mr batali is only the latest star chef to plant a flag on the opposite coast from the one where he made his name thomas keller wolfgang puck and michael mina have moved from left to right tom colicchio and charlie palmer have cut left from manhattan bases if you add similar star relocations to and from las vegas chicago philadelphia and miami individual brands formerly local institutions have now gone national some have flubbed the expansion test but many have managed their moves smoothly to their own and the gastronome publics benefit in los angeles it was definitely smart of mr batali to hook up with a local heroine ms silverton and he has interloped where many chefs from farther away than mr batalis native seattle have won fame and fortune with their versions of attitude and edible novelty wolfgang puck joachim splichal and nobu matsuhisa in fact angelenos loved osteria mozza months before it opened they showed their readiness by packing pizzeria mozza round the clock both mozzas short for mozzarella the water buffalo milk cheese from south of naples show mr batali at his earthy inventive best retooling italian farmhouse classics but the osteria achieved superlative results only in the earlier parts of the meal the appetizers and primi pasta and other lighter entrees that one could also get at the pizzeria secondi or main courses were curiously underwhelming unlike the full bore meat dishes he pulls off with flair at manhattans del posto which he operates with joe bastianich and his mother lidia the croatian triestian queen mother of manhattans italo eating scene this is exactly the turf that tre venezie claims in pasadena although it does so more singlemindedly the famous venetian buckwheat pasta bigoli comes in the classic anchovy sauce like something from an ethnographic museum but tasty alive even a food historian of italys hapsburg fringe may be surprised by a first course called cjalson a sort of half moon pastry stuffed with ricotta and fruit then covered in butter the name is from friuli northeast of venice but strikes me as a slovenian absorption of french chausson a similarly shaped turnover named after a low cut shoe the ravioli here contain beets among the main courses boreto is the signature dish of the island of grado in the adriatic a mixture of fish served on polenta lovers of the german standby kaestler rippchen or smoked pork chop will find a juicy one here the passion for authenticity stops sensibly with fish by embracing pacific species such as black cod osteria mozza also embraces an italian regional cuisine that of bologna where mr batali and his resident chef matt molina did research but the embrace is a loose one that allows for a wide panorama of dishes from other regions mr batali did his apprenticeship in europe the spiritual center of which seems to have been in an italian butcher shop in all his new york venues even the fish restaurant esca flesh is the star he made beef cheeks famous at babbo and for my money you will get closest to his ruling passion for meats of character at the little tapas place he calls casa mono monkey house no theres no chimp steak but how about ducks tongues tripe cocks combs casa mono is fortissimo mario sophistication at the abattoir i also like his luxury liner of a restaurant del posto which purveys big cuts of meat in a hypergrand setting near manhattans sputtering old gansevoort meat market but the mans heart an organ he must love to eat seems to beat fastest in a smaller racier kind of joint in the case of osteria mozza having eaten in the superb pizzeria mozza next door we were not surprised to find that all the antipasti and pasta dishes were sensational from the melting charred octopus to the perfect pasta with chopped chard and spicy sausage bits this was looking like a meal we would remember warmly for a long time our rapture had made us forget the bad feeling wed got from our waiter right after we sat down our fourth friend was still caught in traffic so we proposed to the amiable server that we might appease our appetites with a few appetizers while we waited amiability turned cold as gelato the waitperson made it clear that the custom in this place was to require that guests order all their courses antipasti primi and secondi all at once before the apparently beleaguered kitchen would schedule any of their orders this was a unique stricture in our experience it did not at all jibe with our idea of an osteria wed acquired in italy where such a place is normally the most free form of hostelries note the cognate with ristorante being the most formal and trattoria in between as one of us said "its not very italian to make people order more than one course ahead the waiter expressed amazement and grudgingly allowed as how maybe just this once but ever the conformists we waved him off and got with the program by the time the main courses trundled out we had given up trying to chat with each other so high was the din or to see what we were eating in the tenebrous dining room none of the dishes registered much on the rest of our sensory apparatus a fish was just the wrong side of overcooked and underflavored the arista a boned pork roast traditionally spitted with the skin on in tuscany was pink and chewy was this intentional if so it needs an explanation from the restaurant molto mario is going to fix all this were sure but meanwhile we hope that all the scenemakers pounding on the door of his osteria will free up some tables at the truly superb pizzeria next door oblivious to all this tre venezie went on vacation last week
