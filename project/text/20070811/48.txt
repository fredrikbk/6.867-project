pursuits sports golf journal the habits you love to hate readers weigh in on golfs irritations but revel in them too a round with the cliche master what a delight it was to read the responses to last weeks column on annoying golfers most of those who wrote added their own lists of favorite irritations jim hatfield of glen ellyn ill for instance contributed a complete taxonomy detailing species such as the walking rule book "just so you know if you hit your golf bag its a two stroke penalty " and the cliche master "that putts afraid of the dark " some might consider rants about annoyances antithetical to the spirit of a game that is after all supposed to be fun but the majority of the emails and forum postings at wsj com werent so much lamenting the aggravations as reveling in them the scots who have to play a lot of golf in nasty weather have an expression "nae wind nae rain nae golf " maybe we should add "nae annoyance " this isnt to say that there wasnt some genuine grumbling about round spoiling irritations several readers chided me for not focusing more on the toxic effect of "perpetually angry" golfers "i have played rounds with guys i believe starting getting mad the moment they slammed the trunk of their car in the course parking lot " wrote a reader from washington another reader described playing with a business contact who smashed so many clubs including several into the roof and sides of their cart that he felt physically intimidated although not so much that he didnt still beat the guy by nine strokes and naturally there was a veritable gripefest about slow play always the chart topper when it comes to golf complaints its amazing how many different ways golfers have stumbled upon to irritate their peers or to be irritated by them readers were lavish in their prose about players who take seconds teeing up their ball wait for greens to clear yards ahead before hitting their approach shots give impromptu lessons to each other midround and tally up their scores while standing on the green the fundamental slow play problem seems to be simply that people enjoy the game at different speeds "i have never met a slow player who knows he is slow everyone else is in a hurry " observed dwight rounds of austin texas cumulatively the emails created a portrait of golfers as kids squabbling over a single fabulous toy in this case the golf course that each wants to play with in his or her own particular way the wonder really is that golfers do as good a job of sharing as they do in my experience despite the whining of the time players are sincerely smiling when they doff their hats on the th green and shake hands i would classify the vast majority of the responses to last weeks column as peccadilloes rather than grievances who knew for instance how many people find obsessive ball retrievers annoying these good shepherds to use mr hatfields term seem to spend more time hunting and fishing for balls than they do playing the game "if youre using golf balls that require more than a two minute search then you might consider cheaper balls or buying them on ebay " advised greg wert of detroit more readers than i expected find cigars on the golf course annoying "there have been times i wished that some of my shots had traveled as far as that annoying odor " wrote jeffrey shein of millwood n y the vehemence against chronic on course cellphone and blackberry use was similarly intense but not nearly as much as that against unsolicited swing advice "smooth swing tommy stand up straighter tommy oh you bent your elbow on that one " is some of the advice recently given to tom tierney of jacksonville fla at least a half dozen readers pointed out how frequently the givers of all this advice are themselves unable to break "this type of golfer should be kindly reminded of a broader truism specifically those who can do those who cant teach " said one i also received many responses from women apparently guys women arent buying it when we harrumph about how much farther we usually hit our drives and how much better we usually play neither are they impressed when pro like we take minutes judiciously deciding which club to hit "this type usually guarantees that the marshal and the guys behind will be blaming the slow pace of play on us women in the group " wrote linda mandolini of oakland calif among other things the emails have convinced me is never henceforth to say "good putt" or "good shot" until the ball either goes in the hole or lands safely and not to brag "i really hit that one well dont you think " more than say twice a round but a good many readers far more than i would have thought took offense at my column "if youre so easily annoyed on the course may i suggest a new game for you solitaire " wrote one "my vote for the number one most annoying golfer is well you " said another several suggested i see a shrink about my condition but almost all of these correspondents i noticed were either rank beginners understandably defensive perhaps about their games or confirmed nongolfers "as a recent retiree several of my friends have been urging me to take up golf after reading your column saturday i think ill pass " one gentleman wrote another professed nonparticipant offered this "other than enjoying the views or a little walk in the fresh air theres nothing about golf to take seriously in any way shape or form " these folks just dont get it in my view the seriousness with which a person takes the game is a measure of the degree to which he or she is truly playing watch the faces of a group of kids playing soldier in the woods sometimes or of girls playing dollhouse they are usually dead serious no sane golfer confuses a three foot putt with something really important except in the moment of standing over it in what other activity are we grown ups so happily able to suspend our disbelief furthermore as i alluded to at the top golfers revel in their griping my favorite single email came from jack phillips of san diego he elaborated on three types of players he found especially annoying before concluding "the three golfers described above constitute my golf foursome for the last years wouldnt give them up for all the tea in china " email me at golfjournal wsj com
