taxes once you go flat you never go back phil kerpens op ed "the smart way to soak the rich " july misses the point too many people are trying to convolute the issue of the carried interest tax by claiming that it "punishes" the rich and what affect it will have on investment the argument should focus on whether or not the carried interest is a capital gain at all i manage someone elses restaurant for a living so i am subject to a tax on my income what i have left after taxes i may chose to risk in equities real estate or some other asset class because i put my capital at risk i am subject to a capital gains tax if there is a realized profit when a hedge fund or private equity manager risks someone elses money and makes a percentage of their investors profit how can one argue that this carried interest is a capital gain the only risk the managers are exposed to is a risk to some of their income if the fund fails to produce a profit the investors of the funds have their capital risk and are therefore entitled to the lower tax rate david ellsweig aspen colo while mr kerpen insightfully points out the disparity between the tax treatment of individual and corporate capital gains efforts to alter the taxation of private equity partnership "carried interest" should also be seen as the broader opportunity to embrace intelligent tax reform or specifically to enact a flat tax the situation presents the opportunity to create a "perfect storm" where all income irrespective of the source or to whom it is paid is taxed at the lower rate the result would be a true flat tax to encourage the more effective deployment of capital and to increase individual productivity by removing the disincentives created by punitive taxation fred medero san francisco first congress passes the alternative minimum tax amt but conveniently doesnt index it for inflation essentially guaranteeing that it will eventually affect a huge percentage of all taxpayers and target unconscionably large amounts of additional taxes then congress agrees on what sounds like a plausible budget approach the so called "paygo" system whereby any tax cut must be offset by some other tax increase absent spending reductions if this logic were followed it would cement into place forever the totally ill gotten exponentially increasing tax revenues due to the original error of the amt not being indexed for inflation how stupid do the politicians think we are warren hausman stanford calif mr kerpen suggests that we keep the capital gain rate low because so many of the middle class are now in the investment class he states that two thirds now own stocks what he fails to mention is that most of those two thirds have most if not all of their equity holdings in k plans as mr kerpen must know when that money is removed from the k it is taxed as ordinary income up to a rate once upon a time circa the reagan era the tax rate on both income and capital gain was capped at a rate if mr kerpen really wants to make things fair for the middle class he would call for splitting the difference between the cap gain rate and income rate at a rate on all income steve walde easton conn
