pursuits the race where horses die a washington towns year old tradition persists drawing devoted fans and the critics who want to shut it down omak wash a gunshot rang out whips flew war cries echoed and in a cloud of dust two weeks ago an avalanche of men and horses plunged down suicide hill a foot slope at a steep degree angle to the okanogan river when the dust settled chavez a year old running quarter horse thrashed frantically to keep from drowning george marchand the horses owner dove into the river in his t shirt and jeans and after a rescue boat ferried the horse to shallow water he pleaded with his horse to stand up his voice filled with despair "come on son come on son " the horse had broken its back in a collision during an elimination heat in preparation for this weekends omak suicide race after half a dozen men struggled to load the horse into a trailer mr marchand took chavez home where he ended the animals life with a shotgun "the one thing i will not let a horse do is suffer " says the year old colville indian for more than years cowboys and indians have gathered here in the rolling sagebrush hills of central washington every august for the annual omak stampede and the rodeos biggest draw the suicide race in four races over four days that began thursday riders simultaneously sprint their horses at full gallop down the hill and across the river to a rodeo arena the first three races are run at night with floodlights to light the hill in thursday nights race one rider was thrown from his mount as the horses barrelled down the hill the horse finished the race riderless to the colville confederated tribes whose million acre reservation borders omak the annual race is a tradition that extends back to the tribes days as horse warriors in the wild west to animal rights groups though it is a banner example of animal cruelty that has no place in modern society at a time when states are banning cockfights and testing cosmetics on animals is considered politically incorrect the suicide race is a surprising holdout it is one of a handful of tourist attractions around the world that draw crowds to watch animals fighting each other or facing extreme danger in pamplona spain for instance thousands of spectators descend for the perilous running of the bulls which precedes the towns storied bullfights in western turkey tribal camel wrestling remains a popular winter pastime meanwhile in bangkok cock fighting tournaments continue to draw big audiences the omak suicide race manages to hold on because of tradition and also the economic boost it delivers for the city the fact that the colville tribes claim the horse race as a link to their indian heritage adds an extra dimension to the debate john sirois a cultural preservation administrator for the tribes says the race is spiritual many riders pray in sweat lodges to prepare for their races and adorn their horses with sacred eagle feathers the competition is the ultimate demonstration of the riders ability to become one with the horse he says the suicide race has passionate fans who say it would be wrong to mess with tradition some people attend the rodeo and suicide race every year many from the western u s and canada but some from as far away as germany and france according to organizers of the event city and race officials say the race is the main draw in a dispute between the tribe and the city cancelled the race and rodeo attendance fell by more than half daryl bjork a retired trucker from langley wash a five hour drive from omak has been a regular at the rodeo and suicide race for about years he describes the race as "the most amazing thing youve ever seen " this year he came with his wife in the couples camper which was parked in a field outside the arena that was filled with hundreds of motor homes trucks and cars "you name it theyre here " he says over the years mr bjork has seen several horse injuries at the race some fatal and says "it is sad when a horse goes down " but the race is an important tradition that should be allowed to continue he says animal rights groups have been pushing for an end to the race for about years during which at least horses including chavez have died three horses died in the race riders are sometimes injured in collisions but no riders have died in decades progressive animal welfare society or paws and the humane society of the united states have posted footage on youtube that shows some horses somersaulting or straining to keep their heads above the river water other animal rights groups have targeted the events sponsors and the rodeos main sanctioning body in an effort to bleed the race of funding but after wal mart stores inc and british liquor maker diageo plc withdrew their sponsorship totaling &# two years ago organizers went out and brought in more than &# from local businesses and the local food workers union decades of criticism have only emboldened omak a town of about an hour from the canadian border to rally around the event race organizers estimate the economic benefit at &# million but the city taking into account indirect revenue says the return is probably twice that "these outsiders are coming in and trying to tell us how to do everything " says the towns mayor dale sparber mr sparber who has lived in omak for years and has been in local politics for of them displays his framed certificate of election on his wall along with three pictures of bald eagles "leaders are like eagles " says the quote on one picture "they dont flock you find them one at a time " animal rights groups have encouraged their supporters to email mr sparber and he says he receives to messages a day he has set up his inbox so that it automatically filters out email containing the phrase "suicide race" and forwards it to his "delete" file the omak race has its origins in the indian races of the late th century near keller wash where riders managed a punishing four mile endurance course in a river basin that was flooded after construction on the grand coulee dam began in but it was claire pentz a white furniture salesman and publicity director for the omak stampede who first pitched the suicide race in to help drum up interest in the towns rodeo in its early days racers often drank heavily before taking the plunge and carried wooden clubs to beat other jockeys and horses today most riders wear helmets and all are required to wear life jackets but they say the thrill is the same "no drug out there could match that adrenaline rush " says darnell sam a business manager for the tribes auto service department who has raced intermittently since most of the riders are members of one of the colville tribes which have more than members each night the top four jockeys and owners take a share of a purse which reached &# last year tyler peasley took first place each night last year netting him around &# as the overall champion or "king of the hill " he also won a saddle a belt buckle a pendleton blanket and two beaded eagle feathers sporting a baseball cap t shirt cargo shorts and flip flops he says that most riders run primarily for the respect of peers and not for the money which hardly covers the costs of caring for a horse during a practice run last month bryce curry flew off the front of his horse when the animal bucked as it jumped off the hill into the water the horse finished the race without a scratch but mr curry was taken from the river unconscious and rushed to the hospital where two staples closed a gash in the back of his head "you were a floater when we went to pull you out " a rescue worker later told him the following week the year old alfalfa farmer and one of the few non indian riders was back on the hill racing again "im not going to finish on a poor note " he says mr currys strategy is to "go so fast that you dont give your horse time to balk theres no time to slow down if you do youre dead or hurt with horses coming right over you " he says in april the state legislature approved &# million to build a new arena for the omak stampede citing the need for economic development in the town some legislators from the urban western parts of the state were opposed either on humanitarian grounds or simply because it wasnt a priority for them but some relaxed their opposition after visiting the town and seeing the race mark ericks a state legislator from bothell wash outside seattle says the event was a "culture shock" for someone who had never been to a rodeo or ridden a horse but he says he was impressed by the racers and their families "if the issue was give us money so we can make the hill steeper id say forget it " he says "thats not what we did " as activists plot their next move they say theyre fast running out of ideas "weve tried everything " says jennifer hillman who spent five years at paws before joining the humane society of the united states mr marchand who drives a truck at the local sawmill grew up watching his father and uncle ride in the race and ran his first suicide race when he was he says hell help his daughters ages and train for the race if they choose to ride in it someday the horse deaths are "an ugly part of the race " mr marchand says but he believes the contest gets an unfair rap "they kill more horses on the race track than they do here " he says he says omak riders spend several months training their horses for the race and care for them like family while horse racing has provided a number of highlights for mr marchand he is a three time suicide race winner it has also been a source of tragedy his father jim marchand died from internal injuries after tumbling from his horse in an indian relay race at wellpinit wash in when mr marchand raced in his own horse wauseka was killed after suffering a broken pelvis "i bawled my eyeballs out that horse was my partner " says mr marchand who owns about horses organizers say theyve taken steps to make the race safer including physical tests and veterinary inspections before and after each race "were not horse killers " says mr sam who lost his horse quilkin in and now mans the boat that rescues injured horses and riders after the hill collision two weeks ago involving chavez organizers and the local police cleared the riverbank of a few hundred spectators to prevent anyone from taking photographs during night races organizers turn out the floodlights when they clean up a wreck in okanogan county and the stampede organizers were forced to pay &# to an animal rights activist whose cameras had been thrown into the river as he tried to document the euthanizing of an injured horse after burying chavez on his ranch two weeks ago mr marchand took one of the eagle feathers that his horse had worn on his mane during the race and tied it to the pine tree above the fresh grave "theres another horse out there for me ill be looking " he says
