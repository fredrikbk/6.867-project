this years first half now with investors in a near panic over rising defaults on mortgages countrywide has more immediate priorities it must shore up its own finances and reassure investors that it has plenty of cash to survive the storm the companys stock fell friday after it warned late thursday that "unprecedented disruptions" in credit markets would have an "unknown" effect on its business countrywides debt is trading at junk levels despite investment grade ratings though most analysts continue to see countrywide as strong enough to withstand the scare the calabasas calif company faces a jolting ride over at least the next few months countrywides financial health matters beyond wall street it is the largest u s home mortgage lender in terms of loan volume making or providing funding for nearly one of every five home loans granted in the u s it also acts as the "servicer" meaning it collects payments and duns delinquent borrowers for about &# trillion in home loans around of those outstanding countrywide and most other lenders count on selling the bulk of their loans for years big investors were happy to snap up bundles of home loans packaged into bonds now investors are panicky over falling house prices and rising defaults and theyre refusing to buy many home loans even aaa rated bonds backed by subprime loans to borrowers with poor credit are deeply out of favor such bonds are now trading for cents on the dollar down from cents a month ago according to an index that tracks them countrywide and others are being forced to limit their lending to what they can keep or what they can sell to fannie mae and freddie mac the government sponsored mortgage investors who buy only loans that fit their relatively conservative standards loans insured by the federal housing administration or the department of veterans affairs accounting for around of the market also remain in favor with investors "this is not over " says walter schmidt a senior vice president at ftn financial capital markets in chicago "the markets very jittery " until it calms loan volume will be much lower than normal and people with bad credit or no down payment will have a hard time finding willing lenders for lenders the market mayhem has big accounting consequences they may have to write down the market value of loans and related securities held on their books they also must put aside money as provisions for loans that have gone bad or are likely to the result will be sharply lower profits at some lenders and losses at others according to thomson financial the average analyst forecast calls for countrywides earnings per share to fall to &# this year from &# in despite the turmoil countrywides loan volume is holding up so far as it takes market share from competitors david sambol the companys president and chief operating officer said in an interview friday he said countrywide should emerge as a big winner from the industry shakeout "we feel very good" about sources of funding available to the company he added countrywides bronx n y born founder and chief executive angelo mozilo regularly reminds investors that hes been through many ups and downs in the mortgage market the son of a butcher of italian descent he got his start in the business at age as a messenger for a new york mortgage company in he and a colleague set up their own two man mortgage company at a time when home lending was mainly a local business they had the audacity to call their firm countrywide while credited with building a giant lender whose shares have shown outstanding performance over the long term mr mozilo years old is often criticized for his compensation last year his base salary bonus and equity incentive pay totaled &# million and he realized &# million from exercising stock options countrywide has said his pay will drop by as much as this year mr mozilo regularly sells stock in the company as part of what he describes as a diversification of his assets mr mozilo also is known for blunt speech he remarked in a conference call with analysts last year that big wall street firms competing with countrywide "dont know anything about the mortgage business " he once dismissed efforts by rivals to gain tax advantages by converting themselves into real estate investment trusts as equivalent to "putting lipstick on a pig " on friday the price of protection against a default by countrywide on its debts shot up it now costs investors &# annually to insure &# million in countrywide bonds from default over the next five years up from &# on thursday and &# a month ago according to data from cma datavision and markit group some countrywide bonds are yielding percentage points above yields on treasury bonds that is a spread comparable to junk bonds although countrywide has investment grade credit ratings from standard &amp poors and moodys investors service several dozen mortgage lenders have closed down in the past six months including two major ones new century financial corp and american home mortgage investment corp unlike those lenders though countrywide owns a sizable deposit taking bank that gives it more sources of low cost funding including its customers deposits it can also borrow from the federal home loan banks cooperatives owned by lenders a report released monday by the bond research firm creditsights inc concluded that countrywides sources of funding "remain ample " those sources include commercial paper borrowings and lines of credit from financial institutions creditsights also said countrywide could be "an attractive takeover play" for a large bank eager to expand in mortgages as of june countrywide says it had &# billion of "highly reliable short term funding liquidity available " even in a bleak scenario in which creditors cut off funding countrywide could drastically curtail lending and limp along for a time mr sambol said countrywide is still hiring more loan officers its loan origination work force grew to in june up from the end of as countrywide hired people from weaker lenders countrywides share of the loan origination market grew to in the first half from in all of according to inside mortgage finance a trade publication no wells fargo &amp co fell to in this years first half from for all of during the housing boom countrywide was a big player in some of the riskiest and most lucrative loans such as those that start out with very low "teaser" interest rates countrywide could sell these loans to investors at a big profit better yet borrowers were coached to refinance into another loan after a few years to avoid a jump in payments that generated a new round of fees and profits now politicians and regulators are pressing the industry to concentrate on "sustainable" loans that dont lead to sharply higher payments after a few years consumers also are growing cautious meaning the industry may have fewer chances to profit from refinancing the entire mortgage market is likely to continue shrinking for at least the next year or two as a weak housing market leads to fewer transactions countrywide is likely to have a bumpier ride than bigger and more diversified rivals such as wells and citigroup inc that are less dependent on mortgages for their overall profit countrywide was a leading promoter of pay option adjustable rate mortgages known as option arms these give borrowers several choices each month including paying no principal and less than the full amount of interest normally due if they take that route their loan balance grows setting them up for much higher payments later on countrywide holds &# billion of option arms on its books and their quality is deteriorating payments were days or more overdue on of them as of june compared with a year earlier the company has scaled back its lending to subprime borrowers those with the weakest credit records to of loans originated in the second quarter from a year earlier but it retains exposure to many past subprime and other risky loans sold to other parties when loans are packaged into securities and sold lenders such as countrywide often keep a portion of the securities known as "residuals " this portion bears the first losses from defaults as of june countrywide had &# billion of those residuals whose value will fall or even vanish if defaults continue to rise rapidly mr mozilo has conceded that countrywide made some mistakes during the boom but getting out of all the riskier types of loans before the housing market cooled "would have been an insight that only i think a superior spirit could have had at that time " he said in a july conference call and countrywide didnt want to cede market share "knowing what we know now " he added "we would have done a lot of things differently the fact is we didnt know "
