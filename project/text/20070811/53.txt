executive who became a poet of processed meat as a teenager jerry ringlien worked at a grocery store in eau claire wis and according to his wife barbara "he just fell in love with meat " it was a relationship that served him well mr ringlien went on to become a longtime executive at oscar mayer where he helped create some of the most memorable commercials in pop culture history including the "my bologna has a first name" spot which debuted in the campaign using a jingle created by the companys advertising agency continues to play a significant role in the brands marketing nearly a decade earlier he was part of the team that ushered in another ode to processed meat the "i wish i were an oscar mayer wiener" jingle just days before he passed away on july in wilkesboro n c mr ringlien recounted the advertising campaigns in a video shot by his son who posted it on youtube "hot dogs were easy " he said "its pretty hard to drum up a lot of interest in a slice of bologna " but mr ringlien had a knack for selling beef according to mr ringliens son bradley the grocery store owner in eau claire didnt know much about meat so he "basically handed the whole opportunity over" to mr ringlien soon after "people were coming in and asking for my dad asking him to cut their meat or to make suggestions " says bradley ringlien "he really loved the whole process " indeed mr ringlien often used his kids as guinea pigs for new oscar mayer products like hot dogs filled with cheese "we learned to be pretty suspicious anytime he said here try this " says bradley ringlien after serving in the air force and graduating from the university of wisconsin in mr ringlien was hired by oscar mayer as part of a special training program to groom the next generation of managers several members of mr ringliens group went on to become senior executives including jim mcvey oscar mayers chief executive during the s "we worked in every part of the plant even the actual meat processing just so we could say we did it " says mr mcvey who retired in mr ringliens first brush with advertising success came in the early s when chairman oscar g mayer came to the marketing division and issued a demand he wanted a catchy jingle for radio and tv ads within days or else he would make them use an old mayer family song in the companys commercials "we were in a panic " says mr ringlien in the online video the solution came from richard trentlage a songwriter from indiana who brought in a recording of "i wish i were an oscar mayer wiener " sung by his own kids the jingle and its accompanying tv spot featuring animated children is now considered a classic but at the time some oscar mayer executives felt the song should be rerecorded with adult voices which mr ringlien opposed to prove his point he tested the jingle in houston where oscar mayer did almost no business in "before long we got tons of mail and we knew that we had a winner " he says in the interview with his son by the mid s bologna had become a hot product for oscar mayer and as vice president of marketing mr ringlien was charged with executing a campaign for the lunch meat writers at j walter thompson the companys long time agency came up with the catchy "my bologna" jingle for the commercial the plan was to edit images of several kids singing different parts of the song after a long day of shooting just as mr ringlien was getting ready to leave the director asked if any of the kids could recite the entire jingle for the camera sure enough one curly haired boy volunteered and sang perfectly the next day after hours of looking at footage the advertising team finally saw the boys rendition of the whole song "i looked at it one time and said thats the commercial " says mr ringlien in the interview after some initial objections the company went ahead with the spot entitled "the fisherman" and it soon caught fire "very rarely do you hit that kind of home run once in a business life " says mr mcvey the former ceo "we were able to do it twice " mr ringlien left the company in in part because he was passed over for the ceo job at oscar mayer now owned by kraft foods inc which went to mr mcvey he later worked at a number of companies including armour processed meat co holly farms tyson foods and as a consultant for coleman natural meats and perdue the poultry company email remembrances wsj com
