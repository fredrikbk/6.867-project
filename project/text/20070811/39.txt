pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink in praise of orphan brands not long ago i was rummaging through the shelves of my local liquor store and spotted a bottle i hadnt seen for years a scotch with a faded yellow low res label featuring a photocopy quality picture of sheep farmers herding a flock through the english village of oldbury the bottle i had found was something of an artifact a lone and dusty example of "sheep dip " a quirky brand that enjoyed a fervent underground following in the s and s so what ever happened to sheep dip to my delight i discovered that the brand which disappeared from the market around the turn of the millennium has recently been revived and is just now working its way back into stores sheep dip is a classic example of an "orphan brand " originally made just for the anchor inn a pub in gloucestershire where the local rustics slang for whisky is "sheep dip" the scotch grew into a nationally distributed brand sheep dip was successful enough to catch the attention of a major producer invergordon which took over the brand in the early s but soon invergordon was swallowed by whyte &amp mackay which was part of what is now called fortune brands home of jim beam courvoisier sauza tequila and titleist golf balls and moen faucets for that matter sheep dip wasnt even a rounding error for its corporate parent which eventually let the whisky drift into oblivion a former marketing director for glenmorangie single malt alex nicol spotted the opportunity in the defunct brand for the big conglomerates sheep dip "wasnt worth getting out of bed " he says but for a small start up like the spencerfield spirit company he was setting up the whisky came with a built in base of customers a base perplexed at the brands disappearance and eager for its return two years ago mr nicol made a deal for the rights to the brand and set about reviving it sheep dip always had two chief sources of appeal the first was that it was very good whisky a vatted malt blend made exclusively from single malts without any of the generic grain whisky that goes into most scotch blends but perhaps more important was the off beat branding decidedly unslick and antipretentious a brand like sheep dip short circuits the one upmanship of connoisseurism declaring that whisky is something simply to be enjoyed or as mr nicol puts it a dram should be about "having fun not taking yourself so bloody serious " mr nicol turned to well regarded whisky blender richard paterson to re create and upgrade the old sheep dip mix of single malt whiskies comparing my recently acquired vintage bottle with the new stuff i found that sheep dip is true to the original but more polished with admirable depth and complexity mr nicol also updated the look of the label which may distress the most catholic of sheep dip aficionados but the illustration of an angry ram that took the place of the oldbury sheep drive maintains the quirky feel of the brand while signaling a stepped up panache orphan brands abound in the world of drink the pabst brewing company has made a specialty of marketing orphan beers the strategy developed almost by accident as pabst acquired a slate of small local beer brands with do not resuscitate orders marked on their charts lone star beer was one of many with a similar path into the pabst stable the brand was bought by the olympia brewery which was later bought by heileman which was later bought by stroh which eventually sold out to pabst advertising accounts for a hefty chunk of the cost of a can of beer but drinkers loyal to their traditional local brew such as national bohemian in baltimore another pabst owned brand dont need to be lured with advertising pabst further keeps its costs down by not even owning a working brewery the company hires miller to brew its various "local" beers as needed orphan brands can be mined for their residual value or they can be revived in earnest which is what happened with plymouth gin a storied brand fallen on hard times some early martini recipes specified plymouth gin and the classic savoy cocktail book compiled from the recipes used at londons savoy hotel called for using plymouth in several drinks among them is a terrific s cocktail called the charlie lindbergh made with plymouth lillet apricot flavored brandy and orange bitters and when it came to gin and bitters plymouth was the brand of preference for the british navys pink gins in the years before world war ii plymouth was selling a million cases a year but by the brand was sadly diminished producing only cases for two more decades the factory managed to limp along tossed from conglomerate to conglomerate as the gin was cheapened and the brand degraded come the lights were about to get turned off for good at the plymouth distillery when four investors bought the brand and the plant a th century monastery outfitted with an pot still they restored the distillery and the quality of the gin which soon became a favorite with hard core cocktail geeks looking for authentic products to put in classic drinks soon plymouth was selling enough to attract the attention of the major players and was bought a few years ago by vin &amp spirit the swedish government owned distillers who make absolut vodka with their distribution muscle plymouth is now available in stores most everywhere which comes in handy if you want to make a martini according to the original specifications but be sure to try it soon because you never know how long any brand will be with us the swedish parliament voted in june to sell vin &amp spirit part of a free market campaign to get out of the business of state owned businesses a bidding war for v&amp s is expected with absolut as the prize lets just hope that plymouth isnt orphaned all over again charlie lindbergh  oz plymouth gin  oz lillet blanc  oz apricot flavored brandy  dash orange bitters shake with ice and strain into a stemmed cocktail glass
