pursuits books five best listen children and you shall hear these books are especially enthralling when read aloud says meghan cox gurdon the journals childrens book critic  charlie and the chocolate factory by roald dahl knopf no one questions the civilizing utility of reading aloud to children nor is there much doubt that the young will cheerfully sit still for almost any story so long as its read with a bit of style the trick is to find picture books for small children that can stand frequent re readings "again again " and longer narratives for older listeners that wont drive you half mad with over long sentences irritating digressions or endless landscape description this childrens favorite is in my opinion the gold standard of read alouds for ages and when read aloud far surpasses any of its flashy film versions the sentences are crisp the plot is full of surprises and best of all virtually every character lends itself to a rich fruity accent in our household for instance the eccentric chocolatier willy wonka is german "velcome to ze fectory " grandpa joe is irish and the intolerably spoiled veruca salt comes from dixie "ahve decided ah want a squirrel git me one of those squirrels" that this approach creates a pig pile of regional twangs only adds to the mad joy of the story  half magic by edward eager harcourt brace in this droll classic set in the s four siblings find an object that resembles a nickel but that is in fact an ancient talisman with a curious power whatever one wants one gets it by halves so when mark wishes the children were all on a desert island they get only as far as a desert when martha longs for the family cat to talk suddenly the creature can sort of "idlwidl baxbix " is the type of thing she says which makes young listeners fall about laughing over the course of the childrens adventures they are kidnapped by an itinerant arab trounce sir launcelot on the jousting field right before king arthurs horrified eyes and inadvertently transport their mother onto the back of a circus steed "half magic" is lightly peppered with literary references to longfellow lewis carroll hans christian andersen et al that not all children age will recognize but that the alert adult may take pleasure in explaining along the way  just william by richmal crompton newnes london these brilliantly funny stories require some skill on the part of the reader a certain archness in the descriptive bits and british accents for the dialogue but theyre infinitely worth the effort the escapades of year old english schoolboy william brown and his doughty companions the outlaws first began appearing in british magazines in a dozen were collected for "just william" three years later and more compilations ensued until the authors death in over the decades no matter how detestable the houseguest devious the schoolmate or dull the drizzly afternoon our incorrigible boy always wins out try this passage aloud where william realizes the comic potential of a new toy and youll see what i mean about archness "he had bought a balloon adorned with the legs and head of a duck fashioned in cardboard this could be blown up to its fullest extent and then left to subside it took several minutes for it to subside and during those minutes it emitted a long draw out and high pitched groan the advantage of this was obvious "  anatole by eve titus illustrated by paul galdone mcgraw hill i dont know why it is but few english speakers fail to enjoy putting on the occasional outrageous french accent this wonderful picture book for children
