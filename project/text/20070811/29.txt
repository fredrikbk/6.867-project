whole conversation about fidelity and market share is tied directly to the performance of magellan " says john bonnanzio editor of fidelity insight an independent newsletter magellan he says "arguably made fidelity " its current manager mr lange has been remaking it after taking over in november he tossed out many household names in the portfolio that made the fund seem more like a plain vanilla index tracking fund as opposed to one that justified the higher fees charged for its active money management staff in the process he has made the fund edgier and probably riskier like it was in its heyday in the s under legendary money manager peter lynch some analysts expect that one of mr lawsons next moves will be to make magellan more widely available as a way to try to showcase its regained luster the fund has been closed to new individual investors since september fidelity declined to comment about its plans for magellan even though it is still arguably fidelitys best known name

seeking comment among the stocks mr lange ejected household names general electric co home depot inc and time warner inc he bought heavily in the technology sector which now carries twice the weighting in magellan than it does in the market as a whole among the funds biggest holdings are botox maker allergan inc and disk drive maker seagate technology in a play on the flat screen tv boom mr lange bought corning inc which crafts the specialized glass corning magellans second biggest holding is up about this year mr langes top holding is nokia corp that was inspired by a trip to china during which he saw a nokia store "on every block" and noticed that even poorer consumers in china would spend extra for higher priced phones "many dont have phones at home so theyre willing to put a bigger portion of their net worth into their cellphones " he says nokia is up about so far this year overall he has increased overseas holdings by since taking over from mr stansky "consumers outside of the u s are now a lot more important than in the u s " he says "we look down the street and see that a house hasnt sold for six months and get a gloomy outlook but its not so gloomy in india and china "
