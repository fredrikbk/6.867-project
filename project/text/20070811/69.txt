the forbidden city of terry gou his complex in china turns out iphones and pcs powering the biggest exporter youve never heard of shenzhen china past a guarded gate on the outskirts of this city sits one of the worlds largest factories in dozens of squat buildings it churns out gadgets bearing technologys household names apple inc s ipods and iphones hewlett packard co s personal computers motorola inc mobile phones and nintendo co wii videogame consoles few people outside of the industry know of the plants owner hon hai precision industry co with a work force of some about as big as the population of newark n j the factory is a bustling testament to the ambition of hon hais founder terry gou in an era when manufacturing has been defined by outsourcing no one has done more to shift global electronics production to china little noticed by the wider world mr gou has turned his company into chinas biggest exporter and the worlds biggest contract manufacturer of electronics hon hais revenue has grown more than a year in the past decade to &# billion last year it is expected to add &# billion in revenue this year that is roughly the equivalent of motorolas adding within a year the sales of cbs corp throughout his companys rise the year old native of taiwan has maintained a low profile publicity he says risks helping competitors and alienating customers "i hate that i have become famous " mr gou said in a recent three hour interview at hon hais taiwan headquarters it was mr gous first interview with western media since following more than five years of requests by the wall street journal "we are so big we cannot hide anymore " hon hai and its massive shenzhen plant provides a window into the sometimes secretive world of manufacturing in china confidentiality is a selling point for contract manufacturers whose customers count on them to shield their products and plans from outsiders secrecy has also been a central issue in chinas recent tainted product scandal with the often quiet relationship between u s companies and their suppliers complicating regulators hunt for the source of defective goods recently citing ongoing investigations mattel inc took nearly a week to identify its chinese provider of toys believed to contain lead paint hon hai hasnt been involved in such scandals and analysts and industry insiders say mr gou has combined discretion with a solid record of quality control and competitive pricing to build a booming empire the &# billion market capitalization of hon hai a public company listed in taiwan which uses the trade name foxconn is equal to that of its biggest global rivals combined mr gou and hon hai control additional affiliates that report revenue separately mr gou is currently worth about &# billion a hon hai spokesman says the company guards its customers identities although some of them are named in its chinese language filings to securities regulators hon hai and its affiliates make products not only for apple nintendo h p and motorola but also cellphones and parts for nokia corp playstation sets for sony corp and computer parts for dell inc those companies did not dispute their relationship with the manufacturer hon hai is also currently the exclusive supplier of apples iphones and one of the few makers of ipods taiwan based analysts say apple acknowledged that hon hai is a supplier but declined to comment further at the center of mr gous empire is his walled shenzhen facility the longhua science &amp technology park which covers about a square mile aside from customers few outsiders set foot inside a reporter visiting longhua was barred from viewing protected areas or taking photographs of more than a few scenes in addition to its dozens of assembly lines and dormitories longhua has a fire brigade hospital and employee swimming pool where mr gou does early morning laps when he is there restaurants banks a grocery store and an internet cafe line the company towns main drag more than monitors around the campus show exercise programs worker safety videos and company news produced by the in house television network foxconn tv even the plants manhole covers are stamped "foxconn " james lee a heavy smoking former banker whom mr gou tapped to run the plant in is longhuas de facto mayor mr lee frets about how to provide more than lunches every day in the cavernous employee canteens thats about metric tons of dry rice per meal at one bowl each he oversees landscaping uniform buying dormitory building and hiring as many as new workers a day during peak periods his administration employs more than security guards to keep order and prevent unauthorized visitors from sensitive areas administrators also battle what he calls new employees tendency to litter "i have to resolve every single small problem on this campus with the exception of production " he says over a "foxconn coffee" at a company restaurant he jokes "would you want this job " now the plants space is running out "we never thought we would expand so fast " says mr lee the founders personality permeates the site and company a charismatic man who inspires intense loyalty among his lieutenants mr gou runs hon hai with the power of a warlord on his right wrist he wears a beaded bracelet he got from a temple dedicated to genghis khan the th century mongolian conqueror whom he calls a personal hero "i always tell employees the groups benefit is more important than your personal benefit " mr gou says mr gou has combined a competitive drive with a business model that lets the company build much of its products in house saving money on parts his zeal for cost cutting prompted a fellow executive to quip several years ago that mr gou is "worth about &# billion in nickels and dimes " longhuas workers tend assembly lines in shifts around the clock they earn wages that seem meager by developed world standards but are enough to keep new recruits streaming through its gates the most basic assembly line jobs pay about cents an hour the legal minimum although workers can earn higher wages for overtime meals are subsidized most workers live rent free in company dormitories inside the walls or off campus last year a british tabloid alleged poor treatment of longhuas workers specifically those who make apples ipods there at the time apple reported that nearly one seventh of longhuas workers made apple products the british account was followed by criticism of the company in the chinese press apple sent a team to investigate and found a handful of violations of its supplier code of conduct including over crowding at three off site dorms according to a report the company issued last august apple which asks suppliers to limit workers to hours of labor a week except in emergencies estimated that one third of longhuas workers exceeded the limit it did not find evidence of forced overtime overall apple found hon hai to be in compliance with its guidelines "in the majority of areas " it said in the report apple declined to comment further hon hai executives say conditions for their workers are better than the average in china which helps them attract new workers they say they have built new dorms at the plant and taken other measures to address apples concerns mr gou angrily dismisses the critical coverage mr gou started what would become hon hai in he borrowed part of the initial investment of &# from his mother who with his father had fled to taiwan in during chinas civil war in a facility near taipei he began making plastic channel changing knobs for black and white television sets in the early s he expanded into the pc industry just as it started to take off his first products were connectors the relatively simple but ubiquitous parts that join components in a pc though he spoke little english or japanese he soon began traveling to the u s and japan seeking out customers during the s and s he says he logged so much time driving from city to city in the u s that he memorized the menu at dennys in with orders surging and costs soaring in taiwan mr gou set up his first factory in china where land and labor were cheaper decades old tensions between taipei and beijing were starting to wane and china was a decade into a massive economic overhaul mr gou chose shenzhen a city next to hong kong at the forefront of chinas market reforms he used his small but fast growing shenzhen operation in his sales pitch to prospective customers in when michael dell was visiting southern china mr gou offered to arrange meetings with local officials he knew in return for the chance to drive the year old american to the airport says max fang who was then dells head of procurement in asia on the way mr gou made an unscheduled detour to show off his factory dell then wasnt one of the worlds top five pc vendors and hon hai didnt yet make parts that dell bought directly but mr gou "knew that michael dell was a star of tomorrow so he wanted to meet him " says mr fang who has known mr gou since today hon hai is one of dells biggest suppliers analysts and industry sources say mr gou keeps a photograph of dells founder on a shelf in his taiwan office that same year mr gou secured a larger plot of land that would become longhua when mr fang visited a year later it had fewer than workers executive offices were housed in foot shipping containers but mr fang was impressed at the time dell and other pc companies tended to buy parts from several suppliers and ship them to their own factories for assembly mr gou had created a production line that let him do most of the process himself from procuring the raw steel for pc casings to putting together the finished product over the years mr gou has expanded his portfolio to include a growing share of the pcs insides making its own components lets hon hai undercut competitors on the price of its finished products without reducing its overall margins says adam pick an analyst at isuppli corp a market research firm in el segundo calif by hon hais work force neared people and its revenue topped &# billion mr gou was expanding his soup to nuts strategy to more products that year hon hai set up a subsidiary called foxconn international holdings ltd now the worlds biggest independent cellphone maker in mr gou launched a company that is now a leading maker of flat panel lcd monitors last year hon hai bought a major producer of digital cameras now in some cases hon hai builds much of a product and ships it to its client for the finishing touches in others it ships the final products directly to retailers or consumers in all more than workers are now employed at mr gous plants across about a dozen provinces of china thousands more work in facilities run by hon hai and its affiliates across the globe including hungary mexico and brazil as the company sets up plants closer to its customers operations the company is one of the biggest exporters in the czech republic where mr gou bought a castle several years ago hon hai is also adding operations in vietnam and india and expanding into other sectors including auto parts as hon hai grew too large for one person to manage directly mr gou fostered a culture centered on his personality around longhua his image can be seen in large framed photos of him with chinese officials and on the gou biographies stacked in the factory book stores window executives say he leads by example to keep products coming out on schedule and to customer specifications known for his hour days the founder for years would cruise the longhua campus late into the night in a golf cart modified with a large bicycle horn stopping to spot check production lines or help repair equipment company managers are expected to read and remember a document called "gous quotations " no "the important thing in any organization is leadership not management a leader must have the decisive courage to be a dictator for the common good " at meetings mr gou often stands and illustrates his ideas with black marker on a giant white paper pad he encourages discussion but if someone says something he considers foolish he may order the person to stand at attention "hell say im not punishing you because im standing too " says a senior hon hai manager industry executives and analysts say customers often start outsourcing one product line to hon hai and then shift more there "you get addicted " says mr fang who left dell in and now runs a venture capital fund that has co invested with hon hai in a company called ugobe inc which makes robotic toys competitors have struggled to keep up four years ago hon hai was smaller by revenue than nasdaq listed flextronics international ltd the industrys longstanding leader now hon hai is so much larger that even after a merger announced in june between flextronics and solectron corp of milpitas calif their combined revenue will be about two thirds that of hon hai hon hai has its vulnerabilities it isnt for example a major producer of laptop computers which analysts say requires product design capabilities that hon hai lacks it is exposed to the risks of contract manufacturing an intensely competitive business with thin margins hon hai relies heavily on a fairly small number of customers in the tech industry a single product line can make or break a companys fortunes and in turn the well being of a supplier the company also faces the challenge of increasing revenue at the rate investors have come to expect hon hais sheer physical size also creates difficulties longhua was built quickly and its layout wasnt well planned says mr lee the plant director with its increasing overcrowding just moving all those workers around is a challenge mr lee says he once considered building a monorail but the idea proved too difficult he says the ideal facility would have about one fourth of the land area and perhaps one third the workers "its not a good idea to be this size " says mr lee who is also in charge of building other large factories for hon hai hon hai executives and outside analysts say the company has stayed nimble so far largely by splitting its operations among about a dozen smaller semi autonomous units mr gou says he wants to upgrade longhuas facilities and take on more advanced work such as research and development that means shifting manufacturing jobs to other parts of china longhua is incessantly busy but during breaks and shift changes the activity explodes at lunchtime on a recent sunny day thousands of employees poured out of their buildings they swarmed in and out of a large cafeteria and browsed in the factory book shop a line of dozens of new employees carrying their few possessions snaked along a crosswalk most of the workers wear uniforms color coded by their department others wear blue jeans and t shirts a number stroll in pairs hand in hand the workers are as young as zhou ruqing an affable year old has worked at longhua for just over a year as a quality inspector on an assembly line she lives in an apartment outside the factory with her boyfriend who also works at longhua ms zhou came to shenzhen in after graduating from high school in rural sichuan province as a mid level assembly line worker she earns about &# a month including overtime pay first year workers can make as little as &# a month if they do not work overtime that doesnt include about &# a month in housing and food subsidies plus health insurance in shenzhen that money goes far the rent for the small apartment she shares is less than &# a month another worker who would identify himself only as mr xiao started as an assembly line worker almost three years ago just after graduating from a technical school in central china where hon hai recruited him his starting salary was &# a month at todays exchange rate working up to days a month he could earn up to &# a month "i was really tired then too busy to rest " he said mr xiao has worked up to a more advanced post his basic salary has doubled although his total pay hasnt increased much partly because he works fewer hours he says conditions are better than they were at the time of last years critical press attention but "the change is incomplete " he currently works six days a week spending his off day studying in hopes of landing a different position mr gous role at hon hai is changing too he says he works just as hard today but is focusing more on big strategic issues than day to day work he is also devoting more time to charity he has pledged to eventually give away one third of his fortune and dealing with changes in his personal life his wife of many years died in last month his younger brother who had headed a hon hai affiliate died after a long illness mr gou has begun looking for a successor at hon hai focusing on candidates in their late s or early s and asking senior managers to prove themselves by running their units assertively there is no natural successor his son and daughter dont work at the company he says his decision to begin stepping down now is inspired by chinese history specifically the qianlong emperor who ruled from until when he was years old qianlong greatly expanded the qing dynasty making china perhaps the wealthiest country on earth but his judgment failed in his later years and the qing began a decline that led to its eventual demise "he controlled the whole of china for years " says mr gou "he stayed there too long so i want to sit back and give young people more responsibilities when im still young " sue feng in beijing and christopher lawton in san francisco contributed to this article
