costly venture in vietnam hanoi can get tough on foreign investors hanoi vietnam when american businessman hoan nguyen came to vietnam a decade ago with plans to build an international school he says he was bright eyed with hope for the country of his birth but by last year he was lying on a damp bench in hanois b prison after a business dispute with his vietnamese government partners turned into a police investigation with mr nguyen as the key suspect mr nguyens travails highlight one of the big risks for the foreign investors who have been flocking to vietnam whose economy has been growing at more than a year and is widely regarded as the developing worlds hottest emerging market after china and india it also shows how vietnamese government agencies or officials can sometimes employ tough tactics to get what they want when a deal goes wrong in jail for months while investigators probed the case mr nguyen listened to vietnamese state radio booming in the prisons courtyard each morning as announcers exhorted overseas vietnamese to come home to fuel the countrys rapid economic growth "it was so ironic i did exactly what the government wanted and i ended up in jail " says the year old mr nguyen who was released in june and is now in hanoi awaiting the final resolution of his case while in prison mr nguyen says he was given access to a lawyer only twice during his detention and alleges he was once beaten by a police officer food was meager at vietnamese new year he says he was allowed a little chunk of chicken with his once a day portion of rice police officials declined to comment on mr nguyens detention then after mr nguyen had spent months behind bars without charges and his family paid &# in what they were told was bail vietnamese police concluded in their initial report there wasnt sufficient evidence to prosecute him and let him go the bail money hasnt been returned mr nguyen is still waiting for vietnamese prosecutors to formally decide if they will charge him with any offense after decades of communist rule vietnams legal system is still ill equipped to handle civil business disputes that would be routinely handled by independent regulators in other nations with well established market economies so without recourse to civil courts complainants can take their grievances directly to the police who can detain suspects for months without filing charges against them in other instances the government has used its authority to seize private businesses leaving their owners little prospect of redress in the courts tony foster the managing partner of the vietnam practice of united kingdom based legal firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer says one of the idiosyncrasies of vietnamese legal code a hodgepodge of indigenous and imported regulations is that it includes some very broad definitions of crimes which can easily be applied to a business setting one is the crime of "economic mismanagement" resulting in losses to the state mr foster says that a foreign business engaged in a joint venture with a state owned agency could face criminal prosecution if it stumbles over a simple administrative step in a politically charged case vietnamese president nguyen minh triet acknowledged in a recent interview that his country needs to amend its legal system to bring it more in line with international standards but people familiar with vietnams legal reform effort say it will take considerable time the reform drive has already been under way for several years focusing among other things on leveling the playing field between foreign and local businesses in the meantime business disputes and regulatory violations that are treated as crimes keep piling up last year four local traders at the vietnam branch of dutch bank abn amro holding nv were arrested after vietnamese police accused them of conducting a series of foreign exchange trades with an unauthorized trader at a state bank in which the government lost &# million abn amro paid the vietnamese government &# million in november in an effort to get its staff released the four bankers are now free to work and travel within the country but the investigation into the actions of the abn amro staff hasnt yet been dropped an abn amro spokeswoman has previously denied any wrongdoing by its traders in vietnam a government audit this year concluded that vietnamese banks dont adequately regulate their foreign exchange trading other foreign banks protested the police actions in a letter to the government complaining that under vietnamese law it is too easy to criminalize ordinary civil disputes expatriate ethnic vietnamese who have returned to join the countrys march away from a centrally planned economy have fared worse than most other foreign investors many including mr nguyen complain their legal situation is compromised because the state is reluctant to regard them as foreigners even though they are legally citizens of other countries for example one of reasons the police held mr nguyen in prison for more than a year according to people closely following the case was to investigate whether he illegally received medical insurance reserved for foreign employees of the hanoi international school overlooking that mr nguyen is a u s citizen to be sure some overseas vietnamese appear to have flouted the countrys laws in their effort to make their fortunes damaging the reputation of other overseas vietnamese or viet kieu who have returned to engage in legitimate businesses in one well known case french businessman nguyen gia thieu built a business with his brother selling nokia and samsung mobile phones in police arrested mr thieu for allegedly smuggling the phones into vietnam to avoid import duties he was later convicted and sentenced to years in prison mr nguyen meanwhile is still fighting to clear his name an energetic man with a thick mop of gray hair and degrees from vanderbilt and george mason universities nguyen dinh hoan left vietnam in the s and didnt return for decades because of war and political upheaval there like many overseas vietnamese he reversed his name to follow western practices and became known as hoan nguyen in he finally returned with plans to establish an international school to cater to the families of the foreign expatriates who were then beginning to flock to the country mr nguyen formed the hanoi international school in partnership with the vietnamese governments center for education in the government provided a lease on a now valuable plot of land in booming downtown hanoi in return for a stake in the venture as the value of the land on which the school is built rose tensions between mr nguyen and his partners also grew in april police arrested mr nguyen as part of their investigations into the government partners claims that he illegally received medical insurance and into his allegedly improper hiring of a personal assistant to help him in a separate english language teaching business police investigators said in their report while mr nguyen was in prison u s embassy officials in hanoi warned mr nguyens wife in the u s against visiting vietnam to try to help obtain her husbands release because they couldnt guarantee her safety here family members say ho ngoc dai former director of the governments center for education the schools partner and a son in law of a former communist party chief called mr nguyen "a thief" but refused to explain why he believes mr nguyen is a criminal and declined to discuss the matter further mr nguyen maintains he did nothing wrong and that the salary payments to his personal assistant were split between the school and himself in june after mr ngyuens release his case ended up on the desk of vietnams prime minister nguyen tan dung a former central bank chief with a reputation for straight shooting he instructed the vietnamese members of the schools board to resolve its disputes with mr nguyen failing which the government would impose its own solution the state run peoples police newspaper reported
