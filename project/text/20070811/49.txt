oscar de la renta says they are capturing a different market by selling online both at neimans virtual trunk show and in general "fit is one of the most important things about our line and weve been

them to offer an entire designer collection to their customers without having to purchase inventory themselves designers in turn found that they could move more merchandise when they hawked their wares in person some designers such as donna karan would make personal appearances hand fitting their clothes to eager customers customers could try on clothes if they could fit in to the size four to six samples and order from the collection including items the store might never stock a few months later theyd return to pick them up and have them adjusted over time the shows became more populist spreading to smaller stores and mid priced clothing lines but most still retain the feel of a special event retailers and designers say these traditional in store trunk shows arent going away in addition to being marketing tools the events also help designers gauge customer interest in items if one item sells unexpectedly well at a trunk show they might decide to ramp up production they also build store loyalty among customers says kimberly soffey a retail strategist at kurt salmon associates this season neiman marcus showed dior both online and in the store the luxury department stores typically let shoppers return items theyve preordered through a trunk show even pieces the store isnt carrying but smaller boutiques generally dont accept trunk show returns online orders can be returned most come with prepaid shipping labels but customers are sometimes charged for shipping ann zimmerman contributed to this article
