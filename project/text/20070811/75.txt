wal mart in india americas wal mart and indias bharti are hoping to bring a dose of modernity to indias retailing landscape and good for them for trying but its going to take a lot more than wal marts legendary supply chain management and margin shaving acumen to bring "everyday low prices" to indian consumers this week the two companies finalized a joint venture to go into the business to business cash and carry wholesaling sector this structure evades indias strict ban on foreign department stores and supermarkets setting up shops by themselves and selling directly to consumers foreign direct investment in single brand stores such as nike shops or samsung outlets has been allowed only since and even then foreign ownership is limited to wal mart hopes that entering india now even if it cant open retail stores will give it a leg up if the countrys market opens further meantime bharti is planning to open its own wal mart style chain with technical expertise from its american partner to the extent wal marts new wholesale outlets reduce costs for retailers indian consumers may see at least some indirect benefit the biggest problem facing indian retailers and consumers is a dysfunctional supply chain because the market is highly fragmented about of the retail marketplace consists of small shopkeepers economies of scale are elusive and both producers and retailers depend on long chains of middlemen to bring goods to market agricultural produce typically travels from farmer to trader to commission agent to wholesaler to retailer and each step imposes new costs by one count the amount an indian consumer pays for food is five times the amount the farmer actually receives in the u s the ratio is closer to to waste is also a problem about of the value of indias agricultural output is lost between farm and market as processing delays and "wear and tear" on delicate produce take their toll on quality part of the onus for rationalizing this lies with the private sector and there progress is already happening by organized retailers multi store chains supermarkets department stores and the like are projected to account for of the retail market up from today according to technopak an indian consulting firm organized retailers have more clout to exact better prices from and impose more efficiencies on suppliers its exactly what wal mart has done in the u s but indias government still seems at best ambivalent about retail consolidation some laws such as those requiring each retail store in a chain to obtain its own trading licenses or limiting store opening hours are holdovers from an earlier era as is the current ban on foreign investment in retailing but governments can also be overtly hostile the southern state of kerala is considering an outright ban on new big stores and other states have been taking steps to block chain retailers from stepping into the agricultural market india has also yet to match americas feat of creating a single internal market for consumer and agricultural goods each state imposes its own inspection requirements duties and regulations on shipments that cross its borders even en route to another state in the u s a trucker can haul a load miles in about hours the equivalent journey in india takes four to five days and thats after a round of reforms five years ago it took so far building a political constituency to press for reforms has been hard small retailers and middlemen are far more numerous there are between two and three million kiranas small individually owned corner stores alone not counting market vendors and other small sellers but that may change as some of indias biggest and politically best connected companies and families like the tatas and bharti start investing in organized retail foreign retailers such as carrefour tesco and wal mart could also bring expertise in building supply chains shaving margins and gauging consumer tastes then again theres no guarantee their type of retailing would appeal to indian consumers but thats for indias consumers to decide if the government will let them
