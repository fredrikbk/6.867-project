subprime turmoil catches funds off guard some of the most highly regarded mutual funds are getting beaten up by the mortgage meltdown and investors are yanking money out of u s stock funds still a few fund categories are holding up well this year despite the recent turmoil in fact in what should come as little surprise the only stock fund category to post gains recently is bear market funds theyre up for the month ended aug according to morningstar inc some top stock funds havent fared so well largely because of heavy investments in housing related stocks for instance weitz value and legg mason value trust which have stellar long term track records also have hefty positions in stocks like home lender countrywide financial corp according to fund filings countrywides stock has fallen roughly this year it took a hit friday after it said its financial condition could be hurt by "unprecedented disruptions" in debt and mortgage finance markets weitz value is down this year and lost about over the past month while legg mason value trust is down so far this year and lost in the past month according to morningstar data through aug both funds are lagging behind most of their category rivals so far this year according to morningstar troubles in such funds illustrate that even some of the savviest stock pickers may have been caught off guard by the extent of the housing slowdown and mortgage market woes for fund investors the risk is making investment decisions based on short term swings advisers say investors should view the volatility as a reminder to stay diversified alternative investments like commodities tend to behave differently than stocks and bonds reducing the risk of the overall portfolio indeed many commodities related funds have weathered the recent storm given their distance from the mortgage debacle overall the average losses at u s stock funds in the past month range from in health sector funds to in small value oriented funds according to morningstar overseas diversification didnt necessarily help emerging markets funds are down and europe stock funds lost in that period the market turmoil is driving investors to pull money out of domestic stock funds at a rapid clip investors pulled nearly &# million out of stock funds in the week ended aug according to amg data services that is a reversal from july when money poured in as the dow jones industrial average climbed toward a number of fund managers whose holdings have been hit by housing related woes say theyd like to buy more of these stocks as their prices fall but they dont have the cash to do it because investors are withdrawing money from their funds "ive had pretty steady redemptions and havent had a chance to come up for air " says david ellison manager of fbr small cap financial fund in recent weeks mortgage related holdings have seen steep declines american home mortgage investment corp said earlier this month that it had stopped taking mortgage applications amid the deteriorating market conditions and in recent days filed for bankruptcy court protection the stock sank to under &# from over &# in little more than a month also seeing declines are home builders building materials companies and big banks like washington mutual inc down about over the past month the housing and mortgage jitters are reflected in the worst performing domestic stock fund categories this year real estate funds are down for the year through aug and financial stock funds are down natural resources and communications have been the top performing domestic stock fund categories this year up and respectively american homes troubles are likely the main cause of a sudden reversal of fortune for at least one highly respected value fund manager the schneider small cap value fund the top performing small company value fund over the past five years is the worst performing fund in that category in the month through aug with a decline according to morningstar its major holdings as of may included american home as well as luminent mortgage capital inc which recently suspended payment of its second quarter dividend arnold c schneider iii manager of the schneider small cap value fund declined to comment a number of managers say they didnt anticipate the housing troubles would be so severe or widespread "we have been surprised by the extent of this " says john buckingham manager of al frank fund which holds home builders like beazer homes usa inc down nearly this year and kb home down about as well as other housing related stocks the fund is down more than over the past month but still up this year through aug many managers firmly defend their housing related holdings and say their long term prospects are still bright "we think the good companies will do very well long term " says ron muhlenkamp who holds stocks like countrywide financial washington mutual and home builder nvr inc in his muhlenkamp fund the funds year returns place it near the top of its large company value category according to morningstar but it falls near the bottom of the category so far this year and over the past month when it dropped some of the managers have been defending their housing related holdings in recent communications to shareholders in a july letter to shareholders managers wally weitz and brad hinton who devoted nearly of their weitz value funds assets to mortgage services stocks as of june noted that such stocks have dragged down performance but wrote that "we feel very good about our mortgage related holdings " in an interview messrs weitz and hinton say they still like holdings like countrywide but are scrutinizing them "as questions arise out in the marketplace and fears blossom and hedge funds go broke and so on we recheck our assumptions " mr weitz says bill miller the legg mason value trust manager also defended his housing stocks in a july letter to shareholders "if we did not own housing or housing related stocks such as countrywide financial we would be buying them now amidst the panic selling currently underway " he wrote a number of managers feel their stocks are being unfairly punished anton schutz manager of burnham financial services fund says holdings like peoples united financial inc a bank stock down this year have suffered even though they dont have big problems with subprime mortgages "if someone would give me some more money i would love to buy more " mr schutz says burnham financial services fund is down about this year through thursday
