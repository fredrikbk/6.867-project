fairtax flawed tax former arkansas gov mike huckabees unexpectedly strong second place showing in the recent iowa republican straw poll is widely attributed to his support for the fairtax for those who never heard about it the fairtax is a national retail sales tax that would replace the entire current federal tax system it was originally devised by the church of scientology in the early s as a way to get rid of the internal revenue service with which the church was then at war at the time the irs refused to recognize it as a legitimate religion the scientologists idea was that since almost all states have sales taxes replacing federal taxes with the same sort of tax would allow them to collect the federal governments revenue and thereby get rid of their hated enemy the irs rep john linder r ga and sen saxby chambliss r ga have introduced legislation h r s to implement the fairtax they assert that a rate of would be sufficient to replace federal individual and corporate income taxes as well as payroll and estate taxes mr linders web site claims that u s gross domestic product will rise the first year after enactment exports will grow by and real investment spending will increase an astonishing in reality the fairtax rate is not messrs linder and chambliss get this figure by calculating the tax as if it were already incorporated into the price of goods and services this is known as the tax inclusive rate calculating it the conventional way that every other sales tax is calculated with the tax on top of the price yields a rate of this is called the tax exclusive rate the distinction is confusing but think of it this way if a product costs &# at retail the fairtax adds for a total of &# since the cent tax is of &# fairtax supporters say the rate is rather than this is only the beginning of the deceptions in the fairtax under the linder chambliss bill the federal government would have to pay taxes to itself on all of its purchases of goods and services thus if the defense department buys a tank that now costs &# million the manufacturer would have to add the fairtax and send it to the treasury department the tank would then cost the federal government &# more than it does today but its tax collection will also be &# higher this legerdemain is done solely to make revenues under the fairtax seem larger than they really are so that its supporters can claim that it is revenue neutral but for the government to afford to purchase the same goods and services it would have to raise spending by the amount of the tax it pays to itself the fairtax rate however is not high enough to finance the higher spending it imposes therefore the proposal only works if federal purchases are cut by close to &# billion the increased cost imposed by the fairtax similarly state and local governments would have to pay the fairtax on most of their purchases this means that it is partly financed by higher state and local taxes its also worth remembering that state sales taxes now average which means that the total tax rate will be on retail sales state sales taxes have long exempted all but a few services because of the enormous difficulty in taxing intangibles but the fairtax would apply to of services including medical care thus increasing their cost by no state comes close to taxing services so broadly consumers would also find themselves taxed on newly constructed homes imagine paying to the federal government on top of the purchase price of your next house since sales taxes are regressive taking more in percentage terms from the incomes of the poor and middle class than the rich some provision is needed to prevent a vast increase in taxation on the nonwealthy the fairtax does this by sending monthly checks to every household based on income aside from the incredible complexity and intrusiveness of tracking every americans monthly income and creating a de facto national welfare program the fairtax does not include the cost of this rebate in the tax rate as noted earlier the fairtax is designed only to match current revenues and does not cover any increased spending that it may require since the rebate will cost at least &# billion the first year either federal discretionary spending would have to be cut by or the rate would have to be five percentage points higher than advertised rejecting all the tricks of fairtax supporters and calculating the tax rate honestly by including the higher spending that it mandates and by being realistic about what could actually be taxed professional revenue estimators have always concluded that a national retail sales tax would have to be much much higher than a estimate by congresss joint committee on taxation found the tax inclusive rate would have to be and the tax exclusive rate would be in the u s treasury department calculated that a tax exclusive rate of would be needed just to replace the income tax leaving the payroll tax in place but if evasion were high then the rate might have to rise to if the fairtax were only able to cover the limited sales tax base of a typical state then a rate of would be required with high evasion ive emphasized problems with the fairtax rate because public opinion polls have long shown that support for flat rate tax reforms is extremely sensitive to the proposed rate with support dropping off sharply at a rate higher than but there are also massive technical and administrative problems with collecting all federal taxes at the checkout counter and relying entirely on state governments to collect the federal governments revenue among the problems what possible incentive would the states have to be vigorous in their federal tax collections what is to stop them from slacking off and giving their citizens a tax cut at federal expense what about states with no sales taxes whats to stop people from bypassing retail outlets and buying their goods from producers or at wholesale tax free perhaps the biggest deception in the fairtax however is its promise to relieve individuals from having to file income tax returns keep extensive financial records and potentially suffer audits judging by the emphasis fairtax supporters place on the idea of making april just another day this seems to be a major selling point for their proposal yet all but six states now have state income taxes so unless one lives in one of those states this promise is an empty one indeed in short the fairtax is too good to be true and voters should not take seriously any candidate who supports it mr bartlett was deputy assistant
