hot topic the rules of the game way back when professional sports was often a family business populated by men still playing boys games for fun and money its a much bigger more serious business now as michael vicks year &# million contract attests when he signed in it was the largest in nfl history with this kind of money at stake the bottom line moved to the top of concerns in most pro sports even as all involved still chose to call what they did a "game " the vick story is no game for himself or for professional sports mr vick is scheduled to plead guilty to some of the federal charges against him monday even as he denies some of the acts of which hes been accused sports have long had commissioners realizing that any sport dominated by young men who are suddenly exposed to new money but who may have had poor backgrounds is going to have player troubles baseball got retired judge kennesaw mountain landis after the "black sox" game rigging scandal judge landis was a man of principle who fiercely defended the integrity of the game and set the tone for baseball commissioners for decades baseball and the white sox lost "shoeless" joe jackson one of the games best hitters but the sports reputation was saved we would not support the idea that sports today need outsiders as monitors or congressional oversight or a department of sport at least as long as they have strong commissioners willing to act to maintain the reputation and standards of the sport the problem with baseball in recent years has been that the commissioner unlike landis has had too little power bud selig recently won more from the owners but the steroid scandal blossomed because the owners and particularly the unions wouldnt act for years only when the story blew up with the balco barry bonds probe did mr selig get enough clout to make the unions bend his appointment of the probe led by former u s senator george mitchell will probably give him more this is all to the good football and the nba have had better records in part because they have had stronger commissioners pete rozelle set the tone by suspending paul hornung and alex karras for the season for gambling paul tagliabue maintained the strong commissioner model new nfl commissioner roger goodell has sent a proper message by warning the bengals that their player problems wont be tolerated and by suspending tennessee titan pacman jones for the season most likely he will punish michael vick in some way beyond the criminal sanction its hard to see how the nba could have done more to prevent the case of the crooked referee david stern has asked an outsider to inspect the leagues officiating standards and monitoring a good idea in the past he has been tough on fighting and other lapses there really is no better alternative than a league commissioner willing to enforce standards of behavior on and off the field court or gridiron sports are entertainment too of course fans pay for the thrill that athletic spectacle provides the continuing popularity of these sports is that they create a world in which talented people are permitted to free wheel improvise and do wondrous things but always within a clearly defined and enforced set of rules everyone involved knows and agrees on the rules of the game in the real world today rule breaking itself has become a kind of entertainment starlets sent to jail for drunk driving or drug possession become fodder for lifestyle pieces its supposed to be regarded as all fun and games "as long as no one gets hurt " and it has been noted that sports fans whether in san francisco or new york seem willing to look past pretty much anything the boys do so long as they keep putting up numbers on the scoreboard "bread and circuses" has a long pedigree the vick case however suggests that tolerance even in our time has its limits whether mr vick will ever play again after paying his debt to society is something the league and the fans will decide but mr vick would seem to have a larger reckoning in store with the norms and values of the society that so richly rewards him for his running and passing it is the civilizing rules of that world he has flouted and it is to that larger society as much as to his fans or his team that a debt is now owed
