pursuits sports golf journal a brain teaser for golfers the new pga playoff format is so complex that even some players are befuddled harrison n y for an ancient game distinguished by its fundamental simplicity a ball a stick the hole golf is looking an awful lot like quantitative finance about now this weekend at the barclays tournament at westchester country club here we will begin to get a sense of whether the pga tours season ending four event fedex cup playoff system can deliver what tour officials desperately hope it will or continue to seem like an impenetrable overengineered mess the reason we dont know yet is that the playoff formula is something that hardly anyone understands "i never was good at math " tour player boo weekley deadpanned recently when asked about the playoffs of course pro football players and fans often struggle to understand the nfls playoff system when dozens of possible permutations arise at the end of the regular season and nobody minds but the pga tour efforts to sell the fedex cup have so far been a struggle the pga tour knew it needed to do something to reverse its customary fade out at this time of year after the final major the pga championship is over except for the blip of interest sparked by the alternate year ryder cup and presidents cup matches and the distant and perfunctory tour championship at the end of october fans attention in the fall usually wanders to football and baseballs world series so the tour moved up the finish of the season except for a few post playoff events that few of the top pros will participate in and created a new kind of event more than two years ago a small team of executives at the tours headquarters in florida began crunching the numbers "it was tricky because we wanted a playoff that was dramatic in its own right with a sense that anybody could win but also one that rewarded season long performance and produced a champion that would seem legitimate " says steve dennis the tours director of communication strategy and a key member of the research team what the tour hoped to avoid was a fluke winner as sometimes happens even at golfs majors the pga champion shaun micheel for instance still has only that single tour win on his resume the team dreamed up dozens of different systems and tested most of them with computer simulations using as its database the round by round tournament scores and rankings for the tours top players for every season back to the puzzle had two parts the first was how to seed players into the playoffs based on their performance in the years first events the team discovered that no matter how it rewarded points doubling the number for the majors doling them out in an arithmetically descending style as nascar does its nextel cup points nothing much changed "the rankings were imperturbable which makes sense when you think about it because the guys who do well do well whenever they play at the majors or wherever " says mr dennis the final fedex cup points list this year differs so little from the traditional way the tour has ranked its players the good old money list that im hoping next year theyll just call it the fedex cup money list and do away with the separate and pointlessly over hyped "points race " the second part of the puzzle how to reset and then reward points during the playoffs was more complex in the final months of tweaking last summer and fall the research team ran literally millions of simulations using a spreadsheet program designed primarily for risk analysis in the securities industry for all that computational firepower however the tour arrived at its final formula largely by seat of the pants instinct "it was trial and error " acknowledged mr dennis tour executives and committees spent a lot of time poring over the actual results lists that the computer trial runs generated name by name looking for anomalies if retief goosens ranking seemed somehow too high or too low in scenario b for the year scenario b was either junked or tweaked so now well see how it all plays out the odds of those in the bottom of the pack winning the &# million top prize are long especially since the field will be culled each week from a maximum of players for the first event to for the second for the third and for the tour championship in atlanta on sept the media and even some of the players have criticized quirky details of the playoff system and tiger woodss decision to skip the barclays isnt a good sign commissioner tim finchem says the system can be tweaked going forward as needed my sense is that over time fans and players will come to support the cup enough to make it a fall fixture but even if it never approaches the significance of a major the fedex cup is sure a better way to end the season than watching freddie couples and three friends play the skins game in december the barclays the first of the four playoff events will be televised on cbs saturday from p m to p m edt and sunday from p m to p m
