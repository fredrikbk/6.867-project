remembrances into a southern shopping mall anchor john montgomery belk he built the family department store into a southern shopping mall anchor john montgomery belk was famous for folksy fractured english quips but that quirk belied a formidable will that he applied to his familys century old belk inc department store chain as well as to the city of charlotte n c mr belk transformed the belk chain from a mainstay of the souths main streets to a mall anchor that now is the nations largest closely held department store chain he brought a similar approach to charlotte where in eight years as mayor he was the leading advocate for an international airport and attracted corporate skyscrapers as he expanded the citys land area by half "i dont think anyone in charlotte has ever had as much power " says alex coffin who covered city government in the s and wrote a book about mr belks tenure mr belk who died aug at his charlotte home at age went to work for the family business which his father had founded in as a dry goods store in rural monroe n c an infantry veteran of world war ii and korea mr belk emerged from a group of several brothers and cousins as the chains leader in the years after his fathers death in the belks that john belk inherited ran along the lines that were innovative by th century standards it displayed fixed prices favored house brands and didnt offer credit most of the stores were partnerships between the belk family and local individuals and typically bore a hyphenated name such as belk leggett in danville va each partnership was a separate corporation and there were of them by the chain had a reputation for good quality house branded wares and its partnership structure gave it a local connection unusual for a chain store but it wasnt a place to find fashions john belk set out to upgrade its image he began building larger stores in suburban shopping malls and taking on fashionable lines such as calvin klein nike and estee lauder although he had been chairman of the local chamber of commerce it came as a surprise to some when mr belk declared his candidacy for mayor in he tripped almost immediately freezing in response to a reporters question about what to do about the citys fractious unions but his "belkisms " as they came to be called were if anything an asset as the somewhat imperious bachelor tycoon learned to press the flesh one of the most quoted "you cant be unreasonable about something until you get the facts " he credited the black vote for the thin margin that elected him to the first of four two year terms as mayor mr belk implemented court ordered integration erected public housing and attracted new buildings to the diminished downtown which his own department store had recently left for a big mall he helped build he also ceased being the citys most eligible bachelor by marrying claudia watkins a federal district judge they had a daughter in mr belk declined to run for what would have been a record fifth term bishop george battle jr of the african methodist episcopal zion church of charlotte a longtime friend recalled his years as mayor as ones of harmony between the races "he was fair and generous and he was open minded " mr battle credits the international airport with giving the city an economic boost yet one that didnt directly help mr belks business while mayor he also served as president of the national retail merchants association but despite these multiple roles mr belks attention to business seemed never to waver in the s he began unwinding belks cumbersome partnerships
