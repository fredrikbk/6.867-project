exodus from muni bonds could yield opportunities one unexpected victim of the bond market turmoil is the normally placid market for municipal bonds selling by hedge funds and general nervousness by investors drove down the prices of many bonds driving up yields and in the process creating interesting opportunities for investors two of the newest examples classic muni bonds and "callable" bonds the ones that can be paid back early at the issuers whim yields on some of these issues have topped in recent weeks as investors yanked money out pushing down their prices as they scrambled into safer investments like treasurys because bond yields move in the opposite direction to prices the exodus is resulting in higher yielding options for investors willing to swim against the current and snap up the out of favor issues the benchmark triple a rated year municipal bond as tracked by research firm thomson financial municipal market data is yielding up percentage point since the start of the year the highest rated year bond is up about percentage point at a yield of "theres been no difference in credit quality of these bonds just the appetite for risk from investors has gone down " says dan solender director of municipal bond management at lord abbett &amp co some new muni bonds are coming to market with coupons above such as year new york thruway personal income tax revenue bonds at a similar deal would have had a coupon just few months ago says bob nelson of municipal market data because munis can be tax free current yields start looking even richer for instance the benchmark year bond yields about assuming an income tax rate of among callable bonds in recent weeks the difference between their yields and comparable treasurys has widened to its highest level in three years in the past week for example prudential financial inc issued year bonds yielding callable in three years there are risks of course trying to time the market isnt a game for weak stomachs if the flight to treasurys continues other bond prices may fall further and buying munis is a murky process at best the pricing mechanism isnt as open as in other markets which means its tougher for individual investors to know if theyre getting a fair price as for callable bonds theres the russian roulette element if issuers redeem the bonds at the wrong time for you e g when interest rates are low you could get stuck holding a bushel of cash without a good place to redeploy it that said there are some new online tools that offer pricing clues for savvy investors such as web site investinginbonds com that lists the prices at which many munis and corporate bonds have traded recently for investors willing to bet that the federal reserve will cut interest rates some longer term muni bonds may be a way to lock in higher yields the best way to start call a trustworthy broker and ask for bonds giving a yield of or more that list will vary widely by state the next step before actually buying look up the municipal bond section of investinginbonds com to check the yields at which bonds have been trading lately this is key because it can be tricky for individuals to otherwise determine whether theyre getting a decent price indeed for the bond obsessed its occasionally possible to spot transactions where some poor bondholder got a bad deal for instance in one trade of bonds on thursday a triple a rated new york muni bond was bought at a nearly yield which suggests that the bondholder got a really low price for it when selling another way to play the bond market upheaval is to look for mutual funds that may be oversold overall mutual funds holding municipal bonds had outflows of &# billion in the last three weeks through aug according to amg data services this race for the exits has been a key source "of selling pressure in the market " says matt fabian an analyst at municipal market advisors funds holding lower quality bonds or unrated bonds have been hit the most with the average junk muni bond fund down for the year through thursday according to morningstar inc for investors looking to buy conservative low cost options morningstar analyst lawrence jones recommends looking at funds offered by vanguard group and fidelity investments such as the vanguard long term tax exempt fund and the fidelity municipal income fund the funds are down and respectively for the three months through thursday but up and for the past months the volatility is also creating new opportunities in callable bonds because theres the risk that the bonds will be "called" paid off early they typically offer a higher yield the yields on investment grade corporate bonds with call provisions have jumped by over half a percentage point in recent weeks to and says tom ricketts of incapital llc a chicago investment bank for example incapital recently underwrote and distributed more than &# million of year triple a rated bonds issued by general electric co s ge capital corp offering a yield with interest paid out semiannually callable in four years by comparison an average approximation for a year treasury is about the risk of a call means these bonds only make sense for short term investors marilyn cohen president of envision capital management inc a los angeles money management firm has been buying some callable bonds issued by government agencies such as the federal home loan bank the federal home loan bank for example recently issued callable bonds with a yield of although the bonds are due to mature in august the yield is only guaranteed for six months
