pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece civilization at the crossroads the alhambra and the harmony of seeming cultural opposites anatomy of a classic henri matisse exclaimed "the alhambra is a marvel " the holy roman emperor charles v concluded "ill fated was the man who lost all this " nonetheless the current director of the site maria del mar villafranca jimenez readily affirms that the american writer washington irving deserves primary credit for inspiring later generations to preserve the finest example of islamic architecture in europe and one of the greatest anywhere in the world situated on a spur of the snow covered sierra nevada the complex of buildings known as the alhambra dominates the city of granada spain itself or so miles inland from the port of malaga and not a great deal farther from the straits of gibraltar that barely separate europe from africa contemporary spain from morocco since its earliest stages in the ninth century the alhambra has been at a crossroads of civilizations it was the capital of al andalus the moorish kingdom of southern spain a region now known as andalusia in the later middle ages it became one of the finest trophies of dominance between christian and islamic cultures yet its creation and preservation highlight not warring ideologies but the profound harmony that can emerge from the intermingling of seeming opposites during the th through th centuries the nasrid kings descended from arabs and berbers of north africa accumulated a city housing as many as people on the hill that came to be called the "alhambra " probably due to the reddish color al hamra in arabic of the local rock among these dozens of buildings only a small number survive particularly the defensive citadel or alcazaba three palaces the mexuar comares and courtyard of the lions and an encircling wall of battlements and towers along with the great mosque which in the th century was replaced with a franciscan monastery that is now an excellent government run hotel these extant palaces were almost certainly the finest buildings of the old city they were the ceremonial centers of a richly developed culture and the private residence of the king yet these structures affirm the authority of their builders in a very different way from the massive foundations gigantic proportions and dominating axes of medieval european palaces the alhambra does not immediately impress visitors with sheer size rather it leads them through a series of intimate rooms that accumulate into one of the richest experiences of architecture decoration and nature anywhere on earth the th century architect lecorbusier spoke of "the intelligent just and magnificent interplay of volumes made harmonious by daylight " the best way to see the alhambra is seated on the floor in their heyday the rooms were covered with ornately decorated rugs cushions and low settees from this vantage still available to the tourist willing to break ranks and plop on the cool stone flooring the architecture is transformed windows so low that views are obscured and sills that threaten a passing stroller with a fall become shoulder height opening vistas to the acres of surrounding gardens and distant peaks the minutely structured geometries of colored tiles and plasterwork once richly painted that clothe the walls in opulent patterns engage the eyes as the body rests and even more intricately fitted ceilings made of thousands of meticulously carved sections of wood rise layer upon layer as small apertures allow shafts of sunlight or moonlight to penetrate these soothing retreats from the intense sun and arid expanses of the surrounding hills these buildings are designed to evoke natural and spiritual oases the varied levels of the ceilings suggest stalactites hanging from the roof of a cave and clusters of columns mimic trunks of palm trees the most explicit evocations of nature however are watercourses that run through many rooms and spill across portals into pools amid enclosed gardens literally joining interior and exterior architecture and nature fed by a remarkable series of aqueducts bringing an ample supply of water from snow melt the hundreds of channels crisscrossing the alhambra and filling it with watersong are a perfect emblem of the nasrids seemingly effortless blend of practicality and art some say that the fullest appreciation of the alhambra comes only at night when cool breezes enter the buildings and moonlight reveals how closely their decorated surfaces repeat the patterns of flowing water the last of the existing palaces to be constructed the courtyard of the lions is perhaps the fullest expression of this aesthetic yet its design is also believed to reflect cultural exchange with the christian spaniards named after the marble lions that seem to support a water filled basin at the center of a network of channels and colonnades the courtyard was built in the late s by muhammad v possibly to celebrate his return to power after several years of exile in the court of pedro "the cruel " a castilian king who for once seems not to have deserved the name during this sojourn among christian allies when tolerance between cultures briefly prevailed muhammad v may well have visited the cloisters of benedictine abbeys and later chosen to create his own attenuated and filigreed version as the exquisite border of the courtyard of the lions on jan ferdinand king of aragon and isabella queen of castille took possession of granada from the last nasrid ruler muhammad xii ending centuries of episodic warfare between muslims and christians on the spanish peninsula far from merely a matter of local politics their victory over the last islamic state in europe was seen as a counterweight to a great loss at the opposite end of the mediterranean the ottoman conquest of constantinople in the pope named ferdinand and isabella "catholic monarchs " instead of razing this foremost center of islamic culture in europe however the monarchs preserved it before the inquisition intensified they tolerated muslims and they regularly stayed at the alhambra even occasionally wearing arab dress their grandson the holy roman emperor charles v chose it for the site of his honeymoon and planned extensive renovations to construct a european style palace alongside those of the moors if these spanish rulers treasured the alhambra as more than a trophy of war their descendants abandoned it to freeloaders who used it to store a variety of goods including galley slaves and gunpowder french occupiers of the early th century found its towers perfect for target practice when washington irving arrived at the alhambra in and took up residence for a few months in rooms once used by charles v he found the site on the verge of ruin although filled with romantic nonsense his book "the alhambra " captured imaginations around the world with its extravagant fantasies of oriental adventures and less farfetched appreciations of the buildings themselves perhaps it is fair that this american writer would be the alhambras savior since ferdinand and isabellas conquest of it freed the monarchs to send christopher
