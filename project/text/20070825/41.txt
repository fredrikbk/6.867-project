pursuits leisure &amp arts the spirit of the s in the internet age an audience sings together in a sonic gesture of peace new york long ago back in the early s i used to write about the outer edge of classical music events often staged in lofts in which music could be rapt and meditative and was often improvised sometimes it was dedicated to some higher cause and one of the best composers doing that was pauline oliveros whod often ask her audience to sing with magical results youd find yourself not just listening but helping to create rich tapestries of sound and youd feel that you belonged to a wonderful community in which everybody felt a deep and soulful sense of peace work like this of course was a survival of the spirit of the s and by the s it could seem a little dated once in a crowded new york railroad station i watched musicians walk among commuters tooting apparently at random in at least some of the commuters might have smiled but in the reaction seemed much more like "what the bleep " but im nostalgic for those days and so when lincoln center as part of a celebration of the th anniversary of the summer of love included a pauline oliveros piece in this years lincoln center out of doors events i had to be there would the magic still work certainly ms oliveros hadnt changed the piece sung on tuesday night was called "worldwide tuning meditation " on her web site www deeplistening org ms oliveros rhapsodized " or more voices are gathering at damrosch park lincoln center out of doors voices from other countries will be included via freepoint internet radio channels and broadcast into the park with the local voices broadcasting out to the world please join oceans of voices in this sonic gesture of peace where ever you are no experience is necessary " we were given a handout with instructions for the piece "begin by taking a deep breath and letting it all the way out listen with your minds ear for a tone on the next breath sing the tone that you have silently perceived listen to the whole field of sound the group is making select a voice distant from you and tune as exactly as possible to the tone you are hearing from that voice listen again to the whole field of sound contribute by singing a new tone that no one else is singing communicate with as many different voices as possible sing warmly " ms oliveros talked to us looking and sounding at age just as unassuming and committed as she always has "youll create a wave " she said "i hope it will be understood as a sonic gesture of peace " and to my complete delight the audience responded there werent voices that had been naively hopeful but at least people were there and they began intoning very beautifully with or so it seemed not a moments doubt or hesitation the instructions turned out to be very powerful they balanced each of us as individuals with all of us as members of a group wed take a breath and merge with what others in the group were doing then on the next breath wed set our own direction the sound because of this kept changing sometimes many of us seemed to get the same idea and seemed to tune our sounds together this was magical in the s it still was magical now only one thing went wrong the world wide voices coming to us through the internet through loudspeakers and computers the sound was crackly it was louder than the tones that we at lincoln center sang and i had no idea how much people in those other places ranging we were told from prague to minnesota could hear us or respond to us so i thought their presence meant to create at least in principle a bond of world wide community unfortunately weakened the more tangible communal sense that we ourselves created there was one more event that evening an improvisation by ms oliveros playing the accordion and three colleagues a cellist a spoken word performer and someone who generates electronic sounds the tamest player was the cellist who played things that sounded like excerpts from cello works by contemporary classical composers they werent that of course he was improvising making it all up but he worked inside a predictable and very safe little box his thoughts filled or so it seemed to me with music hed heard many times before he was balanced very happily by the spoken word performer named very simply ione shed slip right into the center of what everybody else was doing or more often shed define that center drawing her colleagues into her very quiet aura she was perfect and when she spoke she made everybody else sound perfect too mr sandow a composer is writing a book on the future of classical music
