however he is the famed directors personal political consultant recognizing that his client had gotten himself into a ticklish political arena mr spahn quickly arranged a series of primers on topics that might dog china and therefore mr spielberg heading into the games at the top of the list chinas much criticized support of the sudanese government which many believe is engaged in a genocidal campaign in that countrys darfur region mr spahn supplied mr spielberg with reports and books and set up briefings with darfur policy experts as well actors george clooney and don cheadle who have visited the region and campaigned aggressively on the topic when in march actress mia farrow publicly attacked mr spielberg on the editorial pages of the wall street journal for helping to "sanitize beijings image" via the olympics mr spielberg reacted quickly within days the movie maker sent a letter drafted by mr spahn to chinese president hu jintao saying that he had "only recently come to understand fully the extent of chinas involvement in the region and its strategic and supportive relationship with the sudanese government " he urged china to change its policy toward sudan in the entertainment business the elite have personal chefs trainers hair and makeup stylists mansion redecorators and art consultants some moguls have a personal minder for their serious side too private political aides like the year old mr spahn who help them navigate the world of policy and politicians "the great advantage" of being a political consultant in hollywood is "the all too rare opportunity to work on behalf of candidates and issues you care about" says mr spahn whose main clients at various times have included the three founders of the dreamworks skg movie studio mr spielberg jeffrey katzenberg and david geffen "it allows you to work for people who are driven by values and not simply business interests " but its the fame and clout of these hollywood moguls and their ability to fill campaign coffers thats at the root of their influence during the clinton white house years "andys calls were quickly returned and we listened to what he had to say " says chris lehane a former aide to president clinton and vice president gore who is now a political consultant living in san francisco "andy was viewed as a serious person with serious ideas " the duties of hollywood consultants depend greatly on the wishes and whims of the client political consultants help carry on crusades against everything from education problems in los angeles to aids in africa to global warming everywhere they connect their bosses with powerful politicians and keep an eye out for who might be the next political power they act as gatekeepers sorting through the flood of requests that comes in from people seeking access to their clients money fame or power they sometimes hobnob with presidents and prime ministers raise millions for candidates or causes and when necessary bring bagels to the next community meeting mr spahn a one time berkeley radical who has been involved in liberal democratic politics in washington d c and california for decades once helped mr spielberg negotiate a compromise with neighbors angry over his reported plans to build a five story &# million plus horse riding facility on his estate he also has been criticized for pushing what some environmentalists saw as an ecologically damaging project on behalf of his dreamworks bosses other celebrities retain political consultants typically operatives who cut their teeth and made their connections working for democratic pols or the democratic party there arent any well known republican political consultants in hollywood likely a reflection of the scarcity of gop fans among the entertainment industry elite barbra streisand has used political consultant margery tabankin a former carter administration official actor richard dreyfuss producer norman lear director rob reiner and billionaire tv impressario haim saban also use political consultants with democratic party pedigrees such experiences and rolodexes are attractive to the entertainment industry elite looking to make their own marks in the public realm "if you are going to spend &# million on politics you want to know how to get the most bang " says howard bragman a veteran hollywood publicist the bang can range from working on major policy issues to getting a prime seat at a political fundraiser though incomes vary widely observers estimate that a top consultant can earn well into the six figures annually this year democratic presidential hopefuls have been flocking to los angeles in a frantic rush to make friends and raise money for the rapidly approaching primary season which means that mr spahn has been very busy already this year he has helped organize two major fundraisers one on behalf of hillary clinton for mr spielberg one on behalf of barack obama for mr katzenberg who currently heads dreamworks animation when mr katzenbergs wife marilyn wanted to meet mr obama in mr spahn arranged an intimate beverly hills dinner with the illinois senator that get together helped convince the katzenbergs who had long been supporters of the clintons to back the obama presidential bid mr spahn says his clients split loyalties in the current presidential race have required him to be neutral an unusual position for him mr katzenberg says mr spahn "is invaluable at keeping his finger on the pulse in the political world" and does it in a way that rarely ruffles feathers mr spielberg says "andys counsel over the years has been invaluable to me from his advice on my philanthropic and political giving to my current work on darfur " mr spahn has even done some work for an ex client mr geffen who cut formal ties with mr spahn two years ago after deciding to reduce his political activity earlier this year when mr geffen very publicly accused his former friends bill and hillary clinton of being liars mr spahn helped him manage the resulting media firestorm the son of labor organizers mr spahn listened to political arguments from a young age at his familys croton on hudson home in new york he dropped out of beloit college in wisconsin during his freshman year to organize against the vietnam war to earn money he briefly peddled records for rca at music stores in new york before moving west for a stint as bicycle messenger in san francisco in he enrolled at the university of california berkeley where he found the local political theater more enticing than classroom lectures with shoulder length hair mr spahn became a student protest leader on such issues as apartheid in south africa twice arrested and routinely battling administrators over his academic standing he nonetheless graduated in with a degree in political science at berkeley mr spahn met the man who would change his life by plunging him simultaneously into the worlds of democratic electoral politics and hollywood tom hayden was already an icon of the left and a veteran of the s protest movements when mr spahn signed on to help him run in for the democratic nomination for a u s senate seat from california still angry over what the democratic partys leaders did to bring about the war in vietnam mr spahn reluctantly bit the bullet and registered as a democrat though mr hayden lost his race the situation plugged mr spahn into the world of hollywood stars thanks to the campaigning efforts of the candidates then wife actress jane fonda he liked mingling with hollywood folks whom he found appealing for their "passion creativity and do no harm ethic " for a time mr spahn headed a political action group started by mr hayden and ms fonda which aimed at changing california through the electoral process after a stint in washington d c during the s where he worked for a succession of democratic power players he returned to california and worked for a time as chief of staff for then state controller gray davis before helping found an entertainment industry based non profit aimed at raising public awareness about environmental issues in he married his wife jennifer in a ceremony led by mr lear the producer the couple has three adopted daughters also in mr spahn received a call from mr geffen who was looking to ramp up his own political activities his previous political consultant hadnt worked out the two hit it off mr spahn says mr geffen struck him as "extremely smart " and "high energy" but "unfocused" about how to fulfill his desire to have a big impact beyond the entertainment business at the end of that two hour first meeting mr geffen asked mr spahn when he could start mr geffen says mr spahn came well recommended by the democratic community and he liked his "dedication his commitment to make things better and his humility " in addition to focusing his political and philanthropic agenda including the fight against aids mr geffen was looking to expand and deepen his friendships with powerful politicians particularly bill clinton an opportunity came in when mrs clinton asked mr geffen to help organize a th birthday party for her husband by getting crosby stills &amp nash a favorite band of his to perform at the white house mr spahn helped put that gala together mr geffen soon became one of the democratic partys top fundraisers hosting numerous events at his various homes mr spahn worked furiously behind the scenes organizing the events and dialing for dollars from his growing list of prospective donors that list he says now numbers over mr spahn estimates that during the clinton administration mr geffen raised &# million for democratic politicians and causes as well as contributing a like amount to various charities through the geffen foundation at a white house state dinner for russian president boris yeltsin three of the guests messrs geffen spielberg and katzenberg began talking about starting a new movie studio together the result was dreamworks skg and a new job for mr spahn as the companys head of corporate affairs and de facto political consultant for the three very politically active founders one of his first assignments put him at odds with local environmental activists over dreamworks plan to build its headquarters complex in an environmentally sensitive part of west los angeles mr spahn used his liberal credentials and past donations by the dreamworks founders to environmental causes to head off opposition from major environmental groups and isolate critics of the headquarters project says marcia hanscom one of the opponents "i think andys job was to neutralize the environmentalists that was very disappointing because of his history but sometimes power can influence people in a way thats not the best " mr spahn says he is very comfortable with dreamworks environmental record the headquarters project eventually died largely for financial reasons after the democrats stumbled badly in the midterm elections losing control of congress the dreamworks trio held a gala at mr spielbergs pacific palisades estate attended by the clintons with entertainment provided by comic robin williams the event raised around &# million for the battered democrats one photograph on mr spahns office wall shows mr katzenberg hugging a much taller al gore from behind while mrs clinton singer elton john and mr spahn look on laughing when dreamworks spun off its animation unit into a separate public company in and the three partners sold the rest of dreamworks to viacom inc s paramount pictures unit the following year mr spahn at the urging of messrs spielberg and katzenberg started his own consulting firm and the two men signed up as his clients mr spahns firm also represents environmental defense formerly known as the environmental defense fund and the academy of motion picture arts and sciences which oversees the academy awards the run up to the presidential campaign has thrown mr spahn into overdrive earlier this year when mr geffen and mr katzenberg decided to put on a big fundraiser for sen obama mr spahn handled much of the organizing and made many of the fundraising phone calls for the event which raised more than&# million for the obama campaign an accomplishment that mr spahn describes as a "huge wake up call" for the clinton camp signaling that hollywoods long love affair with the clintons could be in jeopardy then mr geffen dumped on the clintons in an interview with new york times columnist maureen dowd "everybody in politics lies " said mr geffen "but the clintons do it with such ease its troubling " when mr geffen was deluged with press calls on the morning ms dowds column ran he frantically called mr spahn for help though the consultant acknowledges with a laugh his former client didnt offer to pay mr spahn put together a statement he distributed to reporters indicating that mr geffen was not speaking on behalf of the obama camp mr geffen says he still values mr spahns advice but after becoming "disillusioned" with politics towards the end of the clinton administration he does not feel his level of political activity requires a full time consultant any more having aided mr katzenberg and mr geffen mr spahn then turned to helping mr spielberg who had evoked some unhappiness from the clinton camp when he signed on as a co sponsor of the obama fundraiser mostly as a favor to his two friends and former business partners mr spahn helped put together a fundraiser for mrs clinton co hosted by mr spielberg that raised just under &# million mr spahn also helped mr spielberg craft a statement formally endorsing sen clinton a move that attracted widespread media attention mr spahn says that at the time the column by ms farrow and her son ronan attacking mr spielberg ran he was already helping mr spielberg draft a letter to chinas president requesting changes in chinas darfur policy for now the controversy has died down but mr spahn isnt taking any chances he recently obtained a chinese visa in hopes of eventually getting a meeting with government officials there to discuss darfur
