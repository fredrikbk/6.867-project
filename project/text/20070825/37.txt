pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink mystery in a tall glass when prohibition slouched off into oblivion in the newly legalized liquor business was eager to show it was committed to the responsible enjoyment of its product it wasnt just drunkenness the industry wanted to disassociate itself from but also the notion that drinkers were slothful citizens donn beach and his don the beachcomber bar with its slate of potent rum concoctions and its celebration of an ethic of indolence were decidedly off message beach was born in louisiana to the name ernest raymond beaumont gantt after gauguining his way around the pacific he settled in hollywood in time to open his first bar as he put it "a few minutes after prohibition was repealed " he crowded the walls with polynesian tchotchkes and created a menu of rum drinks as elaborate as they were potent achieving almost instant notoriety was the zombie a drink with a jigger each of three kinds of rum and one of those overproof at that served in a towering glass the beachcomber issued a barnumesque dare declaring the drink so potent that he would serve no more than two to a customer drinks author david embury would later note that the "fear inspiring slogan" simply guaranteed that "everyone except caspar milquetoast of course comes back for a third " within a couple of years donns drink and his club were tinseltown icons don the beachcomber came to be nicknamed the "zombie palace " and beach kept four filipino barmen cranking the drinks out they were relegated to the kitchen to keep prying eyes from discerning the mystery drinks ingredients and even the bartenders were in the dark about the makeup of certain key ingredients such as "donns mix " beach had good reason to protect his secret formula "trader vic" was just plain victor bergeron until he saw donns joint in hollywood he promptly remade his own oakland restaurant a hunting lodge themed place called hinky dinks into a south seas idyll trader vic served zombies and in stetson offered a straw hat it named the zombie "with a bow to trader vic " but the most egregious usurper was a broadway publicist producer and nightclub impresario named monte proser who promoted himself as "the father of the zombie " proser is best remembered as the man behind new yorks copacabana nightspot where he hired headliners such as frank sinatra and martin &amp lewis but before opening the copa he got a taste for exotically themed boites with a worlds fair bar called monte prosers zombie and then a string of east coast restaurants called "the beachcomber " naturally he featured zombies and even hewed to the well worn vow that no more than two would be sold to a customer even aside from his theft of the beachcomber concept there is no doubt that proser was the greatest fraud in the history of the tiki craze he didnt even like rum he was a scotch and water man syndicated columnist lucius beebe seemed to think the new york beachcomber was an extension of the original california club which he described as "a gloomy grotto of strong waters specializing in rum toddies of paralyzing dimensions " in a article headlined "rash of tropical saloons spreads across nation " beebe wrote that it would soon "be possible to cross the continent without ever emerging from a zombie swoon " he was not thrilled by the prospect and predicted the tiki fad would soon fizzle he was only off by about or years which was how long it took for the deluge of faux polynesia finally to dry up there arent many places to go these days to get a zombie even fewer with a clue how to make one thanks to beachs secrecy but jeff "beachbum" berry has devoted years to tracking down the original recipes from the beachcomber and other polynesian themed bars the zombie has been his white whale in "intoxica " mr berry printed what he believed to be beachs original recipe only to discover later two new primary sources for a competing recipe in his newest book on tiki drinks "sippin safari " mr berry allows that this one made with lime pineapple and grapefruit juices falernum a tropical syrup pastis cinnamon syrup and grenadine not to mention the rums may be the most authentic but i prefer the version he had previously championed made with lime lemon and pineapple juices passion fruit syrup sugar angostura and rum it is a zombie that mr berry suspects donn himself simplified to be made at home not only is it manageable but it tastes better too and a recipe is always in the tasting embury in his book "the fine art of mixing drinks " may have denounced the zombie as "the most overadvertised overemphasized overexalted and foolishly feared drink whose claims to glory ever assaulted the eyes and ears of the gullible american public " but when he put one to his lips he had to admit that "actually as a drink it is not bad at all " email me at eric felten wsj com zombie  oz fresh lime juice  oz fresh lemon juice  oz pineapple juice  oz passion fruit syrup  oz white rum  oz gold rum  oz proof demerara rum  tsp brown sugar  dash angostura muddle the brown sugar in the citrus until it is dissolved then shake all the ingredients with plenty of crushed ice pour without straining into a tall highball glass and garnish with a sprig of mint and remember dont even think about having a third one
