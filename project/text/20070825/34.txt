pursuits books five best an unrivaled portrait of the era of americas founding emerges from these works of history biography and memoir says author jay winik  thomas jefferson by fawn m brodie norton this subtle account of thomas jeffersons life richly illustrates his many contradictions and accomplishments author of the declaration of independence yet lifelong slaveholder revolutionary statesman yet almost reactionary defender of states rights a lover of mankind yet a fervent hater he loathed cities industrialists and federalists without distinction as fawn m brodie delves into jeffersons personal and public lives her greatest achievement is in capturing his humanity even as she gradually reveals his often darker side when this book first came out it was derided by critics as "psycho history" and condemned for having the temerity to suggest that jefferson fathered a child with sally hemmings brodies work might be provocative but it is also compelling her jefferson is a dreamer a visionary and a romantic he is also tragic and poignant and conflicted which is just about right  the memoirs and anecdotes of the count de segur translated by gerard shelley scribner born on the eve of the seven years war the french count de segur was part of a rarefied circle of globetrotting diplomats who crossed borders spoke in foreign tongues and fomented revolution they were often the engine of the events upending the old order with great idealism segur left the comforts of the french court to join the american rebels in their struggle for independence and he soon added george washington to his list of illustrious friends a traveler poet and ambassador segur was an intimate of both louis xvi and marie antoinette he distinguished himself as a general under napoleon and he captivated no less than russias empress catherine the great traveling with catherine to crimea in the s he discussed with her of all things the young american republic catherine snapped "if i had lost any of the provinces the way king george did i would have blown my brains out with a pistol " segurs reply is immortal "the air of our age is that of philosophy and freedom it enters palaces as well as huts " segurs memoirs relating monumental events in an unsparing voice are among the greatest of the era  the age of the democratic revolution by r r palmer princeton vol vol this book belongs to a now dwindling genre of sweeping historical surveys grappling with big ideas r r palmers subject is the revolutionary tide that swept europe in the s he succeeds handsomely in this ambitious project though perhaps more partial to the french revolution than many of his readers might be and arguably too understated when he assesses the significance of americas rebellion it showed only "mild accents of liberty" palmer deftly captures the cataclysms of the age we see the rape of poland the subjugation of italy the rise of napoleon we see britain and austria seeking to stamp out the revolutionary menace and we see france sliding into chaos and seeking to export its fervor to america though at times heavy going "the age of the democratic revolution" recalls the best sort of historical survey classes we once took in college  george washington by douglas southall freeman scribner despite all that has been written about the legendary general and president george washington remains the most impenetrable of the founders forever austere dignified aloof and unapproachable yet douglas southall freeman who is best known for his monumental biography of robert e lee has done as good a job as anyone in pulling together the threads of washingtons life washington emerges as not the most brilliant man of his day or the most eloquent or even the most militarily gifted for that matter his administration was troubled such as by the controversy over its tax policies which helped ignite the whiskey rebellion in western pennsylvania in in the end however what comes across in this biography i prefer the abridged edition published in is that in a thousand little ways washington was destined to become the most important of americas founders  the ordeal of thomas hutchinson by bernard bailyn harvard before the american revolution thomas hutchinson was perhaps the most distinguished colonial official of his day he was the royal governor of massachusetts and americas most eminent historian but like a third of the colonists he remained stubbornly wedded to the british crown thus becoming one of the most hated men on the continent he was variously denounced as "dark intriguing and ambitious" and as an "arch fiend " in a mob enraged by his support for the stamp act stormed into his house and when he was nowhere to be found stabbed his portrait with bayonets exiled to britain in hutchinson became a broken man forever longing to be buried in american soil bailyn writes the story with uncommon sensitivity and elegance and he powerfully reminds us that americas revolution stripped of its mythology was a painful even tragic civil war mr winik is the author of "april " his latest book "the great upheaval america and the birth of the modern world " will be published by harpercollins next month
