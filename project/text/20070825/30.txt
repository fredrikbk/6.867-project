no headline available one might have thought that "knife skills" like chewing and swallowing skills come naturally even our paleolithic ancestors seem to have mastered a basic cutting technique but according to peter hertzmann who "teaches knife skills" for the sur la table kitchenware chain "as well as privately in both the united states and france" there is still a lot for us to learn with "knife skills illustrated " he has produced a meaty book with the dimensions of a modest cutting board it is padded out only slightly do we really need mirror image left handed versions of each knife technique otherwise mr hertzmann offers a near comprehensive guide to slicing dicing and chopping and to selecting caring for and sharpening cutlery at times he is so thorough that the reader may be reminded of the anal retentive chef character on "saturday night live" years ago there are individual chapters on cutting fruits and vegetables and nine pages on onions alone a whole chapter is devoted to that not so hardy perennial fennel mr hertzmann may go too far when he claims that with good knife skills "cutting a carrot is no longer a chore but a meditation" yet he provides a lot of useful information the "pinch grip" "you pinch the blade with your thumb and forefinger and wrap only the other three fingers around the handle" is an astoundingly simple but effective way of adding firmness and control to knife use and in an age of overpriced "trophy knives " mr hertzmann exercises commendable restraint all that most home kitchens minimally require he says is a paring knife a chefs knife and perhaps a slicer "knife skills illustrated" makes one serious omission however there is not a word about shucking knives and bivalve opening techniques anyone who enjoys a good oyster on the half shell will regret that mr hertzmann chose to clam up on this subject aram bakshian jr
