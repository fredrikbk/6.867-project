pursuits food &amp drink eating out duck confit in terminal five as passengers face more delays than ever one chain is making layovers more palatable every seat is filled on my mile flight from podunk to germfask im in the middle seat of course between a man with an extender for his seatbelt and a wailing toddler separated by the airline computer from his parents rows away for my nonrefundable &# i will receive free canned beverages with unfamiliar brand names such as mr t and a meal of unhealthy snacks we boarded an hour late and we sit for two more hours waiting to take off but at least the flight wasnt canceled and the delay means my five hour layover at tin can airs germfask hub will last only two hours thats where vino volo comes in maybe you have already noticed that in airports all over the country from sacramento to baltimore a suave chain of wine bars with first rate food have popped up to help the buffeted traveler endure aviation hell i first happened into a vino volo in the seattle airport could it be that i was hallucinating in an elegant setting right in the so called sterile zone the space where you end up after youve passed security and mislaid your picture id i was being asked by a polite fellow which of his many open wines i might wish to taste perhaps a flight of northwest coast reds with a small plate of salumi on the side vino volo is not the only escape hatch from jet age misery while the airlines have done their worst to turn their customers into victims of criminal mistreatment a tilt toward better terminals and higher quality of food service on the ground is helping to alleviate some of the pain of hard time in the tsa security gulag new glamorous terminals are obvious venues for higher scale retailing and the virtual elimination of inflight meals on domestic flights has spawned airport food courts that often include ethnic food stands and sophisticated deli markets and restaurants with a wide range of carry on provender at jfk airport in new york deltas terminal two has balduccis stylish deli food at the sapphire martini bar wine bars also play a role in this creeping upgrade jfks terminal one a new facility for international flights opening this fall will offer new york state vintages at its idlewild wine bar the big apple seems to be following the provinces in this trend notably north carolina where in state wine producers opened a successful tasting and retail store at charlotte douglas airport in vino volo established itself at four sterile zones before making a jfk debut at american airlines terminal nine an airy technoid facility filled with luxury boutiques including a metropolitan museum of art shop we dropped in at the vino volo for lunch a few days ago and plunked ourself down in a modern looking leather chair with old fashioned comfort an eager and vinously informed young woman called jennifer emerged from the adjacent vino volo wine store bearing a menu and a wine list in a spirit of earnest inquiry we ordered several of the small platters smoked salmon came as rollups attractively plated duck confit with lentils and a generous sprinkling of cracklings was bathed in a vinaigrette made from banyuls a wine of provence the same region where duck has been parcooked in its own fat and preserved in this way for centuries the plate white china like the others of cured meats included prosciutto fennel salami and jambon de bayonne with crisp fried crostini sliced from a good baguette style loaf and bocconcini little balls of mozzarella the teetotaler could limit herself to this food alone and wash it down with a bottle of sparkling tau water from wales but once again performing a reportorial service for travelers i matched these platters with appropriate flights of wines for the duck i ordered shades of white a trio of glasses each roughly half full of villa maria cellar selection sauvignon blanc from the central otago region of new zealand and two from california terlato family vineyards russian river valley pinot grigio and ferrari caranos alexander valley chardonnay this adventure in global quaffing cost &# the glasses arrived on a silvery tray atop a sheet of information about the wines to describe each wine vino volo provides a chart divided into four quadrants bright light rich and brooding a black dot shows where the wine falls in the spectrum vino volo pegged the sauvignon blanc as bright the chardonnay as rich the pinot grigios dot hovered over the line between bright and light next to each chart were tasting notes the chardonnay we were told has "enticing aromas of dried apricots papaya and mango with a toasted almond finish " even with such mellifluous guidance the wines gave us much to think about ditto for a flight of "world value reds" from italy spain and argentina and a tonier troika of pinot noirs from new zealand burgundy and california we wound up our simple repast with the elite sommelier series a duo representing the upper reaches of vinification from california caymus vineyards cabernet special selection and bordeaux a carruades de lafite for a total of &# every wine was for sale by the bottle next door ready to carry on remember there are no restrictions on liquids bought in the sterile zone all in all this lunch was a good omen for frequent flyers everywhere indeed vino volo could compete handily in the distinctly unsterile zone of manhattan island and there you wouldnt have to pay a three digit cover charge in the form of a boarding pass
