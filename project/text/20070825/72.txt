the week ahead our take on coming events tobacco altria spinoff would liberate international arm by vanessa oconnell altria group inc is likely to announce a spinoff of its philip morris international tobacco arm after a board meeting wednesday that would create a new company unfettered by legal and public relations problems in the u s to blanket overseas markets aggressively though altria management has been largely mum about any plan to break up the two units one based in lausanne switzerland and the other in richmond va there are ample signs that it is heading down that path earlier this summer altria said its international tobacco business would no longer import about billion cigarettes annually from its u s sister company and instead would gets its entire supply internationally primarily from its own manufacturing centers the largest are in holland russia germany turkey and the ukraine philip morris international produced a whopping billion cigarettes last year more than four times the billion cigarettes its american sibling made for the u s market also telling the international unit last month began providing wall street with more financial details about its four key regional markets breaking out the slowly declining european and latin american markets where quarterly cigarette volumes fell and respectively from the more stable eastern europe middle east and africa where cigarettes volumes rose and high growth asia up overseas growth contrasts with philip morris usas volume which shrank in the latest quarter from a year earlier for all of philip morris international had revenue of &# billion compared with &# billion at philip morris usa ironically one of the biggest rationales for the spinoff of the international business used to be the argument that it needed to move away from the shadow cast by the u s companys legal woes only a few years ago legal challenges against philip morris usa seemed ominous enough that some speculated there was a chance the domestic cigarette company might be forced to file for bankruptcy protection yet those same litigation problems would have made a spinoff harder with plaintiffs attorneys likely crying foul at any attempt to remove assets today in the wake of several important courtroom victories the litigation environment in the u s has changed significantly and few if any antitobacco plaintiff lawyers would have legal grounds to be able to successfully block the spinoff of philip morris international because at the moment merely four major class action claims are pending against philip morris usa the litigation situation aside altria investors feel there are plenty of compelling reasons for a breakup which could be completed by early the intent is to give both companies new life with greater product innovation and the capability to make acquisitions and aggressive moves to return some of their substantial free cash flow to investors an independent international unit could use its own shares as currency in any deals it is likely that management incentives would be linked to the share price of each respective tobacco unit rather than to the performance of the global entity with all of its various markets lumped together nonetheless any spinoff of the overseas business could potentially delay major share buybacks until because only after the companies are finally separated would their respective boards have the chance to mull such a move earnings dell inc is finally getting back to business by christopher lawton the round rock texas personal computer company will report fiscal second quarter earnings on thursday the first financial results from dell since the company concluded an investigation by its audit committee into its own finances the investigation found

it began in august applauded dell for finally giving a face and a number to the probe while dell is still being investigated by the securities and exchange commission over the accounting issues investors are eager to refocus on the companys fundamentals and theres a lot to focus on including software acquisitions and a growing business selling pcs at retail stores dells stock is up since the investigations conclusion earlier this month shares may rise further after thursday wall street expects the pc giant to report improved quarterly results from a year ago thanks in part to growing international sales its consumer pc push and favorable trends that include declining prices for the pc component called memory also the companys enterprise business experienced the strongest growth in world wide server sales in the second quarter according to idc a market research firm over all wall street projects dell will earn cents a share for the quarter ended aug up from a year earlier revenue is expected to be up to &# billion according to thomson financial the results are preliminary since dell has yet to file some delinquent reports with the sec and the company wont host a call for analysts dell says it expects to file the delinquent reports with the sec by the first week in november but dells hard work is just beginning brent bracelin an analyst with pacific crest

accelerate in " a dell spokesman declined to comment steel a possible delay in arcelor deal by robert guy matthews and anne jolis the proposed linkup of steelmakers mittal steel nv and arcelor sa could be delayed early this coming week if a group of dissident arcelor shareholders can convince european courts that they are being forced to take a low ball offer for their shares the courts are set to rule on the case monday a day before mittal steel shareholders meet to approve the first of two phases of the merger the minority arcelor shareholders some of whom bought stock last year after netherlands based mittal bid for luxembourg based arcelor want the payment terms for the deal to be subject to dutch or french law where greater shareholder protections might be available rather than solely luxembourg law arcelor shares are listed in france and the netherlands minority hedge fund shareholders including srm global master fund limited partnership trafalgar catalyst fund and trafalgar entropy fund have filed suit in a dutch court a small group of individual minority shareholders have filed suit in a french court if the courts find in favor of the shareholders they could require a postponement in shareholder votes to approve the deal mittal already has said it would immediately appeal any such decision and would seek to still hold its shareholder vote on tuesday whatever the courts decide it is unlikely that the proposed merger would fall through even the dissident shareholders behind the court action want the merger to go forward they just want to leave with a heftier profit from the proposed price tag of billion euros &# billion in cash and shares mittal steel isnt publicly speculating about the outcome of the merger or saying whether it would pay what would amount to about &# million the hedge funds claim they are losing under the current deal ""we strongly believe that the ratio is equitable to both arcelor minorities and mittal steel shareholders " said company spokesman bill steers in an email response to questions about the shareholder complaints he said the company will publish an independent "fairness report" in coming weeks that aims to show that shareholders rights werent violated these minority shareholders if they win in court would be more of an annoyance than an actual financial headache for mittal steel mittal certainly has enough cash to pay the &# million additionally the proposed merger is expected to sail through approval votes by both the mittal and arcelor boards indeed mittal and arcelor already are calling themselves arcelormittal even though the merger has yet to be formally approved by shareholders mittal plans on tuesday to ask shareholders to approve combining the company with arcelormittal sa a holding company created to execute the merger arcelor would then combine with arcelormittal later this year the postmerger arcelormittal would be the worlds largest steelmaker by sales garnering about of the steel market that makes the proposed company well positioned to profit from the strong steel market steel prices globally are expected to continue to rise as demand increases in china india and the middle east world wide steelmakers are making the most of the recent uptick in steel demand by buying each other to form ever bigger companies by being bigger steelmakers have stronger control over how much steel to sell on the market constricting supply helps to keep prices higher a good move for steel companies but ultimately bad for automobile makers appliance companies construction companies and other steel consumers that strategy was largely spurred by mittal steels aggressive purchase of smaller steelmakers around the world over the past several years
