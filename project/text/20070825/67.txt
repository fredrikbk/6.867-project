the easy way to hard rock distressed guitars new models are beat up to look like old ones the police use doubles corona calif at the fender guitar factory here recently mike eldred carefully laid the freshly painted body of a baby blue stratocaster on a workbench he then proceeded to scar the new instruments delicate lacquer surface using a menacing leather strap adorned with belt buckles nuts and other hardware normally even one of the resulting scratches or dings on a brand new instrument would make a guitar enthusiast cringe but in the hands of mr eldred they are the first steps in the process of creating a "relic" guitar a brand new instrument that has been deliberately aged to simulate decades worth of rock and roll wear and tear "this is the one i really like " mr eldred says forcefully swinging his makeshift tool to leave a deep welt in the strats body he calls the resulting gash "the cymbal stand" because its meant to look "like the guitarist bumped into the drum set during a gig " relics have taken off recently for a simple reason the market for real vintage guitars has skyrocketed far beyond the reach of average collectors with the most desirable instruments now fetching &# or more and even lesser axes commanding tens of thousands of dollars that has sent collectors of more modest means scrambling for guitars that look virtually identical to decades old instruments even though they are brand new for example the abuse inflicted on the handcrafted stratocaster made by mr eldred a replica of the instrument as it was built in will contribute to its &# price tag a &# premium over a comparable model that hasnt been similarly mistreated before assembling and shipping out "relic" guitars mr eldreds employees at fender musical instruments corp s custom shop will use powerful industrial solvents to create worn spots in the paint and the subfreezing accelerant from aerosol cans to mimic the subtle "weather checking" cracks that spider across old lacquer surfaces with sandpaper workers simulate finger wear on the fretboard they dull the chrome plating on brass fittings in a vibrating electric "tumbler" normally used by lapidary artists to polish rocks then further degrade the metal using nitric acid which also is used to rust screws and other steel hardware furniture dye and grease pencil imbue exposed wood with the nightclub appropriate hues of tobacco smoke and spilled whiskey "usually in a collectible condition is very important " says vince cunetto who as a contractor did aging work on fenders relics when the company began making them in the mid s "here thats all reversed " mr cunetto now builds his own vinetto brand guitars including an "artifact" line that employs many of the same antiquing techniques there is great debate within the guitar collecting community about the faux vintage instruments worth over the long term "theyre too new to say whether they retain value " says hawley waldman a new york guitar builder and technician shai mizrahi a year old professional martial arts fighter and amateur blues musician recently added a relic to his collection of mostly vintage guitars he says he was somewhat skeptical about paying almost &# for the artificially distressed replica of a stratocaster built at fenders custom shop "i struggled with this concept " he says but he now calls the relic his favorite guitar and plays it more often for instance than his stratocaster that cost &# he says the prematurely worn in neck and body make the instrument play better than an untouched new instrument and he prefers the way the artificial aging looks to that of many of his genuinely old guitars "its new but it feels broken in " he says for most people who buy relics the idea is simply to own a cool looking guitar "a lot of the guys we sell to are dentists or lawyers or whatever " says dave rogers owner of daves guitars in la crosse wis where fenders relic line accounts for more than of its &# million annual sales "theyre never going to put in the wear and tear to make it look like a real one " "i always use the pre faded blue jean analogy " says tom murphy whose guitar preservation inc does antiquing work for fenders main competitor the gibson guitar corp "we know what thats all about why wait just buy em like that " some relics are so painstakingly aged that the end result is scratch for scratch copies of legendary guitars owned by real rock stars this even appeals to the rock stars themselves who have put in decades of sweat equity to create the real thing as their prized vintage instruments have become increasingly valuable and fragile some have begun using replicas of their famous guitars especially on long tours mr murphy a former professional musician who in the early s played guitar in marie osmonds touring band has built replicas now played by led zeppelins legendary guitarist jimmy page and aerosmiths joe perry among others in a few instances guitar makers have sold limited runs of replicas with every nick scratch and stain duplicated on new instruments made to look and feel like those made famous by eric clapton mr page and the clashs joe strummer fender is producing copies of police guitarist andy summerss telecaster which he bought used in for &# which are authentic right down to the broken bridge and quirky custom electronics the replicas are being offered at &# each dealers have already sold most of them sight unseen according to fender and dealers this summer mr summers is using three of the replicas on his bands reunion tour he is leaving the original home in los angeles the british born guitarist says that visually and musically he cant tell the difference between the doppelgangers and the original whose battered paint job he compares to "a map of a foreign planet " when mr summers was shown the first finished duplicate at a recording studio in los angeles he says he experienced "a quantum physics moment i said its back at my house hows it here its an impossibility " such sentiments run counter to the emotional attachment many guitarists feel to their main instrument in an autobiography published last year mr summers wrote about his telecaster in deeply romantic terms "arriving at this guitar was a bit like having several relationships with the wrong women before finding the one you truly love and will spend the rest of your life with " selling duplicates to potentially any hobbyist with a five figure budget then spawned "a peculiar feeling " mr summers acknowledges but he says he doesnt want to be "insane" in his possessiveness "people love it and i want to share it " the "reasonably substantial" fee fender is paying him has helped him get over any lingering hesitation "its like found money " he says on the tour mr summerss bandmate sting is playing a replica of his worn fender precision bass the company says it made just one copy for him and hasnt approached sting about a production model of his instrument thanks largely to the growing stakes the relic phenomenon has generated controversy within the often claustrophobic subculture of high end guitar builders one of the biggest independent builders bill nash turns out an estimated to relics a month all with shapes lifted from fenders famous models nashguitars artificially aged "timewarp" line includes an "s series" modeled on fenders sleek stratocaster design and a "t series" that looks like the blocky telecaster mr nash doesnt put fenders name or logo on his guitars which typically sell for about &# "nash is clearly attempting to rip off fender " mr eldred says mr nash doesnt dispute the design origins of his guitars "obviously im building replicas of old fenders " he says "but ive never said im fender theres room for everyone the fact is most people cant afford a custom shop guitar and they can afford mine " for instance his replica of guitar legend jeff becks battered fender esquire advertised under the moniker "e series jb model" sold for around &# fenders official version cost &# fender chief legal officer mark van vleet says in a statement that the company "protects and defends its intellectual property rights " it hasnt sued mr nash as for whether artificially distressed models sound better than comparable new guitars most people who build them say one common method improves the instruments sound painting it with a thin but fragile coating of lacquer which lets it resonate better than the thick tough polyurethane varnish favored today in large scale production but how do the replicas compare to truly old guitars aerosmiths mr perry says that while on tour he uses both vintage guitars which he usually hand carries and replicas "there are a lot of fantastic guitars being made now that can easily stand up to the sound of the vintage guitars " he says "however nothing sounds as good as the real thing "
