default lines condo troubles further squeeze property lenders full force of glut is felt as buyers back out more of the iceberg for the nations real estate lenders the other shoe may be about to drop condominiums already plagued by rising home loan defaults and foreclosures among overstretched consumers major markets across the country including parts of florida california and washington d c are seeing rising foreclosures and bankruptcies of entire condo projects the problems are emerging as some buyers who signed contracts to buy new condos two to three years ago when construction was just starting seek ways to back out as they encounter trouble getting financing in the suddenly dicey mortgage market falling prices are forcing appraisals down so banks arent willing to lend the full amounts that people committed to in the sales contract "closings that are scheduled to take place are not taking place " says marvin moss a north miami beach real estate attorney he is suing several developers to help clients get out of contracts the condo market while tied to the housing market overall behaves differently under stress while a single family home builder generally constructs units as orders come in a condo developer builds all at once and hopes for the best adding risk so while the speculative overhang of newly constructed single family homes may have peaked in many markets across the country the full force of the condo glut is starting to hit now with single family homes "you put up a couple of model homes and build the rest as you get sales contracts " says james haughey director of research at reed construction data in norcross ga "but you have to build the entire building before you can sell a single condo " in the number of new condominium units completed jumped to from in according to the u s census bureau last year was the highest level since when units were built so far this year units have been built and another are under construction according to new york research firm reis inc downtown san diego can expect new units to arrive on the market in the next year according to real estate investment brokerage marcus &amp millichap hessam nadji a managing director at the encino calif firm estimates it will take as long as to months for the most saturated markets to buy up the glut of condo inventory if the economy overall stays strong miami is in worse shape the city added condo units in and so far this year another will be delivered by the end of the year with another slated for to according to reis for a grand total of news units between and "more of the iceberg is being revealed but we havent seen it all yet " says norman radow an atlanta real estate investor who works with lenders to rescue distressed condo complexes typically condo developers are required to pay off construction loans shortly after construction is completed but with sales stalled more developers are defaulting creating headaches for banks and real estate funds that financed the projects the percentage of bank construction loans overall that are in default has risen to in the second quarter of from at the end of "condos are a significant share of defaults and delinquencies going on " says matthew anderson of foresight analytics an oakland calif research firm his analysis shows condo lending ballooned to &# billion in from &# billion in these figures dont include the large amounts flowing into condos from hedge funds and investment banks one of the biggest condo lenders chicagos corus bankshares has seen its &# billion portfolio of condo loans deteriorate the value of the banks nonperforming assets has skyrocketed to to &# million in the quarter ended june from &# a year ago the bank continues to be profitable and made three new condo loans worth &# million though it predicts darker times are ahead "it would not surprise us to see an even greater impact on earnings over the next several quarters or even years depending on when the market improves " chief executive robert glickman said in a note to shareholders the failures so far have been concentrated among developers that bought land or existing rental apartments to convert to condos at the top of the market in late or early the worst collapses have so far involved condo conversions developer triton real estate partners of annapolis md bought a rockville md complex known as the pavilion in november for &# million with plans to pump in &# million to upgrade and sell the units there are units so the average price it paid was &# a unit triton changed the name to the monterey and offered the one to three bedroom units for &# to &# the sales didnt materialize and triton failed to pay its lender cbre realty finance of hartford conn which foreclosed on the property in may with the sales market on the rocks the lender had to write down the projects value by &# million forcing the company to record a &# million loss in the second quarter the commercial property lender incorporated as a real estate investment trust has stopped making new investments and almost missed a &# million payment on a line of credit from wachovia corp it hopes to restart the sales program at the monterey complex shortly triton and cbre declined to comment buyers remorse is also causing problems for some developers cindy cicala plunked down a deposit on a &# two bedroom condo in a new project in tampa fla in august a time when investors were elbowing each other aside to sign contracts the site was particularly attractive to ms cicala because in addition to superb views her unit was to be finished by august making it one of the first high rise residences to be built in the citys reviving downtown but in april the developer asked for an extension "it was just one delay after another " says ms cicala a year old residential mortgage broker she decided she didnt want to close on the condo claiming the developer hadnt held up its end of the contract ms cicala says she asked for her deposit back but hasnt received it so she sued under a federal law that guarantees condos must be delivered within two years unless the developer can prove certain extenuating circumstances her attorney harry lee coe iv says ms cicala and other clients "are seeing their investing potential has dwindled and they are now no longer at the front of the pack and you dont want to be in the middle of the pack in a bad or down market " left holding the bag amid the defaults and foreclosures are the banks and real estate investment funds that lent money to people such as farbod zohouri an atlanta developer who took out &# million in loans for more than a dozen projects in and within a year all were foreclosed or had filed for bankruptcy protection in a sign of how widespread the condo frenzy was among lenders mr zohouris financing sources ranged from tiny local banks to lehman brothers which lent him &# million for two orlando condo conversion projects that flopped several commercial banks lent him money for five projects despite his relatively small operation and spotty track record which included a settlement with the federal government on mortgage kickback allegations mr zohouri who goes by "fred " says he is "an honest person" who is working hard to get his investors money back he says because of possible legal actions he cant explain exactly what went wrong underlying the defaults was a loosening of lending standards in the past wary of the high risks posed by condo sales lenders such as commercial banks would give money to condo projects with the understanding that if the condos didnt sell the developer could rent them and still repay the loan that would limit the amount banks would lend because the cash from renting units is slow and steady and can cover a smaller amount of debt than the amount generated by selling all units within a year of completion as most condo projects aim to do but in the latest boom a host of nonbank lenders began throwing cash at condo projects allowing developers to pay prices for land and buildings such that they could pay back the loans only if the units sold at high prices mr radow the atlanta real estate investor says troubles in the condo market stem from the proliferation of new players in the real estate finance world many of whom never went through bad times before the condo boom there were only about a dozen major sources of equity or mezzanine debt the riskiest and potentially most rewarding parts of real estate finance in past five years hedge funds real estate funds private equity and community banks all got into the act "who are managing all the funds " mr radow asks "where did all the real estate experts come from " jennifer s forsythe contributed to this article
