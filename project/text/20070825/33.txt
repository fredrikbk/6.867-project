pursuits books eisenhower revisited celebrating the d day mastermind and th president ike an american hero by michael korda harper pages &# at the height of his military career dwight d eisenhower commanded more than three million men in the most complicated combat operation of his time his title reflected his importance supreme commander something no previous american had ever been called its easy to forget that just a few years earlier in he had been a mere lieutenant colonel in contrast to battle hardened officers like douglas macarthur and george patton ike had more experience coaching army football teams than commanding soldiers in the s he had toiled in obscurity as macarthurs personal military assistant toward the end of world war ii when eisenhowers fame had surpassed even his someone asked macarthur if he knew eisenhower his reply "the best clerk i ever had " in "ike an american hero " michael korda has produced a sweeping crisply written account of eisenhowers meteoric rise through the ranks and his leadership of the war against nazi germany this biography is primarily the story of eisenhower as a military man and mr korda sees evidence of eisenhowers brilliance everywhere even in his courtship of the woman who would become his wife mamie doud initially shows no interest in the young lt eisenhower so he sets out to charm her parents first eventually he gets the girl to mr korda this success "shows early proof of both patience and a gift for strategy " thats a stretch but generally mr korda makes the case that even though he had never seen combat eisenhower had been perfectly prepared by his military career before world war ii for the ultimate combat assignment in his introduction mr korda tells us that there is "a natural ebb and flow" to historical reputations of great leaders and that "a reputation can be revived by a single great book " just as david mccullough rescued the reputations of john adams and harry truman mr korda wants to defend eisenhower against those who have portrayed him as a weak military strategist and a detached often incoherent president in mr kordas narrative eisenhower is a decisive leader a man of unquestioned integrity and "in every sense of the words an american hero " the british generals who would ultimately serve under eisenhowers command didnt see him that way "i am afraid that eisenhower as a general is hopeless " british gen alan brooke wrote in his diary during the darker moments of the allied campaign in north africa in "he submerges himself in politics and neglects his military duties partly i am afraid because he knows little if anything about military matters " field marshall bernard montgomery assessed ike this way "i should say he was good probably on the political line but he obviously knows nothing whatever about fighting " eisenhower had been a mediocre student at west point graduating th in a class of and nearly getting thrown out a couple times because of disciplinary problems but mr korda says that eisenhowers more important military education came later when he was assigned to panama and the staff of brig gen fox conner an officer who embodied the best of the armys warrior scholar tradition for three years in panama from to conner took eisenhower under his wing and became something of a personal tutor putting eisenhower through an intensive course in military strategy and history from the ancient greeks to world war i with conners help eisenhower was admitted to the command and general staff school the elite training ground for the armys future leaders in stark contrast to his performance at west point eisenhower graduated first in his class "proof at last " mr korda writes "of his intellectual and professional abilities " much to his disappointment eisenhower continued to get staff assignments in the army but they were not just any staff assignments he would become an indispensable aide to two of the most celebrated and difficult men in the army gen john j pershing and douglas macarthur pershing so trusted eisenhower that he tapped him to write his memoirs and eisenhower became not macarthurs "clerk" but his most important aide working on his staff for seven years at the pentagon and in the philippines "ike was never the simple soldier he made himself out to be " mr korda writes "certainly not after his apprenticeship in military politics beside douglas macarthur it would be like calling the private secretary of the pope a simple man of god " mr korda argues that the unlikely choice of eisenhower as supreme commander was the greatest stroke of good fortune the allies had in world war ii the choice of the wrong commander he says could have led to hitlers victory this again may be a stretch the russians on the eastern front had a great deal to say about hitlers fate in any case eisenhower was uniquely suited to command a coalition made up of competing interests and larger than life egos "his sincerity his grasp of detail and his lack of ceremony made it difficult if not impossible to refuse him " mr korda writes "his skill lay precisely in getting stubborn difficult and bloody minded people churchill de gaulle montgomery and patton among them to do what he wanted despite their objections " churchill for example argued with all his rhetorical power against the invasion of normandy favoring the balkans instead he told eisenhower "we must take care that the tides do not run red with the blood of american and british youth or the beaches be choked with their bodies " ever the diplomat eisenhower was "practiced in the art of listening politely without agreeing " eisenhowers political career apparently doesnt interest mr korda very much ikes eight years in the white house get just pages his creation of the interstate highway system one of the most socially transformative government programs of the th century merits only a few sentences still mr korda sees eisenhower in heroic terms as a great and underrated president he argues that ike was actually a bolder civil rights leader than either john f kennedy or lyndon b johnson as evidence he points to eisenhowers decision to federalize the national guard to enforce the desegregation of the little rock ark school system "perhaps the chief reason why ike does not get the credit he deserves in this area " writes mr korda "is that unlike lyndon johnson he had no interest in being portrayed as someone at the center of a national psycho drama and unlike kennedy he did not make decisions while surrounded by friendly newsmen and photographers he preferred to operate quietly with the absolute minimum of public posturing " mr korda leaves no doubt that he likes ike and occasionally comes across as more cheerleader than biographer he is certain for example that ike would not have made the mistakes of future presidents mr kordas eisenhower would have avoided the vietnam war ensured success in the bay of pigs and would never have been so foolish as to invade iraq mr korda also states flatly that president eisenhower despite his reputation was a hands on leader with a detailed knowledge and control of all the major issues affecting his administration "no american president had ever exercised power more surely or more deftly or under greater pressure of time and events " mr korda writes in a burst of typical overstatement mr korda so admires eisenhower that he even gives him a pass on what is arguably his greatest mistake holding his forces back in early and allowing the soviets to take berlin "berlin is no longer a particularly important objective " ike explained at the time "its usefulness to the germans has largely been destroyed and even his hilters government is preparing to move to another area " churchill bitterly disagreed arguing that "berlin remains of high strategic importance" and that "we should shake hands with the russians as far to the east as possible " history would prove churchill tragically correct and the decision to leave berlin to stalin would haunt the western world for a half century but mr korda defends eisenhower claiming weakly that nobody not even churchill could have known in how much a threat stalins soviet union would become you have to wonder whether eisenhower really needs michael korda to save his historical reputation ike is actually doing quite well these days mr korda is hardly the first to contend that he has been underestimated either as a politician or military strategist mr korda relies almost entirely on secondary sources or published primary sources but he seems to have read virtually everything written on eisenhowers military career and has done a superb job of turning such material into a readable vibrant narrative academics may dismiss "ike an american hero" as popular history but most others will read with pleasure a great american story well told mr karl is senior national security correspondent for
