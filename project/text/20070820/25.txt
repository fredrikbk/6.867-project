fixing the air traffic mess this summers record level of flight delays is just the beginning as our skies become more crowded and airline passengers approach a billion a year the nations air traffic control system is close to maxing out its capacity without fundamental change we are facing unacceptable delays higher prices and safety concerns year round these delays affect the entire economy through lost productivity and higher costs fortunately an interagency task force of experts from nasa and the departments of defense and transportation has been working on a dramatic transformation of air traffic control its called "nextgen " and it would triple the systems capacity without tripling the workforce nextgen would do this by harnessing precise information from gps satellites advanced communications and sophisticated automation to shift from air traffic control to air traffic management this "network centric" system would make it possible to manage air traffic from anywhere in the country no longer would we need hundreds of air traffic control facilities located directly beneath the pieces of sky they control the entire system could be managed from a few dozen new high tech facilities at a substantial cost saving to taxpayers key components of nextgen are already moving forward the backbone of the system has been tested extensively in alaska and other components have been tested on a smaller scale technology is not the impediment for deploying the system bureaucratic inertia at the federal aviation administration and congresss penchant for micromanagement is to break the stalemate i propose we dust off an idea i introduced in the s to address another highly political issue the military base closure commission whose findings can only be approved not amended by congress the major obstacle to creating a state of the art system is facilities consolidation the faa today operates en route centers approach control tracon facilities hundreds of control towers and thousands of ground based navigation aids with maintenance staff each one is in a member of congresss district one nextgen proposal would replace all centers and tracons with only super hubs as well as retiring ground based navigational aids this would produce enormous cost savings while greatly increasing the productivity of air traffic controllers unfortunately congress has a long history of resisting the consolidation of air traffic facilities just as it did for many years with military bases throughout the s and s the defense department had full authority to close or realign military bases as necessary yet allegations frequently arose about base closures as a form of political payback and congress attempted to insert itself in the process earlier efforts were vetoed but in under president jimmy carter congress finally passed a law that stymied the base closing process with a series of bureaucratic hurdles including an environmental impact assessment once this law was enacted no bases were closed until when i introduced and congress passed legislation that would take the politics out of the process this was just in time as the end of the cold war left america with far too many bases and every one of them was in somebodys district and protected by bureaucratic maneuvering under the new legislation an independent base realignment and closure brac commissions recommendations would be put to an up or down vote with no possibilities for amendments it has worked so far we have had five rounds of base realignments and closings with the latest approved in the first four rounds are estimated to have saved more than &# billion as of with recurring savings of &# billion per year since then the success of brac with the military makes it an ideal template for the faa since congress must reauthorize the faa this year there is an opportunity for reform and modernization restructuring the nations air traffic control facilities will help bring nextgen technologies online and ease mounting congestion problems a commission can ensure that the nextgen technologies developed by the inter agency task force are not deep sixed by politics a senate bill s has cleared the commerce committee and calls for the faa to develop a realignment and consolidation plan but the plan would simply be delivered to congress where if history and recent practice are any guides it would be dead on arrival recently congress came within an inch of rejecting the consolidation of flight service stations and recent bills would forbid the faa from consolidating any more tracons delegating the details of facility consolidation to the faa or better yet to the new stakeholder board that the senate bill also calls for would be a major challenge but it is the right thing to do congress realized in that it was difficult if not impossible for any member to support closing military facilities in his or her district the only solution was to delegate the consolidation decisions to an independent commission and its the only way well get the larger and affordable air traffic system we need mr armey house majority leader from to is chairman of freedomworks see related
