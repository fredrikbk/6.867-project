running the show screen shots new online services offer small businesses an affordable opportunity to advertise on television once considered prohibitively expensive advertising on television is fast becoming a viable option for small businesses thanks to new online services that provide everything from customizable templates for commercials to commercial placement services spot runner inc los angeles picknclick of fort lauderdale fla and spotzer media group bv of the netherlands are among a new breed of online tv ad production companies that offer an inexpensive and practical option for small firms spot runner gave timely help to bizfilings com a person firm in madison wis that allows customers to form legal entities without hiring a lawyer although bizfilings has been in business for years it hadnt developed national brand recognition meanwhile new rivals have continuously popped up making it increasingly important for the company to stand out in the markets where it competes bizfilings turned to spot runner which has an online library of templates already produced commercials cataloged by industry and that require only customized voice overs and titles "i spent an hour browsing the library and a half hour writing the voice over " says bizfilings marketing director troy janisch within two days the company had a finished tv commercial the company previewed it and approved it online "we were on the air within three weeks " adds mr janisch the cost mr janisch says that after paying spot runners standard one time set up fee of &# bizfilings has paid an average of &# each time its second commercial has aired regionally on cable television networks such as cnn espn and fox news and an average of &# when the commercial ran nationally on those networks and in every market where the commercial has run he says bizfilings has seen a "modest to major" boost to its business bizfilings is a unit of dutch publisher wolters kluwer nv choosing a template for a commercial wont express the uniqueness of a business or produce something as slick as a custom designed commercial created by a leading national agency indeed its not always possible for a small firm to find the right tv spot "the spot runner library has a great selection of tv spots for realtors and other common types of businesses " says mr janisch "the more unique your business is though the more challenging it is to find a spot " still for a small business on a budget it can be cost effective tony martinelli office manager at a person dental office in san diego estimates that a three week tv campaign produced by spot runner that the office ran earlier this year in san diego county produced enough new business to pay for the cost of the ad more than six times over after running tv ads for the past years or so clarke auto inc a hudson ohio auto dealership last year hired pick n click a service run by the zimmerman agency of omnicom group inc the general manager of the dealership darrell fall says its easier quicker and more effective to point to what he wants rather than explain it pick n click offers a library of video to which customers can add titles or voice overs though for now it caters only to auto dealers "weve used this to help eliminate time and to produce better ads " mr fall says before airing any commercial he has created he adds he always consults his advertising agency "ill have them check it because theyre the professionals " he says "i know my business but they know the commercials " most small businesses that use a template driven commercial creation service compete in different markets so there is little risk of rivals choosing the same ad pick n click spot runner and spotzer for example all offer exclusive rights to a commercial in the markets in which the customer operates for at least as long as the commercial runs but if a company competes on a national basis it may want to go a step further and pay to have the ad template permanently removed from the library as bizfilings did "its a very creative ad " says mr janisch "people are convinced that the guy in the ad works for bizfilings " of course just because such services make it more affordable for small companies to create and air tv commercials doesnt necessarily mean that small firms should do so for one thing tv commercials arent as all powerful as they once were says peter kim senior analyst at forrester research inc in cambridge mass the rise of digital video recorders makes it easier for consumers to skip commercials for example says mr kim adding that the effectiveness of tv commercials depends a lot on a companys target customers companies targeting to year olds for example may not want to advertise on tv because people in that demographic spend more time online hours weekly according to forrester data than they do watching tv hours weekly boomers between the ages of and meanwhile spend only hours online weekly but hours watching tv a small ad budget "might be better spent on alternative media " says mr kim greg sterling principal analyst at sterling market intelligence in oakland calif says "these spots ideally would complement other ads in other media and or online " he concedes though that many small businesses cant afford a "multifaceted strategy " some of the new breed of online services specialize only in the placement of tv ads softwave media exchange inc based in irvington n y offers an online system for placing already created commercials its web site swmxtv com works as an online marketplace for buying selling and managing advertising time in return for transaction fees on executed orders the site lets businesses tailor tv campaigns to meet their budget audience demographics desired time of day and region rather than having to negotiate the process with multiple stations or networks to find out about rates and available times firms can see a host of networks and stations in one place and do all the negotiations quickly and simply in one spot after a firm posts its campaign and price parameters on the site broadcasters can accept refuse or counter those parameters online using swmxtv com means
