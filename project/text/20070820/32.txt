hastert to leave after over two decades on hill online edition washington former house speaker dennis hastert expected to announce that he will retire from congress this term wants to add one "last hurrah" to his career enacting climate change energy legislation with the woman who took the gavel from him nancy pelosi of california it is a remarkable convergence of interests and given the splits among democrats over energy policy the illinois republican could be a spoiler for ms pelosi or an invaluable asset with access to the white house and an understanding of the difficulties of her office having been there himself mr hastert wants more emphasis on new energy production as well as carbon dioxide controls in the bill which is scheduled to be marked up this fall by the house energy and commerce committee on which he sits but weary of partisanship this year old lawmaker sees the spoiler role as a dead end at this stage of his year career and instead mr hastert seems most intent on building partnerships with committee democrats and cashing in chits that open doors for both parties to high officials in the bush administration such as treasury secretary henry paulson "i really think there are good things we can have an opportunity to do " mr hastert said "i would like to put my talents to work to try to do that " mr hasterts comments came in an interview conducted in anticipation of his announcement friday in illinois th district that he will not seek re election next year he could yet give up his house seat early next spring depending on how the energy debate proceeds the first speaker since the s to continue serving in congress after leaving the post his departure has long been anticipated since last years republican losses he did not say what he will do when he returns to private life durability and service have long been his trademark thrust into power after newt gingrichs fall in mr hastert was dubbed the "accidental" speaker over shadowed by the man who helped get him the gavel majority leader tom delay of texas but in the course of four terms the former high school wrestling coach emerged as one of the most constant republican figures in modern politics and his eight year rule witnessed two presidencies terrorist attacks and multiple wars from the balkans to iraq before also breaking the republican record established in the early s by the legendary speaker joseph cannon also of illinois from a policy standpoint mr hasterts greatest impact was in expanding private market alternatives in healthcare coverage including health savings accounts and the medicare prescription drug benefit he famously pushed through in a middle of the night vote which he kept open for nearly three hours he was more willing to share power with his committee chairmen and albeit press shy and awkward as a stump speaker he proved a relentless campaigner and fundraiser for members "i dont think anybody went to more districts than denny did " said rep ray lahood r ill giving up power after the elections he shed pounds and moved into a capitol office one flight below the suite he ceded to ms pelosi meanwhile he rediscovered an old power base on the energy and commerce committee chaired by his fellow midwesterner michigan rep john dingell and where mr hastert is the ranking republican on the energy panel led by rep rick boucher d va "i have a good relationship with boucher and a pretty good relationship with dingell " mr hastert says in fact mr hastert is to return wednesday from an asian trip authorized by mr dingell and which included stops at nuclear facilities in rokkasho and the monju fast breeder site japan as well as general electric facilities in china mr boucher and the former speaker traveled to europe last spring on a climate change delegation which was followed in july by a meeting mr hastert set up for mr boucher and himself with secy paulson and the two lawmakers share an interest in coal to liquid technologies as an alternative to petroleum fuels especially for aviation house democrats "do have an agenda they have a very difficult agenda with what they are trying to do on global warming " mr hastert says "i think some of it is credible i think some of it is futuristic its so futuristic it is difficult to put into legislative language on the other hand if they want to achieve that there are members on their side for whom some things are pretty important to them " mr hasterts eight years as speaker was marked by a growing partisanship in the house which he says he regrets "i dont think we really need to have that sharp partisan stick poking at each other that became kind of the nature of the place " he says but like many in washington in both parties he can seem blind to how his own actions contribute to this atmosphere and if he and ms pelosi are to be real partners it will require more self awareness on his part "shes jammed a lot of stuff thats become her style " he said in an interview "i never did that we never jammed " "you never jammed please " asked a reporter "well we never jammed in the sense that nobody knew what was in the bill " mr hastert added "i think shes a skilled politician my relationship with pelosi when i was speaker was we got along together we kind of kidded one another we got along we certainly didnt think alike shes been pretty cool since shes been speaker i understand thats a tough job up there that place has a lot of pressure " ms pelosi leans more toward the environmentalist side of the party on the climate change issue while chairman dingell and rep boucher bring long standing ties to two adversaries the auto and coal industries the energy legislation adopted by the house prior to the august recess ms pelosis "flagship" issue largely sidestepped these differences but the expectation is that many will resurface this fall given the breadth of the climate change debate mr boucher said he had promised ms pelosi he will begin to move legislation next month to mandate a new carbon dioxide control program for the nation coal to liquid technology will be part of that process he said the virginian believes that with the addition of biomass cellulosic material in the refining process liquid coal fuels can be produced with fewer carbon emissions than petroleum and still have the power needed for the aviation industry in an interview mr boucher also said the climate change debate cant avoid the issue of auto standards that has so divided democrats but he predicted it would return with a different metric grams of carbon dioxide emitted per mile of travel vs gallons of gasoline consumed per mile one constant will be mr hastert "hes not only useful he is essential " mr boucher said "we need to create a bipartisan bill that can get signed into law by president bush and denny hastert will be our partner to make this happen " write to david rogers at david rogers wsj com
