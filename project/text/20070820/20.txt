debt puts german banks in a bind financial rescue given state owned sachsen lb reflects conduit problem investors around the world are snubbing many types of short term debt as credit worries spread that is posing particular problems for german banks which issue a lot of such debt known as commercial paper many used the borrowed money to buy securities some of which were backed by u s mortgages to people with weak credit a market that is crumbling adding to investor concern is a lack of transparency many banks hold their loans in off balance sheet affiliates called "conduits" in industry parlance mainly because of conduits issuance of asset backed commercial paper has exploded as of march there was &# billion in such paper outstanding globally up about fivefold from a decade earlier according to standard &amp poors corp conduits issue commercial paper borrowing money for terms of less than a year and use that cash to buy longer term bonds paying higher interest rates the bank behind the conduit typically collects asset management fees and investment profits the conduit business model breaks down if investors get nervous about the value of the securities the conduit has bought and stop lending the conduit money in recent weeks conduits have struggled to find buyers for their paper and when they have sold it buyers have wanted sharply higher interest rates that is how midtier german bank ikb deutsche industriebank ag ended up with big bills due to its commercial paper buyers that it couldnt pay and in need of a recent bailout organized by germanys markets regulator and other german banks sachsen lb a small german state owned bank became the second german bank to require a financial rescue in less than a month saying friday a consortium of banks had stepped in to bail it out after an affiliate faced difficulties selling commercial paper to finance its operations it isnt clear how much there is to be concerned over those with conduits say their portfolios are solid and not overly exposed to shaky mortgages the president of the countrys central bank the bundesbank said "the heightened risks in the affected business areas are insulated and the profit losses for the credit institutes are limited overall " across europe a number of large banks operate some of the worlds biggest conduits including dutch bank abn amro holding nv and dutch belgian bank fortis nv the united kingdoms barclays plc and royal bank of scotland group plc and germanys deutsche bank ag big u s operators include citigroup inc bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co according to a morgan stanley report issued thursday the difference in germany is that many smaller banks have relatively large conduits raising concern should they have to cover shortfalls smaller banks that are exposed to the subprime problems "may find that their liquidity risk management capabilities or financial resources are less adequate to absorb any valuation adjustments or corresponding liquidity requirements " said antonio carballo london team managing director in moodys investors service inc s emea financial institutions group some german banks pushed aggressively into conduits to diversify their business beyond german loans after when the corporate loan market collapsed in the wake of corporate bankruptcies a further impetus came in when the european union banned state backed guarantees on some liabilities which had helped them achieve excellent credit ratings for decades the german banks including some state controlled landesbanken also were seeking higher returns banking in europes largest economy is overcrowded with more than financial institutions by comparison the u k has financial institutions spain has and italy has according to the european central bank germanys state owned banks "have at times got caught out borrowing short term and investing that its a classic thing that has gone wrong in the past for banks " said simon adamson an analyst in the london office of creditsights a credit research firm "quite a few of them have reasonably large conduits both the asset backed commercial paper conduits and the structured investment vehicles in some cases there is no compelling business reason why they should do that it is just they see it as a way of improving their revenue line " despite their small size ikb and
