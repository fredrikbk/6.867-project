wiretap correction the current congress has done little to brag about but in the case of its recent wiretapping legislation we sold it short in one key respect as part of the bill authorizing the executive branch to wiretap al qaeda suspects congress did give prospective liability protection to telephone companies that cooperate with u s intelligence agencies we reported otherwise at the time having missed the following sentence that was included in the final legislation "notwithstanding any other law no cause of action shall lie in any court against any person for providing any information facilities or assistance in accordance with a directive under this section " no doubt someone will sue the companies anyway but this will be crucial protection in court for executives and their shareholders willing to help defeat enemies trying to kill americans democratic leaders still refused to allow retrospective liability protection which means the companies remain vulnerable to lawsuits for having cooperated in the months after worse the legislation lasts for only six months and speaker nancy pelosi is already saying democrats will try to rewrite the rules to restrict this crucial war fighting power this is one debate the white house should be willing to have publicly so americans can appreciate that many democrats think it is appropriate to unleash the trial bar on u s companies merely for helping our military prevent future terrorist attacks
