boss talk beauty prestige and worry lines ceo of estee lauder faces trying times at company started by his grandmother for more than years estee lauder cos has defined top of the line cosmetics in the u s its formula has been simple locate gleaming makeup counters at the entrances of department stores staff them with perky representatives and give away plenty of samples its clinique products led sales in upscale retailers over the past months ended in june while the eponymous estee lauder brand is second and its mac brand is fourth according to market data firm npd group even so william lauder cant afford to relax as chief executive officer of the company founded by his grandmother he faces growing competitive threats on a number of fronts niche brands and retailers are on the rise while department stores are consolidating led by macys inc these chains have more power than ever over vendors affecting estee lauders ability to negotiate meanwhile competitors have poured resources into research development and promotion last week estee lauder reported weaker than expected fiscal fourth quarter results and warned investors that first quarter profit would fall short of expectations on friday the companys share price stood at &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange its week high reached in april was &# against this backdrop year old mr lauder must try to stay nimble and compete against these larger forces or face the possibility that the family may decide to sell in an interview with the wall street journal he talked about the company the family and the future excerpts wsj how has the beauty shopper changed since your grandmother estee lauder started the company mr lauder there are hundreds of millions more consumers today who have both the financial and the emotional wherewithal to buy beauty products than there were when this company was started in the pursuit of quality i dont think that has ever changed buying something good for yourself that hasnt changed what has changed is the degree to which you are willing to treat yourself wsj your main competitors are much bigger than estee lauder what would compel you to sell the company mr lauder we believe we have a better understanding of prestige and aspiration than any of our competitors and the result is we have a larger prestige business we have some competitors who do more business than us totally but not in the prestige arena we understand that consumer in a far better way given the stockholding structure of our family and the company we hope there will not be anything that would force us to sell we could choose at some point in the future if everyone agrees and its in our best interest obviously it would have to be a very attractive financial opportunity but theres nothing we see out there that would be compelling from a negative standpoint to sell wsj how do you balance the challenge of running a family controlled business that is also a public company mr lauder with great difficulty theres a benefit to it if the family members need money theres a very simple solution sell shares that makes life easier on the internal side on the external side its becoming more and more apparent that many of our outside shareholders are not oriented to the long term their definition of long term is a quarter as opposed to a quarter century which is our definition the best example i can give is plus of the sales from our company today come from brands we created ourselves ninety percent of the business we do today comes from either brands we created ourselves or brands that we acquired and the vast majority of their sales came after we acquired them we couldnt do that if we were taking a quarterly view to the management of our business weve spent a lot of time over the last three or four years changing our shareholder base emphasizing long term shareholders i wont be shy about saying that if youre in it for the quarter were not interested in you wsj over the past two years there has been dramatic department store consolidation especially when federated department stores now macys bought may department stores with your two biggest customers suddenly becoming one how do you deal with their increased clout mr lauder weve become equally as important to each other as before we have for the first time a national chain that appeals to that vast middle class in a prestige environment previously if we wanted to launch a product we could never do it nationally because there was no retailer who had a national footprint of significance now we have somebody of size heft and ability when it comes to clout the macy group is an extremely important customer to us and we are an extremely important vendor to them the beauty business represents a pretty significant portion of sales to a department store more than but it represents a far greater portion of profit they have lots of shoppers walking through their doors and we want to put our brands in front of them and sell to them but its also important for department stores to have brands such as ours which are attractive to their consumers and keep them coming back wsj what retail alternatives are particularly attractive for your brands right now mr lauder we look for consumers who spend at the higher end of the product range theres a generic frustration that i have when i talk to the financial community the vast majority of analysts we talk to are american the vast majority of them dont travel much outside of the u s and if they do i imagine that most of that travel isnt to figure out how our brands and other brands are sold and marketed in europe or asia they seem singularly obsessed with north america and the success of the clinique and estee lauder brands there they miss the extraordinary growth and expansion that were seeing from our brands outside of this market more than half of our sales and a significant portion of our total growth will come from outside of north america wsj how do you translate your brands in foreign markets mr lauder there are many things we have to do to make our message for each brand more relevant locally for example the asian consumer is very heavily oriented to the skin treatment business she trusts brands that are really solid in those areas and she doesnt like fragrance its a very small portion of the total business in europe in the parfumerie channel its predominantly a fragrance driven business more than of the business and the remainder is skin care and color in the u s its a little more balanced between fragrance treatment and makeup so our message in each of these markets has to be different and relevant wsj what about emerging markets mr lauder we see emerging markets as a tremendous opportunity beauty is one of the first entry points for that emerging middle class consumer in these markets and shes buying the estee lauder brand in china is exploding right now because it represents aspirational luxury but at a price thats much more affordable than louis vuitton we see the same thing going on in russia india is a little behind because theres a certain lack of established retail there also doing well for us is the middle east latin america brazil mexico and south africa wsj many of your brands compete against each other estee lauder versus clinique aveda versus origins mac versus bobbi brown how do you keep the brands getting along mr lauder weve spent a lot of time over the last five years moving our managers around so that they get a breadth and depth of experience and just as importantly so they havent grown up just in the silo of one brand right now most all of our brand managers have spent time working in at least one or two other brands or spent time working for the outside competition we try to foster a more collegial relationship rather than sibling rivalry also the higher you are in the organizational structure the greater the percentage of your incentive pay is based on the performance of the corporation rather than the performance of your unit so we try to create a financial incentive as well as a moral incentive to work well together and play well together wsj the estee lauder brand is years old how do you keep a brand young and fresh mr lauder you constantly reinvent it whether its the product the package or the message the challenge for any brand marketer is how to continue to maintain a modernity or contemporaneous look to your brand while not changing it so much that that loyal consumer says its not my brand anymore its quite a challenge many of the great brands out there have been hurt by being too committed to history and not committed enough to what history offers as an instruction to the future wsj as ceo part of your job is saying no but your father mother uncle and two cousins work for the company how do you say no to your mom mr lauder its difficult many of my family members think that im saying no to them with a greater frequency than im saying no to other people who work for me most of them arent privy to my conversations with the other people who work for me and the frequency with which i say no to them i like to think that we have an open enough dialogue between and amongst our family that its not a binary thing where theres someone saying "thumbs up or thumbs down go away" and that we have an open mind to do anything we think has the opportunity to grow our business
