japan finds superlow rates hard to shed tokyo a year after toshihiko fukui put the finishing touches on a plan to rehabilitate japans economy the bank of japan governor is finding it harder than expected to abandon superlow interest rates especially after last weeks disruptions in the u s credit market last year consumer prices here had started rising a welcome development following seven years of deflation that had crimped economic growth so the japanese central bank was finally able to abandon a six year policy of zero interest rates and was hoping gradually to close the gap with the rates in other major economies the difference between them had provided a source of cheap funds for international speculators and helped push the yen to its lowest level in years some speculators borrowed in yen in order to invest in higher yielding assets in other currencies while many japanese households simply put their savings into overseas assets to get a better return in each case they sold yen driving down the value of the japanese currency but the subprime mortgage shocks rippling through international markets the past two weeks mean mr fukui will likely put off a rate increase he had planned for thursday after the bank of japan policy boards most recent meeting july he kept the banks target for short term interest rates at but he said that if current trends continue "we will adjust interest rate levels" in the future most economists took that to mean the rate would rise to at the two day meeting that ends thursday higher interest rates tend to make a countrys currency stronger which in turn tends to depress prices because it makes imported goods cost less for domestic consumers less than two weeks ago the bond futures market put the chance of higher interest rates at nearly now however no one expects mr fukui to raise interest rates and market positions friday implied zero chance of an increase the immediate cause is the credit crunch in the u s which has stemmed from a surge in defaults on so called subprime loans to high risk home buyers the defaults caused investors to lose their appetite for securities backed by risky mortgages triggering losses at financial institutions with large exposure to such loans though japanese banks have said they have relatively few subprime related investments the scale of the subprime problem is hard to gauge japanese banks could turn out to have greater exposure to the problem than revealed so far or the impact on the japanese economy could grow since a rate increase would remove funds from money markets when they might be needed economists say the japanese central bank isnt likely to lift rates in addition the recent sharp rise of the yen could affect the banks thinking at one point in fridays trading the yen was stronger than to the dollar though it weakened later to around compared with nearly in late june unlike most countries japan wants more rather than less inflation because that would reduce the likelihood of falling back into deflation or long term drops in prices deflation discourages economic activity by increasing the real value of debt while shrinking corporate revenue japanese consumer prices started falling in february from a year earlier and the latest reading for the consumer price index showed a drop in june economists have been forecasting modest price gains this or next month mr fukuis decision will be the first by a major central bank since the onset of the subprime problems and could indicate how they are affecting an economy the size of japans the second largest behind the u s that has little direct exposure to subprime mortgages japans main fear is that the credit woes could hurt overseas economies particularly that of the u s the european central banks next policy meeting is sept when it is expected to put off what had been an expected increase in its short term rate the federal reserve meets sept and futures markets guess the u s central bank will cut its rate japanese banks have been cautious lenders since their recovery from their own bad loan woes that started in the s last week they disclosed total exposure to assets related to u s subprime mortgages of billion yen &# billion equivalent to just of their forecast recurring profits for this fiscal year according to calculations by macquarie securities the bigger danger for japan comes from potential fallout in the world economy if a bank of japan rate increase somehow contributed to global market jitters that might hurt major export markets on which japan is still highly dependent for growth already japans big exporters of autos to the u s and machine tools to china will suffer from the yens recent rise
