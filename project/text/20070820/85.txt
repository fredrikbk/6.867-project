the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources environment old equipment gets new chance to pollute a lot of the old inefficient factories and vehicles disappearing from the u s enjoy a second life in developing countries reducing the impact that new cleaner technologies have on world wide carbon emissions the global market for hand me down industrial machinery and vehicles has been valued at an estimated &# billion a year by german environmental think tank adelphi research the u s feeds the market with products ranging from four ton trucks to entire power plants reports the boston globes beth daley a s paper making machine from adams mass operates in egypt a rock crushing machine from vermont has been reassembled in colombia a five story coal fired power plant in turners falls mass is being reassembled in guatemala environmentalists and economists a generation ago had assumed that poorer countries would immediately adopt cleaner technologies developed in richer countries the second hand market for industrial goods has slowed that transition although it hasnt entirely undermined it often the cast off secondhand machinery is more efficient than the even more antiquated machinery it replaces for instance guatemalan textile company textiles del sur will use the coal fired power plant from turners falls to replace its oil burning boilers which run far less cleanly than the coal plant the plant has filters to capture the air pollution causing respiratory problems required in the u s but not in guatemala on the other hand because coal typically releases more carbon dioxide than oil the textile mill will probably produce about as much greenhouse gases as before it got the coal plant meanwhile the mills owner says he probably wont scrap the oil fired boilers but try to sell them to someone else textisur paid &# million for the s plant to be dismantled shipped and reassembled miles from guatemala city economists tell ms daley that the u s will need to formulate new policies if it wants developing countries to adopt environmentally up to date technologies it could provide financial assistance buying the technologies for example or restrict the trade of secondhand machinery that doesnt meet certain efficiency standards the boston globe aug agriculture seed bank for plant diversity has hard time taking root disputes over seed patents and genetically modified organisms have hampered an attempt to preserve every kind of seed in the world writes the new yorkers john seabrook almost as soon as farmers domesticated plants they used seed banks to hedge against damage to their crops in the field in the early th century a greater understanding of plant genetics turned seed banks into libraries of genetic material with scientists using them to crossbreed plants and create new strains different strains of a plant record the different ways that the plant has adapted to different climates over thousands of years of agriculture as such seed banks might contain a disused strain of say cauliflower that turns out to be resilient to a disease that has wiped out a more common strain in the th century increasing use of seeds from inbred plants reduced genetic diversity in the fields making seed banks important safeguards of plant diversity however collections in half the seed banks in developing countries are in danger says cary fowler executive director of the global crop diversity trust mr fowler hopes to keep those seeds safe in a bank being built in a mountain in svalbard norway however it isnt the universal seed bank mr fowler envisioned in the s in which patented seeds from businesses could be used by farmers in developing countries while businesses could access the wider variety of seeds in developing countries instead each country will have access only to the seeds it deposits in the bank seed companies have shown little interest in storing their patented seeds in the bank the norwegian government also restricts bringing genetically modified organisms into the country the new yorker aug education safety drives universities to close a rite of passage safety concerns are driving colleges to secure their subterranean tunnels closing off a national source of student pranks and urban legend writes tony barboza a lot of universities use tunnels to distribute water and steam across campus and provide access to maintenance workers they also apparently excite speculation among students wherever they appear university of california irvine professor carol burke who teaches folklore says rumor has it that the tunnels at her university were built in the s so professors could easily escape protesting students tunnels also make for good pranks and hazing rituals concerned by terrorism and legal liability however universities are closing the tunnels princeton university the university of california los angeles stanford university and columbia university are among the many colleges across the nation to restrict tunnel access with padlocks gates and other security measures the los angeles times aug see more on our blog at wsj com informedreader send comments to
