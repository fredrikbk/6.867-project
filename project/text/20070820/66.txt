real time a model world a floor planning program proves addictive because it does and doesnt reflect real life online edition last week i was playing around with a program called floorplanner www floorplanner com which lets you design simple architectural layouts for some time my wife and i have had our eye on an old long vacant basement apartment adjacent to the downstairs of our existing apartment weve had a lot of dreamy discussions about what wed do with this space if we ever managed to acquire it discussions that have often left us talking past each other emily is better at articulating what she doesnt want than what she does while i have a bad habit of eagerly throwing myself into new layout schemes without due consideration for plumbing or other practical matters floor planning software whether its floorplanners or something more elaborate can help with that as can learning the basics theres a reason as ive finally grasped that apartment buildings have bathrooms stacked one atop the other i took a long ago sketch of the space weve coveted and started adapting it for floorplanner you can see the results here feel free to play around with the space yourself if you wish this wouldnt be a terribly elaborate project the entryway on the left would lead to the downstairs of our current apartment which basically mirrors what ive mapped except it has stairs leading up instead of that big black space its an airshaft and two bedrooms instead of the imagined one that leftmost wall by the entryway is supposed to be a low wall with columns supporting a header i cant show that i think because floorplanners treating it as an exterior wall if you do play with the design the middle wall and its doorways have to stay where they are and building plumbing would make it expensive to put the bathroom anywhere else once i got the hang of floorplanners quirks i had a great time playing with it should our project ever pan out i think the time i spent with it will prove useful it was gratifying to find the bathroom should fit more things than id thought which would then free up hallway space id earmarked for a shower but could now use as a closet that extra closet seems pretty necessary too i hadnt realized how small the space id imagined as a closet really was the jog to what would be the master bedroom might be a happy accident creating a little distance between it and that tv lounge area and im still hoping to convince emily that the bedrooms awfully big and could benefit from some sort of low dividing wall by the bed to give it more definition in the last couple of years ive learned enough construction basics to create a model thats at least vaguely realistic but i imagine floor planning software can be a mixed blessing for architects presented with beautiful drawings of layouts that have more to do with james bond than building codes asked about that new york city architectural consultant mila goldman moore was kind emailing that "i think its fantastic when homeowners take control of their specific wants needs and sketch their thoughts thats what architects do too a sketch serves the same purpose whether its on a napkin or in an electronic drawing format " but ms moore noted that "sometimes very important features of a design cannot be communicated in plan ive never seen an owner attempt a sketch of a kitchen millwork elevation for example to show the arrangement of upper cabinets " and she added that sketches often dont take into account building code minimum dimensions "which homeowners are often surprised by the most common issue is an owner trying to fit too much into a space that cannot legally contain it " that had me staring at my floor plan before realizing i dont know enough about building codes to know if i should be worried or not it was also entertaining to tinker with floorplanners various furniture icons adapting floorplanners european stylings took a little doing the program doesnt seem to entirely grasp closets and while i could find plenty of wardrobes a normal looking dresser eluded me feel free to make fun of that armchair i taffy pulled into a fairly monstrous looking chaise i tried to match our usual color scheme and of course goofed around for a while dumping drumkits and lecterns and cars and what not into the middle of the design i even looked up the dimensions for a pool table and adapted a dining room table into a passable facsimile no room shucks what i was doing felt oddly familiar though exactly how was elusive and then it hit me like a thunderbolt thrown by the god of dorks its dungeons &amp dragons sure i was using floorplanner for something thoroughly grown up and reasonably responsible but while i wasnt arranging pit traps or goblins the placement of doors and furniture and the pondering of what to do with a certain space was straight out of my own personal the grid just a browser version of graph paper i was having a grand time creating the worlds smallest dullest dungeon imagining spaces and how theyd look and what it would feel like to live there but putting aside such youthful reveries floorplanner had more than a whiff of fantasy about it one evening i was sitting upstairs tweaking things that didnt need to be tweaked when i glanced up from the miniature world i was constructing onscreen and realized how different floorplanners model would be from our real world living room there was no icon for a ragged pile of snapshots and coupons and newspaper clippings for an overflowing basket of remotes some of which no longer control anything for a rats nest of a v cables and power strips or for the scattering of joshuas toys across every flat surface like a second skin of multicolored plastic nor were there icons for the various things that had gone wrong over the years nothing to represent the tile in the bathroom that sticks up and catches your toe or the fallen coathook i really need to put back into the wall one of these days i could select floor textures and colors but nothing like mottled wood in need of refinishing or carpet thats been walked on by people who didnt use the mat sure id included a couple of scattered books and pillows in my design but those were mere hints at a far messier reality fans of sim city and "god games" of its ilk know what im talking about even the seediest online city retains a certain tidy elegance thats pleasing to the eye and that feeling may be familiar to anyone whos been left oddly ambivalent by living an increasing amount of life online the net makes exploring the world and engaging with it easy in a way were only just getting used to within a few keystrokes you can be digging into the news indulging your curiosity or foundering in an obsession or addiction practically speaking you can communicate with most anyone you wish whenever you wish and you can do so at a remove step away from the pc or just hit the back button and your engagement ends that remove can be a wonderful thing it lets us indulge our curiosity almost as quickly as we can think makes it easy to drop a line to someone we might not feel like we have time to call on the phone and allows us to be part of a community that may be too diffuse for real world interaction the danger is that interacting at a remove can come to seem preferable to the messiness of the real world where a greater commitment is required and interaction demands more of ourselves than it does in our compartmentalized worlds of browsers and digital personas my apartments messy piles of papers and mottled floorboards are hard to model in floorplanner and its tempting to imagine a living room without them but take them away and my living room wouldnt feel like home have you ever used floor planning software for a project was it helpful how close did your design come to the finished product any thoughts about how such simulations do and dont reflect reality join me and other online journal readers in the real time forum or write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
