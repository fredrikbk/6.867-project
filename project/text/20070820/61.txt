politics &amp economics income tax foes regroup alliance for national sales levy gains with some conservatives a less dogged bunch and one with shallower pockets surely would have given up by now for more than a decade a group started among friends at houstons river oaks country club and led by construction magnate leo linbeck jr has pushed to scrap the federal income tax for a national sales tax the stars seemed to align for their "fairtax" plan when sympathetic fellow texas republicans took power george w bush was in the white house and in congress tom delay was house majority leader and bill archer chairman of the tax writing ways and means committee nothing happened now messrs delay and archer who both supported the idea are gone and president bush who promised tax change of some kind in his second term is a lame duck unlikely to deliver so big a change even if he tried yet americans for fair taxation better known as fairtax org has regrouped in the past year it is spending freely to tap a building anti washington mood and hoping to influence both who gets picked as the nations next leaders and what their agenda will be as the group demonstrated recently by its prominence at iowa republicans much watched presidential straw poll it is gaining steam among the conservatives who dominate the partys nominating process and by extension with some candidates struggling to gain traction by all accounts fairtax orgs mobilization was a factor in the surprise second place showing of the plans biggest advocate former arkansas gov mike huckabee "you cant win this strictly on the merits with members of congress " says group spokesman ken hoagland "if its not driven by the grassroots its not going to happen " yet the contrast between the ideas popular appeal and its lack of progress toward becoming law dramatizes a perennial disconnect in u s politics between the easy sound bite sloganeering of campaign season and the postelection difficulty of filling in the details and making the trade offs that translate ideas into reality the fairtax proposal is certainly ambitious it would abolish the internal revenue service and income taxes for individuals and corporations taxes on estates and capital gains as well as payroll taxes for social security and medicare it also would end tax breaks ranging from homeowners mortgage interest deduction to corporate credits that are embedded in the economy and important to many voters and special interests to ensure the income tax never returns the group proposes repealing the th amendment that created it a century ago in its place would be a national sales tax on goods and services though other analysts say the rate would have to be higher where the income tax is intended to be progressive taking more from those with greater wealth a consumption tax would be regressive hitting lower income people proportionally harder because they spend all or most income on necessities while richer people can save and invest much of theirs to address the regressivity argument fairtax org proposes a "prebate" paid monthly to every family to cover their sales taxes up to an amount equal to the poverty level but without an irs that raises questions about who would compute checks for families of various sizes and get them out fairtax org says state tax authorities could do that though not every state has such offices besides mr linbeck other big donors to the group include billionaire investors t boone pickens and robert c mcnair major republican contributors as a tax exempt nonprofit group fairtax org is nonpartisan but democrats havent rallied to the cause mr hoagland says its representatives have met with candidates of both parties or their policy experts they have also been on more than talk radio shows during the past year and have hosted promotional facilities at presidential debates republican front runner rudy giuliani has emerged as the only vocal foe though rivals mitt romney and kansas sen sam brownback also are listed as "nos" on the groups scorecard in mr giulianis answer to a florida voter posted on the fairtax web site he opposed the idea as regressive and likely disruptive to the economy the best course he said would be to simplify the tax code mr romney the former governor of massachusetts takes a similar stance mr brownback despite past financial support from mr linbeck calls the fairtax plan unrealistic instead he supports an optional flat income tax last week fairtax org hailed the news that still undeclared republican fred thompson "has signaled his willingness to support the fairtax" in a letter to mr linbeck but in the letter the former tennessee senator stops short of an endorsement saying the principles are "a good place to start " similarly arizona sen john mccain is listed as a "yes " though adviser douglas holtz eakin says the senators stock reply is "if it comes to my desk ill sign it but i dont think it will get there " the fairtax folks mr holtz eakin adds "choose to leave off the second half of that statement " by contrast mr huckabee did endorse the fairtax last may at its huge rally before a republican debate in columbia s c not insignificantly his endorsement could blunt attacks from another antitax group the club for growth which has been lambasting mr huckabee for raising taxes in arkansas the underdogs finish in the iowa straw poll behind winner mr romney has raised his profile among party activists and donors especially since he seemed to pull it off without paying for buses barbecue and tickets for his voters to the extent messrs romney and brownback did but fairtax org paid for buses and of the &# tickets to vote in the straw poll and let supporters know that mr huckabee was their ally about votes separated him and third place mr brownback mr huckabees chief rival to be the candidate of social conservatives suspicious of front runners messrs giuliani and romney while some brownback backers believe fairtax org cost their man second place campaign advisers only suggest that fairtax supporters probably accounted for a couple hundred huckabee votes "they certainly had an impact " agreed huckabee campaign chairman chip saltsman
