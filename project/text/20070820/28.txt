from disturbed high schooler to college killer of seven students taking music theory at westfield high school in chantilly va in six were "pretty cozy and friendly with one another " recalls one of them greg moore the seventh cho seung hui "was sort of there in the corner just getting by " mr moore says "in that entire year i dont think i ever heard him say as much as a single word " the first time mr moore says he heard mr cho speak was on tv in april on a videotape the korean immigrant mailed the same day he murdered students and faculty members before killing himself at virginia tech mr cho didnt need to talk to succeed academically at westfield diagnosed with "selective mutism " or anxiety related refusal to speak he was placed in special education under the "emotional disturbance" classification as a result he was largely excused from making oral presentations and answering teachers questions in class oral participation was de emphasized in his grading aided by such "accommodations " or efforts to compensate for his disability he achieved as and bs in regular and advanced placement courses and was admitted to virginia tech details of mr chos experience in special education which are only now coming to light suggest that high schools may be paying too much attention to the academic advancement of bright but troubled students and not enough to their emotional disorders "the focus is what do we need to do to help him get through school " says dewey cornell a clinical psychologist and professor of education at the university of virginia when the students move on to college schools are rarely warned students get help with special needs only if they seek it and psychological problems can flare up sometimes with devastating consequences at virginia tech because federal law shields students mental health histories administrators and teachers didnt know about mr chos earlier troubles eventually his strange behavior set off alarm bells and he was ordered to seek counseling by a judge but theres no indication he complied most colleges ask applicants if they have been disciplined in high school or convicted of a crime but they dont inquire about disabilities or accommodations the lack of information about applicants emotional health "is a glaring problem" brought to light by the april massacre says pomona college admissions dean bruce poch its impossible to know whether a different approach by officials in fairfax county va where mr cho attended elementary and secondary schools would have changed his path he wasnt considered a behavior problem in high school and showed few if any signs of violence a panel appointed by virginia gov tim kaine to investigate the massacre is examining mr chos years at westfield including his special education program and transition to college it is expected to issue its report this week in an earlier era students with emotional disorders often dropped out of school or were educated in separate facilities today they typically take mainstream classes with accommodations as needed and many go on to college often students with emotional disorders dont qualify for special education under federal regulations they require special education only if their disabilities "adversely affect educational performance " but whether that adverse impact is limited to test scores and grades or also includes anxiety and lack of friends is disputed in a maine school district denied special education to a girl with aspergers syndrome a form of autism who had attempted suicide after her parents objected an administrative hearing officer upheld the districts position that her condition didnt hamper her academic performance this past march concluding that education is more than academics the u s first circuit court of appeals ruled her eligible for special education michael viega who taught the music theory course at westfield but no longer works for the district thinks fairfax county failed to address mr chos social and emotional issues mr chos individualized education plan a federally mandated document for special education students "had nothing about any kind of inner work for him any self expression " says mr viega who is certified in music therapy which is sometimes used to draw out nonexpressive students "he fell through the cracks he made the grades he passed" state achievement tests "but his soul was as empty as could be " fairfax county officials declined to comment on mr cho the district has also declined numerous requests for mr chos educational records citing privacy restrictions some westfield teachers say the district also advised them not to speak to the media about the case dede bailer director of psychology and preventive services in fairfax county says the district "addresses deficits in social emotional development either through special education or preventively outside special education " through social skills groups run by counselors psychologists and social workers although most students with selective mutism arent placed in special education she says fairfax has a "very high success rate" with them in she says two school psychologists started a research project in the district to study the condition immigrants like mr cho are particularly prone to selective mutism because they are often self conscious about their ability to speak a second language amy copeland a fairfax county mother whose son was too anxious to be able to speak to adults when he entered kindergarten in says he wouldnt have conquered mutism without his dedicated teachers at cherry run elementary in burke va he communicated with them in stages first using a teddy bear tape recorder then leaving phone messages for them at night and relaying responses in class discussion via a fellow pupil mr chos mutism was more severe and persistent family members couldnt be reached for comment but people familiar with his background say that from an early age he rarely spoke at home or school mr cho entered westfield high as a sophomore when it opened in his lack of speech soon had repercussions his english teacher asked students to read aloud says classmate chris davids when mr chos turn came he was silent until the teacher threatened to give him an "f" for class participation "he was really mumbly " mr davids adds "kids started picking on him chuckling and snickering " a teacher referred mr cho for a special education evaluation in fall the education plan developed for him set goals such as learning to interact verbally with adults and peers share knowledge in group projects respond to greetings and farewells and answer factual questions in at least five words according to hollis stambaugh deputy project director for the kaine panel to attain these goals the school encouraged mr chos parents to provide counseling the family arranged for him to see a "dedicated therapist who cared about him deeply and worked with him one on one at a culturally sensitive location " says ms stambaugh the school also offered him minutes of speech and language therapy a month on site when one of his private therapists asked why mr cho wasnt given more time says a person familiar with the matter school officials responded that they didnt want to interrupt his academics by pulling him out of class more often "fifty minutes a month of speech therapy isnt enough for somebody who isnt speaking and has the ability to " says lindy crawford chairwoman of special education at the university of colorado at colorado springs school officials also urged mr cho to participate in clubs related to his academic strengths ms stambaugh says he joined the science club but rarely spoke there according to other members of the club following his education plan teachers were encouraged to meet with him one on one and didnt require him to engage in group or class discussions prof crawford says such accommodations should be a "last resort if the immediate solution was to require less of him thats not how we train teachers here " theresa fayne who sat next to mr cho in world history says he attempted to participate in a group presentation about the vietnam war "you could see his mouth moving but not a single word was coming out " she says ms fayne says she tried to be friendly "there was no point in ignoring him " she says "you dont want to answer thats fine " but she stopped she says when her teacher told her not to bother him although colleges cant ask school guidance counselors directly about students mental health they can ask them to assess how an applicant relates to teachers and peers says gary pavela a teacher at the university of maryland who is also a legal consultant to colleges if the counselor answers candidly the school might be alerted to potential psychological issues mr pavela also says colleges increasingly ask essay questions on applications to try to shed light on a candidates "emotional intelligence " the massachusetts institute of technology tells applicants it wants to know how they "bring balance" to their lives and asks them to "tell us about something you do simply for the pleasure of it " on virginia techs application essays are optional once enrolled on the blacksburg campus in mr cho didnt seek accommodations "the accommodations that are made possible through the cooperation of the school system cant be continued beyond high school without the students request " ms stambaugh says "you do get the sense that theyre carried along to a certain point and then they fall off the cliff " accommodating mr cho highlights of accommodations and services that virginia tech killer cho seung hui received in high school under his special education plan accommodations largely excused from oral presentations and answering teachers questions grading modified to reduce emphasis on class participation services  minutes a month of speech and language therapy encouraged to join school clubs
