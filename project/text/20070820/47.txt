loosening up how a panicky day led the fed to act freezing of credit drives sudden shift shoving to make trades strains in financial markets had been evident for weeks but thursday aug was different as the day dawned in london &# billion in short term ious issued outside the u s by corporations and others were maturing and had to be rolled over traders usually have buyers for such paper by lunchtime in london around a m in new york on this morning demand had dried up and it would take the whole day to sell less than half of it said a person familiar with the market at a m in new york the largest maker of mortgages in the u s countrywide financial corp said it was tapping &# billion in bank credit lines a sign that it was unable to raise money in financial markets as it had been this was a development more serious than another hedge fund running into trouble "when you start talking about countrywide " said one senior wall street executive "thats kind of america at the end of the day were talking about mom and pop and the right to own a home " just before noon new york time near the end of the london trading day the yen suddenly surged against the dollar rising in just minutes and crushing currency market players who hadnt anticipated such a sharp move on the london trading floor of goldman sachs group inc phone lines lit up in unison and some salesmen wielded two phones at the same time they were shoving and grabbing each other to get in front of traders and shouting orders to execute trades according to eyewitnesses shortly afterwards investors began piling into the shortest term u s treasury securities which are considered safe because theyre backed by the u s government the yield on three month bills which had been around dropped as low as and the gap between yields on t bills and corporate commercial paper widened sharply "it was an extraordinarily violent move " said jason evans head of government bond trading at deutsche bank "it became clear that the market was at a point of distress and expected a response" from the u s federal reserve these shocks reflected one of the most perilous days for global credit markets the circulatory system of the international economy since the crisis that began in asia spread to russia and brazil and eventually to the u s based hedge fund long term capital management on friday morning following a conference call the previous evening convened by chairman ben bernanke the fed blinked just days after declaring that inflation was still its predominant worry the fed declared "downside risks to growth have increased appreciably" and hinted that it may soon cut its target for short term rates in an unusual move it also encouraged banks to borrow directly from the fed and made such loans more attractive in essence the fed is following advice that british journalist walter bagehot offered in his book "lombard street " a copy of which mr bernanke kept on a shelf when he was princeton professor in times of "internal discredit" when uncertainty leads private players to pull back the prescription to the central bank is lend freely "a panic is a species of neuralgia and according to the rules of science you must not starve it " bagehot wrote "the holders of the cash reserve" todays central banks "must be ready to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others they must lend to merchants to minor bankers to this man and that man whenever the security is good " this week the fed will find out if it did enough to bolster the confidence that was in such short supply last week when investors refused to buy or accept as collateral securities that in normal times would be of unquestioned worth its critics including those who say it is too quick to rescue imprudent lenders and borrowers will be watching for evidence that the fed went too far the initial reaction of u s stock and credit markets to fridays fed move was favorable the interest rate spread between u s government bonds and some riskier bonds shrank slightly while the dow jones industrial average rose in early tokyo trading today stocks surged more than it isnt clear yet how many big banks responded to the feds encouragement to borrow at what is known as the feds discount window hard data wont come until the fed releases its routine tally on thursday unless the fed or the banks volunteer information one big bank told the fed that though it doesnt need the money and could get it more cheaply it will borrow &# million today as a gesture according to a person familiar with the banks plans and one wall street firm said it planned to offer collateral to its bank assuming the bank in turn would offer it to the fed as collateral for a discount window loan the latest chapter in the credit crisis of rooted in the deterioration of the market for u s subprime mortgages and securities linked to them represents a new test of the savvy of central banks from frankfurt to london to washington to tokyo these are the institutions in modern capitalist economies that regulate the supply of credit with the goal of keeping prices from rising too fast and preventing economic downturns from deteriorating into repeats of the great depression it began on tuesday aug in europe shortly after a m on the second floor of the european central banks story glass and metal office tower in frankfurt the bank doled out billion euros in its regular weekly financing operation commercial banks were flush with cash yet money market rates the interest charged by banks when lending to one another were rising something was eroding the banks willingness to lend on wednesday the ecb noticed volatility increasing and credit spreads rising more money was flowing into safe havens such as two year german government bonds and reports of tensions in the commercial paper market were circulating by evening it was clear the ecb had to intervene to keep market rates from rising well above the central banks previously set target of president jean claude trichet and vice president lucas papademos were in touch with fed officials with market rates nearly three quarters of a percentage point above the target ecb staffers charged with monitoring liquidity met at the next morning about minutes earlier than usual says a person familiar with the matter they recommended that the central bank take the biggest move in its nine year history an unlimited offer of funds to the banking system at its target rate members of the executive board approved the decision at frankfurt time screens across the world flashed the message "the ecb notes that there are tensions in the euro money market notwithstanding the normal supply of aggregate euro liquidity the ecb is closely monitoring the situation and stands ready to act to assure orderly conditions in the euro money market " at p m the ecb announced that it would accept all bids to borrow money made by pm the announcement sent shock waves through the market at pm the ecb said it was lending billion euros in one day funds bigger even than its initial reaction to the sept terrorist attacks that night jp morgans senior european economist david mackie said "for the last few days people have been worried that the subprime crisis would translate to a broader liquidity issue i think the surprise is that it happened in europe rather than in the u s " in the days that followed the ecb repeatedly put money into the markets to a lesser degree so did the fed and other central banks on friday aug following an early morning conference call among fed policy makers the fed assured the markets that it would do what was necessary to keep the economy lubricated with cash by tuesday aug mr trichet who was in and out of frankfurt while trying to take a vacation issued a statement saying that conditions in the euro zone had gone "progressively back to normal " but that would prove overly optimistic on wednesday a real estate affiliate of wall street buyout titan kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co asked investors to accept a six month delay in repayment on &# billion in commercial paper that night countrywide notified

freddie mac cannot buy these big mortgages markets overseas were going haywire too until the credit crunch many investors had engaged in the so called carry trade borrowing money in japanese yen a low yielding currency and converting the yen to higher yielding currencies such as the u s dollar and the australian dollar now facing big losses some investors needed to unwind these trades and the yen shot up in value so many traders were trying to unload the australian currency that australias central bank intervened to restore order for the first time in six years in canada a group of banks and investors had to rescue faltering issuers of billion canadian dollars us&# billion in commercial paper on thursday a top wall street executive telephoned rob nichols a former treasury official who is now president of the financial services forum a washington trade group asking for help in conveying to the fed the urgency of the deteriorating situation "it is time for us to act " he said mr nichols passed on the information but found the fed already knew it fed chairman bernanke sometimes derided on wall street for being an academic rather than a market veteran had long studied episodes like this in a january speech he noted that the fed was founded "in response to the periodic episodes of banking panics and other forms of financial instability that had plagued the u s economy during the th and early th centuries " these panics typically started when banks faced a sudden drain on their deposits and called in loans to meet those demands fueling a self reinforcing constriction of credit in the panic of the stock market crashed the u s slid into recession and bank runs broke out across the country famed financier j p morgan organized other bankers to direct credit to troubled banks secure international lines of credit and buy stock and calm was restored after the federal reserve was founded in banks were able to access the discount window the same mechanism the fed is now using to stimulate a willingness to lend over the past few weeks wall street executives peppered fed officials in new york and washington with suggestions for easing the logjam in credit markets one idea was for the fed to widen the type of assets it accepts in its "open market operations " when it pumps cash into the economy by buying u s government bonds and the like some thought the fed should buy lower quality mortgages at one point on thursday three big banks j p morgan chase &amp co citigroup inc and bank of america corp discussed with the fed the possibility of borrowing a total of &# billion to be used to buy asset backed commercial paper mortgage backed securities and other instruments fed officials say they welcomed the creativity they listened to some ideas without comment and in some cases explained that the suggestions were outside the feds normal legal authority for several days mr bernanke pondered options with his confidants they included the feds vice chairman donald kohn an economist who was one of former chairman alan greenspans closest aides and timothy geithner president of the new york federal reserve bank and a protege of former treasury secretaries robert rubin and lawrence summers the officials were looking for a maneuver dramatic enough to shore up confidence while avoiding a cut in the feds main interest rate the federal funds rate mr bernanke was still not convinced the economy needed a cut and some fed officials feared it might encourage more of the sloppy lending that led to the crisis they began to look more closely at the discount window banks remain well capitalized and profitable but they appeared reluctant to provide credit to companies issuers of commercial paper and even each other perhaps out of uncertainty over the safety of their customers or their collateral eventually fed officials agreed to reduce the rate charged on loans from the discount window to from and try to reduce the usual stigma associated with such loans by making these direct loans to banks more attractive the fed hoped to reassure banks that they could borrow if they needed to without the usual penalty to their bottom line or to their reputation and thus make them a bit more willing to lend in normal fashion in addition in its public statement friday morning the fed made what amounts to a vow to cut its target on the federal funds interest rate if normalcy fails to return that is the key rate that the fed normally lowers when it wants to loosen monetary policy the fed believed this combination of moves would assure everyone that it was aware of risks to the u s economy posed by the market turmoil particularly at times of stress what the fed says can be almost as powerful a weapon as what the fed does so mr geithner whose job makes him the traditional liaison to wall street turned to a convenient forum the clearing house payments co which is owned by a group of banks and operates much of the plumbing of the nations financial system to avoid the inevitable headlines and comparisons to the rescue of long term capital management when financial executives were summoned to the new york feds fortress like headquarters mr geithner sought a minute telephone conference call on the call were commercial bankers who work with clearing house as well as several top investment bankers among them zoe cruz co president of morgan stanley james cayne chief executive of bear stearns cos joseph gregory president of lehman brothers holdings inc and stan oneal chief executive of merrill lynch &amp co joined by mr kohn but not mr bernanke mr geithner told banks about the discount rate cut and said they could wait up to days instead of just a day to pay back their discount window loans "we will consider appropriate use of the discount window a sign of strength " said mr geithner according to a participant seth waugh chief executive of deutsche bank ags americas unit told those on the call that it was important for discount window borrowing not to be seen as a sign of financial weakness "you need some safety in numbers " mr waugh said according to a person who was listening he said the fed needed to make clear it "will be there for as long as it takes to restore liquidity " another banker participating in the call said of the fed "what they came up with is pretty ingenious " investment banks or hedge funds that hold mortgage backed securities cant borrow from the fed directly but they can bring those securities to banks in turn the banks can offer the paper as collateral to the fed for a day loan the fed "really wanted to drive home the point that if bankers were complaining about not being able to borrow money against liquid high quality securities mortgages we have no more basis for complaint we were all given a clear message " says this banker bond markets on friday were calmer although not completely won over by the feds move the price of two year and year treasury bonds fell slightly suggesting demand for these safe investments wasnt as great as before although the price of three month treasury bills rose the difference between yields on junk bonds and treasury bonds slipped to percentage points from percentage points on thursday according to a merrill lynch index in a hint that tolerance for risk was recovering somewhat these are the kinds of measures that will be watched closely this week to see whether the destructive cycle of declining confidence and illiquid debt markets has halted if it doesnt the fed will likely cut interest rates on or before sept the date of its next scheduled policy
