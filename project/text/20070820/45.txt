lessons of past may offer clues to markets fate as investors around the globe try to gauge whether this months financial market turmoil is a passing storm or a more lasting disturbance they are looking at two past periods of turbulence for signs of what could come next those two periods the stock market crash of and the downdraft of bear striking similarities to the present they also provide insight into the role of the federal reserve which bolstered markets friday sparking a rally in both and stocks fell sharply starting in july or august and although markets seemed to stabilize by september they abruptly plunged again and didnt come out of their tailspins fully until october whether stocks will suffer a similar fate now or escape it due at least in part to timely fed action is the big question on investors minds in the previous two cases and again this time around market downturns turned into routs as computer based stock trading models blew up in the faces of the investors who used them the crash of took place during the original buyout boom which bullish investors said would keep stock prices high for years and was the year a big hedge fund called long term capital management almost imploded forcing the fed to step in to calm credit markets big corporate buyouts such as texas utility txu corp s agreement to be acquired for &# billion by a group of private investors and student lender slm corp s deal to be acquired for &# billion have formed part of the backdrop to this years trading so too have battered hedge funds two funds at bear stearns cos for example lost almost all their value after investing in securities linked to low quality mortgages ln the fed wound up intervening three times because its first attempt proved insufficient in the fed didnt intervene until after the crash although when it did step in it succeeded in stanching the bleeding this time as in the fed has tried to intervene before things get worse but unlike fed chairman alan greenspan in his successor ben bernanke has taken a gradualist approach he has cut the rate the fed charges to provide cash to the banking system but he has avoided taking the action mr greenspan took in cutting the more broadly influential federal funds rate which governs banks prime lending rates a cut in the federal funds rate would more directly help small borrowers but the fed fears it also could rekindle inflation yale economist robert shiller whose book "irrational exuberance" appeared just in time to predict the bear market that began in sees unsettling parallels with amid the stock declines earlier this month he moved some of his savings out of stocks he beefed up his safer investments in things such as treasury bills leaving about one third of his money in the stock market but he worries that he may have been hasty and says he certainly wouldnt advise others to imitate him now the markets direction is much harder to read than it was in or prof shiller says "id say the odds are about to " that the markets declines have farther to go as in and one of the most unsettling aspects of the past weeks selloff is that stocks are falling and people dont fully understand why a big reason in each case was the role of computers programmed by people who were supposed to be market geniuses this time it was hedge funds using mathematical models whose forced selling contributed to huge market swings and massive trading volumes over the past few days the hedge funds many of whose models were strikingly similar had to unwind unsuccessful trades involving millions of shares after troubles in the mortgage markets bled into the stock market the sight of unknown sellers using computers to sell millions of shares of many different stocks while buying millions of shares of other stocks sowed panic among other investors "it caused so much mass buying and selling that the market couldnt easily handle it it was almost like trying to get a stampede of elephants through a small door " says gordon fowler chief investment officer at philadelphia money management firm glenmede trust who witnessed similar breakdowns in computer models in and the models on which investors relied in were known as portfolio insurance and the idea seems surprisingly suspect in the light of history the portfolio insurance models called for investors to protect themselves from losses by making sales in stock futures markets if their actual stock holdings fell a predetermined amount the models which were based on detailed analyses of market history didnt take into account what would happen if everyone using these models all tried to do it at the same time markets couldnt absorb all the sales demands and the selling pressure helped cause the crash "the models du jour failed in both and " says william hackney a managing partner at atlanta capital management he remembers being amazed at the stock gains earlier in despite rising interest rates and inflation only later did he realize that people had felt free to behave recklessly because they had "portfolio insurance " indeed in all three years market turmoil was made worse by overconfident investors using borrowed money the unwinding of all of that leverage or borrowing can be brutal because as stock prices fall investors are forced to sell stocks to pay back their loans creating a downward spiral in the blowup that forced the fed to act came at a multibillion dollar hedge fund called long term capital management which had become the dominant player in the treasury bond market in the summer of ltcm was making highly leveraged bets against treasury bonds and in favor of other bonds including those of russia its models showed the risk of losing money that way to be minuscule when russia nonetheless defaulted on its debt payments ltcm faced bankruptcy until the fed helped persuade a group of banks and brokerage firms to rescue it for a while the incident soured many investors on computer models and borrowed money but with time new models emerged and began showing large gains in response investors pulled billions in investments away from traditional "long only" money managers who simply tried to pick which stocks would do best the latest vogue was for so called quantitative market neutral hedge funds which were supposed to avoid market gyrations by betting on gains in one large group of stocks bonds or currencies while simultaneously hedging their risks by betting on declines in other large groups "at dinners with other managers i would hear people talk about how they have quant models or that they were long short managers or market neutral managers they would look at me like i was a dinosaur " says hersh cohen co chief investment officer at clearbridge advisors in new york which manages &# billion in the traditional way by actively choosing which stocks to buy "now i realize that what sounded impressive was not much more than a thing we saw played out in and " says mr cohen who managed money during both of those crisis years another big lesson of all three years is that it is the debt markets that often pose the biggest threats to stability in the stock market in it was rising interest rates that eventually sent stocks plunging in it was the risk that the collapse of ltcm could roil the bond markets lately it has been securities backed by high risk home mortgages that had found their way into a wide variety of investment portfolios the mortgage securities were so widely held that when they went bad they caused credit markets to freeze up hurting other higher grade bonds as in huge investment funds used junk bonds in recent years to take over companies once thought too big to be acquired in and again this year the market suffered once buyouts started to face trouble "my view of booms is that they generate laxity in standards for loans because there is a general sense of optimism that is what we saw in the late s " says yales prof shiller also supporting stocks in as well as in recent months were a strong world economy and healthy corporate profits which investors expected to last for years both times the sudden stock declines shook those hopes in all three cases markets turned increasingly volatile sharp drops earlier on proved to be temporary affairs helping create a false sense of optimism to be sure there are also some big differences one is what analysts call valuation stock prices compared to companies underlying value valuation looked excessive in with stocks trading at more than times corporate profits price earnings ratios were similarly high in this time around the ratios remain in the teens close to the post average of about the real excess this time has been in lending markets where investors bid up mortgage related securities and junk bonds to unheard of levels and where investment banks invented novel bond like securities one reassuring difference is that in the previous crises problems developed in the bedrock treasury bond market this time treasury bonds remain an island of relative tranquility another hopeful sign in both and the markets woes were severe but brief despite the sharp market drops more than in and nearly at one point in the dow jones industrial average finished both years with gains it was up in and in and the standard &amp poors stock index was up both years as well although memories of the crash still make some investors shiver that day oct actually marked the bottom of the bear market the next day stocks began to recover beginning a new bull market one reason for the quick rebounds was prompt action by the fed and another was that the economy avoided recession in both and but the fast rebounds led to more excess and more abuse of borrowed money the buyout boom resumed in but went bust in when a proposed buyout of united airlines fell through and the junk bond market plunged the dow industrials fell into a bear market in as recession arrived the consequences of the post tech stock excess were worse the bear market besides valuation fed intervention and the economy investors need to watch for other corporate and hedge fund blowups to get an idea what might lie ahead the longer it takes to work these problems out the more likely credit and stock market problems will be to spill over into overall economy causing a slowdown or worse a recession "when the market does recover it should recover quickly " more like and than says burton malkiel a princeton university economics professor but prof malkiel doesnt think the hedge fund blowups are over yet "it is undoubtedly the case that we will be reading about more now " he says "it is not just the bear stearns one and the goldman sachs one undoubtedly a lot of those funds were more highly leveraged in some of those investments that now are no longer profitable a number probably bought mortgage backed securities that they didnt completely understand "
