the daily fix for teams in pennant races september has come early online edition remember the "animal house" character played by kevin bacon hes the rotc guy who starts off intoning "remain calm all is well" as the deltas storm the town parade then becomes increasingly unhinged until hes screaming "remain calm all is well " while on the verge of a coronary well its kevin bacon time in a quartet of tight pennant races in the al east the boston red sox are now just four games ahead of the new york yankees with six games to go against their hated rivals and whispers about everywhere "logic suggests that the sox will have a chance to add some valuable fat against tampa bay and chicago this week while the yankees travel to los angeles and detroit all before the sox and yankees go head to head next week in the bronx " tony massarotti writes in the boston herald "but then when has logic ever applied to this team " in the nl central the cubs are a game up on the milwaukee brewers with the st louis cardinals four back in the chicago tribune phil rogers horrifies superstitious cub fans everywhere by wondering where the cubs will open the playoffs "i understand that its baseball blasphemy to take a playoff spot for granted especially in chicago " he writes midway through dissecting the math for everything from runs scored to strength of schedule "the games still must be played and the standings adjusted daily but consider it a huge surprise if the cubs cannot maintain the lead they assumed on friday night " cubbie overconfidence is about all brewers fans can take solace in these days in the milwaukee journal sentinel michael hunt surveys the five run lead blown by the brewers against the cincinnati reds and writes that "now a really bad road team is going on the road for what could be the final stand in a once hopeful season the departure gates say phoenix san francisco and chicago but maybe the actual destination isnt on the board keep this up and the final destination is nowhere " in the al central the detroit tigers now trail the cleveland indians by games "as soon as the tigers wake up this morning they should go to their calendars and rip out the current page that reads august " advises mitch albom in the detroit free press "its september now oh maybe not by the moon and the stars but by the little white ball that measures the season september is really a frame of mind in baseball it means crunch time the shedding of the fat every game and inning with consequence for the playoffs " in the al west the seattle mariners trail the anaheim angels by two and a big reason the ms are in the race is jose guillen who played in only games with the washington nationals last year and did little to shed his reputation as an immature hothead this year everything is different "he has harnessed that fire and taken it onto the field " writes steve kelley in the seattle times "he has been a clubhouse leader not a clubhouse lawyer and provided a spark that has been missing since the halcyon days of he plays the game like a prize fighter every at bat is a battle every inside pitch is a challenge he reacts to every fly ball as if he absolutely knows he can make the catch " on saturday night the washington redskins lost a preseason game to the pittsburgh steelers but they almost lost a lot more than that quarterback jason campbell had to leave the game after an illegal shot to the knee by steelers defensive end brett keisel happily all seems to be ok "when campbell returned to the field in an approximately ambulatory state this whole city could uncross its fingers " writes thomas boswell in the washington post "nothing in this town is anticipated on an annual basis like the start of a new redskins season not the fourth of july on the mall or the cherry blossoms or the state of the union speech only an inauguration every four years tops it its been that way since my dad was a fan of sammy baugh in the s and s to the present when my son knows the number of days until the season opener now the fine frenzy the fall foolishness the football fetish can begin again " so youve just been called up by the oakland as welcome to the show kid before you get used to white balls for batting practice and the ungodly breaking stuff they throw up here a bit of advice dont let em give you the bermuda rectangle thats the name for a certain locker in the oakland clubhouse thats been occupied by six players this season with outfielder dee brown its latest resident "baseball cubicles are like homes or restaurant tables location is a crucial factor in their desirability and status " writes scott ostler in the san francisco chronicle "dee browns cubicle is next to a flat post so its got extra elbow room its in a low traffic area of the clubhouse a quiet neighborhood away from superstars who attract media riff raff yet near the exit to the field and a few steps away from the lunchroom if you were shopping for a nice dressing stall in the as clubhouse youd definitely consider this one and yet it seems crowded with ghosts " chad gaudin dresses next door and has been offered the bermuda rectangle for his own but the pitcher is a native new orleanian so he knows voodoo when he sees it and has kept clear thank you very much his take on the bermuda rectangle "its got friggin something wrong with it " if you dont like your boss or neighbor you cant swap him for someone else if youre raising four kids and decide theyre too much work you cant exchange them for one exceptional prodigy if youre struggling with college loans you cant sell off your younger bro for two sibling draft picks and cash thats why we love sports trades what other aspect of life offers such an immediate solution to a problem thats espn coms bill simmons beginning a study of the kinds of trades from "apples for oranges" to "the all in trade " its a survey that covers everything from the makeup of teams themselves to fan morale and the wrinkles of general managers contracts and the way these various factors intersect a sample mr simmons calls the all in trade "the single most ruinous trade in sports your average gm runs a team for five years but your average fan supports a team for life if the gm knows hes getting canned unless he takes a do or die risk hes much more likely to push his entire stack of poker chips forward and if it doesnt work he walks away a loser and lands a tv gig while the teams shell shocked fans remain in a state of catatonia for the next five years " this weekend the boston red sox took on the anaheim angels at fenway forty years ago the same two teams faced off and bosox slugger and heartthrob tony conigliaro was felled by an errant fastball from the angels jack hamilton as discussed in fridays fix the final game of that weekend series was won by bostons jose santiago singing the national anthem friday night was jimmy fund patient jordan leandre whod sung the anthem nine previous times at fenway but never without a wheelchair brace or cane this time jordan was on his own and after he finished singing he decided hed run the bases waiting for him at home plate was mr
