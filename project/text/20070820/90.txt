theory &amp practice eureka inventor finds bottom line seals the deal entrepreneur looks past gee whiz technology to focus on client profit stephen clarke chief executive of applied intellectual capital thought his new process to clean mining waste would be an instant hit it removed more potentially harmful metals than rival technologies did produced less waste and was cheaper too mr clarke says his tests found but mr clarke couldnt attract any interest from the environmental managers of big mining firms after a year and a half of failed pitches mr clarke realized what was wrong hed been stressing the technologys benefits for the environment rather than how much the process could help a companys bottom line mr clarke started marketing the technology as a way to make money off the recovered metals this year he found a company willing to test it "even when youve got the best mousetrap youre not necessarily going to be welcomed with open arms " he says ruefully mr clarkes story highlights a common blind spot among technology entrepreneurs forgetting to put the customer first technology industry observers say its a particular problem for scientists and inventors who tend to stress the ingenuity of their inventions more than the potential benefits to customers "its easy to get carried away by the capabilities of a new technology " says paul frankel a director of aquillian investments llc a consulting firm that identifies environmentally friendly investments mr frankel who has also taught environmental entrepreneurship at stanford university says he told students to research clients needs in order to craft the best marketing message he also asked them to form project teams that included people from many disciplines from marketing to engineering so that they could consider their proposed business from many angles mr clarkes metal recovery technology got its start early this decade when his firm which specializes in research into electrochemical devices like batteries developed a new way to remove lead from contaminated soil using a chemical reaction mr clarke tested the technology on polluted dirt at a u s naval facility in hawaii then tried to interest mining companies in using it to remove copper lead or zinc from mining waste such residual metal can be an environmental hazard and many countries including the u s require mining companies to contain the waste or reduce the concentration of metals mr clarke who had worked as a mechanical engineer and management consultant before starting applied intellectual capital in the early s was a novice at selling cleanup technology he approached the environmental affairs staff at several big mining firms offering a better way to remove metals from their dumps they werent interested by the end of mr clarke realized he needed a new approach he had found that many companies historically viewed environmental cleanup as a regulatory chore and were reluctant to try new technologies even if they held the promise of saving money for help mr clarke turned to a technology marketing firm called everclear solutions run by environmental consultants to whom hed pitched his technology everclear chief executive donald jacobs knew the environmental market well messrs clarke and jacobs decided to switch targets marketing to mine operators and finance executives rather than environmental managers they told prospective customers that applied intellectual capitals technology could generate revenue by recovering valuable metals from waste piles the soaring prices of copper and other raw materials helped their argument "we all decided we needed to find clients that wanted to make more money " mr jacobs says in everclear tested the technology at a polluted lake in montana then this past may weatherly international plc a small british mining company agreed to let messrs clarke and jacobs test the technology on a dump at a former copper processing operation in namibia weatherly was looking for ways to extract the remaining copper says paul craven weatherlys chief financial officer applied intellectual capital listed on londons aim stock market in january and took a stake in everclear in march its still too early to say how successful the deal will be for messrs clarke and jacobs applied intellectual capital is paying &# million to set up the test facility if the technology proves itself applied will get half of the recovered copper which weatherly estimates is worth hundreds of millions of dollars mr craven says the commercial potential of mr clarkes technology drove him to close the deal "were interested in this primarily to make money for our shareholders " says mr craven "the cleanup is a nice side effect " perfect pitch sales tips for tech entrepreneurs tap managers with varied expertise who can view the business from many angles research potential customers thoroughly focus on niche markets before going on to bigger ones look for problems the technology can solve target technology applications that can drive customer sales be open to different uses of the technology remember the best technology doesnt always win source paul frankel
