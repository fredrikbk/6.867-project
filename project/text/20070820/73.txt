transaction fees and rates when talking with a potential processor begin by asking for specifics on your transaction fees determine the two types of fees the fixed monthly fees and the percentage fee per transaction small businesses that process a lot of transactions particularly in small amounts need to avoid monthly fees designed to penalize just that entrepreneurs anticipating a small number of large transactions need to watch transaction percentage fees carefully all merchants should ask the potential processor for the "fully loaded discount rate " a figure which combines transaction percentage with an approximate breakdown of the cost per transaction for other monthly fees and surcharges to get accurate estimates you will need to provide the processor with average monthly transaction volume and dollar totals these rates differ based on the type of payment card a customer uses ask for the fully loaded discount rate on three types of cards a signature debit card a standard credit card and a rewards credit card also ask about other fixed monthly costs such as what you will be charged if you dont process any transactions if the costs arent what youd like try to negotiate dont accept the one size fits all offer but request rates or fees that better suit your business not all processors may be open to tailoring contracts for individual operators but the majority are hungry enough to make adjustments know what deal youd like to see and "negotiate upfront " says heartland payments mr carr who also runs the site merchantbillofrights com which advises businesses that accept payment cards sample statements once you understand what your fee structure will be ask the processor for samples of paperwork from businesses similar to yours look at the statement the company sends to the merchant and at the merchants checking account statement comparing the two should help you discern how and when the fees are applied to your transaction and conversely subtracted from your account make sure your fees will be itemized by card type references ask the processor for a list of five local business customers preferably in your industry and contact them their experience will tell a lot about how a payment processor handles changes in rates and executes a contract contract terms before signing a contract make sure you understand all of the terms "its not only about price " says doug hambry senior vice president of merchant relations at visa usa "like anything else its what youre buying what services is the financial institution offering you " have the processor spell out the details of when and how youll receive your money the average time between the transaction and receipt of the funds is about two days says mr carr but it can take longer also find out what equipment you can use and whether you will have to buy or rent it the length of the contract is particularly important many small businesses change fast as do their needs for card processing marilyn landis president of basic business concepts inc pittsburgh a consulting firm to small businesses recommends keeping contracts short because early cancellation
