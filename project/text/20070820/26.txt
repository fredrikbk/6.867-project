foreign investors view dollar as refuge currency despite recent tumult for all their gyrations in recent weeks financial markets have shown little worry over one of the u s economys greatest vulnerabilities its appetite for foreign money to finance the huge gap between what it spends and what it earns that gap known as the current account deficit requires inflows of more than &# billion a day into u s stocks bonds and other investments to keep things in balance if a financial panic like the one now unfolding caused the money to stop flowing the logical result would be a precipitous drop in the value of the dollar a sharp rise in interest rates and a deep recession but so far that hasnt happened the dollar in fact has risen against its major competitor the euro and the yields the u s government pays on its debt have fallen that say economists represents an implicit vote of confidence in the ability of u s markets and u s institutions such as the federal reserve to weather the storm "the dollar is regaining its status as a refuge currency " says pierre olivier gourinchas an international economist at the university of california berkeley "if anything the flows are coming back into the u s that will make it easier to finance the current account deficit over at least the next few years " not everyone is so optimistic amid the scene of depositors lining up at a branch of countrywide financial corp in california much as they did outside russian banks during that countrys financial crash almost a decade ago some see a doomsday scenario in which foreigners refuse to lend to the u s as a distinct possibility "the country most exposed to investors not lending is by definition the biggest borrower around namely the u s " says jan loeys global market strategist at j p morgan in london still a crisis that began with u s mortgage debt and u s hedge funds has rapidly become at least as much of a problem for the financial system in europe and points beyond prompting global investors to do what they have traditionally done when crises hit flee into dollars and u s treasurys as a result the dollar has gained in value against the euro and the british pound while the yield on a year u s treasury note has plummeted to from about in early july the dollar has lost value against the japanese yen but that mainly reflects investors rush to unwind trades in which they borrowed yen to invest in other currencies rather than a flight into japanese assets nobody is saying that the market for securities backed by risky u s mortgages will snap back or that the u s economy wont suffer from credit woes or succumb to a deepening housing slump many forecasters still expect the dollar to lose value over the longer term but the markets latest behavior does shed some light on a few of the decades biggest economic questions why the u s current account deficit got so big how long it can be sustained and what dangers it presents the origins of the debate over the current account can be traced back to the last big financial crisis in the late s back then emerging economies in asia and eastern europe paid a huge price for running big deficits either in their current accounts or government budgets when foreign investors lost faith in the countries ability to handle the debt burden they fled en masse forcing sharp currency devaluations the experience led to a shift in many emerging economies financial policies they refocused on managing their currencies and fostering export led growth which generated large trade surpluses and rapid growth in foreign currency reserves china for example now has more than &# trillion in foreign reserves compared with about &# billion in russia has close to &# billion up from less than &# billion in at about the same time the u s current account deficit started growing fast in it stood at of gross domestic product a broad measure of economic activity by last year it had reached of gdp or about &# billion because the u s must borrow money from abroad to close the gap a deficit of that size all else being equal would cause the countrys foreign debt to equal its entire annual gdp by economists offer at least two competing and overlapping explanations for the trend in the u s current account some put the emphasis on the profligate behavior of u s consumers and government faulting americas appetite for foreign televisions and foreign wars for getting the country perilously deep into debt others see the u s as providing a necessary service to the rest of the world offering the only financial markets large and resilient enough to safely absorb all the savings flowing in from countries such as russia and china as of the total value of the u s debt and equity markets stood at about &# trillion about twice the size of the comparable euro area markets according to the international monetary fund in the latter case often called the "bretton woods ii" view after the global system of fixed exchange rates that lasted from to the current account deficit can be sustained as long as there are countries with excess savings to invest and as long as u s financial markets remain the best place to put the money recent worries over tighter accounting standards and the longer term health of the u s economy have challenged the dominance of u s markets but the latest market action suggests their reputation remains largely intact and offers some support for bretton woods ii "the collapse of the yield on the year treasury is probably the best indication of how quality is defined in peoples minds " says michael dooley a professor of economics at the university of california santa cruz who has been co author of seminal papers on the bretton woods ii concept and has become a principal at a san francisco based hedge fund cabezon capital that uses the concept as its investment philosophy "the fact that the u s still produces by far the best assets in the world will as things settle down be very good for the u s " aside from highlighting the relative attraction of u s markets the current crisis has been tough on europe the u s s primary competitor for the attention of global savers last week after the problems in the market for certain u s mortgage backed securities forced the bailout of german bank ikb deutsche industriebank ag and a withdrawal freeze at funds run by french bank bnp paribas sa the european central bank injected large sums into the interbank lending market to calm fears of bigger failures the u s federal reserve also intervened but not on such a large scale it did however signal friday that it is poised to do more if the situation gets worse "the ecb had to intervene with much bigger chunks of change because the european financial markets are less able to adjust to these kinds of rapid price movements than the united states " says catherine mann professor of international economics and finance at brandeis university in massachusetts the troubles in europe caused investors to move into dollars so quickly that european banks may have had difficulty meeting the demand as a result the euro weakened it now buys &# down from about &# a month ago "it shows that in this crunch just looking at the currency maybe theres a greater risk in europe than there is here " says gerald lucas senior investment adviser at deutsche bank securities in new york to be sure even if the u s can sustain the current account deficit that doesnt mean it is a good thing for one robust inflows of foreign capital can create an environment that encourages people companies and the government to borrow irresponsibly a "moral hazard" that some economists believe contributed to the current problems in the mortgage market beyond that paying off the u s foreign debt will require future generations of americans to forfeit a portion of whatever improvement in living standards they manage to achieve "i dont think its a good thing that everybody lends us money " says prof mann "but until there is some alternative investment i mean country then the u s will be able to retain foreign investors even having this huge current account deficit "
