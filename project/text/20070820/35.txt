in asia its a world of extremes chinas insular markets defy slump in shares other trends pose worry shanghai can chinas stock market remain hot amid a global chill the world wide contagion of credit concerns that started with the u s mortgage market has driven down almost every significant global stock index this month from sao paulo to paris to singapore except for chinas shanghai composite index the chinese benchmark slid slightly last week mainly on domestic concerns but remains up about since the beginning of august and up this year the chinese market has been insulated from the global market chaos by strict capital controls that largely prevent international investors from buying domestic chinese stocks and that tightly limit overseas investing by chinese so any reversal in china would have little direct impact on global capital flows but the fall of one of the few pillars of global market strength could damage investor sentiment which remains shaky despite fridays move by the federal reserve to cut its discount rate and encourage banks to borrow for now analysts say there is no reason the global credit crunch has to spread to chinas stock market if trouble remains confined to global financial markets china is still so swimming in cash that its central bank recently drained funds from its financial system while its global counterparts were pouring money into theirs but the sustained rise in chinese shares means many analysts believe it is due for a correction at some point even if no one can say when the u s credit problem "cant affect china directly " says andy xie an independent economist in shanghai but he adds "i think the chinese stock market is a bubble " chinas stock market is less than years old and investors many of them new to the game often trade on rumors or even superstition rather than fundamentals other unhealthy trends persist many companies have been buying stock and using the rise in prices to boost their earnings a trend that could add painfully to any downturn by hammering corporate profits and thereby fueling more selling chinas market still doesnt play the central role its counterparts do in more developed economies but the market is starting to emerge as a closely watched indicator for the chinese economy which this year will become the worlds third largest after the u s and japan already once this year in february a market swoon in china startled markets elsewhere mounting uncertainty about u s economic growth makes chinas economy and its market more important in investor eyes for economists gauging the outlook for chinas markets one key question is whether weak global markets might translate to softer demand among consumers in the u s and elsewhere and thereby slow chinas exports which are a major contributor to the economy about one fifth of chinas exports go to the u s leaving chinas economy "potentially very vulnerable to any substantial future u s consumer pullback " michael kurtz a hong kong based strategist at bear stearns said in a recent note since chinas bull market began in july it has risen by times that has brought total capitalization of its two exchanges in shanghai and shenzhen to about &# trillion about the size of its annual gross domestic product that isnt high compared with other countries but it does suggest any major market setback could cause broader economic fallout than has happened in china in the past by contrast the countrys last bear market in the first half of this decade had no apparent impact on broader economic growth few consider chinese stock prices cheap shanghai listed shares trade at an average times last years earnings yet among chinas retail investors confidence remains high in the first half of august million new trading accounts were opened a week ago as credit worries were pounding global markets &# billion was pledged in a day to the launch of a mutual fund offered by china post &amp capital fund management co friday three initial public offerings made their debuts in china rising an average of more than the shanghai composite index did decline for three straight days late last week it ended the week at about where it was days earlier holding a gain of for the month moreover the main cause for last weeks slip came not from global credit worries analysts and traders said but from domestic concerns that underscore how starkly different chinas current situation is from much of the rest of the world one key factor a surge in inflation fueled worries of another interest rate increase the market also ran up against psychological resistance as it neared the level for the first time but few see that as insurmountable for an index that pulled above for the first time just last november chinas market is a "rational bubble " says walter lin chief representative in beijing of aviva plcs morley fund management unit "it is a largely closed market and we have excess liquidity here " he says while chinese investors believe they are acting sensibly by continuing to pile into the market history is replete with examples of how traditional market fundamentals ultimately squash talk that a particular market is unique and while other markets have been hurt in part by big investors selling off holdings elsewhere to compensate for losses in the u s foreign investors have virtually no role in china about foreign institutions share a &# billion quota to make investments in chinas local currency stock and bond markets meaning foreigners own a total of less than of chinas stock market capitalization foreigners also can trade class b shares denominated in u s or hong kong dollars but the total value of those shares is tiny and they have almost no effect on the broader market because the global credit problem "didnt change the trend of the china stock market " this small pool of foreign money managers hasnt noticeably altered strategy according to a top official at a shanghai brokerage who handles much of the trading to some degree chinas stock values have simply been catching up with broader advances by its economy the shanghai composite fell between the end of and while gdp more than doubled market capitalization plummeted to of gdp the current rally was triggered in mid by a government change to shareholding structures that gave minority investors a bigger voice
