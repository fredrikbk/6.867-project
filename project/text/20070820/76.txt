small business a special report the secrets of serial success how some entrepreneurs manage to score big again and again and five years ago tom scott and tom first realized they would never have to work again friends from college the pair had launched a juice brand called nantucket nectars from the back of their island boat and catapulted themselves the self dubbed "juice guys" into the stuff of entrepreneurial legend as their beverage took off nationwide they sold a majority of their company to ocean spray cranberries inc and when cadbury schweppes plc later bought the entire business for an estimated &# million in march of both men were set for retirement and they were only in their mid s but there was no retiring in their futures today messrs scott and first are both deep into new ventures that for now at least appear headed for success mr scott leads plum tv a new york based company that operates local television channels in historic affluent markets such as aspen nantucket and marthas vineyard and has had notable investors including starwood capital group ceo barry sternlicht singer jimmy buffett and former viacom ceo tom freston mr first is in the midst of a new start up o beverages llc in cambridge mass which markets a line of naturally flavored waters already sold in nearly states through safeway balduccis and bristol farms among other stores in between nantucket nectars and their current ventures the two men started a beverage distribution software company that was sold to a publicly traded technology company "im a crazy competitive person so theres no way im stopping " mr first says "i like being in the trenches " call them serial preneurs while some entrepreneurs struggle their whole lives to bring one idea or product to market theres another breed those who do it once twice or three times more disproving the notion of beginners luck in some cases the brands and people are household names such as steve jobs with apple pixar and next but the ranks also are populated with lesser known entrepreneurs who fly under the radar hitting one start up home run after the other "i really believe that some people are kind of entrepreneurial adrenaline freaks " says wayne stewart a management professor at clemson university in clemson s c "they really get their kicks by starting businesses " in mr stewart published a study with two other researchers looking for common traits among serial entrepreneurs which he defined as those who had owned and operated three or more businesses of the entrepreneurs studied only fit the bill but those who did scored higher in all three categories examined they had a higher propensity for risk innovation and achievement they were less scared of failure and they were more able to recover when they did fail beyond that many serial preneurs bring tactical advantages from their first venture to apply the second and third time around for instance they recruit top talent from their original companies to subsequent ventures they double dip financially getting money and connections from people who backed their earlier brainstorms several lean heavily on a trusted partner for financial professional and emotional support in whatever endeavor they undertake more than anything however the greatest and more crucial challenge among repeat entrepreneurs is figuring out how to rekindle for future ventures the innocence love and hunger that fueled their first enterprise despite hitting it big early with nantucket nectars messrs first and scott both struggled after the sale to find a business that inspired them as much as being the juice guys "a lot of the drive early on was the drive to not have to leave nantucket or write the resume or go do anything else we were hustlers " says mr first adds mr scott "what happened was that while approaching the things we love boats water weather we stumbled on juice ive learned from this that it doesnt matter what im good at it matters what i like " so why do some entrepreneurs who strike gold once continue to start over a general contractor might launch a business because he has certain skills and then stick with it until retirement or a banker will work her way up the corporate ladder happy with the security of a paycheck and benefits and retire once she has saved enough by contrast serial entrepreneurs main job is the act of creation and thus they keep creating new businesses often after they no longer need the paycheck "most people cant understand why someone who made &# million would do it again " says seth godin who founded yoyodyne an interactive direct marketing company bought by yahoo in late hes now running a new online venture called squidoo a free tool that lets users build web pages about any topic within a searchable community "thats because most people dont like working and they think its irrational to keep working " he says "but most entrepreneurs dont care about money its a tool " for instance scott jones was a multimillionaire by age having co founded the company boston technology maker of a voice mail system now used by many telephone companies world wide he retired and learned how to fly planes and perform aerobatics but was quickly bored so he went back to work and has since co founded gracenote inc an internet accessible music database used by itunes as well as a robotic lawn mower company and a search engine that uses human guides in real time those years not creating he says were "the most unhappy years of my life " moreover serial entrepreneurs harbor an unusual appetite for risk something they can inherit from their parents dan bricklin has started four companies in his lifetime his first software arts was sold to lotus development corp in the mid s mr bricklins father was a small business owner who ran a printing business as did his grandfather mr bricklin who now runs software garden inc in newton highlands mass says he feeds on the thrill of starting something new and untested "its like that sense of walking across a stream on the rocks sort of knowing where youre going but sort of not " as for risk "if you actually seen the ups and downs of a business and your family isnt terrified that makes it a lot easier to do yourself " likewise tim miller caught the entrepreneurial bug at age when he received about &# after his father sold a company mr miller stashed that money away planning to invest in his own company one day fifteen years later he dipped into the fund to start a software firm called avitek inc based on an idea his then employer didnt want to explore mr miller recalls how family members fretted about the danger of going it alone with his brother specifically questioning his judgment after he hired his fourth employee how could he possibly put other peoples livelihoods on the line "but it never truly occurred to me that i would potentially need to let any of them go at any point " mr miller says adding that he believes successful entrepreneurs "see opportunities where other see risk " he sold avitek in for about &# million without layoffs and is now running a venture called rally software development corp based in boulder colo mr miller didnt succeed alone he had a partner ryan martens who now works with him at rally software their compatibility is an asset whose value mr miller finds hard to quantify while mr martens as the chief technology officer is deeply invested in software development mr miller is the business guy "i think great leaders build teams " mr miller says "and those teams have some glue and they tend to stick together " whether by design or not on second and third ventures serials often surround themselves with familiar faces partly its about familiarity and trust messrs scott and first both tapped ex nantucket nectar employees for their newest ventures they typically talk to each other several times a week and mr scott is an investor in o beverages "weve never doubted the others total respect and having the other persons good interest at heart " mr first says repeat relationships are also about expediency elizabeth cogswell baskin has run four companies including two advertising agencies and a book packaging operation now shes the ceo of tribe inc a &# million atlanta advertising agency that works with brands including porsche home depot and ups and peppered throughout tribes ranks are faces from her previous companies "i think it is a huge shortcut to hire someone you already have a relationship with " ms baskin says at age jack goeken lays claim to having helped start a string of well known enterprises mci inflight phone airfone and several others now hes deeply involved in a new start up polybrite international inc a naperville ill company that produces a screw in led light bulb that will fit in normal lamps his daughter sandra has worked with him on every venture since mci and says one of her fathers greatest strengths is "herding tigers" that is finding entrepreneurial and sometimes difficult to manage individuals who can make a project happen but then making sure they dont stick around too long "a team can come in and do a great start up and make history but the team that does that isnt the team to run it for years " ms goeken says the key she says is to let those people know theyll be taken care of after a sale so they dont hold a companys progress back worrying about a job bringing them on in the next venture is one inducement plus she says "they are a known entity and you take the risk out of the equation " there are drawbacks to repeat employees mr godin for one believes the strategy can inhibit a fresh start "one good thing is beginners mind people looking at something for the first time often have a fresh insight " he says plus new businesses have different needs at his first start up yoyodyne he says his team worked hours a day in "emergency mode" a pattern he didnt want to repeat "if i put the whole team together again i dont know if we could have worked in anything but emergency mode " by contrast hitting up the same investors mr godin believes is almost always smart particularly if you made them money the first go around "they are doing everything on trust " he says david neeleman the founder of jetblue airways corp says treating investors fairly and staying close to them between ventures is critical as is giving them an opportunity to invest in subsequent ventures in fact he says all of jetblues investors except george soros had been investors in his first airline morris air "i just went back to the investors of morris air and said do you want to do it again " he raised &# million for jetblue from his old investors and &# million from mr soros mr neeleman stepped down as jetblues ceo earlier this year after a series of high profile flight cancellations though he remains chairman whats more serial entrepreneurs find many of the contacts and information they pick up with early ventures can pay off down the road they court vendors customers trade groups chambers of commerce even if they dont need them right away while working in earlier ventures for her father ms goeken often spent weekends in foreign countries instead of going home inviting business contacts to dinner for many years she mailed christmas cards all over the world learned about different religions and picked the brains of partners low level employees about their countrys customs "it may not be that important to you right now but they might have something to teach you " she says "id invest more than just getting the deal done and time and time again i went back to the same people in new ventures " one of the hardest tasks serial entrepreneurs face is recapturing the drive and direction that fueled their first venture without letting the first success overshadow or dictate what they do next sometimes its as simple as learning to let go says ms goeken "walking out of airfone was the saddest day of my life when i finally pulled myself together i never looked back i dont miss a single company now " other times it isnt so clear cut after nantucket nectars was sold the founders started a beverage distribution software company because it seemed a natural evolution from being the juice guys trouble was both men hated software and left before the company was sold "i felt like i was turning into a sheep " says mr scott "i started wondering what id do about the rest of my life and was insecure afraid and slightly depressed " finally he pushed himself to understand what got him to nantucket nectars and arrived at a rather amorphous answer passion "we were passionate about ice and pumping out sewage systems on boats juice was just one of things that we liked " mr scott says with plum tv he loves the civic nature of local tv even though its about as far from juice as you can get "i think the best entrepreneurs are like artists and painters " mr scott says "its about creating its not about business " likewise his partner mr first also fumbled at different enterprises including starting a grocery store until his wife said to him "youre bored stiff arent you " that set off a period of his own soul searching eventually leading him full circle what he loved most it turned out was what he had already done building a consumer products company so in early he launched o and the first bottles hit the boston market that spring mr first concedes that he sometimes feels the burden of re entering a field he once dominated consumers dont pick up o and want to drink it just because nantucket nectars was a big hit he doesnt have the "tom and tom" story he doesnt even have the other tom "i constantly think about how i was the cool guy at nantucket nectars a juice guy " mr first says "im risking going back into the same industry and being a loser " still mr first says hes slowly learning to use the previous success to grease wheels where he can grocery chains for instance believe if he can do it once he can do it again the same is true with investors "it gives me credibility " he says "and the fight is too tough to leave a weapon in the bag " ms bounds the wall street
