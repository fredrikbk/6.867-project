managing technology blog it and they may come small businesses find blogging can be useful but awfully time consuming a few months after launching a blog early last year get it in writing inc started seeing traffic to its web site soar today the small marketing copywriting firm in boca raton fla draws as many as unique visitors a month to its site compared with an average of only before the blog which features advice and trends on marketing and resides within the companys web site but allison nazarian the companys year old founder and president says all that traffic didnt lead to more sales right away in fact the sites sudden popularity even brought on a new financial burden "we ended up having to upgrade our web sites hosting plan so it could accommodate that level of traffic " she says now the number of new clients is finally on the rise as are sales she says so far this year of new prospects have come by way of the companys web site before the blog was launched it was and most new clients came through word of mouth and referrals sales also are up by so far this year from a year earlier she adds blogging is "worth it " says ms nazarian "but you definitely need patience " most owners use blogs which are easy to set up and require little technical savvy to drive people to their company web site but entrepreneurs also use them to get consumer feedback or answer commonly asked questions and some blogs serve as stand ins for web sites as a way to describe what a business does still getting people to visit isnt the same as getting them to buy "a blog can help you establish your credibility and expertise and that is what encourages people to click and buy " says debbie weil an author and corporate blogging consultant in washington d c "but it takes time achieve it you dont get instant high search engine rankings its a fallacy to think you blog and you sell " small business owners often create blogs to boost their company web sites search engine rankings high rankings can help draw more visitors to a site because people tend to click on the top results of a search first search engines rank blogs with fresh content higher than ones that are rarely updated says caroline melberg president of melberg marketing inc an online marketing firm in wayzata minn so the higher a blog is ranked the greater the chances of consumers finding it she says indeed fresh blog content has brought lots of visitors to ms nazarians site in addition to writing two to four brief entries on her blog each week she posts lengthy ones twice a month titled "amazing advertisements " these generate the most traffic she says and feature snapshots of clever advertisements from around the globe plus pithy commentary the company promotes the entries by submitting them to user generated social web sites such as digg com and reddit com which publicize online items recommended by members but coming up with compelling content on a regular basis for a blog can be time consuming ms nazarian says a contract employee responsible for internet marketing at her firm spends between one and five hours scouring the web for interesting ads to profile in just one "amazing advertisements" entry other bloggers are having better luck turning blog readers into customers since tracy l coenen started her blog fraudfiles in november she has seen a considerable boost in revenue for her private forensic accounting practice sequence inc the milwaukee based firms revenue rose last year from and is expected to climb this year from ms coenen says she spends about to minutes a day posting as many as three entries on her blog offering news and opinions about her specialty the blog is located within the companys web site www sequence inc com before the blog ms coenen says "i dont think i ever had a case that came to me because of my web site " she says she currently handles about cases a year and six have come from the blog since it launched she adds that each case generates revenue ranging from &# to &# tys toy box inc an online retailer based in erlanger ky has lured people to its blog about trends in the toy licensing industry by having other blogs and web sites link to it the company arranged a link exchange agreement in april with thetoyguy com a web site from toy industry expert chris byrne that features news and product reviews "we coordinated it so that occasionally our blog and chriss blog are about the same issue but from different perspectives " says george stolpe vice president of business development and media relations for tys toy box the two blogs link to each other in each post he says ms melberg says the links help boost a companys search engines ranking because blogs recommended by external sources rank higher than ones without link referrals according to mr stolpe tys toy box pays a free lance writer to maintain its blog and says the total cost for it is "a very minimal amount " he says while he cant quantify the blogs role in the near triple digit average growth in sales every year since its start he has no doubt it has played an important part for some businesses a blog isnt so much about bringing in new traffic to boost sales as it is about sharing information with customers and getting feedback in may michael hyatt chief executive officer of thomas nelson inc posted an entry in his blog michaelhyatt com asking for input on the cover design of a new book that the publishing company was preparing to put out readers were invited to select one of three images and the company went with the picture that earned the most votes but the commentary hasnt always been postive two years ago mr hyatt wrote about how thomas nelson which has about employees donated around bibles to victims of hurricane katrina several readers posted comments on the blog that criticized the effort including that donating resources such as food and shelter would have made more sense but mr hyatt who devotes about three hours a week to blogging says the reaction only bolstered the authenticity of his blog as a source of honest communication between the company and its customers jonathan ham an independent enterprise security consultant in missoula mont uses his blog to answer client questions that may be of wider interest he adds new entries to his blog located within his companys web site jhamcorp com about twice a month mr ham says hes under no pressure to write more often because he isnt concerned about boosting traffic to the companys site in some cases blogs are actually taking the place of a company web site take london based tailor thomas mahon whose blog called english cut is about the tailoring process or as he puts it "what happens when you order a suit for &# " mr mahons entries discuss his normal business routine including his travels to meet clients and photos of him cutting and stitching materials he says his web journal helps lend more credibility to his work than a web site could because he can profile projects as theyre being developed without the professional help he would need to regularly update a web site before launching his blog in late mr mahon who employs five subcontracted tailors says he landed all client accounts through word of mouth even though he had a web site which he has since abandoned now he gets twice as many referrals and has had to limit the number of suits he can produce a year to about previously he made between and suits a year ms needleman is a reporter for wsj com in south brunswick n j she can be reached at sarah
