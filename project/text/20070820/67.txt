running the show big fish smaller ponds to hook executives of large companies entrepreneurs try a variety of recruiting tactics linkedin corp had just moved to its mountain view calif offices last may when patrick crane visited to interview for the job of the companys head of marketing workmen were swinging hammers and cardboard was scattered across the floors but mr crane then a marketing executive at yahoo inc in nearby sunnyvale was intrigued by the idea of leaving a corporate giant to help build an industry leader "the place was a mess and that was part of the charm there was a sense that everyones sleeves were rolled up and that was extremely attractive " says mr crane who got the job at the four year old online networking service for business professionals mr crane is among a crop of executives at large corporations who are being lured to significantly smaller companies executives who make this move may sacrifice salary support staff perks and prestige but the small business chiefs recruiting them are finding that other motivators can attract big company talent such as greater responsibility a more collegial corporate culture the absence of bureaucracy and the chance to help build a business and cash in if a young company eventually goes public and in many cases theyre using personal salesmanship to seal the deal linkedin ceo dan nye says he tries to appeal to executives desire to make more of a mark than they might at a big company "i point out you have to years left in your career are you going to be the person who didnt take any risk and just lived a conservative quiet life but if you take this risk even if it doesnt work out youre going to feel great that you tried " tom szaky the year old ceo and co founder of terracycle inc a maker of organic plant food has hired several large company veterans at fractions of their previous salaries he finds it easiest to attract older executives looking for a second career who might have even taken a retirement package from their previous employer "people who dont really need the job but want to get back in the game " but he also recently hired a midcareer executive away from philips electronics nv to be vice president of sales mr szaky leans heavily on his vision of terracycle as an environmentally friendly company with a social conscience in his recruiting but he also sweetens the deal with stock options that anticipate the four year old company going public something he says it may do in five years alan johnson a compensation consultant based in new york says many executives moving to smaller companies hope that stock options ultimately will allow them to recoup at least five times what they sacrifice in salary but of course its a gamble one that depends on both the companys fortunes and the general direction of the stock market some small company ceos eventually conclude that they need to lure talent with big money derek mercer is ceo of vurv technology in jacksonville fla a employee human resources technology company he first decided to offer candidates greater compensation in when he wanted to promote the companys software and services to larger businesses with potential accounts over &# million "i have to compete with the big companies" for accounts of that size he says and to do that he felt he had to be more competitive with them on compensation "paying significant salaries was a big step for me " mr mercer first added a vice president of sales for a salary of more than &# and a bonus plan of up to based on achievement plus stock options subsequent funding from venture capital firms made the higher compensation more affordable today mr mercer offers a vice president of sales at least &# in base salary a bonus plan of as much as of salary and stock options before the company raised its sights the same position would have come with only &# in salary a bonus of up to &# and one third as many stock options last year the increased compensation was key as mr mercer recruited michael gibson from dell inc to become vurvs senior vice president of global sales and business development mr gibson hadnt considered leaving dell until a recruiter approached him about vurv he was intrigued partly by the companys clients which include goldman sachs group inc and coca cola co but he wouldnt have taken the job at a much lower salary he says unless the company gave him a significant equity stake something vurv wasnt offering money though is only part of the incentive for executives to move to smaller companies "its not always about the dollars its about what you do and the environment youre in " says holly nelson vice president of finance and controller of eos airlines in purchase n y the airline founded four years ago flies s between new york and london each outfitted for only passengers it pays competitive salaries but ms nelson still earns about less than she did as senior vice president controller and chief accounting officer for jetblue airways corp ms nelson who joined jetblue in was attracted by the opportunity to help build another airline "theres something special about it you make a much bigger difference on the ground floor " says ms nelson jack williams eoss ceo says that in recruiting ms nelson he was able to "articulate a solid vision of where eos could go from the space were in and convince her that theres a real opportunity to build out a lifestyle brand " eric smith who left his position as a sales director for philips electronics in to become vice president of sales for terracycle started with the new company at of his previous salary the stock options he received from terracycle helped cushion the blow but the companys eco friendly mission and social agenda also drew him terracycle packages its organic plant food in used plastic bottles some of which are gathered in collection drives at schools and it established its headquarters in the depressed inner city area of trenton n j creating some jobs for residents "the key is having executive candidates believe in the dream of what you want to accomplish " says mr szaky the ceo executives who move to smaller companies also often find that they can make a greater impact on the business in a shorter time than they could at their old jobs theres far less bureaucracy at a small business so decision making tends to be smoother and projects generally move quickly "its easier to get what youre trying to move into action " says samantha hanson vice president of human resources for vurv who previously was a human resources director for best buy co she developed a company compensation strategy within just days of arriving at vurv a task that often gets bogged down by the need for board input and approval at large public companies many executives also are able to move up the chain of command by moving to a smaller company like mr crane the new head of marketing at linkedin "going from being a leader to being the leader has huge appeal " he says mr crane also says he was swayed by the passion that mr nye the linkedin ceo expressed for his companys work an attribute that many large company executives cite as a reason for moving to a smaller business "one thing i found with dan and other members of his staff was a contagious enthusiasm a belief in a very singular mission " says mr crane terracycles mr szaky has had a similar effect on interviewees "i dont know what word i can use to finger what he is " says mr smith the companys new vice president of sales "but theres an aura almost when you meet the guy he makes you believe" in the companys mission a culture that keeps employees similarly enthusiastic can be another key in luring top talent vurvs mr mercer believes that the three former big company executives who joined his company last year were swayed in part by their visits to its offices the open floor plan with glass walls surrounding the few offices promotes teamwork he says shouts are regularly heard from the recreation room where employees play foosball and build camaraderie he says even small touches like the free meals linkedin provides daily for its employees can help make an impression the food enhances employees sense of value to linkedin and provides opportunities for outsiders including job candidates as well as potential investors from silicon valley to share informal meals at the company says mr nye he describes food as one small expense that quietly attracts interest by promoting the company from the inside out "when we create an environment that is casual and respectful at relatively small costs we attract retain and motivate exceptional people " he says ms barlyn is a writer in washington crossing pa she can be reached at reports wsj com
