a vacationing boss should take a break let staffers step up the president of a small manufacturing company in cleveland told his top marketing manager that he wasnt going to be reachable during a recent weeklong safari in africa but midway through the week the manager received a voice mail message from his boss inquiring whether he had completed a particular assignment and telling him which task to tackle next "i felt he didnt trust that i knew how to do my job " the marketing manager says "when he got back from vacation and i asked how hed managed to get a cellphone signal in the jungle he confessed hed programmed the voice mail message to me before he left " fed up with being micromanaged the manager quit shortly afterward taking a new job its vacation season but many executives not only limit themselves to breaks of just a few days they also continue to check in with employees and issue directives from yachts beaches and mountain resorts their refusal to turn off their cellphones and blackberrys means they are never relieved of work pressures no matter how remote or luxurious their vacation destinations in addition those executives who cant disengage from the office and delegate authority undermine employees confidence to make decisions and be creative "the most successful executives presume that employees will act in the best interests of their company and to their full potentials and dont need to check in with them all the time " says michael mankins a partner at consultant bain &amp co "those who cant step away and trust that decisions can be made without them never get the best work out of subordinates " lee macenczak executive vice president of sales marketing and customer service at delta air lines realized this when he traveled to israel last month with his wife and two daughters for his first weeklong vacation in several years during his absence he expected his six direct reports and thousands of employees to handle the daily crush of meetings and decisions "its important for me to spend time with my family and recharge especially now that delta has emerged from chapter " he says "and i have a great team of high performers who know perfectly well how to take care of our customers and operations " he admits however that he had to restrain himself from sending and answering emails "i checked my blackberry but tried not to work on everything and came home to a lot of unanswered emails " he says michael bonsignore retired chief executive of honeywell thinks executives should fear being indispensable a lot more than fear not being needed "executives go to all this trouble to recruit and train people so they should be able to really get away sometimes and nurture the management structure theyve created by leaving decisions to others " he says he sought to do this when he was ceo at honeywell by taking off three days at a time several times a year to pursue his hobbies of saltwater fly fishing and boating "my view of vacation was leaving work behind and trying to preserve the essence of my inner self " says mr bonsignore and because he maintained his interests outside of business throughout his career he believes he can now enjoy his retirement more than other former ceos who focused only on work he acknowledges that technology is making it increasingly difficult for executives to separate themselves from work and from their staffs even for a day on fishing trips to remote areas in british columbia mr bonsignore has observed executives they "step off the float plane onto the dock and the first thing they do is make sure their cellphone and blackberry are working " he says the fact that they can connect so easily to their offices and staffs from anyplace in the world makes it harder to choose not to engage dan amos ceo of aflac the georgia based insurance company says he was coached not to micromanage in a seminar he took more than a decade ago but he has learned along the way that some compromise is necessary for top executives who can hardly afford to completely disengage from work "you may say you dont want to be reached but youre expected by employees colleagues and superiors to be able to be reached " he says when he took a vacation to the arctic circle with his son a few years ago he took along a satellite phone on which he could be contacted no one called "but if there had been an earthquake in japan" where aflac is the no insurer "or some other cataclysmic event id need to know " he says he believes there is a plus side to always carrying a blackberry although he refrains from calling the office the minute he lands somewhere having the connection he says means he doesnt feel anxious or guilty for taking a long weekend because he can blend work and leisure still he says he keeps himself in check "i stick to a rule that says you can call me and i may call to do business about an issue on my mind but i wont call in just to find out what is going on all the time " email me at inthelead wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj com forums to see past columns go to careerjournal com
