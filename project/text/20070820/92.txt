toy recalls may push medical monitoring debate suits seek funds to test children before injuries show recent recalls of toys believed to contain dangerous levels of lead paint have raised a prickly legal question should families be allowed to sue toy makers and others before their children show any kind of injury already suits have been filed against toy makers mattel inc and rc corp but because the plaintiffs lawyers dont have evidence of physical harm the suits demand that the companies pay for medical tests for children through what are known as medical monitoring funds the suits rely on a legal theory that has gained credence in some states in recent years about states including california and illinois would likely allow such suits in light of a patchwork of state and federal court decisions say legal observers a roughly equal number likely wouldnt they say but the supreme court has cast doubt on the practice and toy related suits could further test the ability of plaintiffs to bring such cases medical monitoring is "among the greatest divisions in all of tort law among judges " says victor schwartz a washington d c attorney who believes medical monitoring suits violate a fundamental principle of the legal system that a person must prove injury before recovering money in class action cases involving thousands or millions of people he says medical monitoring could exhaust money that could be used to pay people who actually show some injury in the future "once you go down that path youre greatly augmenting the meaning of liability " he says richard bourne a law professor at the university of baltimore school of law says it is enough that plaintiffs prove future economic injury he says that companies should be responsible for the costs associated with getting medically tested particularly because many americans dont have health insurance waiting for symptoms to show up "is not in the best interest of the victim " he says courts around the country have been divided on the issue since at least the s in cases where cash is awarded some courts have required plaintiffs to document that money is spent on medical tests while others havent made such requirements courts can also appoint an administrator to oversee the disbursement of funds legal experts say plaintiffs might be able to pursue additional claims if injury can be proven earlier this month after mattel based in el segundo calif recalled hundreds of thousands of toys in the u s believed to be contaminated with lead paint an alabama mother filed a lawsuit seeking class action status in federal court in los angeles against the company and target corp which sells mattel toys alleging negligence and asking for funds to medically monitor children who "suffered an increased risk for serious health problems " in a decision californias highest court ruled that medical monitoring costs could be recovered if the need for monitoring is "a reasonably certain consequence" of exposure to a toxic substance a similar suit was filed against mattel earlier this month in federal court in new york where a federal court ruling in looked favorably upon the idea mattel rc and target declined comment costs in such cases can rise into the millions in one of the first toxic exposure cases that led to funds for medical monitoring in lieu of physical injury the new jersey supreme court in ruled in favor of hundreds of jackson n j residents who sued the town after pollutants contaminated its drinking water they were awarded &# million to cover costs for future medical tests on top of &# million for other damages as for the toy lawsuits it is unclear whether there is enough scientific evidence to prove to courts that monitoring is necessary physicians say a blood test should be considered for children who frequently put things in their mouths as studies in recent years have shown the negative effects of lead exposure at lower and lower levels lead if it enters the body can cause cognitive and developmental abnormalities particularly in children children could develop a hazardous level of lead in their blood in as little as a month after playing with lead paint covered toys says paul mushak a toxicologist and health risk specialist in durham n c who has testified for plaintiffs in lead paint lawsuits "kids get more intimate with toys orally than anything else " he says "if you have a toy train and it gets banged about and that lead paint starts chipping it doesnt take much for a kid to handle it and ingest it " in the u s supreme court ruled in a decision against a medical monitoring fund for a railroad worker who sued his employer because he was exposed to asbestos and feared he would develop related diseases the ruling was narrow in scope and not binding to the states but justice stephen breyer writing for the majority stated that the court was "troubled" by medical monitoring he wrote that medical monitoring would hurt plaintiffs "who depend on a tort system that can distinguish between reliable and serious claims on the one hand and unreliable and relatively trivial claims on the other "
