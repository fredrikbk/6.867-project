americas government failure in peru the water towers on the outskirts of lima peru say "water is health care for it " for many residents of villa el salvador one of the peruvian capitals famous sprawling shanty towns that admonishment is a cruel joke many have petitioned the government for water for decades to no avail one million of limas eight million citizens have no access to clean water the water monopoly which loses some of its water through leaky pipes or in ways otherwise unaccounted for is only one of perus monuments to government incompetence peruvians were reminded of another last month when the communist led teachers union went on strike paralyzing schools and triggering violence across the country the union was protesting a law requiring that teachers be tested and held accountable for competency an evaluation earlier this year found that one third of teachers are deficient in reading comprehension and that nearly half cannot do basic math the unions grip on schools is the main reason for the failure of public education according to the peruvian institute of economics which reports that half of year olds lack minimum reading skills in the end the union agreed to temporarily suspend its strike while it negotiates with the government those hit hardest by the crises in education and water poor peruvians are not reacting with complacency however they are demanding private solutions indeed during my visits to one of the poorest parts of villa el salvador in the past two years i learned why residents began marching on government offices to demand the privatization of sedapal limas state run water company community leaders and residents explained that theyd grown tired of being neglected by sedapal they have been joined by residents of other shanty towns surrounding lima in one such protest by hundreds of people from the shanty town of carabayllo at the ministry of finance last year adolfo pena olivos told the daily diario correo that "we represent families from squatter settlements that have not had water or sewage for more than years and many children and elderly have died because sedapal does not have the resources to alleviate our needs " limas marginalized poor are correct about the potential of the private sector to meet their water needs they can see for themselves how private companies have made electricity telephones and cable widely available in their neighborhoods as jose manuel saavedra head of citperu a local ngo wryly notes poor communities have internet access but no water the poor know too that the price theyre used to paying would fall dramatically with privatization water they now buy from unsanitary tanker trucks costs to times more than piped water in guayaquil ecuador a privatization carried out in has lowered the price of water by for poor people because their homes became connected to the formal network privately run water can also save thousands of lives as has been the case around the developing world including in argentina where child mortality dropped by in the poorest areas that privatized water by chance during my visits i learned that the rejection of state services has extended to education as well one day a woman in villa el salvador confirmed to me that the large building in the distance was a public school and volunteered that she did not send her son there instead he goes to a private school that charges a fee "it hurts but its well worth it " she explained somewhat surprised i then asked if many other parents there send their children to private schools she estimated that at least half do so standing on the dusty hillside overlooking the town with the putrid smell of human waste wafting through the air the mother pointed to building after building where private informal sector schools educate the poor as it turns out perus shanty towns are full of such private for profit schools yet to my knowledge the phenomenon has not been carefully studied the anecdotal evidence is however consistent with the pathbreaking work of university of newcastle professor james tooley who documented how private schools in the african and indian slums he studied have arisen to educate the majority of the children there mr tooley found that students in private schools performed notably better than those in public schools and private schools rated better on most indicators including teacher attendance the same seems to be the case in peru the one grade school i visited san vicente de paul offered classes to children at a cost of about &# per month its several classrooms were clean and orderly and looked well supplied the school even had computers connected to the internet and a small play area director ariela roques main complaint however was that her school lacked a property title thus inhibiting its expansion so it is that people in limas squatter settlements rely on their wits to overcome any number of obstacles thrown up by government their thinking is still as anthropologist william mangin one of the first to document the vast informal economies of limas shanty towns described it some years ago "similar to the beliefs of the operator of a small business in th century england or the united states work hard save your money trust only family members outwit the state vote conservatively if possible educate your children for their future and as old age insurance for yourself " even in a country where the government is dysfunctional and vastly larger than that of th century england those values can serve as a good development guide new spending of the kind president alan garcia has begun on water projects in villa el salvador will not do the trick as citperu points out peru cannot come close to spending the &# billion necessary to meet limas water needs unless there is private investment the governments new water pipes will mostly be running dry it is high time the government recognize the dignity of limas poor by trusting their solutions mr vasquez is the director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at the cato institute
