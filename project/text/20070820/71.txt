shenyang six freed when last we left the shenyang six in january the north korean refugees were being held in a chinese prison awaiting deportation back home where they faced the gulag or worse for the crime of escaping kim jong ils workers paradise their futures were especially grim because theyd been arrested after failing to reach safe haven at the u s consulate in shenyang pyongyang metes out harsh punishment to returnees who have associated with americans or christians so it is a rare joy to report that the six are alive and living safely in south korea in an unprecedented move the chinese government last month agreed to release the four women and two teen age boys they are currently undergoing seouls resettlement program for escapees from the north the shenyang six were rescued thanks to the efforts of the u s government which persuaded beijing to make an exception to its inhumane policy of repatriating north koreans captured on its soil the refugees had been arrested in shenyang before christmas along with two americans who were attempting to help them storm the consulate the americans were deported shortly thereafter beyond the happy ending for these six however lies the larger tragedy of the tens of thousands possibly hundreds of thousands of north korean refugees at risk in northeastern china here the u s efforts fall short there is much more it could be doing to turn an international spotlight on this imperiled population at the very least washington could speak out more forcefully against beijings policy of tracking down and repatriating the refugees that policy violates its obligations under the international convention regarding the treatment of refugees to which it is a signatory china wont even permit the u n high commissioner for refugees access instead the state department worries about rocking the boat in pyongyang and beijing it worries in particular that public talk of the refugee crisis might jeopardize the nuclear deal that north korea isnt adhering to anyway were told that five of the shenyang six wanted to resettle in the u s one is the mother of a boy who is already here but washington wouldnt go to bat for them with beijing the u s has accepted a mere refugees in the three years since passage of legislation welcoming north korean asylum seekers to the u s refugees are currently waiting in china russia cambodia mongolia and thailand for the washington bureaucracy to give the green light if the u s were to accept large numbers of north koreans as envisioned under the legislation it would send a powerful signal to china and neighboring countries that it was serious about helping them it wouldnt take long for the word to get back across the north korean border the u s also takes a softly softly approach at the u n which hasnt pushed china on its treatment of the north koreans it could exert more pressure too on secretary general ban ki moon who as a south korean has the moral authority to make this issue an international priority silence may not be an option for much longer as the worlds attention turns to the beijing olympics next summer the u s has to decide whether to use the opportunity to help expose beijings abuse of the north koreans within its border when jay lefkowitz u s envoy for human rights in north korea said as much in a speech in washington last spring the chinese embassy filed an official protest were glad someone was paying attention and hope beijing gets the message that freeing the shenyang six is not enough
