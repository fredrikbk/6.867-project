the fdas deadly dilemma life liberty and the pursuit of experimental drugs in response to ronald trowbridge and steven walkers aug op ed "the fdas deadly track record" the authors theory that "safe and effective" drugs are being denied to millions of patients has flaws that may stem from confusion about the nature of studies done in support of drug approval in the u s and about some essential concepts in statistics they raise the example of gleevec saying that "coming out of phase testing it was known beyond any reasonable doubt to be safe and effective " they also describe drugs that "had cleared at least preliminary phase testing" as having "obviously worked for some patients " phase trials cannot establish the safety and efficacy of drugs for many reasons a primary one being that these trials lack control groups asserting that because some patients get better after taking a drug it "obviously works" is a bit like asserting that because some seat belted drivers die in car accidents seat belts are obviously dangerous controlled trials are required for drug approval because statistics and history have taught us that without controlled studies the risk of new therapies often outweighs the benefit further they list the numbers of patients who "died waiting" for drug approvals " died without ever getting avastin" implying that had the fda approved the drug all those patients would have been treated with the new drug first do the authors believe that of patients who die of a disease would be candidates for or even want to take such therapy that more than a million patients about half of whom have cancer enter hospice care each year and in doing so forgo further therapy even with fda approved treatments surely proves this assumption to be mistaken the authors underlying argument that lay people with cancer should be able to do whatever they want if they believe it will help may be worth debating but the debate is not clarified by their writings michael s broder m d president partnership for health analytic research los angeles messrs trowbridge and walker mistakenly lead readers into believing that phase fda drug trials provide ample evidence of a drugs ultimate safety this is false the scientific process is in place for a reason and it takes through phase trials before we know if a new drug is equal to or better than the current standard of care even after that after market phase trials still uncover new risks e g vioxx avandia if you read the fda guidelines phase trials are usually conducted on very small sample sizes of healthy patients to simply determine safe dosages pharmacokinetics etc this is because drugs are normally being moved from animal studies to humans at this stage it takes phase trials to determine the safe human dose based on what you were giving the animal subjects matthew dobbs m d birmingham ala messrs trowbridge and walker make it clear that at root the fdas goal is not to save lives but simply to preserve its own power why else would they let people die rather than give them a chance to try potentially live preserving drugs what right has the fda to tell anyone whether they can try a new drug or not so long as there is informed consent congress should pass new legislation prohibiting the fda from interfering in private agreements between individuals and drug manufacturers let the fda publish any opinions about drug safety and efficacy it wants but then let each person decide for himself what actions to take edwin a locke westlake village calif in the spring of my wife jean began treatment with avastin along with other chemotherapy drugs she was one of the first cancer patients to be treated with this new drug after the fdas approval of it in february of that year jeans colon cancer had metastasized to two detectable spots on her liver in spite of previous precautionary chemo treatments with traditional chemo drugs she had been facing radical surgery on her liver and the possibility of a chemo "pump" being implanted in order to deliver chemo drugs to treat any possible recurrence after a treatment period of approximately three months with avastin the smaller of the tumors on jeans liver had shrunk to the point where it was no longer detectable by ct scan the larger of the tumors had shrunk to the point that rather than do radical surgery a minimally invasive procedure known as radio frequency ablation rfa was done in january in this procedure a probe is inserted to the site of the tumor and heat energy is used to burn the tumor away nearly three years later there has been no recurrence of the cancer to jeans liver on reflection i wonder what the outcome might have been if avastin had still been classified as "investigational " and denied to my wife for treatment of her cancer would she have become one of the patients who died because they were denied access to this wonderful drug the possibility makes me shudder michael j clarke baldwin new york the government has no right to forbid individuals from taking medicine they believe would benefit them the only moral policy the government can adopt is to let doctors and patients exercise their right to make their own choices doctors and patients do not need the fda to tell them what drugs and treatments are or are not appropriate for their particular needs pharmaceutical companies medical associations and other private organizations can provide the necessary data for doctors and patients to make informed choices david holcberg ayn rand institute irvine calif the authors raise a number of excellent points in their compelling criticism of the d c circuit court of appeals ruling against the abigail alliance for better access to developmental drugs with such heated rhetoric on both sides of this issue however its easy to lose sight of the fact that everyone wants the same thing expanded access to drugs under clinical investigation thats precisely why when i was at the fda we stopped calling clinical trials "compassionate use " it sounded too paternalistic allowing desperately ill patients into clinical trial programs shouldnt be an act of good will it should be an act of civil society but there has to be oversight by a responsible body that sets rules when it comes to pharmaceutical safety pure libertarianism isnt in the best interests of the public health expanded access to experimental drugs simply cant and shouldnt morph into total unfettered access that doesnt mean the status quo is working what it means is that the fda needs to figure out a way to dramatically broaden and facilitate expanded access to experimental drugs under its review and the abigail alliance and its supporters need to keep up the pressure to reform the current system peter pitts director center for medicine in the public interest new york for shame messrs trowbridge and walker imply that only the abigail alliance has taken action to advocate for or indeed has any interest in advocating for the early approval of important new therapeutic agents for cancer or other disorders this is a complete falsehood the international myeloma foundation made efforts over years to ensure that some of the drugs mentioned in this article were approved for the treatment of myeloma and that they were accessible to many patients who needed them through clinical trials before they were approved the argument recently presented by the abigail alliance was recognized for its lack of merit by the full d c district court of appeals which stated in its opinion that "the fdas policy of limiting access to investigational drugs is rationally related to the legitimate state interest of protecting patients including the terminally ill from potentially unsafe drugs with unknown therapeutic effects " then there is the outrageous suggestion that the fda is solely responsible for tens of thousands of deaths as a consequence of its decision processes the fda may not be perfect but this statement is a disgrace the american society of clinical oncology and the national coalition for cancer survivorship both presented amicus briefs to the d c court of appeals arguing against the position taken by the abigail alliance and the washington legal foundation as a year cancer patient advocate i am forced to wonder why the wall street journal continues to support this bizarre theory of a "constitutional right" to investigational therapy michael d scott member board of directors international myeloma foundation philadelphia
