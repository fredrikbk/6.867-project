the feds job blaming monetary policy for economic and financial market turmoil is a time honored tradition maybe the most famous bashing was in when william jennings bryan an original populist ranted against hard money and for inflation " we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold " monetary policy makes an easy scapegoat because printing money like drinking a cup of coffee is an easy way to give an economy a temporary boost but if what ails the economy or markets was not caused by tight money in the first place a temporary boost will not help it may cover up the symptoms temporarily but in the end it does not solve the underlying issue a lack of sleep in fact easy money always leads to greater problems down the road either rising inflation or a reduced sensitivity to risk as markets come to expect rate cuts to bail them out lately modern day william jennings bryans have been loudly calling on the fed to cut interest rates and inject cash into the banking system they believe more money would stop financial markets from seizing up any further this would make sense if money was already tight or to put it another way if a lack of liquidity was the real issue but trades are clearing banks are well capitalized commercial and industrial loans are growing credit worthy borrowers are getting mortgages and the economy is still expanding this was not the case after when communication lines were cut to the bank of new york a key clearing house for bond trades then liquidity injections were clearly needed trades failed and overdrafts mounted forcing the fed to inject hundreds of billions of dollars into the banking system in contrast the current turmoil in the financial markets has nothing to do with a lack of liquidity more importantly there is little hope that any liquidity the fed would inject into the banking system would actually get to the sectors of the market where only sporadic fire sale pricing of securities is taking place some are arguing that a sharp decline in the three month treasury bill yield to from roughly during the past few days shows the need for a huge infusion of cash that would force the federal funds rate down but the drop in t bill yields is a reflection of three issues a flight to quality a guess that the fed will lower rates at its next meeting and a very liquid market first fear and panic has increased demand for rock solid treasury debt driving prices up and yields down second expectations of fed rate cuts always push short term rates down but its a circular argument to say falling short term rates due to an expectation of fed rate cuts is any reason to cut rates finally the liquidity already sloshing around in the banking system must go somewhere and right now it is going into the t bill market low t bill rates are a reflection of the liquidity already in the system not a clarion call for more the real problem with the financial markets is that extreme leverage and extreme uncertainty have met in the subprime loan market no one knows how many loans will go bad who owns these mortgages and what leverage they have applied we do know that subprime lending is just of the &# trillion dollar mortgage market and delinquencies are running at about the alt a market is about of all mortgages and about of this debt is delinquent as an example lets take a very low probability event and assume that losses triple from here lets assume that of all subprime loans and of all alt a loans actually move to foreclosure then assume that lenders are able to recover of the value of their loans in this scenario total losses in the subprime market would be while total losses in alt a would be from this we can estimate a price for the securitized pools of these assets without doing any actual adjustment for yields or for different tranches of this debt the raw value of the underlying assets would be cents on the dollar for subprime pools and cents for the alt a pools getting a bid on this stuff should be easy right after all the market prices risky assets every day but this is the rub a hedge fund or financial institution that uses leverage of or more would be wiped out if it sold subprime bonds at those levels a loss on main street turns into a loss on wall street very easily but because hedge funds can slow down redemptions at least for awhile and because they are trying desperately not to implode they hold back from the market at the same time those with cash smell blood in the water patiently wait and put low ball bids on risky bonds the result no market clearing price in the leveraged asset backed marketplace additional fed liquidity cant fix this problem an old phrase from the s comes to mind "pushing on a string " in the s no matter how much money the fed pushed into the system it could not create a sustainable economic recovery that did not include a surge in inflation because high tax rates and significant government interference in the economy prevented true gains in productivity there is a lesson here populism is in the air these days and the threat from tax hikes trade protectionism and more government involvement in the economy is rising this reduces the desire to take risk congress is working on a legislative response to current mortgage market woes as well and as with the savings and loan industry forcing s&amp ls to sell junk bonds at fire sale prices and sarbanes oxley the legislative response almost always compounds the problems the interaction of an uncertain regulatory and tax environment with a highly leveraged illiquid market for risky mortgage debt creates conditions that look just like an economy wide liquidity crisis but its not a few rate cuts will not help what can help is more certainty tax cuts or at least a promise not to raise taxes and immunity or at least a safe harbor from criminal prosecution for above board institutions in the mortgage business could help loosen up a rigid market in a more permanent way than sending out the helicopters to dump cash in the marketplace the best the fed can do is to stand at the ready to contain the damage in this vein their decision to cut the discount rate and allow a broad list of assets to be used as collateral for loans to banks was a brilliant maneuver it increases confidence that the fed has liquidity at the ready but does not create more inflationary pressures it was a helping hand not a bailout it also buys some time which is what the markets need every additional month of payment information on mortgage pools and every mortgage that is refinanced from an adjustable rate to a fixed rate will increase certainty and provide more clarity on pricing even though many including alan greenspan continue to argue that the excessively easy monetary policy of was necessary it was this policy stance that caused the problems we face today the current financial market stress is a result of absurdly low interest rates in the past not high interest rates today in fact current interest rates are still low on both a nominal and real basis cutting them again causes a further misallocation of resources and makes the fed an enabler of the highly leveraged what william jennings bryan was really complaining about in was falling commodity prices especially falling farm prices what he and the other populists ignored was that these prices were falling because of productivity not tight money his "cross of gold" speech was a clear stepping stone to the creation of the fed in since then inflation has been much higher than it would have been under the gold standard but all that inflation never did save the family farm similarly even very easy money today cant put off the day of reckoning for subprime mortgage holders who bought homes with no money down and thought interest rates would stay low forever it cant help overly leveraged investors who thought they were getting risk free annual returns providing enough liquidity to allow markets to function while keeping consumer prices as stable as possible is the best the fed can do it should be all we really ask mr wesbury is chief economist for first trust portfolios l p
