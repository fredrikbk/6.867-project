love &amp money money and the second child syndrome a friend asked me recently about my year old daughter noting that he rarely reads about her in my column except in passing he has read a great deal through the years however about my year old son and he essentially wanted to know if i cared about my daughters financial future as much as i obviously care about my sons the simple answer is of course i do but as i thought more about his question i realized its more complicated than that the truth is that my wife amy and i are generally pursuing a different tack in raising our daughter when it comes to money matters and its one thats reflected in this column many of the things we did with our son we simply arent doing with our daughter and things we are doing were doing with less intensity it isnt in other words that amy and i dont care its that were battle tested we know what works and what doesnt and most important we know what we dont need to worry about this second time around like many second children everywhere our daughter in some ways is in for a smoother ride we arent nearly as protective as we were with her brother and we are substantially more laid back about the small stuff that once incited panic as first time parents this second child syndrome applies to financial issues as well i look back over the past seven years back to when my son was years old and i see many mistakes i made with regard to his financial education where i pushed him too hard where i didnt push hard enough where i worried he would grow up a financial incompetent where i worried hed grow up to be an enron executive all the twists and turns meant too much angst for me and no doubt for him as well with my daughter well there isnt nearly the angst on either our part or hers i pretty much know the road were on and i dont get hung up on the little bumps along the way a perfect example is her savings account she has one just like her brother but she wont know anything about it until shes probably years old maybe by contrast i began inculcating my son into the saving habit at or requiring him to save some of his allowance i also paid him to do extra chores around the house things like picking up his trading cards and legos or "helping" me rake the leaves i was intent on teaching him smart money skills as early as possible i could have been teaching my dog to sing for all the good it did saving as a concept didnt really gel with him until recently and only when he naturally became interested in it not because of my efforts to foist it upon him likewise we started our son on an allowance around the same age but that too was ill timed kids that young ive come to learn dont understand saving and the amount you dole out in allowance is too small to afford anything beyond throwaway items you end up buying for them what they want and then the whole concept of an allowance is warped for that reason our daughter is still several years away from her first family payday to be clear this doesnt mean my daughter is getting any less money than my son got along with the savings account we have for her weve opened and fund every month a college savings plan in her name nor does it mean that she isnt learning about money she most certainly is but shes learning in a way that has little to do with amy or me trying to move her in some particular direction instead shes learning as so many second children do by watching her older sibling just the other day for instance my daughter received &# in the mail from one of her great grandmothers she told amy that she wanted to put her money in the bank she has no clue she has a savings account she just thinks the bank is where you generally keep your money moreover she has her own version of a saving ethic now budding squirreling away her dollar bills and pocket change in a music box in her room all of this she learned from her brother and our interactions with him she wants to give her money to the bank teller because thats what she sees her brother do once a month she stashes money in her music box because she sees her brother stuff money into a wallet he hides in his room so that he has funds for those moments we go somewhere that sells something he might want when he digs out those dollars she often does too and takes them to the store im not implying any of this makes any sense to her at this age i know it doesnt my point though is that shes learning without our direction just yet shes learning without us putting on her the kind of pressure we put on her brother to save and to use his allowance wisely shes learning without us even thinking about it and that is why i have so little to write about her just yet jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal email lovemoney wsj com
