tom hermans tax tip time to donate stock winners this is the time of year when many americans suddenly rediscover their charitable giving instincts just in time to nail down valuable tax deductions but before you automatically write a check to your favorite charity consider an alternate method that may be smarter from a tax perspective think about donating stocks and mutual fund shares that have risen sharply in value over the years that way you typically get a deduction for the fair market value of your gift and avoid having to pay capital gains tax on the increased value of the shares over the years several donor advised funds tell me gifts of appreciated securities are up sharply this year and a recent report by fidelity investments says millions of other people could benefit from this practice "although stocks and mutual funds have become a common investment vehicle for most americans only a small fraction ever factor in their investment gains for the purposes of charitable giving " says steve feinschreiber senior vice president of research at fidelity investments "the added tax savings from donating appreciated securities over cash can be significant and applicable to many more americans who already donate to charity " mr feinschreiber says but before you do anything pay attention to the fine print you can deduct charitable gifts only if you itemize your deductions consider giving away stocks or fund shares in which you have large long term gains held more than one year if you donate securities with unrealized short term gains your deduction typically would be limited to your cost basis and dont give away your losers if you were thinking of getting rid of those losers anyway sell them use those losses to trim your taxes and give the proceeds to charity losses can be very valuable you can use those losses to offset capital gains on a dollar for dollar basis with no limit if your losses exceed your gains or if you have no gains you typically can deduct as much as &# a year of net losses against regular income additional losses are carried over into future years send your question to us at askdowjones sunday wsj com and include your name address and telephone number questions may be edited we regret that we cannot answer every letter
