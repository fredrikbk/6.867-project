new procedure repairs surface of damaged hips associated press washington doctors are beginning to offer a new alternative to hip replacement one aimed at younger athletic baby boomers who have worn out their joints too soon now they no longer have to wait until they hit their s for a fix it is called hip resurfacing covering a damaged hips ball and socket with smooth metal rather than cutting away worn bone and replacing it the operation hit the u s market last spring with food and drug administration approval of the british designed birmingham hip resurfacing system competitors are in clinical trials here and expect to clear fda later this year it isnt the first time orthopedic surgeons have tried resurfacing worn out hips but where earlier attempts failed data from europe suggest this latest approach uses longer lasting materials with the additional promise of a joint that may hold up to the heavy recreation of todays and somethings better than traditional hip implants "i do have people that call me and say my father had hip resurfacing in and it didnt work why are we doing that now " says michael j anderson an orthopedic surgeon in milwaukee who estimates that about of his hip implants now are resurfacings his response comparing todays resurfacing with yesteryears is like comparing a modern car to a model t not everyones a good candidate specialists caution resurfacing isnt for patients with thinning bones part of the joint could break or those who have poorly functioning kidneys that cant eliminate microscopic metal particles produced when the joints reinforced pieces rub together moreover while patients typically recover quickly resurfacing is harder to perform than a hip replacement and only a small fraction of the nations orthopedic surgeons so far are trained to do it but interest is growing as evidenced by a focus on hip resurfacing at next months annual meeting of the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons and a growing demand for hip repair from ever younger patients until now "you might have told someone to soldier on for as long as you possibly can " because a standard hip replacement before age is itself likely to wear out explains academy spokesman scott rubinstein of the illinois bone and joint institute with the new resurfacing option "people may be a little more aggressive" in treating younger creaky joints he adds more than total or partial hip replacements are performed each year a number growing as the population ages typically surgeons replace a hip by cutting off the femoral head the joints ball and replacing it with a metal ball mounted on a rod implanted deep in the thigh bone a plastic socket replaces the original those artificial hips can bring tremendous relief to people crippled by hip pain but the metal on plastic friction means the implants can begin wearing out in about years sooner if sports or other activities increase pressure on the joint for the average year old thats no problem a year old in contrast could very well wear out an initial replacement and have little thigh bone left to fit another "youre dealing with swiss cheese " is how hip replacement pioneer mitchell sheinkop describes the remaining bone enter resurfacing surgeons lightly shave the damaged femoral ball and fit a metal ball snugly over it that ball rolls in a metal cup reinforcing the socket the idea metal on metal shouldnt wear out as fast and if patients do need another replacement in or years the thigh bone is largely intact "this resurfacing initiative has interest because were sparing bone " explains dr sheinkop a rush university professor and joint replacement director of the neurologic and orthopedic institute of chicago whats the evidence the fda cited studies showing the birmingham hip resurfacer lasted at least five years approving its sale on condition that manufacturer smith &amp nephew inc continue tracking its endurance for years doctors differ on what age is the cutoff for resurfacing somewhere between and largely dependent on the patients bone strength nor do all insurers cover it the implant costs about more than a standard artificial hip adding to the &# tab complicating the choice is that surgeons call newer artificial hips ceramic on ceramic balls and sockets or tougher plastic designs good options for even the most active person just turning so resurfacing is emerging as a niche for the younger sports enthusiast marc wiener a chicago area internist chose resurfacing when his own hip degenerated in his s because it came with few restrictions on his activity dr wiener exercised before surgery to be in prime condition for physical therapy afterward and played holes of golf a month after his resurfacing hit the basketball court at seven weeks and the tennis courts in three months milwaukees dr anderson cautions that average patients shouldnt expect as much "if you find your exercise level can increase we like that but im not going to promise youll be playing doubles at wimbledon next year "
