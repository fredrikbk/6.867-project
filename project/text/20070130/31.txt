enterprise golf club designer hopes to repeat tv success infomercials are pricey but let upstarts reach audience directly there is something jesse ortiz learned the first time he designed a ground breaking golf club if you build a better fairway wood the world wont necessarily beat a path to your door make an infomercial about that club and play it often enough on the golf channel well that is a different story mr ortizs orlimar trimetal fairway wood became a phenomenon a decade ago with his minute spots now he is hoping to catch fire again with an infomercial for his new club for the fledgling bobby jones brand "the big retailers are getting bigger the smaller people that were willing to seek out a niche product theyre fading away " mr ortiz says " if you really believe youve got something special youve got to go out and tell the story yourself " the infomercial long the late night province of nostalgic music anthologies slimmer tummy tapes and kitchen and workshop wonders help small businesses break through brick and mortar retailers indifference by appealing directly to customers while at the same time letting companies monitor the effectiveness of their advertising in real time a half hour commercial usually airing on niche channels such as the sci fi channel or the food network averages &# to &# to produce not including the cost of air time according to george belch chairman of the marketing department at san diego state university that is a large chunk of change for many small companies he says make the right choice to deliver a highly tailored message with phone numbers and web addresses for immediate purchasing though and the "heavy liftings already been done you are targeting the right people " the first segment for mr ortizs latest club which cost about &# for production will begin showing on the golf channel next week annual sales of merchandise via direct response consumer television which includes infomercials as well as short commercial spots was an estimated &# billion in according to the direct marketing association ad spending on the direct response consumer tv was nearly &# billion that isnt to say there arent risks involved small businesses intent on using an infomercial often have to throw all of their marketing budget into the production and air time bobby jones golf co for example did &# million in sales last year but is spending half a million dollars on their infomercial for mr ortizs new hybrid which is designed to replace hard to hit long irons the price of products featured on infomercials typically less than &# is very important to enticing customers too high you will deter customers too low and you wont cover production costs music compilations magazine subscriptions and cooking utensils typically sell well as does fitness and athletic equipment mr belch adds the good news for small businesses is that infomercial structure is fairly basic says alan bernhard owner of alan bernhard creative enterprises a bedford n y company that produces infomercials for such clients as universal music and conde nast publishing for starters the storyline tends to be very simple and repetitive because viewers cant be expected to start watching from the beginning or sit through an entire spot mr bernhard focuses on thorough frequent product demonstrations that solve some sort of problem at a minimum he advises there should be at least three "calls to action " industry lingo for getting customers up off the couch to order the product credit card orders rather than cash on delivery are imperative to cash flow mr bernhard adds noting that it is a selling bonus if customers hear they cant get the product anywhere else the classic "not available in any store" line "thats maybe a cliche but its very important " he says "you want to have a product thats specially devised for television " what is more customer testimonials even ones by vaguely recognizable names paired with a charismatic host can add an extra punch for instance richard karn the next door neighbor al from the situation comedy "home improvement " is currently hosting a successful infomercial selling a collapsible ladder by wing enterprises a small company based in springville utah chuck norris hawking the total gym exercise machine is another popular product for his part mr ortiz has been through building a brand and selling it in front of the camera before as a teenager he helped develop his fathers company orlimar a compilation of letters from his familys last name and two of their first partners the business based in northern california didnt take off until the late s when mr ortiz developed the trimetal fairway wood to advertise the club now well received by professionals and civilians orlimar executives designed the companys first infomercial they spent about &# to create a minute infomercial and around &# in january for the first month of air time on the golf channel simultaneously they conducted a limited print advertising campaign up against industry giants callaway and titleist the company couldnt interest retailers the return on the infomercial investment was visible from the start mr ortiz says on a microlevel he could see that the time sales orders were placed over the internet or telephone coincided with the time the infomercial aired the company reinvested their earnings of &# from the first month to buy air time for another days before long the company was spending upward of &# million a month sales exploded as a result of the infomercial rising to &# million in from &# million in in all orlimar spent about &# million on air time and customers began seeking out the club at retail outlets prompting chains to place large orders after several decades with his family owned company mr ortiz parted ways with orlimar in he stepped away from club design for a spell before being lured back to the trade by the family of bobby jones the family which had licensed the great golfers name for a clothing line did the same thing for equipment in after signing on with mr ortiz the company took in &# million in sales in and started looking for ways to make a bigger splash in the mainstream consumer market so the bobby jones by jesse ortiz hybrid an early darling among critics turned to the infomercial strategy the company spent about &# to produce the minute segment they have budgeted &# million to &# million in airtime for the year the new segment follows the classic equation of a simple storyline and ample demonstrations featuring a variety of golfers on the pga champions tour including jay sigel and john jacobs who use the club during competitive rounds the pros will get paid nominal royalties based on the sale of the club mr jacobs who played on the pga tour from to says he was glad to participate even if he isnt an on camera natural "you just start yakking away " he says laughing "you feel like an idiot " still he admits to buying a club or two after watching other infomercials "im a sucker for all that stuff " corrections &amp amplifications actor richard karn played the role of al borland tim taylors sidekick on the television show "home improvement " a jan small business article on a golf club designer incorrectly said that mr karn portrayed the taylors neighbor on the program wsj feb
