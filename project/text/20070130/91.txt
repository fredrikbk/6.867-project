the afternoon report icahn comes calling motorola coughed up a gruesome decline in earnings for the final quarter of last year and though the cellphone maker is taking steps to get well a high profile investor may be mixing up harsher medicine chief executive ed zander explained the companys pitiful performance to investors with palms upturned motorola "didnt get it right " he sighed earlier this month in a conference call with analysts but the news that billionaire financier carl icahn who owns roughly a interest in the electronics company is now seeking nomination to its board of directors suggests mr zander could soon be discussing the travails of the cellphone business with an even tougher audience just what might happen next and when is unclear mr icahn offered no comments about his intentions and motorola still hasnt set a date for its next annual meeting when a vote on mr icahns nomination would take place despite motorolas struggles of late mr zander is still held in high esteem on wall street but warm fuzzies are one thing and prods from activist investors are another "corporate actions such as these are apt to be well received by investors " analysts at kaufman bros acknowledged and indeed motorola shares jumped motorola which is second only to nokia in handset market share aimed to grab an even bigger slice of the action by slashing prices on its popular razr phone but that plan backfired motorola moved more than million of the wafer thin phones after they were first introduced at the end of but its profit margins were squeezed down to in the fourth quarter from a much fatter in the third quarter furthermore by expending so much energy on the razr analysts worry motorola has stumbled behind rivals like samsung and nokia in the race to sell lots of pricey high margin phones for third generation networks those companies have managed to maintain their margins by selling phones that play videos and music and that ground may soon be even tougher to make up thanks to the new pound gorilla in the market apples iphone analysts at first global wrote recently that "apples ambitions in the high end phone business poses a serious threat to motorola on its home turf " such headwinds make motorola seem ripe for mr icahns brand of shareholder activism he has made a string of investments in companies like blockbuster and kerr mcgee and though he backed away from waging a proxy fight with time warner where he and mr zander sit on the board the company adopted some of his prescriptions the billionaire also turned his aim on struggling biotech company imclone systems which was facing bruising competition for its sole product the cancer drug erbitux he rained torrents of criticism on imclones directors and was elected its chairman last year however a humbled motorola isnt standing still it announced plans to slash jobs from its rolls in order to get its costs in line and has promised to shift its manufacturing strategy to repair the miscalculations that harmed it at the end of last year that could leave mr icahn little to agitate for stocks climb before fed announcement the federal reserve kicked off its two day monetary policy
