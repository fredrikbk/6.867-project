the middle seat new airline to link small midsize cities as big carriers consolidate flights at hubs expressjet will fly nonstop between destinations k c to raleigh direct a new airline will try to solve a frustrating conundrum for thousands of travelers how to fly nonstop between two small or medium size cities within the next week expressjet holdings inc a regional airline once wholly owned by continental airlines inc is expected to launch a new carrier under its own name that will focus on point to point service direct flights without herding planes and passengers through hub airports using seat jets expressjet will go to cities and fly only where there isnt currently any nonstop service routes like san diego to omaha austin to albuquerque sacramento to tucson kansas city to raleigh and new orleans to jacksonville ontario calif near los angeles will be the new airlines busiest city with nonstop flights to cities officials say exact schedules will be loaded in computer reservation systems later this week flights will actually begin in april with the full route network rolled out roughly west to east by may before the start of the summer travel season expressjet is pursuing a goldilocks strategy it wants markets that are not too small to leave planes empty not too big to attract nonstop competition but just right for a couple of flights a day with its small jets it hopes to connect dots that southwest airlines co and other major airlines cant afford to serve directly thus making it easier for business travelers and leisure passengers to reach second tier cities without the hassle and time of a connection at a hub "seat availability has become harder and harder for many communities " says james b ream chief executive of expressjet large airlines have increasingly focused on flying only into and out of their hub airports forcing many travelers into inconvenient connecting flights and reducing capacity for small and medium size cities in addition southwest long king of point to point airline service from medium size cities has increasingly put its new airplanes into big hubs like philadelphia and denver expressjet will launch with jets all passenger embraer aircraft repainted and refurbished with new gray leather seats and satellite radio service fares will run roughly &# to &# one way about the same as the price structure today it is trying to be a bit upscale to attract business travelers expressjet plans to serve free snacks sandwiches and cold pasta dishes have its own segment based frequent flier program and sell tickets online over the phone without added fees and through travel agents the new airline begins with solid financial backing since expressjet has another airplanes currently flying profitably feeding passengers to continental which spun off expressjet in still the risks are huge for every successful jetblue airways corp there are dozens of other carriers that tried and failed the department of transportation says it authorized new airlines flying scheduled service from to and by the end of had already shut down whats more another regional carrier with its own independent strategy failed a year ago atlantic coast airlines renamed itself flyi inc and started flying its passenger jets under the name independence air in june of flyi flew on the east coast from a hub at washingtons dulles airport trying to be a discount airline with some tickets as low as &# it attacked united airlines which has a hub at dulles on busy routes to cities like chicago and boston united responded sharply by adding flights cutting fares and battling fiercely and flyi lasted only about months before huge losses pushed it to liquidation expressjet says it can avoid flyis fate by staying away from hubs direct competition with bigger airlines and price wars the company has been studying the independent airline idea for several years and was pressured into this gamble this year when continental put some of its flying out for competitive bids and expressjet lost contracts for airplanes expressjet had the option of turning those planes back to continental but didnt want to shrink it studied whether it could create a business for the planes in mexico but decided the market was changing too quickly there it bid on putting the planes to work feeding passengers to other airlines but didnt land any business one market it did decide to go after is chartering flights historically chartering planes has meant corporate jets that carry six to people or so or old s and other airline jets that carry people or more the seat plane turns out to be a good size and far more economical for sports teams corporate shuttles and package tours for casinos and cruise ships so expressjet is taking of the planes continental gave up and using them to launch a charter fleet for the scheduled airline idea the rise in ticket prices over the past year and the cuts airlines made in capacity created new opportunity and made expressjets projections start to work "this is the first time the fare mix is where it needed to be " said chris warren senior director of strategic planning for expressjet "back in the fares just werent where they needed to be " in a way the new airline fulfills the original mission of the seat regional jet designed in the s and s to bring jet service to small towns instead over the past few years airlines have used regional jets on mainline routes drawn to lower labor costs at regional airlines or the benefits of replacing old gas guzzling aircraft "there are seat airplanes in this country and every one of them ended up flying into and out of a hub " says mr ream "no one has ever tried point to point with the regional jet " snubbing the hubs a new airline expressjet is trying to fill an underserved niche passengers who want to fly directly between small and medium size cities some details the carrier will fly between cities including san diego to omaha
