a u s law firm takes a new route into china for brand name law firms bent on global expansion china poses a conundrum economic activity is generating plenty of legal work but opening an office on the mainland is fraught with hurdles from a shortage of legal talent to regulations that limit the work foreign lawyers can do now a u s firm thinks it has found a way to build business in china while avoiding some of the burdens mcdermott will &amp emery a lawyer firm founded in chicago has entered into a strategic alliance with yuan da law offices of shanghai which has around lawyers its the first formal tie up between a western and a mainland china firm and a bold move given that regulations bar international firms from fully merging with chinese counterparts "the scale is far more than that of a start up " says harvey freishtat chairman of mcdermott which is making its first foray into the country under the alliance the yuan da firm will now be known for marketing purposes as mwe china law offices inside and outside china the firms will share clients for instance each providing legal assistance in their areas of expertise but to comply with chinese law mcdermott and mwe cant share the profit the u s firm must account separately for its work and the revenue it brings in the strategic alliance is structured so that mcdermott stands to reduce its costs if mwe increases the amount of work it does for clients mr freishtat says hes particularly pleased to avoid the headache of building a mainland operation from scratch many other big law firms have flocked to mainland china to advise multinational clients and snag new ones in the countrys burgeoning corporate sector last year foreign firms opened offices in mainland china about the same as in each of the two previous years according to legal consultant hildebrandt international inc when firms enter the market they mostly send partners to china and hire local chinese lawyers peter zeughauser who advised mcdermott and yuan da on their alliance says firms generally expect to invest &# million to &# million over three to five years to build a mainland office before they can hope to be in the black the problem isnt a lack of business last year saw &# billion in foreign direct investment into china fueling demand for cross border legal services in such areas as securities offerings deals and trade disputes chinese companies themselves are becoming increasingly attractive clients as they pursue public offerings and overseas acquisitions last year for example chinese companies raised &# billion in ipos on the hong kong stock exchange deals that because of hong kongs common law tradition and western style securities regulation create demand for international legal expertise many law firms have long served the china market from hong kong where it is easier for foreign firms to set up but firms are increasingly turning to the mainland to get better access to chinese corporate and government clients but mainland china poses particular challenges for these outside lawyers besides unfriendly regulations theres a shortage of top legal talent and there are clients who recoil at western billing rates for lawyers advice "you have a situation where people can appreciate makeup or starbucks and wont hesitate to pay for that but they are just starting to understand what it means to have a good lawyer " says carmen chang the palo alto based head of the china practice at wilson sonsini goodrich &amp rosati which has six lawyers in shanghai mcdermotts entry into the market stands out it is licensing its name to yuan da for a fee mcdermott is also investing in telephones and computers among other expenses for mwe china to fully integrate the new entity into its global network mcdermott has offices around the world mcdermott will send its lawyers to shanghai on a periodic basis and it will co host business seminars and share clients with its new business partner mwe china plans to represent multinationals as well as public and emerging chinese companies the mcdermott alliance took about months to ink in large part because of chinas vague rules governing foreign law firms enacted in the regulations bar foreign firms from practicing chinese law but allow them to advise on chinas "legal environment " foreign lawyers cannot issue formal opinions interpreting chinese law nor represent clients in a chinese court but some firms take the position that they can for example counsel a client about how they expect chinas environmental laws will evolve since mwe china will practice chinese law mcdermott cannot share in the entitys profits what it can do is boast to existing clients that it has on the ground legal expertise in china and thus hopefully ensure its clients dont turn to another western firm with an office on the mainland when they do business in china mcdermott will also gain access to mwes chinese clients and can team up with mwe in providing legal work to them though it cant advise on chinese law other foreign firms also routinely team up with chinese firms on matters requiring chinese law expertise but the firms enter these ventures on a more informal one time basis john huang a partner at mwe china says that before allying with mcdermott on an exclusive basis he worked with several brand name u s firms mr huang who previously founded allbright law offices of shanghai widely considered a top firm in the city left to form yuan da other firms may be slow to follow mcdermotts lead in part because they may prefer to have the flexibility to partner with any chinese firm of their choosing on a deal says xiaoming li a partner in the beijing office of white &amp case llp the mcdermott alliance requires the firm to use mwe china lawyers though the deal has been officially finalized some lawyers in china say this new kind of alliance could nevertheless rattle chinese regulators "it might be a hefty step into gray areas " says guy himsworth a london based consultant with hildebrandt last year the shanghai lawyers association issued a memo claiming that foreign firms had drafted contracts performed due diligence on chinese companies and offered other services that "far exceeded what is allowed" by law the memo caused widespread anxiety but it hasnt been followed by official government action "people scrutinize everything these days " says mr freishtat of the alliance "we go into this with a confidence that this is very much in keeping with the intent and direction of chinese law " one problem mcdermott avoids is recruiting despite its population of about billion china has only about full time lawyers according to the latest count the country long run by communist party fiat is still developing many of the basic foundations of a legal system western lawyers describe their ideal candidate to work in a china office as someone with a chinese law degree an international law degree from the u s or u k and a few years of practice experience with an international firm but such people are hard to find and much in demand "getting the talent is a constant struggle " says nick seddon managing director of dla piper llps asian practice the firm has more than lawyers in mainland china a mix of local hires and expatriates fees can also bring sticker shock lester ross a partner in the five lawyer beijing office of wilmer cutler pickering hale and dorr llp says last year he quoted a fee to a chinese manufacturer in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars for a trade matter the company countered with &# "we immediately declined " says mr ross
