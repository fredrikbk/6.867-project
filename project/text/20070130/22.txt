critic behind the curtain by force of thought irregular memoirs of an intellectual journey by janos kornai the mit press cambridge mass pp &# outside hungary and the precincts of professional economists janos kornai is not a household name "by force of thought " mr kornais memoir may not make him one overnight but it is a thoughtful account of an extraordinary life and a portrait of a certain kind of intellectual dissent too little written about from personal experience mr kornai was born in and raised in budapest in a prosperous assimilated jewish family his life changed abruptly with the outbreak of world war ii his father a lawyer had once represented german business interests in hungary he would be arrested and eventually deported to auschwitz where he perished one older brother was drafted into a hungarian labor battalion and died on the eastern front mr kornai himself managed to obtain a kind of passport which the swedish diplomat raoul wallenberg was distributing to jews armed with this document he was spared deportation and survived the war the traumas he experienced and the need to resist fascism led him to sympathize with the communist party and to join it a few months after the wars end for a time he was a sincere believer not only in the hungarian dictator matyas rakosi but in stalin as well the young mr kornai carried a "blind unconditional faith" in the soviet union in spite of the brutalities he had witnessed by liberating red army troops "political naivete and immaturity " he now writes coupled with moral "blindness and self imposed isolation " kept him oblivious to the repression around him for eight years he worked as a journalist for a prestigious newspaper writing on the economy but along the way he talked with an old friend who had been tortured by the communists an experience that helped to open mr kornais eyes following stalins death in hungary began to experience political turmoil within the communist party itself leading to a purge at mr kornais newspaper he was dismissed as an anti stalinist and rightly so by then he had relinquished his belief in marxism he embarked on a career as a professional economist defending his dissertation just weeks before the hungarian revolution in the fall of mr kornai was among the advisers to the imre nagy the doomed leader of the hungarian government who sought to free the country from soviet domination once soviet tanks intervened and crushed the revolt mr kornai found himself in a precarious position but unlike tens of thousands of others he decided to remain in hungary come what may and pursue his career as an economist he was monitored by informers and repeatedly interrogated he was dismissed from his research institute for lack of ideological conformity he was forced to denounce a friend who had escaped to paris an act that he found "oppressive and degrading " mr kornai decided in the late s to stay clear of politics and focus on research his book "overcentralization" was the first by an economist behind the iron curtain to examine the command economy of "actual socialism" and to criticize central planning surprisingly the authorities allowed it to be published in hungary although naturally it was attacked in the press an english language edition of the book appeared soon after from a british publisher mr kornais international career was launched by he was allowed to travel to cambridge england where he attended an academic conference and conferred with western colleagues he later became the first economist from an eastern european country to work as a researcher at the world bank over the ensuing decades mr kornais books and lectures in europe north america and asia established him as one of the leading scholars of socialist economics and an expert on the difficult transitions that many countries face when they move from socialism to a more democratic and capitalist system some of this expertise is on display in "by force of thought " in passages that professional economists may savor more than the general reader at one point in under the more relaxed rule of janos kadar when hungary was the "most cheerful barrack in the camp " mr kornai and his wife decided to build their own home over the course of several months they personally confronted the corruption endemic shortages and shoddy construction materials that were so common in eastern europe a year later on a trip to india mr kornai was faced by idealistic young maoists whose concern for the desperately poor reinforced their support for socialism mr kornai responded to them by arguing as he puts it here that "rationing systems that spread misery equally may assuage feelings of injustice for a while but they will not solve anything " that is not to say that mr kornais views match up perfectly with milton friedmans he retains respect for karl marx as an economist and pointedly notes the "morally nasty features" of capitalism he is obviously not an intellectual meant for strict orthodoxies of any kind nearing his ninth decade janos kornai continues to enjoy a fully engaged and independent career he is back in budapest full time after years of spending months at a time at western universities particularly harvard his memoir shows just how much can be accomplished by force of thought even when political forces do so much to oppose it mr rubenstein the northeast regional director of amnesty international usa is the author of "the kgb file of andrei sakharov "
