democrats craft spending bill as deadline looms washington democrats put the final touches on a &# billion spending bill designed to keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year and bridge the gap left by the collapse of the budget process last fall never before in modern times has congress attempted this type of streamlined funding resolution on such a large scale the bill touches almost every corner of the government down to securities transaction fees charged by federal regulators and even lawmakers pay reflecting the new democratic majority the largest funding increases would go to veterans medical care pell grants for low income college students law enforcement and fighting aids and malaria overseas the white house appeared receptive to much of the package but it would have to accept an almost &# billion cut from its fiscal request for military construction and base closing funds "we know this is not going to be enough to sustain the government for the balance of the fiscal year " said mississippi sen thad cochran the ranking republican on the senate appropriations committee "i dont know anybody who would pretend otherwise " faced with a feb deadline speed is essential and the house is scheduled to vote tomorrow without a formal committee markup the senate will be more of an obstacle and democrats hope that concessions to conservatives and weeks of negotiations with federal agencies will hasten action there as well both parties have a stake in resolving the crisis now republicans complain of the rushed schedule but are embarrassed for failing to complete spending bills last fall leading to the current predicament the white house wants relief for agencies operating since oct under a stopgap funding bill a situation that has become untenable for major cabinet departments such as justice that stopgap measure expires feb and rather than extend it again the new house appropriations committee leadership will craft a long term streamlined funding resolution to carry the government through the end of the fiscal year sept the basic funding formula calls for continuing agencies at spending levels after first stripping out one time emergency funds account by account the legislation then cuts and adds by creating scores of exceptions to meet agency needs and fill a gap of &# billion to &# billion before reaching the &# billion total that number was chosen to conform to president bushs budget for this year and appeal to white house support in addition a temporary moratorium is imposed on any spending earmarks for lawmakers and the bill would freeze congressional pay at &# and deny members a scheduled adjustment next month major additions include &# billion for veterans medical services and &# billion for education and health programs the national institutes of health budget would grow to &# billion a &# million increase and an additional &# million is provided for community health centers among education accounts funding for title i reading and math instruction for low income public school students is increased by &# million an additional &# million is provided for pell grants to low income college students money that will help raise the maximum annual grant by &# to &# law enforcement is a third priority with an estimated &# billion increase including an additional &# million for the federal bureau of investigation once emergency funds in are excluded within foreign aid accounts an estimated &# million is provided to fight malaria a &# million increase and the measure is expected to at least match the administrations total request to fight aids though the geneva based global fund would receive a greater share &# million a &# million increase and twice what the administration had requested the military will get about &# billion less than it wanted to help close military bases and relocate thousands of troops to the u s from posts in europe and asia across the board many agencies will be effectively frozen at their appropriations with only a modest increase in personnel funds to cover half the cost of scheduled federal pay raises this year about the securities and exchange commission will find itself still below the &# million requested by the administration but the bill allows the agency to go ahead with a promised reduction in transaction fees that has been delayed because of the budget breakdown those fee reductions had been tied to passage of the agencys "regular" appropriations bill for fiscal but there has been nothing regular about the budget process of the past months the legislation now spells out that for the secs purposes this bill meets these requirements meaning that upon enactment the agency could proceed with the delayed reductions the reductions include a proposed cut in fees for transactions on stock exchanges and over the counter markets to &# per million dollars from the current rate of &# per million dollars while the final text wasnt public last evening the changes look to be applicable to future transactions only
