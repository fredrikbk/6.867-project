what living organ donors need to know even as transplants surge data on long term impact on givers remain scant with demand for organ transplants far outstripping the supply of deceased donors the hunt for friends family and even strangers willing to donate a kidney or piece of liver has never been more intense but as the number of living donors rises so has concern that donors themselves face significant medical psychological and financial risks in all more than people became living donors in triple the number of just a decade ago in many cases relatives volunteer in others patients set up web sites and monitor the internet in search of altruistic strangers and sometimes they find them amid this growth many patient advocates and bioethicists say that hospitals and federal agencies arent doing enough to inform living donors of the consequences of giving a piece of themselves complications can include a wide range of medical problems from infections and bile leaks to pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis some donors report feeling dejected if the transplant fails or ignored after all the attention surrounding the surgery and while surgery is covered by the recipients health insurance donors are responsible for medical problems down the road so its essential that they have their own insurance there is a move at some of the nations transplant programs to better screen and prepare potential donors but critics say that national efforts to protect living donors have lagged behind the science that makes the transplants possible living kidney donation first performed in has proved safe for most donors though some do suffer from hernias and other problems kidney donors are known to have later needed transplants themselves out of more than live kidney transplants from to in the u s for liver donation a more recent medical advance there is less information available two national studies in the past year reported that more than one in three liver donors experience at least one medical complication during surgery or in the months or more after more than a dozen liver donors have died world wide after donation from complications resulting from the surgery beyond these statistics there are no good long term data on how liver donors fare medically or how donating a liver or kidney affects quality of life employment and finances there is little tracking of organ donors over extended periods a federal advisory panel on organ transplantation the institute of medicine and an informal band of donors turned activists have called for the creation of a national registry to follow how donors fare they have also recommended the creation of donor advocacy teams at all transplant programs to protect potential donors "if youre going to keep doing the surgery you have an ethical and moral obligation to find out how these patients are doing " says donna luebke a nurse practitioner in cleveland who lobbies for greater protections for living donors ms luebke who gave her sister a kidney in is a former member of the living donor committee of united network for organ sharing a private group that oversees the nations transplant system under contract with the department of health and human services to be sure many if not most living donors have positive experiences and few if any lasting medical problems many donors feel great joy in having helped save someones life and encourage others to consider live donation as well "sure it is scary going into it but it is also a relatively safe process that gives donor recipients a second chance at life it is truly a miracle " says miles fawcett of washington d c he donated a piece of his liver to his month old daughter this month of the more than people who became living donors in the latest year for which complete figures are available the vast majority gave a kidney about people gave part of their livers the larger of two lobes is removed when the recipient is an adult while the smaller lobe is taken for a child within weeks both pieces grow large enough to do the work of an entire liver a handful of people gave lobes of their lungs or other body parts driving the surge is the lengthening waiting list for organs amid an increase in chronic disease such as diabetes and transplantation advances that make the surgeries more popular ten years ago fewer than people were on the national transplant waiting list today that number is approaching at the same time medical advances have fueled living donation kidneys can now be removed by less invasive laparoscopic surgery for instance but bioethicists and other experts worry that there are inherent conflicts of interest in the living donation process some hospitals concerned with saving the life of the recipient arent focused enough on the donor critics say and transplant surgeons earn money and prestige with every surgery giving them an incentive to recruit donors to protect donors patient advocates and federal advisory panels have urged increased safeguards for one they want independent donor advocacy teams at all transplant programs made up of surgeons psychologists and others who arent involved in care of the recipient and whose mission is to ensure that donors are medically suitable understand the risks involved and arent pressured into donating hhs is now considering mandating these teams with a final regulation expected in coming weeks most living liver donor programs have such teams though it is unclear how many have been adopted for kidney donation which increasingly attracts anonymous and other volunteers with only loose relationships to the recipients even donor advocates dont always catch red flags in laura odom donated half of her liver to her sister in law at northwestern memorial hospital in chicago she went through the hospitals donor advocacy program which aims in part to ensure that donors have a plan in place for care after the surgery ms odom who at the time had three children under the age of including a month old baby told them she would rely on her husbands help after surgery but she says the recovery turned out to be far more difficult than she anticipated and that she felt woefully unprepared unable to change diapers fix bottles or lift her infant son on her own "i was crying all the time " mrs odom says her wound broke open her husband could get only one week off from work he wound up having to repeatedly leave work to help her and eventually lost his job and the familys health insurance creating a financial crisis after about nine months she started feeling better and is doing well today says mrs odom who lives in wheaton ill but she says she feels northwestern memorial should have known that her plan for aftercare wouldnt be sufficient and she felt abandoned by the hospital when she sought help she says she was told to come back to the hospital for follow up but she couldnt afford the transportation and child care so that was the end of it northwestern memorial officials wouldnt comment on the specifics of mrs odoms case but in a statement the hospital noted that medical literature has documented that "living donors feel abandoned because so much attention is paid to them during preop and then they feel abandoned postop " as for predicting the need for follow up care the hospital said that when a patient says he or she has adequate care in place "there is an assumption the patient is telling us the truth " one of the hardest things for potential donors can be the lack of good data about how donors fare four years ago the federal advisory committee on organ transplantation urged hhs to set up a registry to track donors in may the institute of medicine issued the same recommendation but hhs hasnt moved to set up a registry "if we do a registry were going to have a registry largely of healthy patients who perhaps dont want to be bothered " says james burdick director of hhss division of transplantation he says he is working with the national institutes of health to survey a sample of donors five and years after surgery to see how they are doing the united network for organ sharing or unos hasnt followed through on a donor quality of life survey ordered by its board officials cite lack of funds while unos asks hospitals to track donors for two years in a recent one year period hospitals failed to keep track of of kidney donors and of liver donors the group has taken some modest steps it recently began requiring hospitals to report any donor death or organ failure within hours living donor liver programs are now required to prove that surgeons meet certain qualifications absent comprehensive tracking data there is little agreement on long term complication rates for living organ donors a conference of more than experts who met in vancouver in may and reviewed data from around the world found that of liver donors are likely to have complications including pneumonia renal failure and repeat surgery the time frames for follow up varied among the research examined but most complications arise shortly after surgery data from a national study that reviewed a sample of liver donors from to found a similar complication rate of with a median follow up time of six months but organ donation programs dont always offer up such statistics in interviews with surgeons at the largest living liver donor programs half said they cite statistics in the range the other half said they avoid overall percentages or cite a lower rate they offered different explanations for what they tell patients mount sinai medical center in new york generally doesnt give any percentages when talking to donors sukru emre who heads mount sinais program says that he isnt confident in the figures and that every patients experience is different the university of minnesota tells potential donors that the national complication rate is to says abhi humar director of the living donor program who participated in the vancouver panel "its difficult to classify what exactly is a complication and whats not " dr humar says "saying its exactly is being a bit rigid " he added he thinks it is more important to talk about complications that his program has seen at the lahey clinic in burlington mass however elizabeth pomfret tells potential donors that the complication rate is to she adds that to of all donors have major complications and that a few have died "there is a small but real possibility something horrible could happen " she told members of a family considering donation last year "this is a big big deal type of surgery "
