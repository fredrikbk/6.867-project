investors bombarded by index fund choices but many of latest offerings stretch definition of index warnings of increased risks index fund investors known to take a hands off approach to their money are now being asked to make some big decisions and possibly take on more risk index funds traditionally have aimed to mirror the performance of broad market benchmarks such as the standard &amp poors stock index or the dow jones wilshire composite index this made the funds relatively predictable since investors could expect to closely track the markets return minus a small slice for management expenses another attraction index funds have historically outperformed the majority of funds that rely on a fund managers active stock picking now however investors are embracing a slew of new specialized funds that have exploded the idea of what an index fund is meant to track fund companies aiming to differentiate their offerings and levy higher fees are slicing and dicing the market in various new ways many of these "alternative" index funds are less than a year old and have yet to establish a meaningful track record some firms are even inventing new indexes to track wisdomtree investments inc offers dozens of exchange traded funds essentially mutual funds that trade like stocks that track indexes composed of dividend paying stocks generally the bigger the dividend the more weighting the stock has in the index vtl associates llc is planning to launch three etfs that track indexes weighted by the size of company revenues thats a big departure from traditional indexing which weights stocks based on their so called market capitalization or total stock market value other funds target indexes focused on narrow market niches including the newly launched powershares buyback achievers portfolio an exchange traded fund that invests in companies buying back their own shares and the claymore ocean tomo patent etf which buys stocks of companies based on the value of their patents yet many financial advisers and industry experts fear that the alternative index funds sacrifice many of the traditional benefits of indexing including low cost broad diversification and simplicity experts also see risks to investors in many of the new funds that track narrow volatile market segments such as commodities and currencies some funds employ complex financial products such as derivatives or use borrowed money which can juice returns on the upside but also amplify downturns fees are also an issue many offerings from wisdomtree and powershares capital management another major seller of alternative index funds charge expenses of roughly to of assets while that makes them cheaper than many actively managed mutual funds they are more expensive than some traditional

alternative index funds aim to solve what their proponents say is a basic problem with market cap weighting as a stocks price climbs market cap weighted funds must buy more shares forcing them to

get better returns index strategies "dont have to be market clones " says robert arnott chairman of research affiliates llc which offers indexes based on a variety of company fundamentals including revenues and dividends one alternative is to weight all the stocks in an index equally morgan stanley for instance offers an s&amp p fund that gives each stock equal representation instead of

weight youre really just dialing up the small cap factor " says david yeske a financial planner in san francisco while small cap stocks have outperformed large companies in recent years theres no guarantee theyll do so in the future whats more equal weighted funds may come with higher expenses and less tax efficiency than traditional index funds as stocks prices change their weighting in cap weighted indexes generally remains the same so little trading is required but equal weighted indexes must trade more as stock prices move which drives up transaction costs more trading also increases

debate about how much the dividend is " says jeremy siegel a finance professor at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school and wisdomtrees senior investment strategy adviser the problem counters
