for mcdonalds its a wrap created by chef dan coudreaut chicken snack is a hit shows new approach to menu items oak brook ill dan coudreaut trained at the culinary institute of america and has performed gastronomic feats in a variety of kitchens including that of the four seasons hotel in dallas but the creation that has had the greatest impact on the nations palate started two years ago in the test kitchen of mcdonalds corp where he has been director of culinary innovation since responding to a request from management for a new chicken item that would appeal to mcdonalds growing number of drive through customers mr coudreaut pronounced of koo drow huddled with helpers in the companys stainless steel test kitchen and came up with different ideas when an invention called a "tacadilla" sank in consumer tests mr coudreaut turned to a simple alternative he took breaded chicken used in the restaurants chicken selects strips topped it with shredded cheddar jack cheese and lettuce added a few squirts of ranch sauce and wrapped it in a flour tortilla mcdonalds called it a snack wrap and put it on the menu for &# after six months the snack wrap has become one of the most successful new product launches in the history of the golden arches early sales have exceeded company projections by the company says that today it plans to add a version with honey mustard sauce and make both wraps available with grilled chicken years ago mcdonalds relied on creative franchisees to concoct new items in the back of their kitchens restaurant owners invented the big mac the egg mcmuffin and other favorites now mcdonalds uses a far more sophisticated system led by mr coudreaut that has increased the variety and ambition of the menu mr coudreaut borrowed edamame a type of soybean served in sushi restaurants to create mcdonalds asian salad and he buys experimental ingredients at ethnic groceries he winnows as many as ideas a year down to a handful of items that must be tasty inexpensive and easy to prepare known at headquarters as "chef dan " the year old was lured to mcdonalds by a headhunter "you can impact people a night at the hotel or million a day at mcdonalds " he says "its an easy decision " after he arrived he redesigned the companys test kitchen with upscale touches like granite countertops the company made him a white chefs jacket finding products that work inside a mcdonalds has been tricky mr coudreaut considered adding a shrimp salad to the menu but couldnt because he says mcdonalds would need to use so much shrimp that it threatened to deplete the nations shrimp supply new items must be simple for unskilled cooks to make and assembled fast enough to meet mcdonalds target of serving customers in less than seconds the idea for the snack wrap started when a franchisee suggested that mcdonalds find a way to use more of the meat for its chicken selects strips of chicken served with dipping sauce moving more chicken through the restaurant would allow each restaurant to cook new batches more frequently which means customers get a fresher product the chain also wanted an item that would draw customers between meals "the idea was there were times when our consumers tell us they want something thats substantial but not so filling " says ubong ituen senior director for product marketing at mcdonalds u s division mr coudreaut huddled with his four person team which includes a sous chef who helps prepare items and invited experts from mcdonalds suppliers to brainstorm one idea stuffing the chicken inside a tortilla with melted cheese to make a cross between a taco and a quesadilla chefs cooked up the taco and quesadilla combination and liked the way it tasted they named it a tacadilla and tested it with customers patrons didnt like it mr coudreaut stayed with the idea but instead of melting the cheese kept it in a shredded form he added ranch sauce to give it a flavor thats distinct yet has broad appeal including lettuce that left the wrap with five ingredients all of which were already used in mcdonalds restaurants customers who tested the snack wrap liked it "you dont have to have ingredients in something to be great " mr coudreaut says workers make it in as few as seconds seeing high gasoline prices that threatened to slow consumer spending mcdonalds rushed the snack wrap into restaurants last year in six months as opposed to the months to two years it typically takes to launch a new product research by the chain found some customers eat as many as three in one sitting as a meal meanwhile mr coudreaut began working on the next version he modified a honey mustard dipping sauce used for the chicken selects and substituted grilled chicken for the breaded chicken used in the first wrap mcdonalds has been making mr coudreaut more visible as part of a broad effort to convince customers it serves wholesome food after books like "fast food nation" criticized the quality of its ingredients the chain used to closely guard its kitchens and suppliers but has been making them more transparent to rebut the criticism in another step the company confirmed this week that it has selected a trans fat free oil for its french fries although it has yet to put it in most of its restaurants inside the test kitchen mr coudreaut keeps a refrigerator stocked with the cheese lettuce yogurt and other ingredients used in mcdonalds food when he wants to experiment with an ingredient thats not used in the menu basil for instance he picks it up at a nearby grocery the asian salad mr coudreaut invented has helped bring in more female customers but his spicy chicken sandwich was dropped from the core menu last year after mediocre sales franchisees still offer ideas for new items but mcdonalds officials say its been several years since theyve put any of them on the menu "you probably cant renegade quite as much as you could in the old days " says david peterson a santa barbara calif operator whose father herb peterson invented the egg mcmuffin in the early s more recently the elder mr peterson year old tried to persuade mcdonalds to put oatmeal on the menu so far it hasnt been added
