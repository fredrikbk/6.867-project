a cultural conversation with clive gillinson carnegie halls leader is broadening its reach new york early in his year tenure as managing director of the london symphony orchestra clive gillinson regretfully informed then principal conductor claudio abbado that a costly mahler festival would have to be scrapped mr abbado ultimately persuaded him of the projects importance and inspired him to pursue new funding sources "artistically the orchestra ended up a million times better than if we had done something more practical " recounts the year old mr gillinson now executive and artistic director of carnegie hall during an interview at his airy seventh floor office about a week ago "we even wound up financially better it was a great lesson money follows vision not the other way around " ever since mr gillinson arrived from london to take up the carnegie post in july classical music observers have been waiting to hear his vision for the hall unmatched among american music presenters for cachet historic importance and name recognition yesterdays announcement of carnegies season held onstage in its elegant main auditorium provided some answers at a time when many classical institutions are tightening their belts mr gillinson is broadening the reach and scale of the halls operations he had already showed a more activist approach to education in his first major initiative a performing and teaching fellowship program announced last fall with the juilliard school and the new york city department of education "this provides a template for how departments of education could work in other cities " mr gillinson commented during a question and answer session following the announcement continuing the collaborative theme carnegie will present its first major interdisciplinary festival "berlin in lights " a &# million day undertaking this november in partnership with other institutions the festival has at its core an eight day residency of the berlin philharmonic conceived during the tenure of his predecessor the late robert harth it has been enlarged under mr gillinsons aegis to encompass world music film architecture and panel discussions exploring berlins rebirth since the reunification of germany "berlin is a place where culture is leading the regeneration of the city " mr gillinson says "its absolutely at the cutting edge of ideas " at carnegie a variety of ensembles will present everything from baroque and contemporary works to re creations of german dance music from the s and s by the max raabe palast orchester complementary activities include a week of recent german films featuring contemporary berlin as a main character at the museum of modern art cabaret in the period cafe of the neue galerie a small museum of early th century austrian and german art work by young berlin photographers at the goethe institut a german cultural center and an exhibit contrasting berlin and new york cityscapes at the center for architecture headlining the festivals educational component the berlin philharmonic will serve as "pit band" when schoolchildren from upper manhattan dance in a choreographed performance of stravinskys "rite of spring" at the united palace theatre a restored vaudeville house one of the ideas behind the festival as in a recently finalized programming partnership proposed by nearby city center is to entice cultural consumers from one hall or artistic genre to another city center presents dance and theater beginning in fall the two organizations will link their programs in specially created annual thematic festivals officials say no cost or revenue sharing is involved the carnegie presentations in will maintain the current seasons level of about events up from about in and about a decade ago the exciting news that gifted british composer thomas ades assumes the position of composers chair was tempered by the announcement that the holders tenure will now last one season instead of four in my view this dilutes the significance of the position which has not only involved showcasing the music of recipients but allowing them to curate some contemporary music concerts asked at the conference to elaborate on the reasons for the change mr gillinson said he wanted to look beyond the classical genre to give more composers particularly younger ones a chance at the honor clive gillinson was born in bangalore india but raised largely in britain mr gillinsons first appearance at carnegie hall was actually in as a member of the london symphony orchestras cello section a position he held for years during that time he helped run an antiques shop with his wife and served as finance director of the self governing lsos board at a moment of financial crisis the board asked him to act as temporary managing director while it sought a professional candidate after three months it offered mr gillinson the job entrepreneurial and astute he soon had the orchestra in the black helped improve its artistic standing and introduced lso live its pioneering in house record label among the first to offer digital downloads of its releases cost overruns for lso st lukes mr gillinsons ambitious educational project contributed to a &# million deficit in by the time he left the lso the deficit had been erased thanks to additional fund raising and a two year wage freeze for orchestra members and staff which has subsequently been lifted according to an lso spokesperson mr gillinsons passion for outreach has already affected carnegie as well "we must be missionaries for music " he says "clearly carnegie has to continue to be about bringing the most extraordinary musicians here for concerts and educational activities but because of technology for the first time in human history there is no reason why it cant be our aspiration that the extraordinary music we love can reach every human being on the planet " carnegie was already beaming music instruction to foreign lands via satellite video conferencing before his arrival now through another new partnership the hall is exporting its "professional training workshops" and "carnegiekids" concepts to suntory hall in japan it has teamed up with national public radio npr and boston public television station wgbh to produce "from the top live from carnegie hall " filmed at zankel hall its midsize basement space this televised version of nprs popular musical variety show will premiere in april the carnegie imprimatur now graces a wider variety of cultural products the admirable fellowship program with juilliard is another attempt at building future audiences by offering salaries training performance opportunities and teaching experience to post graduate musicians selected for residencies in public schools the project also provides a cushion for young artists between the conservatory and the professional performance arena mr gillinson was "blown away" by the speed with which the venture got off the ground "fifteen months from its conception " he says "were in the schools with a significant amount of funding raised i dont think theres another country in the world where this would have been possible in that time in most countries you go to people and say look heres this fantastic idea and theyll say thats fabulous please keep me in touch with how youre getting on here people say thats fantastic how can i help make it happen " with an operating budget of nearly &# million for the current fiscal year and a &# million endowment carnegie hall appears able to realize its global ambitions contributions from the carnegie hall society its fund raising entity have kept it in the black despite increasing operating expenses and decreasing operating revenues for the three fiscal years ending june there is danger perhaps in the hall spreading itself too thin diluting the identity it has strived to create since it ceased being merely a rental hall in but theres greater peril in resting upon the halls considerable laurels something mr gillinson clearly understands "everybodys got to be moving forward " he says when asked what challenges carnegie faces in the future then he recites the words of another maestro pierre boulez "the arts are like riding a bicycle if you stop pedaling you fall off " ms jepson writes on classical music for the journal
