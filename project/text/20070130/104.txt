where art and nature merge patrick dougherty frederik meijer gardens and sculpture park through may grand rapids mich for three weeks patrick dougherty working here with a group of volunteers at the frederik meijer gardens and sculpture park had his hands full not metaphorically but literally he and his team of helpers were taking huge bundles of saplings and twigs from a pile of willows and dogwood lying out on the snow and dragging them into a large indoor exhibition space there they were meticulously weaving winding and tucking them into three cavernous abstract sculptures no hardware was used in their making only bits of twine a video camera recorded their progress and on the day of my visit days ago one of the giant shapes was just completed another was beginning to take shape and a third was barely begun on a piece of paper three blobs indicated the basic placement of the three pieces but everything else shape height and details was in mr doughertys head although the exhibit was opening to the public on jan a short film detailing each step of the construction process is a part of the show he showed no concern about the impending deadline "i never work on a piece for longer than three weeks " he told me a remarkable admission i thought given the size and scope of his work and perhaps one reason why he likes to recruit volunteers whenever possible mr dougherty decided to become a sculptor only after getting a degree in hospital administration he enrolled at the university of north carolina in the early s to study art and soon realized he wanted to work on a large scale being interested in sinuous shapes with no sharp edges he was drawn to the idea of working with wooden branches "my affinity for trees as a material comes from a childhood spent wandering the forest around southern pines n c i was drawn to sticks covering the forest floor as a plentiful and renewable resource and i realized that saplings had an inherent method of joining that is sticks get easily entangled and this became key to my working it into a variety of large forms " many years later and having created more than monumental scale works mr dougherty is still committed to working only in wood he has received commissions in japan and all over europe as well as in this country and his work has been shown both outdoors and indoors it can be rooted in the earth wrapped around trees curled over turrets crawling over roofs or bursting from a staircase in a recent exhibition in savannah ga a giant construction was even attached to the window bars of a former county jail from which it hung in a dramatic diagonal swathe by its nature his work is temporary and site specific usually it exists for the duration of an exhibit having a life span of about three months before going to the wood chipper "im just not going to survive into art history " he admits cheerfully from my experience sculpture and public gardens tend to co exist somewhat warily with each other most botanical gardens are not averse to showing sculpture but this is not what they are primarily about and in many instances the only permanent sculpture they display borders on "cute" and is relegated to the childrens garden conversely no sculpture garden ive ever seen pays much attention to horticulture so the meijer gardens is unusual in that from the start it was planned to showcase both sculpture and horticulture these being the two interests of the founder for whom the gardens are named and his wife today the meijer which sits on acres of land just outside grand rapids and is about to celebrate its th anniversary attracts more than visitors a year it boasts a complex of large indoor tropical conservatory gardens and a series of outdoor gardens including a new american garden by james van sweden a bulb and perennial garden designed by penelope hobhouse and an elaborate childrens garden alas all were covered in snow when i was there there is also an extensive program of horticultural lectures and workshops for children and adults the same snow that masked the gardens made a magnificent backdrop to an outdoor sculpture collection that includes works by rodin di suvero henry moore andy goldsworthy and edward gormley the meijer collection contains a formidable array of contemporary sculpture and is still growing the permanent outdoor collection is complemented by a series of temporary exhibitions such as the one that has just opened mr doughertys exhibit will be followed by the english artist sophie ryder and later in the summer there will be a retrospective of george rickey all of them artists who particularly resonate with nature much to my surprise this particular marriage between art and nature at the meijer gardens seems to be in perfect harmony when i inquired if there was ever any tension between these two often conflicting interests i received blank looks "did one outclass the other " i asked but no one seemed to know what i was talking about my theory that gardens and sculpture make uneasy bedfellows was dealt a serious blow in grand rapids although im not yet prepared to admit im entirely wrong seeing patrick dougherty work his magic with those willow and dogwood twigs im forced to admit theres an exception to my rule ms garmey writes about gardens and gardening for the journal
