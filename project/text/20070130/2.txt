arent we grand straightaway after the chicago bears defeated the new orleans saints and then the indianapolis colts defeated the new england patriots the type was set the story locked in lovie smith the bears coach and tony dungy the colts coach are both african americans and this will mark the first time that an african american coach has brought his team to a super bowl that there would be two african american coaches with teams playing against each other was too big a journalistic bonanza to ignore far from ignoring it the fact has been endlessly emphasized great vulgar minds think alike yet every time i hear mention of lovie smith and tony dungy as african americans i wonder if this emphasis on ethnicity is a good thing the more it goes on the more i feel that on game day jesse jackson will be called in to kick extra points with al sharpton holding lovie smith and tony dungy are superior men smart dignified cool under fire and high above the average of ex jocks who have gone on to coach national football league teams why make such a journalistic meal out of their being african american nothing nearly similar would be taking place if the two coaches were italian jewish irish ukrainian or texan history provides i suppose a partial excuse for many years black football players were thought insufficiently intelligent to play quarterback in the nfl professional football itself wasnt integrated until and it awaited the year before james harris out of all black grambling college started a playoff game as quarterback for the los angeles rams lots of brilliant african american quarterbacks doug williams warren moon randall cunningham steve mcnair donovan mcnabb michael vick followed so that today black quarterbacks seem as common a phenomenon as white ones both messrs dungy and smith happen to coach teams with white quarterbacks and lovie smith has been exemplary in standing by his young quarterback rex grossman through a season in which mr grossman has performed unevenly and consequently has been lashed by press criticism as someone who lives in chicago i have watched lovie smith over the past three years that he has been the bears head coach and find myself much taken by his quiet authority being a coach in the nfl entails being able to command an often out of control bunch of too young multimillionaire jocks the executive gifts to handle several sub coaches offense defense special teams and more and orchestrate their combined efforts on the field at game day and to deal with a low grade sports press always on the qui vive for stirring up troublesome controversy mr smith has handled all this with calm mastery never losing his cool never compromising his dignity he came to the bears following a coach who standing on the sidelines showed such stress that it seemed advisable to have him strapped to an ekg machine and a coach before that who specialized in humiliating his players by screaming at them on the sidelines when they made mistakes lovie smith the emotional antithesis of both these predecessors is a gent tony dungy a longtime friend of mr smith is no less gracious under fire alert intense but never neurotically wired on the sidelines he is a man in charge last year during the football season he underwent a family tragedy the suicide of his year old son which he handled with dignified reticence religious humility and manly stoicism tom brokaw wrote a bestseller about the men in world war ii whom he called "the greatest generation " my own nominee for the greatest generation would be that of those african american jazz musicians louis armstrong duke ellington count basie and others who practiced their subtle art through decades of ugly racial prejudice while maintaining a high artistic standard and an unruffled elegance of demeanor lovie smith and tony dungy strike me as the equivalent in sports of those men why then emphasize the african americanness of these two excellent coaches doesnt doing so suggest a patronizing sense of amazement at their accomplishments as if to say whod have thunk not one but two black men could be at the top of their line of work doesnt doing so also suggest a note of self congratulations for americans as if to say look how far weve come in giving these men a chance arent we grand in our virtue african americans will naturally enough take their own quiet pride in the achievements of lovie smith and tony dungy as every other ethnic group does when its members produce extraordinary achievements there must somewhere in america be an armenian athletes hall of fame but wont america more truly have come of age as a tolerant and mature society when men and women of genuine accomplishment can stand apart on their own without being weighed down by the heavy freight of their race religion or ethnicity hold the public relations forget the ethnic pride let the game begin mr epstein is the author most recently of "alexis de tocqueville democracys guide" harpercollins see related letter "letters to the editor racial patronizing" wsj feb
