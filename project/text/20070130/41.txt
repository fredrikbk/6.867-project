how best to supervise internal runner up for the job you got the good news you accepted a terrific job offer the potential bad news you must supervise the internal runner up for your spot amid a buoyant job market the problem appears to be spreading "anyone who comes into a moderately senior position will probably encounter resistance and possibly resentment from the passed over insider " says richard guha a partner for a small brand consultancy in san marino calif who has run into the dicey dilemma twice "a lot of people dont recognize it until its too late " he notes how can you make sure the loser doesnt hijack your authority give you wrong information or otherwise derail your effectiveness as an outside hire to avoid being sabotaged you should come well informed about your selection "find out all you can about what was behind your being brought on board over the inside contender " says sheryl spanier a new york leadership consultant ask your boss why he didnt pick that individual and how to best use her talents she suggests its equally important to discover whether upper management appeased the defeated employee with a raise the gesture may make that person "feel newly empowered and less willing to cooperate " says vince thompson an internet business adviser and former aol executive after an energy company wooed mr guha to lead a key division the industry novice belatedly learned he had been chosen over a staffer who was a long time friend of the founder and board chairman the vanquished official soon complained to the chairman that mr guha would wreck the enterprise "he thought he had the right answers and i was the wrong answer " mr guha remembers he believes the badmouthing hurt his effectiveness if a prior relationship allows a spurned contender to circumvent you try to "get your bosss help in making sure that the employee is sent back to you " ms spanier says in mr guhas case the chairman refused to curb his chums misbehavior so a month after he arrived mr guha took matters into his own hands he solicited business insights from the disgruntled official over dinner once a week the man stopped whining to the chairman his cooperation improved and the division flourished their weekly or monthly meals lasted a year mr guha now wishes he had inaugurated the dinners right away "before the resentment could build up " an immediate frank chat with the passed over prospect about his disappointment and career goals can also defuse the sticky situation act empathetic without naively assuming you will become friends in discussing the associates definition of personal success stress that you value his abilities but you are the boss recommends barb bridendolph president of crenshaw associates a new york career advisory boutique "otherwise you set false expectations that this role can be shared " during her initial nine weeks with a pennsylvania management consulting firm a senior vice president lacked time for a heart to heart chat with paul forti a middle manager and psychologist rebuffed for her job being ignored by the new boss exacerbated his pain at being passed over he recalls dr forti deliberately kept his distance never volunteering information when consulting clients inquired about the executive he curtly replied "she is senior to me she is obviously competent " but he told work buddies that he doubted she was the right pick "i didnt want her to succeed " says dr forti now a management psychologist in morristown n j "that really hurt us both " he found himself testy with private practice patients while the senior vp "was always a little on edge " a fall on the ice broke the ice dr forti saw his supervisor tumble as she emerged from her car one snowy morning he rushed outside to help "id really like to get to know you " the grateful executive said they ate lunch together that day for the first time she explained how much she respected him and promised they would operate as equals according to dr forti afterward "we worked well together " he says things improved partly because the senior vp offered dr forti first crack at plum client assignments and touted his expertise when they made new business pitches finding attractive opportunities for a rejected but well respected insider to shine is a good idea career coaches advise the approach transformed one newcomers possible
