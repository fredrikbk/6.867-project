medtronic heart device draws scrutiny the food and drug administration is investigating allegations by a former medtronic inc engineer that the medical device company didnt adequately test its new concerto cardiac device for patients with congestive heart failure the fdas minneapolis office is conducting an inquiry into the claims by christopher fuller who worked as an engineer at medtronic until late mr fullers concerns deal with one of the minneapolis companys newest and most lucrative products the concerto device is one that can resynchronize the heartbeat of a patient and also provide backup "defibrillator" capability to save the patients life if the heart goes into cardiac arrest at issue is the wireless technology by which doctors and nurses can remotely monitor how well the device is working and how a patient is doing this technology is one of the most cutting edge of the capabilities of such medical devices which can cost &# or more mr fuller contends that medtronic didnt do enough to test this wireless capability and that there are as a result possible safety problems with the concerto device medtronic said that of the devices have been implanted in the u s and that it believes the device to be safe the company said it has investigated mr fullers concerns "thoroughly" and has either addressed his concerns or "believes them to be without merit " the device went on the market last june after being approved for sale by the fda in may in the u s alone there are an estimated five million people with congestive heart failure in which the heart has reduced pumping capacity often because of a prior heart attack heart valve disease or an infection the concerto device is one of a modern generation of devices that can treat moderate congestive heart failure by improving the timing of beating of chambers of the heart so rather than sloshing back and forth uselessly within the heart more blood is pumped out to vital organs mr fuller an engineer who had worked on the concerto device said he resigned from medtronic in protest over what he terms "serious issues" regarding "how medtronic evaluated the concerto " last year mr fuller contacted the fda and the offices of the u s senators from minnesota in one letter to republican sen norm coleman mr fuller wrote that the concerto devices long distance telemetry "exhibited instabilities in testing" and that medtronic "has chosen to ignore the problem " medtronic spokesman rob clark said the company believes the frequency band used by doctors to monitor patients with the concerto "is dedicated for these uses and we believe its extremely stable we have had no adverse events reported due to the wireless telemetry features of the devices " mr fuller contends that this instability can "prevent other circuits from behaving properly" and can lead to "excessive" battery depletion or can "burn up" other circuitry in the devices medtronic is expected to have about &# billion in fiscal sales
