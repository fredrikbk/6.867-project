testing the limits how mitt romney avoided campaign finance rules governor found way around federal caps before presidential bid washington federal law limits how much money individuals can give to presidential candidates &# per election but what about compuware inc founder peter karmanos last year he gave &# to presidential aspirant and former massachusetts gov mitt romney since other romney backers have sunk at least &# each into the republicans coffers sometimes with a series of checks issued on a single day because he doesnt hold federal office mr romney became subject to the federal rules only after he set up a presidential exploratory committee earlier this month until then his team took advantage of a little noticed gap between federal and state law while most states limit political donations about a dozen dont mr romneys political team set up fund raising committees in three of those michigan iowa and alabama during that time his political action committees raised &# million as a result mr romney was able to hit the ground running a big advantage in what has already become a feverish race a week after announcing his possible bid having already taken care of basic campaign logistics such as hiring and office space the former governor held a boston fund raiser that netted &# million in pledges mr romney also used the cash to build a broad network of financial backers and grass roots allies mr romneys financial network is in a long tradition of candidates working around post watergate campaign finance rules in the s and s candidates dodged limits by steering big checks to party committees which in turn paid for television ads and turnout efforts the s also saw the rise of lawmakers "leadership" committees some of which were set up in a way that allowed them to collect big unlimited checks members of congress used these accounts to help colleagues and for travel expenses in then texas gov george w bush recruited volunteers who "bundled" small checks from friends and families into packets that totaled as much as &# in return top fundraisers got inside access to mr bush and his team the very result the donation limits were designed to prevent congress clamped down in with a major revamping of campaign finance laws that banned unlimited donations to party and leadership committees but innovative fund raising techniques continue to mushroom as the cost of campaigning rises ever higher in both mr bush and john kerry the democratic nominee opted out of the governments subsidized financing system to win their nominations spending an unprecedented &# million each before agreeing to rejoin public funding for the general election this year experts expect the two major party candidates to push combined costs to over a billion dollars like mr romney former iowa gov tom vilsack has a nonfederal committee which collected more than &# from labor unions before he became a democratic presidential candidate the campaign finance law forbids such contributions to federal politicians or anyone who has officially opened a committee exploring a run for federal office mr vilsack like mr romney isnt a federal office holder ditto former new york gov george pataki who has a &# backer patrick e malloy iii a sag harbor developer mr malloys september donation to the iowa arm of mr patakis st century freedom pac makes up nearly half the contributions to the state account according to the latest reports filed just before the november elections meredith mcgehee policy director at the nonpartisan campaign legal center a washington d c group that tracks issues relating to money and politics says the tactic undermines a basic purpose of federal limits preventing big donors from buying access "do we expect those who gave him large amounts in the infancy of his campaign will be especially remembered later on absolutely that seed money is sometimes the most critical part of your campaign " based on some polls and early organizing strength mr romney is considered among the top three republican candidates alongside arizona sen john mccain and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani benjamin ginsberg the romney campaigns chief attorney says the committees were set up to help state and local republicans not necessarily mr romneys presidential campaign criticism of the fund raising tactic he says is "washington centric" and "disrespectful" of states power to establish their own rules "mr romney complied with the letter spirit and intent of state laws where state candidates were on the ballot " he says the committees spending and fund raising efforts are disclosed in state capitols in the past three years mr romneys network donated &# million to republican candidates the campaign says a big chunk of the rest went to mr romneys travel staff and national consultants spencer zwick mr romneys national finance director says the national spending was needed to help raise money for local races mr zwick says the state political action committees as theyre called were designed for quick fund raising and maximum flexibility some local candidates are prohibited from taking money from federal committees mr zwick says state based operations "allow us to participate at all levels " he says kevin madden a spokesman for the campaign acknowledges there could be residual benefits to mr romneys presidential bid he adds that none of the donors wrote a check expecting to receive special favors in return most of them have known mr romney for a long time theyre "motivated by advocacy and what they think is right with regard to the current political and policy debate " mr madden says mr karmanos the compuware founder declines to comment mr romneys alabama pac illustrates how the network operated in its public disclosures the state pac reported raising &# in the money came from donors none of whom live in alabama muneer satter a chicago based goldman sachs group inc managing director was a top giver donating &# to the account in a single day mr satter declines to comment from that kitty &# was donated to alabama state and local candidates who could be important allies as mr romney tests his northern pedigree in the rural south a region vital to any republican presidential bid much of the remaining balance was used to help defray the costs of mr romneys national operation including a portion of the rent for his boston headquarters bills at jules catering of somerville mass and services provided by daynes music co of midvale utah no alabama vendors received money from the alabama account according to the public records son of a former michigan governor mr romney joined bain &amp co a management consulting firm shortly after graduating from harvard in he co founded bain capital and helped build it into a major private equity firm he left in and drew national attention when he took over the troubled organizing effort for the winter olympics in utah in he ran for governor of massachusetts touting himself as a fiscal conservative and social moderate when he set his sights on the white house mr romney and his allies concluded he needed to broaden his exposure particularly among the iowa and new hampshire activists who will winnow the field mr romneys commonwealth pacs as theyre all called were launched july in michigan all are in states with early primaries in addition to picking iowa alabama and michigan the campaign chose two important states that do have donation limits new hampshire and south carolina mr romney also started a federal political action committee mr romneys massachusetts and utah backers financed the state networks from the beginning and distributed their contributions among them records show for others the campaign provided a list of state committees and recommended donation amounts donors say they didnt inquire about the legalities of the arrangement assuming rightly that mr romney had vetted it properly and that the practice was legal between july and october the michigan committee raised nearly &# from a dozen donors from massachusetts and two from michigan the committee issued checks to local candidates and parties including a &# donation to the state republican party headquarters in the michigan committee covered the costs of hiring navigators llc a washington d c media consulting firm the committee also paid more than &# to gentry collins a des moines iowa consultant who helped president bushs campaign records show the romney network expanded in public documents show how donors issued multiple checks on the same day to different accounts mark and joseph fuller for example gave a total of &# the brothers checks to the iowa new hampshire michigan south carolina committees and to mr romneys federal committee were all issued aug the fullers are both senior executives at monitor group a cambridge mass management and strategic consulting firm mark fuller the companys chairman and ceo says he was a student at harvard law school when he met mr romney who was then a recent graduate he says his donation stemmed from his belief in mr romneys candidacy "this is a guy who does not talk himself into alice in wonderland fantasy he will deal with bad news in a realistic way " mr fuller says he and his wife opted to spread their money across the spectrum of mr romneys accounts because they wanted him "to get out and see some of the states that are more traditionally red states and get in touch with a different part of the party base " throughout the various state committees coordinated their activities each paid a portion of the expenses incurred by the national campaign in boston such as rent and consulting costs in south carolina a state that has donation limits the committee says it received more than &# and spent nearly &# all but one of the donors lived outside the state most of mr romneys top dollar national givers were among the south carolina contributors records show south carolina state and local candidates received &# in donations from the account the committee hired south carolina consultants leslie gaines and nick breeding to guide the committees work both advisers worked for the bush cheney campaigns south carolina operation experience that could boost mr romneys candidacy in the south carolina committee also paid for furniture rental and a boston car service for the campaigns headquarters spending in new hampshire followed a similar pattern now mr romney hopes to convert his new friends into a presidential campaign team former republican iowa house speaker christopher rants was a prime recruitment target because of his ties to other local house members state legislators are important allies because they can deliver supporters to the caucus meetings that decide the primary winners mr rants was impressed with mr romneys willingness to help him raise money the former governor attended events in the state donated &# to mr rantss iowa re election campaign and similar amounts to every other tight race in july mr rants flew to boston to get a better feel for mr romneys positions on policy issues including transportation and social issues he liked what he heard and joined the team at a december meeting in westwood iowa a small clutch of legislators gathered in a hotel meeting room to pepper mr romney for more than an hour about his health care plan and position against gay marriage as legislators they sympathized with mr romneys explanation that he couldnt always control legislation pushed by the statehouse democrats "after all we thwarted our governor a few times too " said mr rants by the end of the meeting mr romney had four new local supporters money doesnt always work former iowa republican rep jim nussle was a prime target for all hopefuls in his unsuccessful bid for iowa governor last year mr nussle received more than &# from mr romneys iowa account as head of the republican governors association mr romney also directed &# million to mr nussles iowa race including a &# check the former governor personally delivered at mr nussles annual red white and blues fund raiser in dubuque last august in the end mr nussle joined the campaign team of mr giuliani the former mayor headlined nussle fund raisers but didnt donate money directly to his campaign mr romney now has to comply with federal fund raising limits his advisers say they havent decided what to do with the state accounts which had a combined surplus of about &# million as of election day in november according to the most recent disclosure reports its unclear how much of that money remains much of it could have been used to finance mr romneys boston headquarters between november and january when the candidate officially entered the race year end reports will soon clarify that campaign finance experts say mr romney and his allies cant use the remaining cash during this presidential campaign mr romney could transfer it to another person over whom he has no control if he loses he could save the cash for another possible bid
