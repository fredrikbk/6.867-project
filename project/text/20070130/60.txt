politics &amp economics a covert fight for putins job presidential hopefuls contend to win the bosss favor moscow even though the vote is more than a year away presidential jockeying in russia already is in full swing but if new u s presidential candidates declare themselves almost daily that is the one thing a serious contender in russias tightly controlled system would never do instead the race to succeed vladimir putin who is obliged by a two term limit to step down next year is a kind of kabuki theater where contenders maneuver to score points for themselves and undermine suspected rivals with the only constituency that really matters mr putin and the kremlin elite the behind the scenes struggle has triggered waves of conspiracy theories as events ranging from corruption scandals to contract killings to the poisoning of a former security agent are dissected for clues to what it says about the presidential race "with such tight controls on the media everyone naturally starts to wonder why the government lets one piece of information out instead of something else " said nikolai petrov political analyst at the carnegie moscow center "so everyone is analyzing information to learn about the battles between different clans " politicians and analysts agree that there is little suspense about who will decide the outcome of the elections slated for march basking in strong public support and tight control over the media political parties and election authorities mr putin will be able to ensure victory for whichever candidate he endorses russias next president must do more than safeguard the stability of a sprawling resource rich nuclear armed nation more threatening to those now in control in the kremlin he will decide who controls the enormous power and wealth that mr putin has concentrated in moscow kremlin insiders also insist that tight control over the process is critical to ensure that extreme left wing or nationalist candidates whose views have strong appeal in russia dont prevail mr putin kicked off speculation over who would succeed him more than a year ago when he elevated two close allies to prominent government jobs in a move widely viewed as setting up a horse race between the two dmitry medvedev a baby faced lawyer who got his start with mr putin in st petersburg in the s was handed the reins of a massive new social spending program defense minister sergei ivanov an old putin colleague from the kgb security agency mr ivanov wont say just what he did there was tasked with rebuilding russias military industry even as the two have seen their poll ratings rise thanks to blanket coverage on state tv doubts persist about whether mr putin might find a way to stay on despite the constitutional ban on running for a third term one theory popular in moscows political class runs that people close to the president might precipitate some kind of crisis possibly a breach in relations with the west to force him to reverse his public pledge to step down next year a similar struggle played out in early when one kremlin faction sought to persuade then president boris yeltsin who was ailing and lagging far behind in the polls to cancel the vote that group lost out to another and mr yeltsin went on to defeat his communist rival russias short democratic history doesnt have many success stories fourteen years ago the first relatively free elections after the collapse of communism led to a parliament packed with hard line nationalists and communists later presidential campaigns involved heavy handed manipulation of the media and other official levers to ensure that boris yeltsin and then mr putin prevailed "russia has no system of deciding who will be the next president " said grigory yavlinsky head of the opposition yabloko political party and a former presidential candidate as elections approach "there will be lots of instability and terrible nervousness " the recent murders of kremlin critics journalist anna politkovskaya in moscow and former security agent alexander litvinenko in london are seen as evidence of a fight among kremlin clans mr putins critics have blamed the kremlin for both deaths russian officials heatedly deny that and suggest the murders were arranged by mr putins opponents to tarnish russias reputation practically every political development is interpreted for what it might say about the hidden race mr ivanov for instance wound up on the defensive last year after the brutal hazing of a military academy recruit got heavy media coverage then a wave of corruption charges at the health ministry looked to many analysts like a campaign to discredit mr medvedev some of the speculation is even more extreme stanislav belkovsky a political analyst and onetime kremlin adviser believes mr litvinenkos poisoning has given an edge to mr medvedevs supporters because it has discredited russian security services the radioactive poison used to kill mr litvinenko was spread through restaurants and hotels in london and the incident has badly strained relations with britain publicly officials deny any split in mr putins retinue insisting that since he has said he will step down at the end of his term the issue is closed mr putin has been cagey about his plans to endorse a successor saying only that his preferred candidate should continue his policies and that it might not be one of the apparent heirs mr putin says he expects to remain a prominent political player after he leaves office raising the possibility that he could keep the reins of power behind the scenes a wholly new political construct for russia even so the race is heating up messrs medvedev and ivanov are shown daily on state tv looking presidential and regularly make highly publicized foreign visits the unannounced competition has been thinly veiled at times such as when the two attended ceremonies for rival business schools within days of each other for now kremlin watchers say mr medvedev has mr putins favor the spending programs he is running are a machine politicians dream about &# billion in subsidies to improve health education housing and agriculture a former law professor and longtime putin protege he is also chairman of the board of state gas giant oao gazprom considered a relative liberal mr medvedev delivered a keynote speech at this years davos economic forum insisting the kremlin is committed to market economics and democracy detractors say that at years old mr medvedev is handicapped by a lack of political experience and gravitas at feet inches tall he is one of the few top russian officials shorter than mr putin others say his mild bearing might work to his advantage because mr putin could more easily control him after stepping down kremlin watchers say mr ivanov remains a contender thanks to his supposed appeal to kremlin hard liners owing to his tough guy credentials mr ivanov took a hard line during russias recent confrontation with the former soviet state of georgia whose pro western president has accused the kremlin of trying to topple him for the moment any competition between messrs ivanov and medvedev is strictly under the carpet neither man will even admit to harboring presidential ambitions whos next behind the scenes jockeying has begun for russias march presidential election some potential candidates front runners
