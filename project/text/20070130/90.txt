the tax gap myth when something sounds too good to be true it usually is so now is an apt time to deconstruct the much discussed "tax gap " that mythical golden goose that the beltway political class is counting on to fund its spending agenda the "tax gap" is the difference between what the internal revenue service thinks taxpayers should be paying and what it collects the irs currently estimates this at about &# billion a year ask any congressional chairman how he intends to close the deficit expand the medicare drug benefit reform the alternative minimum tax or subsidize college education and the answer is invariably "close the tax gap " last year the senate held some half dozen hearings in search of this pot of gold senate finance chairman max baucus has put out a monthly newsletter on the issue and last year he blocked a treasury nominee until the agency had developed a tax gap fix mr baucus and his gop sidekick charles grassley have ordered up a tax gap report from the joint tax committee and they vow to make closing the gap a priority we suppose politicans are allowed to dream but its worth recalling that washington has searched for this revenue atlantis for decades without success to put the tax gap in perspective consider that the irs took in tax receipts in fiscal of more than &# trillion and that the overall u s tax compliance rate is about this isnt perfect but it also isnt italy its especially good considering the u s tax system is based on voluntary compliance nina olson the irss taxpayer advocate told congress last year that irs auditors have found that an estimated of noncompliance is the result of honest mistakes by tax filers who simply dont understand the page beast of a tax code one obvious answer would be to simplify the code more on that later but this requires political will so congress naturally prefers the easier route of ratcheting up taxpayer regulation and enforcement one popular solution is to increase dramatically the information taxpayers must report to the irs some potential illustrations brokers would have to report securities sales information to the irs the better to monitor capital gains individuals who participate in online auctions such as ebay would have to file a tax form about their transactions americans would be required to file expanded mortgage interest forms while mortgage lenders would have to report loan information state and local governments would have to provide their tax data to washington the better to double check deductions our personal favorite would require that americans withhold taxes from any cash payments they make to such individual contractors as babysitters gardeners or plumbers theyll love that one in the suburbs implicit in all these new plans is a much bigger irs staff to monitor and chase tax miscreants heres another bad idea many doctors and lawyers who are incorporated under subchapter s will often pay themselves lower wages but higher dividends in order to reduce self employment taxes the law is vague on the limits of this practice and it is undoubtedly abused but the joint tax committees preferred solution is to make all professional income even dividend payments subject to self employment taxes this is nothing more than a backdoor tax hike all voluntary tax compliance systems have their limits under todays tax code the only way the feds can raise compliance is to place extraordinary burdens on taxpayers most of those financial and social costs also end up being borne by those who already dutifully pay their taxes in the name of catching the few who evade the law the tradeoff for higher tax collection is less liberty as we learned only a decade ago when congress held much hyped hearings on abusive irs tactics and audits there is a better way the more complicated a tax system the more likely taxpayers wont understand or will try to dodge the rules simple tax regimes such as a single flat rate encourage compliance and efficiency not to mention economic growth this has been the experience of many eastern european countries after they imposed a flat tax and the u s had similar jumps in reported tax income from "the rich" following the tax reform that cut rates and closed loopholes at least a few "tax gap" critics in washington are beginning to understand all this messrs baucus and grassley have started pairing the "tax gap" problem with the need to eliminate or simplify the alternative minimum tax which is hitting more and more americans house ways and means chairman charlie rangel has also said that fixing the amt might require "a look at the whole tax code " could it be that even washington is beginning to understand that fixing the tax mess means starting over
