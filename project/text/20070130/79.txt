small europe markets look to rise athens greece small stock markets of southeastern europe could have another year of big gains analysts say although they are unlikely to match last years sizable double digit performance convergence with the european union strong economic growth a credit fueled consumer spending boom and a string of privatizations in sectors such as energy and telecommunications should support the regions markets this year like other emerging markets stocks in romania bulgaria croatia and serbia the four biggest markets in the region that also includes albania and much of the former yugoslavia could suffer from volatility particularly in the first half of this year some see declines this quarter which may be triggered by a change in the outlook for global growth if a weak u s housing market drags down the worlds largest economy moreover valuations already are hefty and investors are expected to price in less robust growth in earnings from companies in the region in the coming months still analysts believe solid domestic and global economic growth will support corporate earnings at least in the short term "the main trigger for a correction in southeastern europe will not be the local factors but the turnaround in the market sentiment resulting from the slump in some of the u s indicators " said stefan maxian head of company research at rzbs equity arm raiffeisen centrobank "but a correction expected in southeastern europe in the first quarter is set to be lower than that of emerging markets " rzbs raiffeisen research estimates romanias bet index could pull back while the croatian market could fall in the first quarter overall it expects an correction in emerging markets this quarter so far there is little sign of that the regions stock markets posted spectacular gains last year higher than the rises in their developed counterparts as their currencies appreciated against the u s dollar and investors generally favored emerging markets the leader was croatias zagreb stock exchange share index or crobex which surged nearly it has risen another this year the main serbian index the belgrade stock exchange index or belex jumped in it is up this year romania and bulgaria which joined the eu on jan posted slightly more modest gains last year the bucharest stock exchange index or bet rose nearly last year and is up another this year the bulgarian stock exchange index the sofix climbed and has advanced this year all fared much better than the pan european dow jones stoxx index which rose last year and has edged up about this year returns also compared well with many emerging markets russias rts index jumped last year but has slipped this year indias sensex climbed last year and is up another this year of course the regions markets still are relatively small and thinly traded so even modest purchases or sales can have a substantial impact on prices the combined value of companies traded on the bulgarian romanian croatian and serbian stock markets is about half that of warsaws stock market eastern europes largest outside russia croatian oil group ina the biggest stock in the regions largest stock market had a market capitalization of billion euros &# billion making it about the size of spains banco espirito santo and about the size of hsbc holdings plc the european stock with the largest market value another risk is that the regions stock markets trade at higher valuations than other markets around the world the romanian bet is trading at around times estimated earnings compared with just times for polands benchmark wig index "most local stocks in the region are expensive but one exception is equest investments balkans which invests in consumer related businesses " said gunter faschang money manager and head of eastern european equities at bank vontobel oesterreich ag in vienna the stock which is listed on the irish stock exchange trades at about times expected earnings he said other large cap stocks in eastern europe trade at to times their expected earnings investors also are eyeing a raft of possible share sales in the energy and telecommunications sectors in romania state monopolies romgaz and transgaz could go public this year and the government could sell more shares in petrom an energy company that is owned by austrias omv ag croatias government also could sell more shares in ina "last year has shown that ipo issuance offered good opportunities to enter these markets " said matthias siller investment manager emea equities at baring asset management
