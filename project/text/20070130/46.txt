journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources foreign policy u s belief in unique moral role leads to harmful use of power the belief that the u s possesses a unique moral responsibility to end tyranny around the world is mistaken and doomed to failure in potentially costly ways william pfaff says in the new york review of books since the s u s policy makers across the political spectrum have operated under an assumption of american exceptionalism culminating in the bush administrations mission to use the u s military to help nations achieve their ultimate destiny democracy mr pfaff says a far more effective alternative foreign policy for the u s was developed by george kennan in the aftermath of world war ii mr kennan thought nondemocratic societies in many cases should be left alone as long as they didnt cause international trouble limits on intervention should be observed even when dealing with humanitarian crises he says u s involvement to stem the miseries facing parts of africa is destined to fail intervention wont solve the longstanding feuds or the droughts that are behind recent conflicts in darfur sudan and somalia he says whats more those conflicts are beginning to be confused with the larger u s "war on terror " which risks a course of "endless and fruitless" military interventions in the region to achieve its

right to "medical self defense " championed by eugene volokh of the university of california los angeles medical self defense could be used to prevent the government from withholding treatment such as experimental drugs from sick individuals while mr volokh said his argument is conservative because it is based on precedent and political tradition mr nagel said it will have the same undesirable effect of turning judges into legislators "creating a constitutional right to medical self defense would be a definitive sign that the conservatives who sit on the supreme court are not serious about establishing a saner less imperial role for the judiciary " the weekly standard feb iraq talabani deftly works all sides in conflict president jalal talabani has a greater role in iraq than his

turned enemy of saddam hussein as a kurdish leader he has worked with both iran and the u s he still controls the kurdish militia that won him power in iraqi kurdistan in the s in he used it to settle a standoff with iraqs prime minister over who should control a former nato building in baghdad he believes the u s should let him use his militia against foreign fighters and baathists mr anderson watches mr talabani run up a large hotel bill at le meurice in paris while clinching an oil deal with total sa for kurdistan he also is trying to exploit his ties with iran mr anderson notes that ever the realist mr talabani seems eager to go down as the father of a new united iraq but is hedging against failure "if iraq falls apart he can be a founding father of an independent kurdish state " the

reflexes taken with a hammer the penlights shone in the eye laments texas physician abraham verghese as a result he says patients have disappeared behind an overly expensive array of lab tests and scans percussion the technical term for tapping the body to diagnose problems can uncover ailments including "a dilated heart an enlarged liver fluid around the lung " during his medical training in
