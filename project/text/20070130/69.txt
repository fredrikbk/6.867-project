politics &amp economics iranian presidents setbacks embolden his domestic critics establishment rivals fault populism foreign policy nuclear deadline looms tehran iran with another confrontational moment in irans nuclear standoff approaching next month criticism of the countrys president at home is increasing president mahmoud ahmadinejad whose landslide victory in elections months ago set the iranian establishment reeling suddenly faces a concerted effort by political foes to constrain both his populist economic policies and his public defiance of the west many of tehrans elite politicians and even clerics have long harbored concerns about mr ahmadinejad who ascended to the countrys top political post from outside the traditional ruling circles but the immense popularity he generated among irans poor and working class voters kept many of his critics from speaking out or openly moving against his policies he also appeared to have the backing of the most important figure in irans power structure supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei but a round of elections late last year for local municipal and village leaders as well as an important national consultative body has undermined mr ahmadinejads political momentum and unleashed a flood of public criticism and moves to clip his wings candidates whom mr ahmadinejad supported fared poorly in the elections while key adversaries re established themselves as fixtures of the political scene in tehrans city council from which mr ahmadinejad launched his campaign for president two years ago his supporters went from a majority to a handful of seats meanwhile hashemi rafsanjani whom mr ahmadinejad defeated in the presidential election two years ago dominated the voting for seats on the assembly of experts the body charged with choosing a new supreme leader when the year old mr khamenei steps down or dies since those public votes a drumbeat of criticism against mr ahmadinejads administration has emerged from within irans parliament and among some senior regime officials the president even found himself confronted by a crowd of jeering students during an appearance at a tehran university campus with a video of the incident distributed on the internet "the elections opened a space and legitimized criticism of him " said nasser hadian a political science professor at the university of tehran "there are going to be more attempts to contain him " the poor showing by candidates associated with mr ahmadinejad in local elections and the relatively better performance of reform candidates opposed to him resulted from the sort of strong turnout that generally favors reformers the countrys conservatives also failed to rally behind a single slate of candidates as they did during the earlier presidential election but high on many voters minds is irans increasingly muddled economy the president won the election with vows to improve the living standards of iranians he has pursued a populist agenda while traversing the nation to announce development initiatives rising spending however has sparked a bout of inflation which officially is but private economists say likely is far higher after a speech introducing his annual budget which will push spending another higher for the fiscal year beginning in march mr ahmadinejad argued with several parliamentarians over the rising price of tomatoes while mr ahmadinejads appeal persists among his core supporters they are among the hardest hit by rising inflation and some privately express doubts about his leadership "he looked like a decent person one of us " says one year old man who works part time washing dishes in a restaurant in southern tehran "i voted for him but i wouldnt again " meanwhile mr rafsanjani a longtime regime power broker and president of the country during much of the early s is spearheading a tentative movement to rein in mr ahmadinejad particularly his proclamations about irans nuclear program and denunciations of israel a large group of parliamentarians including many who once supported mr ahmadinejad recently met with mr rafsanjani the gathering was seen as an important indication that support for mr ahmadinejad is eroding a key question is whether mr khamenei will continue backing mr ahmadinejad while the supreme leader has vocally defended the president and largely embraced his confrontational approach toward the united nations security council on the nuclear issue mr khamenei has done little to stem criticism of mr ahmadinejad he also has held several meetings with mr rafsanjani mr ahmadinejads standing with mr khamenei and the broader attempts to rein him in could be important in the run up to a feb deadline for the security council resolution passed in december ordering iran to stop its uranium enrichment program the u s and european countries say the program has violated international rules and is aimed at creating a nuclear weapon iran says the program is peaceful and hasnt violated international rules the resolution included a limited set of sanctions targeting officials and organizations accused of involvement in the nuclear program european governments have joined with the u s to broaden and toughen those punishments the u s is expected to push for harsher sanctions if iran doesnt stop its enrichment program mr khamenei reiterated publicly recently that iran wouldnt halt enrichment but mr ahmadinejad has been relatively quiet on the issue in public some european diplomats and iranian analysts say iran might agree to a temporary pause in the program after the country completes a research level enrichment project in coming weeks in an effort to keep the crisis from escalating further
