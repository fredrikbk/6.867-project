iowa emigration act the labor department reported last week that u s union membership keeps shrinking which helps explain why unions have made easing the rules for organizing one of their top political priorities and in some places theyve got a good chance to succeed unions lost members in and the percentage of working americans who belong to a union dipped to continuing to fall from the high of in the s today only one in private sector workers is a member of a labor union while four times as many americans own stock as belong to a union big labors response has been to redouble efforts to rig the rules to make union organizing much easier so in congress the number one afl cio priority is "card check" legislation which would end secret ballots for organizing elections at worksites union reps would know which workers voted "no" and thus be able to exert enormous peer pressure to conform given union history this would surely include threats and other intimidation democrats on capitol hill are likely to bring "card check" up for a vote on very short notice the better to prevent business from mobilizing against it meanwhile at the state level unions are trying to exploit their legislative victories in november by overturning right to work laws these laws prohibit employers from requiring workers to join a union as a condition of employment they also protect workers from having to pay union dues whether they belong to the union or not dues that often go to political causes that workers dont support iowa is emerging as the first test of this effort thanks to democratic control of the governorship and both legislative houses for the first time in years iowa has been a right to work state for years which is one reason the state has been able to hold on to some of its manufacturing base though neither new governor chet culver nor legislators campaigned against right to work unions are now demanding a vote to gut the popular law the proposed law wouldnt require workers to join a union but it would mandate that all workers pay union dues whether they join or not the unions call this a "fair play law" because all shop employees have to pay equally for union activities but this is a strange definition of "fair" because it allows unions to dun workers without their consent if the iowa legislature wanted to chase jobs and employers out of the state they couldnt come up with a better plan than underming right to work leo troy an economist at rutgers university has studied the issue and found that "right to work laws are strongly correlated with faster growth in jobs and personal income " many international and domestic companies wont consider locating a plant in a non right to work state most of the new auto plants owned by mercedes nissan bmw and honda are located in alabama south carolina texas and other right to work locales a recent survey by the national right to work institute found that between and right to work states have added auto manufacturing jobs a increase the non right to work states lost auto jobs or over the same period iowa has one of americas older populations and the states politicians have been fretting for years about the difficulty of keeping their young people from fleeing for better economic opportunities in other states if iowa democrats placate big labor and join new jersey new york michigan and ohio in all but forcing workers to join unions they can expect an accelerating exit to warmer economic climes
