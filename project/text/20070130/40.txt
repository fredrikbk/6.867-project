hedge fund hardball amid amaranths crisis other players profited goldman offered deal j p morgan balked then did one itself when amaranth llc collapsed in the fall after swiftly losing more than &# billion it was the biggest hedge fund failure ever now as investors slowly get back whats left of their money its becoming clear the debacle also had some big winners other players in the high stakes energy market who profited from a crippled rivals travails the final agonies of amaranth described by dozens of people close to the roller coaster negotiations about its fate began on friday sept bleeding cash and facing a monday demand for money it didnt have amaranth scrambled through an intense weekend to find someone who would take over losing energy investments for a price it did negotiate a rescue plan requiring it to pay nearly &# billion to goldman sachs group to take toxic trades off its hands strapped for cash amaranth aimed to get the money to do the deal by using cash collateral on deposit with its middleman for natural gas trades j p morgan chase &amp co but on monday morning just after amaranth had told its investors a rescue was close j p morgan said it wouldnt release the collateral the firm was effectively responsible for making sure parties to amaranths trades got paid and it said the rescue plan didnt free it of this risk according to people familiar with its stance j p morgans refusal killed the plan amaranths situation went from dire to desperate two days later j p morgan itself agreed to take over most amaranth energy positions with a partner it cut a deal that turned out to be lucrative for j p morgan earning it an estimated &# million but more painful for its longtime client amaranth hedge funds are among wall streets biggest customers and the street gives them red carpet treatment as the fees roll in but the amaranth case shows how wall street dealt with a fund after it had traded its way into a deep hole information the fund revealed about its holdings as it grasped for a lifeline let other commodity market players wall street firms included exploit its positions as they drove prices relentlessly against amaranth its losses swelled and instead of facing a big but possibly survivable setback it collapsed amaranths case also reflects an incentive structure in the world of hedge funds that can tempt some to assume heavy risk typical of hedge funds private investment pools for the wealthy and institutions amaranth took of investors assets as a management fee each year plus of investment gains this fee is calculated on gains recorded at year end including gains not nailed down by closed trades from this take traders at many firms such as amaranth are given bonuses that are largely theirs to keep even if the paper gains later shrink or vanish "this results in a huge incentive for taking risk " says luis garicano a university of chicago business school professor "when the bet goes well the hedge fund manager collects a lot while when it goes badly the worst that can happen to the loser is he gets zero " at amaranth star energy trader brian hunter won an estimated &# million bonus after his team produced a &# billion profit in like many others at the fund he had to keep about of his pay in the fund the funds chief risk officer robert jones got a bonus of at least &# million for say people familiar with the bonuses nicholas maounis founder majority owner and chief executive of the amaranth management firm got an estimated &# million cut of management fees plus some of amaranths &# million plus in performance fees he kept much of his compensation in the fund asked to comment a fund spokesman said "it would be inadvisable for amaranth to speak on the public record at this time while no litigation has been threatened or commenced against amaranth regulatory inquiries continue and litigation remains possible " he said "mr maouniss no priority is the continued disposition of the amaranth portfolio and distribution of capital to investors " the year old mr hunters specialty was natural gas futures contracts for delivery on a future date and options this is a highly volatile market where the price can move swiftly on changes in gas available in storage and on shifts in the weather or a weather forecast if mr hunter thought prices in say march would be higher than what other traders expected he could buy contracts for march delivery cheaply if his view of april prices was lower than the markets he could go the other way or he could bet on the spread between a pair of months for example if theres a cold winter gas can suddenly get scarce in march sending prices skyrocketing things shift in april as the heating season winds down the march april spread is one many gas traders bet on but can be such a perilous bet that some call it "the widowmaker " mr hunter bet big he sometimes held of contracts for gas delivery in certain months say people who saw the trading data his team operating largely out of calgary alberta made a stunning &# billion in six weeks last spring mostly on energy trades but gains that big in a single market can portend swings just as fast the other way and in may thats what happened his bets on gas prices years into the future backfired and dealt the fund a sudden loss of about that triggered demands for more collateral from j p morgan it was amaranths natural gas clearing broker a firm that executes a clients trades on an exchange and stands behind the clients obligations in case it cant pay clearing brokers give futures traders confidence theyll be paid if they are owed money when a contract expires for taking this risk the firms demand collateral known as "margin " in an amount of cash reflecting a portfolios possible one day price move the margin demand fluctuates daily with how well or badly the positions did that day amaranth told its investors the may loss was "a humbling experience that has led us to recalibrate how we assess risk " to reduce its exposure it paid investment bank morgan stanley to take over part of its energy portfolio yet officials at the new york mercantile exchange where many energy contracts trade were concerned enough that they discussed what a failure by a player as big as amaranth might do to the market the regulators took comfort in the stability of j p morgan the bank at times advised amaranth to reduce its natural gas exposure says someone familiar with the banks operations but the clearing operation focused chiefly on whether the fund met margin requirements as amaranth always did according to a person involved in the discussions amaranths mr maounis told his energy team to reduce its exposure but warned them not to do so precipitously lest the firm suffer another major loss amaranths positions were so big they couldnt be unwound fast without moving the market but amaranth allowed the portion of the fund invested in energy to grow as the energy bets started to pay off again by july amaranth was in energy up from in april in the last week of august the value of the funds assets reached &# billion up about since jan one of mr hunters bets anticipated relatively cheap gas in september but in the last half hour of trading aug the price of the expiring contract for september delivery jumped the surge wiped out hundreds of millions of dollars in amaranths gains the fund told nymex it suspected someone had manipulated prices regulators are looking at it then in early september widely watched weather forecasting centers made two predictions that the hurricane season would pass without major storms and that the winter would be mild the forecasts too slammed mr hunter he was betting on a gas shortage and price spike at some point after october worse contracts for winter delivery fell by more than those for early fall delivery hitting him where his bets were concentrated by the end of friday sept amaranth was down more than &# billion from its august value the losses automatically raised j p morgans margin demands one of the ways amaranth had met past demands was selling nonenergy investments to raise cash but now it turned out some couldnt be liquidated instantly say people involved amaranth suddenly faced a risk of not having enough cash for mondays margin demand if it didnt creditors could foreclose on its assets and it might lose them amaranth called wall street banks in search of solutions it asked goldman sachs if the bank a major player in both energy markets and hedge funds would take over much of amaranths energy portfolio the fund tried a different tack with others trying to raise money by selling a piece of the fund management firm amaranth advisors llc firms prefer to do negotiations like these secretly and one at a time to avoid revealing too much to too many rivals or signaling vulnerability but amaranths greenwich conn office that weekend was a revolving door morgan stanley representatives spotted someone from merrill lynch &amp co in the parking lot rumors flew on saturday goldman offered to do a deal designed to eliminate most of amaranths energy risk in return for a &# billion cash payment from the fund say people familiar with the negotiations amaranth managers were insulted mr hunter had figured the fund could get out of these problematic trades for about &# million amaranth kept shopping it called john arnold of centaurus energy a houston hedge fund that was mr hunters biggest rival no deal with others they talked to some amaranth traders claimed mr arnold was driving gas prices against amaranth according to someone who was approached their pitch was weve got one guy in the market trading against us if you take over our positions and hold onto them you can make a billion dollars later that saturday amaranth managed to make a partial deal it got merrill lynch to assume about a quarter of its natural gas exposure in return for a payment of approximately &# million say people familiar with the matter merrill wont comment amaranth officials figured that goldman sachs now would reduce its price since merrill was taking some of the exposure instead goldman executives fumed say people familiar with their reaction goldman had wanted to negotiate exclusively not have competitors poring over amaranths books rather than reduce its price goldman upped it to &# billion the deal it envisioned would use derivative contracts to assume most of the risk of amaranths main remaining energy investments goldman would do trades that partially offset energy trades on amaranths books with the aim of neutralizing them the deal would leave a lot of positions on amaranths accounts at j p morgan which remained responsible for their execution some at j p morgan including chief executive james dimon had grown concerned about amaranth late sunday j p morgan called in its top energy trader george "beau" taylor to review amaranths positions informed that an amaranth goldman deal was imminent j p morgan said it might make an offer itself but then said it needed more time in greenwich mr maounis was in turmoil sometimes losing composure and in tears according to people familiar with the matter late that night he accepted the deal with goldman on monday morning the sleep deprived fund chief issued a letter to investors telling them that half of the money the fund had at its peak weeks earlier was gone instead of being up for the year it might be down more than but his letter gave an assurance it said a deal to get the fund out of natural gas was "near completion " the letter didnt mention that a key player still needed to sign off j p morgan the clearing broker held an estimated &# billion to &# billion of amaranths money in a margin account cash that amaranth intended to use to pay goldman amaranth held a conference call intended to close the goldman deal but as officials from goldman and nymex listened j p morgan refused to release amaranths collateral scotching the deal the bank said it believed the complex transaction wouldnt eliminate its risk j p morgan would still be the clearing broker for amaranths energy positions and although goldman and amaranth claimed that the risk in those positions would be drastically reduced by goldmans offsetting trades j p morgan would be the clearing broker for those new trades too the firm said it needed to analyze how the deal worked it also argued that it had a right and perhaps a duty to hold onto the margin money until its obligations were resolved "we would have been absolutely willing to facilitate a deal that would have removed unwanted amaranth credit exposure from our risk profile " a j p morgan spokesman said in the energy market it was now open season on amaranth all weekend others had been dumping natural gas positions on after hours trading platforms having either heard rumors about amaranth or been invited to review its books on monday with word of the funds distress out in the open traders sold certain gas investments even faster in anticipation of a forced liquidation of amaranths portfolio for instance mr hunter had bet that the spread between march delivery gas contracts and april contracts the "widowmaker" bet would widen the burst of trading made it shrink to cents per million btu gas contract from &# on friday according to naturalgasanalytics net on monday alone amaranths losses deepened by several hundred million dollars that morning amaranth got a call from kenneth griffin founder of citadel investment group mr griffin had built citadel into a &# billion hedge fund behemoth estimated to be responsible for of daily trading on the new york stock exchange even so his group suffered some losses during mr hunters winning streak mr griffin proposed taking over most of amaranths energy portfolio that portfolio now was in worse shape because of mondays losses the more it deteriorated the more cash an outsider would demand to take it off amaranths hands the citadel deal would have cost amaranth more than &# billion say people familiar with the bid and the fund couldnt pay with its collateral hung up at j p morgan mr griffin considered giving the hedge fund time to pay by granting it a bridge loan taking other amaranth assets as collateral he dropped the idea when lawyers warned that citadel might have a hard time collecting if amaranth ended up in bankruptcy with the citadel plan shaky j p morgan got back in the game in conjunction with citadel j p morgan which itself is a big hedge fund player began new talks with its now very vulnerable clearing client the end result was a broader deal than the scuttled goldman one j p morgan and citadel would jointly assume amaranths entire remaining energy portfolio amaranth would have to eat losses of about &# million its portfolio had incurred from friday night through tuesday as others exploited its weakness j p morgan and citadel wanted &# billion to take over most remaining gas trading positions and some &# million to assume options to buy or sell gas as a topper they asked for &# million for taking over miscellaneous commodity investments mr hunter thought the price for taking over the miscellaneous positions should be no more than &# million says someone involved in the talks amaranth capitulated after an all night session the deal was signed at a m wednesday amaranths total payments to merrill lynch j p morgan and citadel plus the last few days market losses came to about &# billion now that j p morgan was in on the deal getting access to the amaranth cash that j p morgan held as collateral was no longer a problem his business in tatters amaranths mr maounis discussed selling what was left of his fund management firm to citigroup inc dean barr an official of citigroups alternative investments group was interested but wouldnt buy unless mr maounis stepped down as the firms chief says someone familiar with the talks ultimately negotiations foundered over other issues so amaranth began liquidating its remaining holdings mr hunter flew back to calgary and settled into a new house he had been building he is now talking about launching a hedge fund of his own mr maounis also is exploring starting a new hedge fund business the three firms that were paid hundreds of millions of dollars to take over amaranth trades merrill lynch citadel and j p morgan soon reported significant profits on energy trading j p morgan made at least &# million partly by quickly selling many of its new positions to citadel the amaranth deal produced a "very nice increment to fixed income trading " mr dimon j p morgans ceo said in a speech in november "but we did take a lot of risk " bill winters co head of j p morgans investment bank said at a november conference that through its hedge fund relationships such as trade clearing "we have the insight into whats going on in these funds" and can "respond quickly to opportunities when they come up amaranth was one obvious example of that " he added "i imagine there will be others where our ability to be both on the inside but not compromised is extremely powerful as a way to generate profits " the huge complex deal with amaranth helped build j p morgans profile as a commodities player this month a magazine called risk named the firm "energy derivatives house of the year " how much the investors in amaranth will lose depends on when they got in theyve gotten back about &# billion to date for one investor that came in in mid money returned so far comes to
