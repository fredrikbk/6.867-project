bill introduced by the newly majority democrats comes to &# billion sticking to president bushs spending cap for domestic agencies as the washington post reports it is the first instance in modern times that such a streamlined spending bill has covered such a large scale of government activity touching on details like securities transaction fees charged by regulators and even lawmakers own pay

bases the journal reports that money will largely pay for democrats priorities which include "veterans medical care pell grants for low income college students law enforcement and fighting aids and malaria overseas " the journal says the democrats have also imposed a moratorium on lawmakers earmarked spending items and the bill would freeze their own pay doing away with a cost of living increase

executive order as a move to ease the regulatory burden while consumer labor and environmental groups denounced it as means for the white house to hinder agencies efforts to safeguard the public saudi

notes is a "broader campaign by the organization of petroleum exporting countries are intended to shrink inventories of oil that had ballooned last year as demand growth for petroleum faltered "
