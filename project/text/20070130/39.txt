heartwarming soccer story kicks off hollywood fight early on january hollywood producer scott rudin sent up an urgent flare to his top deputy he had just read a heartwarming new york times story about a group of refugee kids playing soccer in clarkston ga and was desperate to win the movie rights four days later though mr rudin was bellyaching in a snarky email to top studio executives at sony corp and walt disney co about a frenzied auction that had ensued in which he was one of the losers despite an impassioned pitch and big money bid on a list of "some things i learned yesterday " mr rudin included this as lesson no "when someone says we want to look you in the eye " what they really mean is that "we want to look benjamin franklin in the eye many many times " "scott rudin makes a lot of money " says the refugees soccer coach luma mufleh "this is nothing to him in the large scheme of things what we could do with half a million dollars is a lot " how one of filmmakings wiliest players went from wooing a journalist and a small town soccer coach to venting his frustration toward them all over hollywood shows how sticky things sometimes get when real people are sucked into the entertainment industry vortex the articles author warren st john and his subject ms mufleh told studio executives they were taken aback by the interest the story had generated and wanted any resultant film project to do the right thing for the kids involved "i think i have an obligation to the kids in the community to tell their story " says ms mufleh but the flood of interest generated by the article "was just kind of surreal " she wasnt the only one who thought so when the project went to general electric co s universal pictures for an upfront payment of &# million plus a promised future payment of &# million some felt the buyers and the sellers had been caught up in a hype machine dealmakers say bruised feelings can be an unfortunate outcome of a case like this "at the end of the day as a seller you want your buyers to be happy " says jeremy zimmer a director of united talent agency which represents mr st john and ms mufleh "but only one person gets it so you know you enter into these things with excitement and trepidation " ms mufleh and her soccer players represent the rare tale that managed to transfix a wide swath of filmmakers the moment they read it the article told the story of a jordan born coach who has brought together refugee children from war torn places like liberia and kosovo on a team called "the fugees " because the mayor of clarkston restricted the teams use of a local field the team was left without a permanent place to play dozens of hollywood writers producers and executives immediately saw big screen potential producer scott stuber was heading into a photography exhibition in santa monica calif when he first read the story a little after a m he and his colleagues quickly began emailing each other and their counterparts at universal where mr stubers company has a production deal about the possibilities for a movie "the phones started burning up " he recalls "and then by noon or so we were all worked up and excited as was the whole industry " in park city utah where he was attending the sundance film festival scott rudin productions president mark roybal whod been awakened early by the call from his boss in new york was busy cobbling together an offer mr rudin a mercurial producer who worked on the movie "the hours" as well as the current release "notes on a scandal " has a production deal with disney a movie about the trials and tribulations of refugee kids on a soccer team seemed like a perfect fit for the family oriented studio so that evening mr roybal fired off an email to the agents from uta mr st johns representative and international creative management inc which represents the times "todays article is probably one of the best pieces of journalism we have read in years " wrote the executive adding "it deserves all the inevitable acclaim and accolades it will certainly accrue " for a three year lock on the rights to the article and the life story of the key figures which he hoped included the coach and the kids mr roybal offered a total of &# million plus a possible cut of the eventual movies box office revenue executives at columbia pictures a sony pictures label were also working fast the companys two production presidents had conversed about the times story over email during the day and the studios chairman amy pascal had told them to start bidding their initial offer presented late sunday a total of about &# million a hair above where mr rudin had opened the auction according to someone with knowledge of the figures shortly thereafter universal lobbed in a formal offer teamed with the production companies stuber parent which had produced "the break up " and the kennedy marshall company which made "the bourne identity " dreamworks skg a viacom inc unit was also in the mix offering &# for story rights and &# earmarked for scholarships and soccer equipment for the kids the studio would offer another &# to the kids if the movie got made mr st john was at home in new york when the inquiries started pouring in a birmingham ala native he had come across the coach through a tip from a reader of his first book an account of football fan culture called "rammer jammer yellow hammer " that was published in ms mufleh agreed to tell her story and last summer hed made a deal to write a book version of it now due to be published in early last week uta made a deal to represent ms mufleh in the sale of her "life story" rights effectively making her and mr st john a package deal along with the rights to the times article itself as the week wore on the bidding escalated sony had joined with mark gordon who produces the television series "greys anatomy " and will smith one of hollywoods most bankable actors and the head of a production company the star of sonys current release "the pursuit of happyness " based on a true story about a former homeless man and his struggles as a single father mr smith was eager to call ms mufleh and kick around some ideas as a producer but the coach was turned off by the idea because she feared having the story overly glamorized by the hollywood establishment so mr smith backed off "why would will smith want to talk to me " says ms mufleh on reflection a spokeswoman for the actor said he couldnt be reached for comment one concern among the bidders how to deal with the kids themselves although ms muflehs experiences were at the heart of the story a movie that got specific about individual children would require their life story rights as well rights that werent on offer by uta according to a person familiar with the matter dreamworks for example backed out when it was told that its offer with money earmarked specifically for the soccer players wasnt structured correctly ms mufleh wanted the children in the movie to be generic dreamworks executives were told rather than based on the actual kids ms mufleh confirms that she wanted to make a movie with generic kids in order to avoid the divisiveness that buying the life rights to just a few true stories could create ultimately with an upfront offer of &# million against a total of &# million sony had the highest bid say people who were involved with the process but the brass ring went to universal which in addition to a compelling financial offer had a couple of other inducements including a no strings charitable donation and a seasoned female producer kathleen kennedy who had produced "schindlers list " among other films late tuesday that studio was told it had won the deal and in a show of goodwill uta donated part of its commission to the kids a spokeswoman for the times confirmed that the newspaper had sold the story adaptation rights to universal and that it would be splitting the proceeds with the coach and the reporter with a significant portion also going to a foundation that assists clarkstons refugee community ms mufleh says she plans to put most of her cut of the total &# million payment into a foundation she established for the kids given that a number of equipment drives have been launched for her team since the times article ran she adds the most immediate need is for a permanent soccer field and a physical space for the kids to study in "i never thought it would get up to &# million " ms mufleh says "but its kind of humbling to think people think that our story is worth that much to me it says theyre going to make it and tell it right "
