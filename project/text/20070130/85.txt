taking aim at small caps in the last months the u s capital markets have started to take a serious interest in aim the london stock exchanges market for smaller growing companies despite being in its th year of operation the timing of this awakening in the alternative investment market is not surprising companies on or joining aim have been raising record amounts of capital to help fund their growth &# billion in if aim were an exchange in its own right it would rank sixth in the world by money raised last year a growing number of american based companies are among those benefiting from increasing investor interest in companies on aim in the last months alone u s companies have joined raising &# billion between them the london stock exchange is delighted to be helping smaller u s companies obtain international investment capital to fund their growth as it has for so many companies from the u k and increasingly from across the globe and we are very encouraged by the positive reception aim is receiving across the u s at various meetings and seminars we have attended what is the attraction in some quarters of the u s capital markets participants are crying foul making two broad points first they complain that aim is engaged in an act of regulatory arbitrage with which they cannot compete second they dismiss the companies that aim is attracting as somewhat substandard neither assertion is even close to the mark throughout its development aim has had one clear overriding principle it is centered on providing smaller growing companies with a capital market that meets their distinct requirements regulation on the market has been designed to balance these needs with those of investors who require adequate regulatory comfort this philosophy marries the high standards of initial and ongoing disclosure that have become the hallmark of londons markets with relatively liberal entry criteria no prescribed size no track record requirement and no minimum free float the role of the "nominated adviser " or nomad is central to the operation regulation and success of aim the nomad which is usually a brokerage firm investment bank or accountancy firm is responsible for assessing an individual companys suitability to join the market and must then be available to advise the company about its ongoing compliance with the aim rules the london stock exchange approves firms to operate as nomads and regulates their conduct retaining a nomad is an ongoing requirement for all companies on aim the pursuit of high quality regulation without the imposition of high quantity regulation and an overly prescriptive rulebook appears to be gaining currency in the u s glenn hubbard john l thornton and hal s scott in their "interim report of the committee on capital markets regulation " state that "the sec and self regulatory organizations should engage in a more risk based process focused explicitly on the costs and benefits of regulation " aims regulatory system has worked very well in its first decade and the exchange is in the process of completing a regulatory consultation which is intended to ensure that aim has the appropriate regulatory context for further strong international growth in its second decade confidence in the quality of this regulatory model can be gauged by the levels of institutional investment in the market when aim was launched the pioneers were retail investors and small cap specialists as the market has grown and matured the ever larger sums of money being raised have been supported by an increasing amount of institutional participation in the market in the last months for example institutional investment in aim has risen to up from investors include recognizable names such as fidelity merrill lynch asset management goldman sachs and amvescap these levels of institutional investment are critical to understanding aims success the &# billion raised by companies on the market in the last year is significant in its own right but when considered in light of the fact that the average market cap of a company on aim is only &# million this number is truly remarkable so what of the companies choosing to float on aim as a market for smaller companies which are often at an earlier stage in their development cycle or less diversified there will inevitably be a number of companies that do not succeed this however reflects the greater economic risk associated with investing in small companies not any regulatory risk associated in investing in aim and greater specific economic risk is offset by the potential for higher returns take the top five u s performers on aim each one has seen its value grow more than by coming to the market the aggregate value of u s companies on aim has grown since listing one of those top five u s performers is clipper windpower a california based company that develops and produces wind turbines it came to aim in september raising &# million in the process since then it has raised an additional &# million these funds have helped the company to grow rapidly and clippers share price has risen threefold lehman brothers acted as its nomad fidelity and threadneedle asset management are among the institutional investors being on aim clipper windpowers shares trade alongside other companies considered to be in the alternative energy sector small innovative companies are a powerful engine of economic growth they create employment and new sources of wealth for society and some of them will grow into the blue chip giants of tomorrow regardless of sector or geography such companies are welcome in london this is the story of aim mrs furse is chief executive of the london stock exchange
