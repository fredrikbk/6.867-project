pro bono lawyers create a politically charged problem at guantanamo in his intemperate complaint against deputy assistant secretary of defense charles stimson "ignorance " "malice " "egregious " "hapless" for lamenting the pro bono representation of guantanamo detainees by elite law firms law professor and former solicitor general charles fried misses critical distinctions "mr stimson and the american way " editorial page jan first the construct "presumption of innocence" applies only within the machinery of the legal system there is no general epistemologically mandated presumption of innocence individual citizens who are occasionally better situated to make a determination of objective guilt or innocence than a jury are entirely free to make their own judgments and to act accordingly their decisions dont have the weight of the legal systems but that does not mean that they are inaccurate or devoid of justice in a broader sense second although defendants have the right to effective assistance of counsel there is no requirement for a lawyer to represent any particular defendant firms retain discretion and the guantanamo detainees already have the assistance of competent and often combative u s military counsel the corporate client has every right to question a firm as to why it would choose to represent a khalid sheikh mohammed and it is not their duty to facilitate lawyers in the implementation of representational aspirations would prof fried rest easier if the identities of such firms were kept in the dark third the pro bono work here does not exist in a vacuum studies suggest that such work by large law firms leans strongly toward leftist causes no topic today is more politically charged than the bush administrations episodic efforts to wage a muscular assault on islamist terrorism it is illegitimate to shut down evaluation of any political motives behind pro bono representation here through recourse to the talisman of "assistance of counsel " finally while assistant secretary stimson as counsel of a party to the guantanamo proceedings might have violated professional ethics that is of no general interest in contrast whether corporations should subsidize such representations especially if its politically motivated is a matter of broad public concern not least to the corporations themselves and notwithstanding the heart warming news from prof fried that as currently arranged the lawyers have "a satisfying way of life " thomas a connolly new york charles fried makes several good points about lawyers representing difficult and controversial cases as part of the history of the united states however one point he seems to have missed or perhaps deliberately omits from his discussion is the fact that all those cases he cites were cases where lawyers from various walks of life represented american citizens terrorists confined at guantanamo bay are not u s citizens and should not be considered privileged to be protected by our laws our constitutional rights or american lawyers these people were not just innocent bystanders trapped on a battlefield they were captured by american forces or others as battlefield combatants who wore no uniforms served no recognized government and who are still a threat to the u s they are human beings deserving of some legal protections but the military tribunals provide those protections in accordance with the will of congress and within the power of the president to define unfortunately too many people in this country forget that our rights and laws work only within the boundaries of this country these folks might want to consider what good our lawyers have done for those americans captured by the same kind of people they deem worthy of representing at guantanamo bay i do not recall our miranda rights being read to any americans as they were being beheaded or tortured to death gerry j dail west lafayette ind i concur with mr frieds noble aspirations for lawyers its interesting that the practice areas of the prominent firms defending guantanamo prisoners fail to note experience in military tribunal law though a few tout white collar defense or government investigations its also interesting that so few of the firms tout this work on their pro bono web pages presumably these cases are being handled by former military lawyers no doubt large percentages of the graduates of schools from which these firms recruit turn down the high law firm salaries for a temporary stint serving their country in the judge advocate general corps even so it seems they would be out of practice in the field but perhaps it does not matter as it is unlikely these particular clients will sue for malpractice that this is done pro bono means that the firms corporate clients are subsidizing these activities j h colter lindon utah
