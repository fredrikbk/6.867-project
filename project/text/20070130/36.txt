health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q how many calories do i have to burn to lose one pound s s a a pound is equal to calories in theory this means that if you are maintaining your weight right now cutting your intake by calories a day will cause you to lose one pound a week or if you exercise enough to burn calories a day and reduce your caloric intake by calories you should also lose a pound a week unfortunately that math doesnt always work that way inside the body thats because the body has all kinds of compensatory mechanisms that kick in to defend your body weight and hold on to as many calories as possible our bodies are designed to maintain weight when food is scarce and gain weight when food is abundant a problem in a society where food is plentiful and supersized if you cut too many calories your body reacts by slowing down the metabolism so that it can operate on less fuel so if you started off eating calories a day and cut back to you should lose a pound a week but if your body shifts gears and starts to run just fine on calories a day then its going to take you two weeks to lose that pound exercise further complicates the diet picture when a person starts exercising the body also starts to compensate to make up for calories lost to exercise the natural tendency is to eat more even if you stick to your diet the body still finds ways to steal calories back you may move a little slower in the morning or take just a little longer to get out of your chair and once you start exercising your body becomes more efficient so you might burn off calories per mile of jogging now but as you get used to the exercise you may only burn off calories per one mile jog and heres another problem once you start losing weight your body gets smaller and needs fewer calories to operate after losing some weight youll likely need to cut even more calories because your baseline caloric need has shifted downward all of this sounds like a losing battle but really its an argument for why crash diets dont work for most people cutting enough calories to lose a half pound to a pound a week is a modest change and your body wont go into starvation mode even though exercise often doesnt make a dramatic difference on the bathroom scale regular exercise is good for your heart clears your head and is proven to prevent weight gain q thanks for your article about the high calories in restaurant foods there is a real paucity of information available about caloric information at most restaurants how many calories in a slice of pizza an egg roll a gyro chicken tikka masala pad thai and a bagel with lox and cream cheese n p a its a worthwhile exercise to look up the calorie content of some of your favorite restaurant foods the best bet is to go to the restaurants own web site and look for nutrition information but when that isnt available search around on the web and other restaurant web sites to get a sense of the calorie count of various foods the book "restaurant confidential " by michael f jacobson and jayne hurley is always a good resource a slice of cheese pizza has about calories depending on the size but if its a deep dish version add an extra calories for the extra crust egg rolls are only about calories but they are deep fried and about fat for the same calories and a lot less fat you can have four steamed veggie dumplings a gyro sandwich packs a whopping calories a serving of chicken tikka masala has about calories and is also loaded with fat you can have a large portion of tandoori chicken for less than half the calories a serving of pad thai noodles has about calories the calories in a bagel with lox and cream cheese varies depending on the size of the bagel an einstein bros plain bagel has calories and a "schmear" of salmon and cream cheese has calories per tablespoon since most people glob on the topping you should probably estimate at least another calories the high calorie content of restaurant foods doesnt mean you shouldnt enjoy them but knowing what youre taking in at a restaurant will help you cut back early in the day when you know youll be dining out email questions to tara parker pope at healthjournal wsj com
