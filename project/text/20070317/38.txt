hot topic iraq will congress force withdrawal congress took the first steps toward setting a date for withdrawing soldiers from iraq this past week even as president bush called for more troops in iraq and afghanistan house speaker nancy pelosi spent the week rallying her party around a war spending bill that would aim to bring troops home by september the bill marks a significant shift from last months symbolic vote against the presidents surge to more concrete action the president meanwhile announced he will send support troops on top of the original surge of and called on congress to provide war funds without "strings attached " recent opinion polls show that while of the public opposes the troop buildup only of the public supports congressional action to restrict funding to send more troops compared with strongly opposed heres a closer look what have the democrats proposed democrats have been divided over how far they should go to stop the war with some calling for an immediate pullout and others unwilling to set a timetable but this past week a house committee approved a war spending bill that would withdraw u s troops this year if the iraqi government failed to meet certain benchmarks including progress on sharing oil revenue and disarming militias the bill would require president bush to certify that the benchmarks had been met in july and again in october failure to meet the targets would bring some troops home by december and more by march the majority of the combat force would be withdrawn by sept to build support democratic leaders dropped a provision requiring the president to seek congressional approval to conduct military operations in iran and loosened another designed to derail the troop surge the &# billion spending package also funds democrats domestic priorities including veterans and childrens health care will the bill become law probably not even if the house and senate passed the bill they wouldnt be able to override a presidential veto in the house the bill may pass narrowly on a party line vote but the senate likely would reject the measure this past week sen ben nelson d neb sen mark pryor d ark and sen joseph

one the pentagon will run out of war funds in the next few months so why are democrats taking this approach elected officials who steered congress to end funding for the vietnam war note that congress made more than different attempts in a two year span to put a stop to the war and that it ended when republicans not democrats pressured the president the current jockeying previews a bigger battle likely to take place later this year when congress and the president decide on next years budget the bills also seek to pressure moderate republicans whose call for withdrawal could challenge the president to negotiate an exit timetable especially if the surge doesnt reduce violence in iraq is the surge working early signs show progress bomb deaths have decreased in baghdad since the security crackdown began one month ago and execution style killings have been cut in half according to associated press figures but military officials have cautioned against overly optimistic assessments insurgents could be waiting out the military buildup and real gains may not be known until iraqis are more comfortable with their government and police forces how long will the current surge last the presidents plan has boosted the fighting force in iraq to about unless the president sends more troops or extends the current rotation those levels will probably fall by the end of the year defense secretary robert gates had initially indicated that the surge could end this fall but military leaders have suggested recently that higher levels should remain into early next year that could pose problems because u s ground forces are already thinly stretched of the additional five brigades called up in january only two have arrived in iraq and the last may not be in place until may the surge has cut short the time soldiers typically have in between tours of duty nick timiraos points of view this is a major moment in the history of ending the iraq war " sen russell feingold d wis "setting
