shorting out fast money crowd embraces etfs adding risk for individual investors exchange traded funds are a simple way for small investors to take a stake in broad market segments like china or precious metals brokers often tout them as an affordable alternative to traditional mutual funds but buyer beware the funds also are heavily used by the fast money crowd such as hedge funds and big wall street traders combined with the effects of a hour market and the unusual inner workings of etfs that trading can distort prices on days such as feb and march when the market swooned some investors who sold amid the turmoil got significantly less for their etf shares than the underlying assets were worth mutual funds known as index funds and etfs both generally attempt to track the performance of broad indexes such as the s&amp p in the u s decades ago an investor seeking to match those indexes would have had to purchase shares in each of the companies separately today they can own shares in an index fund or an etf an etf has some advantages unlike index funds whose prices are set once daily an etf can be traded during the day as with regular shares traders can buy options on an etf or borrow etf shares and sell them in a bet that they will fall in price thanks to these features etfs have turned into a powerful tool for wall street pros on many days some of the most actively traded issues on the new york stock exchange and other u s markets arent regular stocks theyre etfs the largest etf manager barclays global investors estimates that of trading in its funds is carried out by big investors like hedge funds investment pools that cater to the wealthy even vanguard group the mutual fund giant that built its reputation by serving individual investors has started marketing its own etfs directly to hedge funds the waves caused by these traders emerged starkly on feb first stock prices tumbled in china u s markets opening after china closed picked up on the trend and also fell sharply this succession of events caused uncertainty about the proper price for u s traded etfs that track asian markets "the bottom line is nobody knows where taiwan is going to open" the next day says michael crinieri head of etf trading at goldman sachs group inc one etf managed by barclays global investors that tracks the chinese stock market closed the u s day on feb down even though the index it was tracking had fallen just during chinese trading hours that index fell another the next day in china although etfs are often advertised as an easy way for investors to jump in and out of the market those who sold during the u s day would have lost significantly more than the actual index they thought they were mirroring to be sure theres a flip side those who bought during the u s day got a bargain price still the basic problem remains etf prices came unglued from the stocks and markets they are designed to track the problem can occur even without time zone complications perhaps because of a frenzy among those trading the etfs or because the prices of the underlying assets arent as up to date as etf prices on feb the share price for a precious metals fund offered by powershares capital management ended the day below the actual value of the funds holdings etfs have taken off in the past five years during a period of relative calm in global markets their popularity has soared among individual investors and some are starting to show up in k retirement plans industry executives argue etfs are a good idea on the whole because they provide traders large and small with strategies previously unavailable to them the added flexibility could help the market adjust more quickly in stressful times and mitigate another style crash proponents say patrick oconnor head of portfolio management for barclays ishares line of etfs says its pointless to expect an etf to precisely track an overseas market that isnt trading because of a time zone difference an etf delivers its real value during seesawing markets he says by serving as a "price discovery vehicle" a way to find the best collective guess of investors about where those markets will move the next day if the guess turns out to be wrong thats the way it goes says mr oconnor "we all wish we could have a crystal ball " he says so long as markets calm down any big discrepancies are cleared away in a day or two on feb etfs continued trading normally during the markets gyrations and their prices swung to reflect the ebb and flow of investor sentiment mr oconnor notes "i understand how investors can be confused" by temporary price disparities he says but "etfs and ishares worked exactly as designed " thats news to scot stark a financial planner in freeland md who frequently uses etfs for clients he says he sold shares in the china ishares etf for six of his clients on feb the etf had gone up more than since he bought it for them in late june and by p m that day mr stark was ready to exit "that day was the day we happened to eliminate our position " says mr stark but "we hadnt noticed differences nor had we been informed of any pricing discrepancies " he says "it is actually very surprising " the extent of the price distortions in february was also a surprise to dan culloton a morningstar inc analyst who follows etfs it should be "a wakeup call to investors " he says "so far in the great etf boom what largely has been talked about is their flexibility efficiency and ability to track their market " he says but on volatile days in the market he now believes investors need to be extremely careful about using etfs for short term trading regardless of the sales pitch there are about etfs in the u s holding about &# billion in assets while thats tiny compared to roughly traditional mutual funds which hold some &# trillion in assets etf assets are growing much more quickly many of the newest etfs are targeted mainly at professional investors vanguard is famous as a pioneer of the s&amp p index fund which is popular among mom and pop investors but vanguard now offers etfs as well and last year started marketing them directly to hedge funds vanguard executive martha papariello says the company is trying to expand to new audiences while an index fund may be good for individual investors etfs are useful for sophisticated investors using fast trading strategies "that nobody would have looked to traditional index funds to meet " she says unlike etfs traditional mutual funds cant be sold short the strategy of selling borrowed shares in hopes of profiting by buying them back later at a lower price also most mutual fund companies penalize rapid trading by shorting an etf traders can easily make big bets against a market sector such as energy or biotechnology companies or an entire foreign market from germany to malaysia a mutual fund is priced just once a day based on the value of the underlying holdings the vanguard index fund tracking the s&amp p for example is priced in the late afternoon new york time and reflects the closing prices of the stocks in the index all buy and sell orders from the previous hours are settled at that daily price by contrast an etfs share price is determined by buyers and sellers in the market and may diverge from the value of the funds holdings when an investor puts in an order to buy or sell an etf through a broker the money doesnt go directly to the fund company small orders are typically carried out through a stock exchange large trades go to traders called market makers who are authorized to create or redeem shares of the fund from scratch in the market thats an unusual power market makers in regular stocks cant create or eliminate a share of say general electric but they can if its a share of an etf powerful players such as big brokerages on wall street try to profit from pricing gaps goldman sachs has a team of five traders sitting amid the bustle of goldmans massive trading room stories above new york harbor who specialize in taking advantage of discrepancies as they quote prices to clients if goldman creates etf shares to sell to a big hedge fund it will attempt to sell the shares at a slight markup to the price at which it thinks it can purchase the underlying assets it cant go too far of course as goldmans mr crinieri notes other market makers would step in to offer a better deal any big spread is likely to be narrowed quickly amid the bustle of buying and selling the exception when markets are fast moving and volatile then it can be hard for market participants to immediately grasp what the "correct" price is feb was one of those exceptional days when trading was heavy and etfs got considerably out of whack with their underlying assets between p m and p m more shares of the ishares emerging markets fund changed hands than usually trade in an entire day driving the activity was "really short term traders like hedge funds " says veteran fund manager mark mobius of franklin templeton investments a hefty portion of the activity was short selling on the china ishares fund the equivalent of three months of typical short selling activity was compressed into one day staffers at matthews asian funds a mutual fund company in san francisco say they were glued to their computers by the drama in the china ishares fund usually the funds managers focus on the long term not hour by hour movements says matthews fund manager mark headley "were not into the trading minutiae" unless "we see something this big " he says by the end of the day etf traders were betting that stock prices would take another big hit when overseas markets reopened the ishares emerging markets fund lost even though index it tracks had fallen only in its most recent close as a result an investor selling &# of the barclays ishares emerging markets etf would have received &# less than if the fund had tracked its index directly the value of the underlying portfolio updated to reflect movements for those shares traded during u s daytime hours would also have been &# greater than the amount the investor received for his etf conversely investors buying the etf at the right moment would have picked up a bargain there were disparities even for etfs consisting exclusively of u s traded stocks the russell index of small company shares fell that day but the ishares russell index etf that tracks the index fell in large part because like other etfs it trades for minues longer than regular stocks funds tracking gold and oil similarly diverged from their indexes in all that day of the etfs tracked by morningstar fell short of their portfolio value by more than plus or minus is generally considered normal of those about of those fell short by more than the ishares malaysia etf one of the most actively traded etfs despite the relatively small market closed below its value on feb the ishares etfs tracking countries like singapore hong kong south korea and taiwan all closed about below their portfolio values ultimately it turned out that the big traders were wrong while overseas markets continued to lose ground it wasnt the expected bloodbath reflected in etf pricing traders were so far off on the barclays ishares china fund that even though the underlying index fell on feb the price of the china ishares etf actually rose in u s trading that day as traders reversed their overly pessimistic pricing it was the same story for the emerging markets ishares where the index fell but the fund gained significant etf price discrepancies also occurred last tuesday when the dow dropped points or almost that day etfs closed at or more above their portfolio values seven others closed below their portfolio values by more than shefali anand contributed to
