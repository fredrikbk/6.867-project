should boards control or support corporate management tom perkins the self proclaimed geek is degrees out of phase in his march editorial page commentary "the compliance board " he says ideal corporate governance should be in control of management in both his "guidance and compliance models " and any mix thereof boards in reality must be in support of management otherwise managers have no function and his management by board committee protocol prevails mr perkinss venture capitalist background of being on site each week or every other day is why the term vulture capitalist was coined his goal of fattening up the golden goose for stockholder benefit is an inept silicon valley model that is contrary to the greatest wealth creating strategy known to man build a management team that serves a customer innovates and works full time at directions and strategies and long term wealth creation will result supporting the directions professional managers choose is what boards do they do not provide direction they ask questions such as have you considered or what should be done first or what budgets will be required by when if research and development cant sell its ideas to management and a professional board they must go back to the drawing boards until they can no geek second guessing is required a geek belongs at a bench not seated at a board table tom perkins and the business dinosaurs he cites belong in the press box where they now sit writing about the action on the field they no longer are qualified to play on jack falvey londonderry n h mr falvey is a business owner independent corporate director and long time adjunct faculty member of the university of massachusetts at boston mr perkins overlooked an important variable that should influence the composition and function of every board the style and content of the ceo mr perkins would agree that when venture capitalists "design" the boards of the companies they fund a key consideration is the ceos experience and talents adjusting the "guidance" and "compliance" contents of a board to complement those of the ceo should be the primary consideration when composing the board of any company public or private constantine anagnostopoulos ph d retired lead director genzyme corp chairman kereos inc mr perkins offers a brilliant analysis of two divergent but essential roles for the corporate board not surprisingly this concept isnt reflected in the longstanding state corporation laws that mandate the establishment and responsibilities of directors reflecting on my own experience as a corporate general counsel i pondered whether overseeing the selection and retention of outside law firms would be best suited for a guidance board or a compliance board my knee jerk reaction placed this squarely in the latter camp with todays overwhelming emphasis on rules and regulations while a corporations lawyers both internal and external must bear the brunt of responsibility for legal compliance this narrow perspective on lawyering can also harm a companys success but reflecting on recent lawsuits against general counsel over options backdating and other matters i would strongly recommend that mr perkins and other members of guidance boards devote more time and effort to the initial selection and ongoing role of external lawyers and law firms rather than rely exclusively on the general counsel to make these choices such boards should identify strengths and weaknesses within their company and ensure that the legal department and outside law firms complement these as necessary for many companies legal decisions encompass a wide range of potential "bet the company" decisions and the robustness of the lawyer selection process may subtly influence the outcome the board must recognize that law firms are big businesses with well defined cultures and complex global operations and that they impose their knowledge and judgment into the selection process to ensure the most favorable outcome in other words share the guidance gary rindner founder lawperiscope chappaqua n y
