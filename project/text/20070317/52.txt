pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state freezing wine i have a summer cottage in nova scotia two winters ago i mistakenly left a case of wine in the house when i closed it up for the winter upon returning in the spring i realized what i had done a couple of the bottles of white had shattered but none of the red i assumed all were undrinkable indeed what remained of the white was but the reds were not only drinkable but some seemed to have improved from the experience the freezing of it seemed to add several years of aging have you ever heard of anything like this kevin burke minneapolis we have never frozen wine intentionally and when we have frozen it unintentionally the bottles have broken or the corks have been pushed out so we cant respond to your question from personal experience we can tell you though that harvey steiman in "wine spectators essentials of wine " recommends freezing leftover wine "wine does lose something when frozen and thawed mainly tannin and acidity " he writes "but the flavors remain intact " if hes right about losing tannin and acidity we can understand how this might have the same effect as age in some cases though its not something wed recommend as regular practice so we contacted harvey weve known him since we all worked at the miami herald in a previous millennium and asked him about this interesting question he responded "like you i would never recommend freezing wine to age it but i do freeze already opened half full bottles that i cant drink within a day or two some acidity drops out of suspension in the process visible as tartrate crystals and some phenols as well including tannins and some flavor but the loss of flavor is much less than in a bottle left at room temperature or fridge for a couple of days the result certainly can mimic the effects of aging also its possible that your bottle lost some unwanted flavors in the process making it seem better " starting a wine journal since we moved to washington state weve gotten more into wine my wife urged me to start a wine journal i thought about it and came up with the following the wines are classified in three ranks which we call "economie" up to &# "moyen" &# to &# and "classique" &# and up the listing is by winery name wine type year and a grade on a to scale were having a lot of fun looking at wine tears sniffing and making comments like "hints of oak and cinnamon " richard shilling and barbara k henon shoreline wash readers often ask us how to start a wine journal so its great to hear from someone who has we began a journal years ago and still enjoy looking back on those notes which also remind us of great dinners and old friends your own journal doesnt need to follow anyone elses form all that matters is whats easiest and most comfortable for you similarly dont feel that you need to dredge up all sorts of wine geek words to describe wines especially at first if you keep doing this you will find that your descriptions and language grow more complex in time and thats fine remember that you are writing this for yourself so the only descriptors that matter are those that make sense to you and will still resonate years later if a wine smells like aunt jennys barn to you it doesnt matter that no one else knows what that means because its a description that youll always understand and wed guess its a burgundy
