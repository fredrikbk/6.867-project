disney says pixar options were backdated walt disney co concluded that options at pixar inc were backdated before its acquisition of the computer animation studio but said no one now associated with disney committed "any intentional or deliberate acts of misconduct " the statement appeared to indicate that steve jobs a disney director and pixars founder wont be faulted by disney over a pattern of suspicious options grants at pixar mr jobs helped negotiate an employment contract at pixar with a key employee that included options priced at the annual low in pixars stock price according to a person familiar with the matter it remains unclear what role if any mr jobs played in selecting the grant date backdating options dates without telling shareholders can be a federal crime as a number of corporate officers have recently discovered friday the former controller of defense contractor engineered support systems inc became the ninth executive charged criminally in a wide ranging corporate scandal over options he reached a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to a false statement charge disneys announcement provided no explanation of how the backdating occurred who was responsible or which options were improperly priced the company acquired pixar last year top executives of pixar had received stock option grants priced at the stocks annual lows in and mr jobs helped negotiate a contract with noted film director john lasseter that awarded him options that carried the lowest share price of the previous year on a date more than three months before the contract was actually signed mr lasseter now disneys chief creative officer of its animation studios couldnt be reached for comment a spokesman at apple inc where mr jobs is chief executive said he wasnt available for interviews disney first disclosed in november that it had received inquiries from the securities and exchange commission and justice department about past stock option grants at pixar bob iger disneys chief executive said then that the disney board was conducting an independent review into the matter which the company friday said had been completed disney said it has been cooperating with both federal agencies the u s attorneys office in san francisco which has been investigating stock options granting practices at both apple and pixar has been awaiting the results of the pixar investigation according to people familiar with the matter a spokesman for the u s attorneys office friday declined to comment in december apple said that mr jobs "was aware or recommended the selection of some favorable grant dates" at apple but that its own internal probe found no wrongdoing an option gives its holder the right to buy shares at a future date at a fixed price usually the market price on the date of the grant by backdating the grant to a previous date with a lower price the value of the award increases in the engineered support case steven landmann who earlier this year had settled civil fraud charges filed by the sec entered his guilty plea in u s district court in st louis according to the prosecutors filing charging mr landmann he "was the executive instructed to backdate options by senior executives at engineered support systems " mr landmann the filing said "followed those instructions " prosecutors didnt name the other executives along with mr landmann the sec had earlier charged engineered supports former finance chief gary gerhardt people familiar with the matter have said prosecutors are looking closely at the former chief executive michael f shanahan sr and his son michael shanahan jr who had been a director neither mr shanahan has been charged mr landmanns lawyer didnt return a call seeking comment a lawyer for mr gerhardt didnt return a phone message a lawyer for the elder mr shanahan couldnt be reached for comment james martin a lawyer for the younger mr shanahan said there was nothing in the plea agreement to suggest executives knew they were acting improperly let alone criminally "weve never seen any evidence that would indicate any criminal intent " mr martin said engineered support was acquired last year after the time of the alleged misconduct by drs technologies inc of parsippany n j a drs spokesman didnt return a phone message according to the document charging mr landmann the unnamed senior executives "took actions to avoid detection " including backdating letters that accompanied option grants to make it appear that the letters had been created around the time of the grants the false statement charge against mr landmann suggests that prosecutors may have a wide berth to bring cases against executives in the broader backdating scandal mr landmann is charged with making a false statement because of lines in the companys annual report saying among other things that options were granted with a price equal to the stocks value on the day they were granted they werent the authorities allege and were instead backdated to earlier days when the stock price was lower handing the executives extra value
