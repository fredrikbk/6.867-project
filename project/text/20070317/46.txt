pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies reasons to cry what a gory stupid hit says about the movies and us after the stunning success last weekend of " " a hyperviolent hypo human version of the battle of thermopylae that earned &# million in three days i came across a quaint remark by lena headey the flagrantly attractive actress who plays gorgo queen of sparta her queen ms headey said in an interview is "not unlike the queen the helen mirren queen in terms of her emotional reserve " yes and "" is not unlike "the blows" in terms of using numbers in its title it is also unreservedly one of the most assaultive and thunderously lumbering films ever projected on the big screen on more than screens last weekend including really big imax screens a sword sandal and splatter epic that manages the trick of being blood soaked and utterly bloodless at the same time all of this may be unsettling for moviegoers of a certain age i e the age of discernment but the import of the box office numbers cant be ignored and not just those rung up by " " after the heady days of the holiday season when theaters actually welcomed adults with grown up fare were back in the dog days of winter spring when primitive comedies like "wild hogs" last weekends no or "norbit" eddie murphy as a monstrously obese woman can make a killing still the remarkable performance of "" as distinct from the unremarkable performances in it represents something new hollywoods studio executives have been awestruck by how far the r rated film soared beyond expectations tracking had suggested an opening weekend of &# million to &# million and fascinated by the details of warner bros pictures marketing strategy which depended heavily on the internet "snakes on a plane" was a web nurtured prodigy that failed to fulfill its promise "" delivered the goods in prodigious numbers now its a certified cultural phenomenon with fanboys and fangirls proclaiming almost in unison that this epic battle between spartans and zillions of digitized persians is one of the greatest movies ever made if it isnt and it isnt "" is not the worst movie ever made either the visual distinction of the source material a graphic novel by frank miller has been enhanced rather than lost in translation as cultural phenomena go though this one is pretty dispiriting because its so clearly predictive of things to come the movies eerie quality of disembodiment in the midst of disembodiments a succession of amputations eviscerations and beheadings that makes "apocalypto" look like a walk in a jungle theme park isnt a failing of the low rent cast its a function of the cost effective process which combines live actors performing against blue screens in limbo a perfect term for the films prevailing emptiness with computer generated backgrounds instead of physical sets the imperative here is the one thats sweeping the movie industry as a whole meet the dual challenge of the web and videogames by morphing into a version of both but raise the gaming stakes with bigger images louder music and bolder brutality than any home entertainment medium can provide where then does that leave us i dont mean the movie critics of the world for its equally clear that were irrelevant to the commercial fate of mass marketed movies like "" such ventures will have their way or sometimes not with audiences that are willing or sometimes not to follow the lead of the marketing machinery i mean the movie lovers of the world people who prefer exercising their brains and opening their hearts to being pounded on the head though also enjoying on occasion heart pounding action or imax adventure it leaves me feeling the way i often feel when im walking on times square oppressed to the point of physical pressure by the gigantic blank monoliths that have transformed the place in recent years but grateful that a city of distinctive neighborhoods survives beyond them the transformation of the movie business will proceed at its own unstoppable pace still dramatic films of distinction will survive albeit in some modified form just as news and public affairs programs essentially banished from commercial tv are being reborn and finding a new audience as feature documentaries good movies came our way in surprising numbers last year despite the rising tide of dreary junk one hopes this year will bring more and less of the same and moviegoers including younger ones arent always into one thing to the exclusion of all others after my review of "" ran a reader emailed me to say that her year old son thought it was in point of fact one of the greatest movies ever made but that he also loved the masterful new german drama "the lives of others " precisely because it struck him as slow and old fashioned maybe theres hope for us all morgensterns picks elephants on parade elephantine movies like "" come and go though seldom with such immediate impact a classic example from the s is the elizabeth taylor richard burton version of "cleopatra " which was lumbering but also entertaining then there are elephant movies here are two good ones plus another with elizabeth taylor king solomons mines the scenery is the star of this adventure with stewart granger as a great white hunter of elephants and deborah kerr as an englishwoman on safari its great old fashioned fun provided you can get

taylor as a trophy wife on a tea plantation in ceylon no one has ever accused this film of greatness or even very goodness still its nice to watch liz compete successfully with the exotic scenery as
