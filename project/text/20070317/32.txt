hot topic peanuts for petraeus to understand why the founders put presidents in charge of war fighting look no further than the supplemental war spending bill now moving through the house everybodys a four star in congresss army and every general wants his own command especially if it includes cash for the troops er campaign contributors too bad none of this bears any relation to what real general david petraeus is trying to accomplish in iraq not that we dont sympathize with defense secretary nancy pelosi she won the majority in part by riding antiwar sentiment and now her antiwar ranks are demanding satisfaction so shes moved beyond the political evasion of "non binding" resolutions and is trying to attach binding legal restrictions in spending bills on president bushs ability to conduct the war this is the strategy she and general jack murtha have worked out trouble is some of her sincere antiwar members dont think even this goes far enough and want to cut off funding for the war immediately wisconsin democrat david obey recently referred to this crowd as "idiot liberals " a phrase weve often longed to use but thought a tad unsubtle and double trouble is speaker pelosi also has more moderate members from swing districts who wouldnt be caught dead voting to de fund the troops they dont want to be seen "micromanaging" the war either to quote tennessee democrat jim coopers apt word this angst was also on display this week in the senate which rejected similar stop the war now language as all but one republican held and three democrats defected so whats a leader of congress to do to get a majority you know the answer let the vote buying begin thus has mr bushs request for &# billion to fund the troops in iraq and afghanistan plus &# billion to replenish the disaster relief fund devolved into a &# billion logrolling extravaganza you can get the flavor from the bills very first words on page two "title i supplemental appropriations for the global war on terror chapter department of agriculture foreign agricultural service " forget the marines send in the meat inspectors this bill has everything the modern military doesnt need theres &# million for spinach designed to attract the vote of sam farr a california farm region liberal perhaps spinach growers who lost business due to last years e coli scare need this taxpayer bailout but it wont intimidate the taliban unless mr farr plans to draft popeye other lowlights include &# million to restore farmland damaged by freezing temperatures and &# billion for livestock farmers and dont forget the &# million "to ensure proper storage for peanuts " an urgent national security need this happens to be about the same amount that house democrats propose to increase spending for operations of the army reserve so its good to see congress has its priorities in order then there are the provisions to raise the minimum wage at one pace for the continental u s but at a separate slower pace for the northern mariana islands and &# million for "urgent wildland fire suppression" thats forest fires not weapons fire theres so much more if only the press corps would take the time to look this pork barrel blowout is grounds enough for a presidential veto but the vote buying is more important for what it says about congress and the way it wants to micromanage the war any legislature is essentially a committee of special interests each of which wants to be massaged this is true of war strategy as much as farm policy the goal isnt victory in iraq but "victory" on capitol hill which means cobbling together a majority of in the house and in the senate logrolling and micromanagement are two sides of the same coin of the legislative pentagon in any case democrats still arent taking any real war responsibility instead of cutting off funds right now which would at least be a policy they kick the issue down the road by imposing "benchmarks " so unless the iraqis meet certain conditions set by congress by july and october of this year u s troops will have to redeploy at once and finish within days and even if these earmarks sorry benchmarks are met all u s troops must begin to retreat by march all of this is flatly unconstitutional but far worse it is an insult to the troops in the field if iraqs parliament somehow gets bogged down like congress on de baathification or dividing up oil revenues american troops have to end their mission so general petraeuss war strategy is made hostage to two legislatures in baghdad and the beltway once the u s retreats american forces would then be permitted only to fight al qaeda and "other terrorist organizations with global reach " so the army colonel leading a strike brigade would have to think twice or consult his lawyers about just what constitutes "global reach " did abu musab al zarqawi qualify since he merely called his outfit "al qaeda in iraq" democrats are trying to appease their antiwar left by attaching a thousand bureaucratic and legal strings rather than being accountable with an up or down funding vote as mr obey told those "idiot liberals" in a moment of candor caught on camera he believes this "bill ends the war " just not honestly meanwhile on the baghdad battlefield general petraeus is moving ahead and signs of tentative progress are visible shiite death squads are laying low or leaving town so casualties are down the new oil law looks like a political breakthrough that would share revenues with all parts of iraq based on population success isnt certain but the democratic congresss only contribution is to make victory more difficult
