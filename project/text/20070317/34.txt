journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources europe why chiracs presidency left the french yearning for something completely different facing an economic crisis seemingly without end frances anxiety over the future has reached a level of "veritable collective depression " declared a presidential candidate in the run up to the election those words were spoken not by one of the current front runners vying to enter elysee palace but by jacques chirac years ago on the eve of his ascent to the presidency given how deeply in tune mr chirac was with the countrys mood it is startling to consider how badly he has fared in putting the nation on a new course the economist says for visitors to france it can be hard to understand the countrys malaise against the backdrop of "high speed trains well stocked municipal flowerbeds and sit down lunches " and aspects of frances highly centralized model of government have been hugely successful delivering in addition to world class public transportation both high quality health care and efficient nuclear energy but unemployment during mr chiracs tenure has averaged while economic growth lags behind britain and ireland frances public debt has grown faster than any other country in the european union for many french those numbers have been experienced as a pervasive sense of economic insecurity as well as a sharp disdain for political leaders in the past two years france has been swept by riots by underprivileged youth in depressed suburbs and mass protests against proposed changes to employment laws so where did it all go wrong much of the blame rests with mr chiracs "non confrontational risk averse" approach to governing that the economist says has characterized french political leadership for years so focused on staying in power mr chirac has resisted seeking sweeping change one of the hallmarks of mr chiracs difficulties is in how little influence he appears to have over who his successor will be if mr chirac had spent the past years revitalizing the economy instead of clinging to the presidency the economist says the country might not now be "yearning so keenly" for someone different the economist march technology why telecommuting remains rare in japan south korea japan and south korea have some of the worlds most advanced broadband access but few workers are able to take advantage of the technology by logging on from home that is because corporate culture in much of asia remains deeply conservative and a high value is placed on face time in the office despite superfast internet connections that put the u s to shame many companies discourage telecommuting and working remotely in addition the confucianist philosophy that plays a big role in parts of asia prizes group effort and consensus building over individual initiative team members are more likely to stick around the office to get tasks done than to try to go it alone from home or during the commute consider the stark difference between packed commuter trains in tokyo or seoul and those in the u s while american workers often aim to maximize their productivity by tapping out emails on blackberrys or working on their laptops koreans and japanese are more likely to be using the latest digital devices to play videogames or send messages to friends the different approaches crop up in the countries technology marketing too u s cellular companies emphasize how their services can boost productivity while asian companies stress the "fun factor " an aversion to telecommuting extends to some of asias high tech behemoths with such companies as canon inc and samsung electronics putting restrictions on remote work the result is that workers often end up toiling at the office until midnight and coming in on weekends too one samsung executive laments that "in my dictionary theres no such thing as work life balance as far as weekdays are concerned " security concerns add to the pressure to confine work to the office in both japan and south korea companies fret about sending workers home with laptops that contain sensitive information businessweek says an influx of foreign companies to the region along with the rise of a new generation of managers might slowly chip away at the pressure for on site productivity it could come down to the bottom line japan and south korea spend more than most nations on research and development but productivity of information technology users lags far behind u s levels businessweek march cuisine at worst dyed red cake offends the eye not health the growing popularity of artificially colored red velvet cake makes some people shudder but our aversion to dyed food makes little sense the recipe alone for scarlet hue velvet cake "stains our conscience " says daniel engber an editor at slate but there isnt any evidence that dyes affect taste or health industrial dyes have very little flavor of their own skeptics should try a blind taste test on the other hand natural colorants say tumeric to impart a little yellow or crimson derived from a cochineal insect do alter flavors moreover chemical dyes such as red no undergo stringent safety testing they pose no more of a risk to human health than regular foods do still some epicures say the bright colors of chemical dyes should be avoided simply on the basis of their garish fakeness mr engber responds that food connoisseurs have an outdated idea of what makes something natural few chefs feel shame at adding a pinch of saffron or pureed parsley to brighten a dish
