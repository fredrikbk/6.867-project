the weekend interview with fred thompson lights camera candidacy new york expect her to recount every moment of her ordeal " the savvy district attorney mused to his deputy "there wont be a dry eye in the jury " "thats a take " says a director of the hit nbc series "law and order " with that fred thompson the former u s senator from tennessee who has played "strict constructionist" prosecutor arthur branch for the past four years walks back with me to his dressing room to talk about a new role he might soon be undertaking surprise republican presidential candidate it is a slightly surreal setting to be talking big league politics but not unprecedented in ronald reagan held early strategy meetings on his nascent race for governor of california on the set of "death valley days " in arnold schwarzenegger stepped off a plane from a world wide publicity tour for his last "terminator" film and immediately huddled with advisers on his own campaign for governor both men effectively used their celebrity status to completely transform the races they entered so too may fred thompson when we meet on thursday night its only been four days since he appeared on fox news to merely announce he was "looking at" running chuck todd the political director of nbc news notes in amazement how "a retired senator can show a tiny bit of interest and literally shake up the race overnight " and he is shaking up the race every gop candidate is nervously watching the reaction to his possible entry j c watts an oklahoma congressman from to has endorsed him "i define fred thompson as ac whats ac all class " fan blogs for "law and order" note that since the show is especially popular among women a thompson race could help close the gops "gender gap " the most pithy comment is from west virginias former bluefield mayor craig hammond he told the bluefield news "hes the tall timber weve been waiting for hes the total package he can hold the red states and pick up a few blue ones along the way " but mr thompson appears serene about all the speculation swirling around him "those running are all good guys and would be good presidents " he says leaning back in a recliner "but there are truly vital issues from the looming entitlement crisis to nuclear proliferation im not afraid to talk about lots of people have such a low regard for politicians that theyre open to a campaign that would be completely different " so how would a possible thompson campaign be distinctive "politics is now one big hour news cycle but we seem to spend less time than ever on real substance " he muses "what if someone harnessed the internet and other technologies and insisted in talking about real issues in more depth than consultants would advise what if they took risks with their race in hopes that the risks to our children could be reduced through building a mandate for good policy " children are a lot on mr thompsons mind especially his own in he lost his daughter after she failed to come out of a drug overdose induced coma already frustrated with the senates endless maneuvering over minutiae he decided to retire at age only two months later and change his life in june of that year he married his second wife jeri his first marriage at age ended amicably in divorce in in they had their first child a second was born last november "within the space of a year and a half i experienced the ultimate tragedy and the ultimate happiness " mr thompson sighs "i count my blessings and i have a real focused sense of purpose now " that brings us to some of the knocks critics have about his possible parachute drop into the "survivor " competition bluntly put fred thompson had a reputation for being lazy in wanting to do the political chores that come with office people openly question if he has "the fire in the belly" to really make a serious race "they used to say i moved slowly " he chuckles "but i move deliberately i won every one of my races by more than points in a state clinton carried twice " but what about his well known reputation for dating up a storm as a bachelor senator in washington in the s "i plead guilty " he says "but everyone i knew is still a friend and if somehow they arent i guess wed hear about it im happy with my life partner and children now " on issues he addresses head on the major complaints conservatives have about his record he was largely stymied in his investigation of both clinton gore and gop campaign fundraising abuses key witnesses declined to testify or fled the country though evidence eventually surfaced of a chinese plan to influence u s politics he wont argue with those who say he showed "naivete" about how he would be stonewalled in his investigation he says hes wiser now many on the right remain angry he supported the campaign finance law sponsored by his friend john mccain "there are problems with people giving politicians large sums of money and then asking them to pass legislation " mr thompson says still he notes he proposed the amendment to raise the &# per person "hard money" federal contribution limit conceding that mccain feingold hasnt worked as intended and is being riddled with new loopholes he throws his hands open in exasperation "im not prepared to go there yet but i wonder if we shouldnt just take off the limits and have full disclosure with harsh penalties for not reporting everything on the internet immediately " mr thompson has also been criticized for failing to back some comprehensive tort reform bills because of his background as a trial lawyer here he insists his stance was based on grounds of federalism "im consistent i address federalist society meetings " he says noting that more issues should be left to the states for example he cast the lonely "nay" in votes against a national blood alcohol level for drivers a federal law banning guns in schools and a measure limiting the tort liability of good samaritans "washington overreaches and by doing so ends up not doing well the basics people really care about " think katrina and walter reed indeed the federal governments inability to function effectively would likely be a major theme of any thompson campaign "audits have shown weve lost control of the waste and mismanagement in our most important agencies its getting so bad its affecting our national security " mr thompson says that while a senator he was long concerned with u s intelligence failures "the cia has better politicians than it has spies " he says referring to the internecine turf wars that have been a feature of the bush administration a key problem mr thompson notes is a general lack of accountability in government where no one pays any price for failure when asked about president bushs awarding the medal of freedom to outgoing cia director george tenet after u s intelligence failures in iraq became apparent he shakes his head "i just didnt understand that " the next president according to mr thompson needs to exercise strong leadership "and get down in the weeds and fix a civil service system that makes it too hard to hire good employees and too hard to fire bad ones " he doesnt offer specifics on what to do but notes the "insanity" of the new congress pushing for the unionization of homeland security employees only five years after it rejected the notion in the wake of "should we tie ourselves up in bureaucratic knots with the challenges we may have to face " he asks in wonderment the challenges he says are numerous on iraq he admits "we are left with nothing but bad choices " however he says the "worst choice" would be to have osama bin laden proven right when he predicted america wouldnt have the stomach for a tough fight the costs of iraq have been high but they could be even higher "if we have another stain on america like that infamous scene from saigon in which our helicopters took off leaving those who supported us grabbing at the landing skids " mr thompson is especially worried about nuclear proliferation he serves as chairman of the international security advisory board along with former clinton cia director jim woolsey and former democratic sen chuck robb the board recently received an unclassified briefing that convinced him three or four countries in the middle east are "on the cusp" of acquiring nuclear weapons should the iranians carry through with their own weapons program he urges continued pressure on iran which he says has grave domestic problems "iran may fall of its own weight and we can help that by offering vocal support to dissident groups and making effective use of the airwaves to reach its people " on domestic issues mr thompson says a major reason republicans lost last november was that they aided and abetted runaway government spending yet democrats he contends are incapable of following through on their pledges to be fiscally prudent "their political coalition needs more revenue like a car requires gasoline " he laughs "reagan showed what can be done if you have the will to push for tough choices and the ability to ask the people to accept them " but mr thompson says those tough choices shouldnt include the tax increases contemplated in the new budget released by senate democrats this week "the phony static accounting the government uses has obscured just how successful the tax cuts have been in boosting the economy " he says "lower marginal tax rates have proven to be a key to prosperity now by kennedy reagan and bush its time millionaires serving in the senate learned not to overly tax other people trying to get wealthy " i note that despite his humble background as the grandson of a sharecropper and son of a used car salesman mr thompson himself is now quite wealthy so how would he campaign against democratic millionaires he used to serve in the senate with such as hillary clinton or john edwards he smiles and says he has plenty of zingers and points he would make but its premature to discuss them mr thompson says he can compete with democrats in talking plainly about the anxiety many americans have about the economy despite good macro numbers "someone who is today may well have employers in their career " he says "thats completely different from how their parents lived i would address that insecurity and help people adapt without shooting ourselves in the foot with protectionism and income redistribution i had employers before i finished law school " fred thompson clearly hasnt decided whether to run for president and he underestimates just how much the traditional fundraising he disdains may be necessary for his long shot campaign but he has assets that add up to an impressive portfolio as republican counsel in the watergate hearings he began building a reputation as a straight shooter it was he who asked the question that forced a white house deputy to admit that richard nixon had secretly recorded his oval office conversations later in the s he played a key role in exposing a tennessee cash for pardons scandal his acting career began when he won the part of playing himself in the movie version of the story today his national exposure is greater than ever with a dozen of his movies playing as tv repeats all of this month he is substituting for radio legend paul harvey whose show is heard on more than stations indeed it is his need to wake up at a m the next morning so he can tape three harvey segments before returning to the law and order set for a long day of shooting that prompts mr thompson to close out our chat "with my current schedule i might have more time to myself if i gave all this up and did start a campaign " he says as he dons a sports coat and heads for his car so many voters remain unsold on any of the current gop contenders that mr thompson just might trade his tv sound stage for a campaign microphone as this is the first truly open republican nomination fight in decades the party might as well revel in the competition it claims to cherish in other parts of life mr fund is a columnist for opinionjournal com
