pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations the trouble with loyalty it was a sparkling and unusual event a dinner that was as interesting as a democrats the talk was culturally broad if sober "life is real and earnest" and as handsomely done as a republicans the flowers were white crisp so expertly arranged they seemed a natural outgrowth of the mirrored table life should not only be grumbled about but celebrated in new york in the second gilded age the age of the thousand dollar pizza wealthy democrats when they entertain seem careful not to have things too physically perfect it might suggest theyre unserious that their thoughts are not always focused on the oppressed wealthy republicans on the other hand will go all out to make it lovely "the oppressed i make jobs for them " as for being thought unserious one senses it does not trouble them they made money in the world they correctly apprehended the lay of the land and moved that serious enough for you we were marking a birthday i was seated next to a politically experienced businessman an acquaintance of many years he kept talking about the presidential race i asked who hes supporting he was surprised i had to ask "hillary " he said i nodded "tell me why " i said "ive known her for years " he said "im a loyal person " i waited for him to say more but he didnt "your reason for backing her is that youre loyal " "yes " he said as if that were enough i was puzzled youre loyal so what you have a virtue good but that doesnt mean the person youre loyal to should be my president thats not enough and i said this in a more polite and less concise way which made him defensive "you should talk " he said "you were loyal to reagan " "no i wasnt " i said "i agreed with him " i didnt know reagan when i went to work with him i only knew his views and philosophy and supported them i wanted him to succeed because i wanted what he stood for to succeed in time i came to feel personal loyalty but agreement came first and if in his presidency reagan had turned into some surprising weak tax raising government growing soft on soviets guy i would have stopped backing him i would have thought him very nice and a bit of a dope like jerry ford i wouldnt feel i had to hold high his memory and meaning loyalty has nothing to do with it not if youre serious or rather personal loyalty has nothing to do with it but the loyal are all over the place this year there is a blight of them the old friends and colleagues and neighbors the former roommates theyre bundling from downtown to the bronx theyre leading the cheers in the audience the other night at a big giuliani fund raiser in midtown manhattan when he said "and if i become the president " a woman standing in the middle of the audience jumped up and bellowed "you will " to great applause and i thought i bet she worked with him at justice a few months ago i had coffee with a new acquaintance whos a longtime friend of a republican candidate he wanted to tell me of his candidates virtues offer insight his guy was honest a leader theyd been young men together hed seen him up close i didnt doubt his sincerity but so far i didnt see why the candidates virtues were dispositive why i asked should he be president the man was surprised and said "well hes a great guy " what does he want to do as president i asked what exactly will he do the man blinked and looked away "i want to think about that " he said he thanked me for bringing it up in a half hour more of talk he never answered why is the personal loyalty blight a problem one reason is the one hannah arendt pointed out the obvious one "total loyalty is possible only when fidelity is emptied of all concrete content from which changes of mind might naturally arise " but another is that the personally loyal seem more powerful than ever money is more important than ever a big war chest leaves a candidate able to intimidate and communicate the war chest comes from money raisers the money raisers are often the personally loyal and the loyal are driven not by a seriousness about ideas proposals or policies but by a seriousness about the candidate himself and what the candidate will do for the contributor once hes elected president ambassador smith no fcc chairman smith smith head of the american delegation told reporters " its all human and traditional and understandable but this year of all years its not enough and its certainly not enough for the candidates its never enough for them there is the story of the politician who accused a follower of never being loyal the follower was nonplussed "but i always support you when i think youre right " he said "anyone can do that " said the politician "i want people who support me when im wrong " theyre all like that and they all have reason for being like that theyre in a hard business in the past personal loyalty has been more a democratic thing than a republican one democrats used to like politics more than republicans so its no surprise theyd like its practitioners more republicans used to be conservatives conservatives think politics is a duty not a joy democrats took their leaders more seriously as personalities as people they emotionally invested more in them fdrs people gave themselves to the boss and went on to write the wonderful compelling story franklin and eleanor he a flighty state rep she a flutey voiced duckling both of them born to and comfortable in wealth then illness growth personal drama he gets sick and finds his strength she becomes independent and finds her voice how many books films and made for tv movies have we seen of it all written by democrats who were more eager to see the life as a reason for their loyalty republicans used to be a cooler sort they got excited by the philosophy by what the guy would do in office if he pleased them in these areas they were more than happy to find hed lived an interesting and inspiring life and tell you about it in books it is better to see activists driven by philosophy than by personalities better to be faithful to the cause than to individuals with whom you merely have a history better to have fidelity to principles and not to political figures no matter how interesting or compelling they are
