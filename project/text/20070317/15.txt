cross country iowas job thieves marshalltown iowa its the third sunday of lent and deisy garcia her month old son jesus heavy in her arms is praying for one thing and one thing only her husbands release from the polk county jail "i am an american citizen a taxpayer and a homeowner " she says through an interpreter at a meeting hall in st marys catholic church "my husband has no criminal record he is a good worker and a good father but still the government is trying to deport him in mexico we have nothing everything we have is here " jesus father year old alejandro vazquez is one of more than local swift &amp co meatpacking employees arrested last dec the arrests were made during an early morning raid by homeland securitys immigration and customs enforcement better known simply as ice the marshalltown workers were among some taken into custody at six swift plants nationwide and charged with working under fraudulent social security numbers and other false documents those with no prior immigration violations were given the option of voluntary deportation without criminal charges a plea agreement or an appearance in federal court mr vazquez unwilling to leave his wife and child behind chose his day in court in the months since homeland security agents stormed the largest employer of this quiet midwestern town the community has done its best to help those left behind and mend the fissures that were opened or in some cases widened by the raid "were a community of some people " says mayor gene beach "of that population to are immigrants both documented and undocumented in the school system its nearly " after the raid mr beach says "our first and foremost concern was whether there were children out there without a parent coming home we tried to get the names from ice through our state senators but because some were working under false names it was difficult but we did find a way with the schools help to find them according to the mayor local churches businesses the united way and the red cross all came together to try to lessen the blow for families affected by the raid "i think people helped out no matter what their stand on immigration they were just people helping people at that point " sister christine feagan of st marys hispanic ministries was instrumental in organizing the relief efforts under her supervision the church served as a clearinghouse for more than &# in donations including &# from swift &amp co that was distributed through the united way "there are scores of stories like deisys " says sister feagan "some of these people are charged with the federal crime of identity theft but these social security numbers werent stolen they were bought and in most cases the person whose number is being used for work is benefiting " shortly after the raid lori chesser an iowa immigration attorney told the des moines register much the same "its not even the immigrants selling these things in most cases " she said referring to the social security numbers "its u s citizens trying to make money off the immigrants " in the immediate aftermath of the raid marshalltown was inundated with members of the press from national news outlets "they really wanted us to say that the raid tore the town apart " says mayor beach "and when you didnt say that they werent as interested in covering the story " but the mayor explains "the truth is it hasnt torn the town apart we do have immigration issues and there are differences of opinion but its an issue that the city council and chamber of commerce cant solve its got to be solved in washington " ken anderson president of the marshalltown chamber of commerce notes that there are more than latino businesses in his city "weve been dealing with this issue for over a decade " he says "we dont have a choice but to work hard to integrate our growing immigrant population into the community cities like ours dont have the luxury of sorting out whos documented and who is undocumented that is a federal jurisdiction " in the s midwestern states saw a dramatic increase in the number of latino immigrants many migrating from more traditional destinations in the u s such as california florida or texas according to a study by researchers at the washington d c based urban institute for instance iowa and minnesota saw growth rates of foreign born residents explode by and respectively the influx has shown no sign of slowing since then theres a joke in iowa that the states biggest exports are corn and people with an aging population and young people going elsewhere for opportunities meatpacking construction manufacturing and other low skill labor intensive jobs are being filled by immigrant workers documented or not "there has to be a way to manage demand " says mr anderson of the chamber of commerce "this economy is demanding this kind of workforce and our immigration system just does not match what is required by our economy " raids like the one on swift &amp co have made it clear to many in this country that congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform including a rational guest worker program and improvements in the basic pilot program that meatpacking and other industries use to verify the legal status of workers until that reform comes we can expect more raids arrests and deportations what that looks like at ground level is a lot different than the abstractions debated by talking heads on cable shows or in the flickering images on a tv screen "when most people think of illegal immigrants they think of people crossing a river or a desert in the dead of night " says mayor beach "but that all changes when the person being hauled off in handcuffs is your neighbor your worker your friend " as it stands now alejandro vazquez has little hope of rejoining his son jesus in marshalltown "they havent set a trial date yet " says ms garcia "but were told theres nothing we can do for him when i became an american citizen i began the application process to make my husband a permanent resident i hired an attorney and paid him money but found out too late that he never processed the papers i dont know whats going to happen next
