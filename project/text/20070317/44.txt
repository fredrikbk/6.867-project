pursuits books physician hear thyself a medical experts prescription for colleagues hurry less communicate more how doctors think by jerome groopman m d houghton mifflin pages &# what kind of doctor do you want a no nonsense decision maker who tells you within minutes whats wrong and what you need to do to fix it or a caring communicator who listens at length expresses his own doubts and outlines a variety of treatment options after reading jerome groopmans enlightening and invaluable "how doctors think " i switched my preference like many people who visit a doctor i had become accustomed to waiting an hour for a minute visit with a lab coated technical expert who did a cursory exam wrote a prescription and headed off to the next case that was good enough for me now thanks to dr groopman a new yorker magazine contributor whose credentials include a harvard chair in medicine and a clinical practice at beth israel in boston ive set my sights higher in this book he pulls off the admirable hat trick of demystifying medicine giving patients the tools they need to improve their dealings with healthcare professionals and challenging readers to examine their own assumptions about the medical world he begins by focusing on the process of diagnosis a complex art that combines intuition science and communication skills when done well diagnosis often yields an accurate guess about the cause of a malady thereby laying the groundwork for its cure diagnosis is the starting point of medicine and it begins as dr groopman tells us the moment a doctor sees a patient within a few seconds of coming face to face most physicians are already forming an idea of whats wrong gauging skin tone breathing posture tics energy level and a variety of other physical cues with a few glances and a quick scan of the chart they begin to move toward a diagnosis before a word is spoken the conversation that happens next the "tell me whats wrong" talk between doctor and patient is the heart of dr groopmans book "how a doctor thinks " dr groopman writes "can first be discerned by how he speaks and how he listens " it is here that you can tell what sort of doctor youve got and it is here that things sometimes go awry dr groopman cites the observation that within an average of seconds most physicians interrupt their patients stories cutting them off or redirecting their comments and often leading them toward what the doctors already think is the most likely diagnosis once physicians take their first steps down this diagnostic path the rest of the conversation and later tests tend to hew to it as information is tailored in subtle ways to support what has become a foregone conclusion in the meantime other possible reasons for the patients complaints tend to be ignored or sidestepped this is the fast track to diagnosis and it is often right unfortunately as the author notes thats not always the case dr groopman includes a welter of examples that demonstrate how diagnoses can go wrong theres the woman in her early s who felt so sick after eating that she started forcing herself to vomit she was diagnosed first with anorexia nervosa and then with irritable bowel syndrome a year later when she reported discomfort in her pelvis she was told by physicians that the pain was just a manifestation of the syndrome nothing made her feel better it took years and visits to countless physicians before she finally got a correct diagnosis a food allergy as dr groopman shows the ways that diagnoses can be mistaken are endless from the physically fit park ranger whose chest pains were diagnosed as muscle strain and not the heart attack they became to the alcoholic sailor whose ailing liver was damaged by an inherited disorder rather than cirrhosis "how doctors think" focuses on how these errors occur the book shows harried modern physicians pushed by drug salespeople inundated by data from sensitive testing equipment like mris and cat scans haunted by the specter of malpractice suits and struggling to stay up to date on fast changing methods even when they make a practice of listening closely to what patients tell them doctors are understandably tempted to take mental shortcuts this is especially true when they are faced with patients exhibiting vague or chronic complaints or symptoms that dont seem to make sense and then theres the problem of increasingly sophisticated lab reports that might conflict its all too easy dr groopman says to rely on statistical probabilities fall back on comfortable conclusions and make mistakes much of the books appeal lies in its interesting array of real life medical mysteries including dr groopmans own personal odyssey when he saw specialist after specialist in an attempt to find a treatment for his ailing hand his trouble turned out to be a ligament problem that didnt show up on mri scans or x rays ultimately it was corrected by surgery or at least his hand was restored to of normal dr groopman sensibly points out that this is a reasonably good result surgery patients too often expect "to be restored to pristine condition more often than not that is unrealistic " in the end "how doctors think" is about a lot more than just that its about how we all think its advice can be applied by anyone who has to reach tough decisions in difficult circumstances at moments when our egos or professional standing are involved in decision making when the pressure is on when we have to rely on incomplete and conflicting information when people are looking to us for guidance thinking like a doctor can be an excellent prescription mr hager is the author of "the demon under the microscope from battlefield hospitals to nazi labs one doctors heroic search for the worlds first miracle drug "
