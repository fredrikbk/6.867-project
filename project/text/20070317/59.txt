pursuits recreation a rift runs through it the boo boys had a sweet deal making legendary bamboo fly fishing rods and dropping their tools when the trout were jumping then modernity intruded twin bridges mont when glenn brackett talks about fishing rods the boo boys listen when mr brackett says he can feel the soul of the universe bend with the arc of a finely made bamboo rod the boo boys agree when mr brackett says a mans spirit goes into every piece of cane he shapes the boo boys know exactly what he means and if mr brackett is in the mood to listen to the grateful dead while he works the boys usually agree that the dead is just right mr brackett is widely considered one of the worlds best builders of high end bamboo fishing rods the boo boys boo is short for bamboo have worked with him for years and they treat him like a rock star he is a short soft spoken man of with white hair and beard and pinkish cheeks the sort of person who can walk into a noisy bar and make the place seem as calm as a library a little more than a year ago quite suddenly mr brackett announced that he would no longer build fishing rods for r l winston co his place of work for more than years naturally the boo boys jerry kustich jeff walker and wayne maca said they wouldnt either they resigned from winston and made plans to set up their own business along with mr brackett across the street from the cozy little workshop where they all thought they would continue to labor for the rest of their lives or at least until they were so old that life seemed too short for anything but fishing thus a new company sweetgrass rods was born and along with it the biggest controversy to hit the laid back world of fly fishing since the advent of fiberglass today collectors are scrambling to buy mr bracketts old rods at ever rising prices and fly fishermen who prefer bamboo wait anxiously to see whether either company can produce rods with the sweet touch that was associated for so long with both winston and glenn brackett a lot of fly fishermen come to twin bridges mont where the beaverhead ruby and big hole rivers come together to form the jefferson and where a two lane road cuts quietly through ruby valley at the foot of the tobacco root mountains they come for trout tranquility and coffee that still costs less than a buck a cup r l winston co created in moved here in from san francisco in large part because its two owners at the time wanted to be where the fishing was good one of those owners was glenn brackett the art of bamboo is a subtle one rod builders cut spaghetti thin strips from the woody rind of a bamboo stalk plane and glue the strips together to form whats called a blank then wrap the blank with fine silk thread before applying varnish and attaching the cork grip and reel seat the finished product is a wondrous sight delicate yet strong and polished to a honeyed glow if pressed the men can build a rod in working hours but during fishing season when distractions abound production can slow dramatically bamboo adherents say they like the rods for their line and loop control for their beauty and for a certain sense that each cast connects them with the arc of the sports history winston typically sells about bamboo rods a year at up to &# each but even in a good year sales arent enough to affect the companys bottom line an estimated two million americans consider themselves active fly fishermen the overwhelming majority of them fish with rods made of graphite which are lighter more powerful and more durable bamboo winston officials say accounts for far less than of total sales in the movie "a river runs through it" helped advertise the sports serenity and contributed to a modest business boom for rod makers since then sales have steadily slipped the more popular the graphite rods became in recent years the more mr brackett and his grungy boo boys came to embody winstons public image they worked with their hands invited fishermen visiting the area to sit by their sides and cracked open cans of beer after long days of labor they made customers feel as if they were buying a magic wand that could transport them back in time with a single stroke before long however winstons corporate culture changed in mr brackett and his co owner tom morgan sold the company to david ondaatje a fly fishing fanatic from canada who now lives in southern california mr ondaatje said he loved everything winston stood for but he also believed the company needed to grow and change some of mr ondaatjes first moves worried the boo boys he hired a ceo who had spent much of his career with general electric and had no background in fishing he moved the company out of its garage size workshop and into a state of the art factory down at the end of twin bridges main street and he began pushing new rod designs intended to help winston compete with its cutting edge rivals not everything changed no one tinkered with the bamboo designs and when the boo boys said they didnt want to move to the new factory they were permitted to stay in their old workshop mr ondaatje and his new ceo continued to stress that the winston name would stand for quality and attention to detail they held firm on their commitment to sell only in select fly shops even though they could have boosted distribution by going through big retailers still the boo boys felt the wind had shifted winston later decided to have some of its low end rods built in china a move that the company said had no effect on jobs in montana winston employs about full and part time workers making it far and away the biggest employer in twin bridges population alone in their old shop mr brackett and the boo boys became isolated physically and psychologically from the rest of the company they blamed the new ceo mike "woody" woodard for creating what they described as a bean counter mentality some of the boo boys handed out bumper stickers that read "to really cut costs outsource the ceo " "they wanted to make the corporate thing more overpowering than the artisan thing " says jerry kustich who worked part time in the bamboo shop making &# an hour "we just decided that at our ages it wasnt worth sacrificing everything we thought was important " mr woodard saw matters differently he says the bamboo craftsmen seldom worked more than hours a week and enjoyed long vacations the company let them go at their own pace never pushing them to increase production "i could never understand why they left " says mr woodard a tall gray haired man who wears jeans and winston fleece pullovers to work "these guys had the softest jobs " both sides agree that the split came in the fall of when mr brackett tried to hire an apprentice someone to replace jeff walker who was planning to leave to pursue his other business interests and someone who would eventually carry on the tradition as winstons chief builder of bamboo rods mr woodard wouldnt allow it mr brackett offered his resignation when mr woodard accepted it mr brackett was shocked "nobody said wait " mr brackett recalls "i didnt mean for my departure i always imagined staying in place and dying at the bench the winston bench " but the line had been snapped and neither side was inclined to try to repair it the boo boys followed their leader and soon after announced the creation of sweetgrass rods mr walker offered to house the operation in his garage they painted it green with orange trim and came up with a logo that shows two fish swimming in a yin yang symbol as word spread through the fly fishing community that winstons bamboo craftsmen had split off the boo boys phones started ringing some collectors were eager to buy the last remaining rods built during mr bracketts tenure at winston others asked when the first sweetgrass rods would be ready before long sweetgrass had orders for more than rods which even if theyd been running at peak capacity likely would have taken them two years to fill but for a long time neither sweetgrass nor winston were capable of building anything sweetgrass lacked the inventory and equipment and winston lacked the know how for the better part of a year there were no bamboo fly fishing rods at all coming out of twin bridges the boo boys admit they hadnt realized how much work would go into starting their own business and assembling all the equipment needed to build rods to their standards mr woodard says he was determined that winston wouldnt ship any bamboo until he was certain that the product was at least as good as those previously made by mr brackett and his team one recent winter morning with snow blowing through the valley and wind whistling against the windows messrs brackett kustich walker and maca were bumping around their new shop along with four good natured dogs of various sizes and colors a newly acquired band saw was slicing thin wedges of bamboo and spitting out sawdust while jerry garcia strummed on the stereo the men were once again doing what they loved the boo boys have refused to take deposits for rods until theyre more certain of when theyll begin shipping product they hope to complete their first rod next month if all goes well they might ship this year the great irony of their fallout with winston given how repulsed the men are by big business is that their move turned out to be a brilliant bit of marketing as word spread through the fishing world that mr brackett had parted ways with winston over differences in philosophy it added to the rod builders already considerable mystique now theyre seen not only as defenders of an ancient craft but also defenders of made in america business values mr woodard says the departure of the boo boys hasnt affected the companys bottom line but their criticism of the company has upset many of winstons workers "the implication that no one else here is an artist has left a lot of hurt feelings " he says "theres a whole shop here full of artists " taking over the bamboo work at winston are two veteran graphite rod builders annette mclean and dave schuller and a more recent arrival named barb weyer the new winston bamboo team has shipped about rods so far ms mclean says she was worried when the first rods went out that aficionados might say they looked or felt different so far she says customers have registered no complaints orders are coming in at roughly the rate they did before the regime change she says still its clear that many fly fishermen are waiting to see how things play on both sides of the divide "glenns rods were ever so slightly on the soft side of medium " says alistair stewart a year old fisherman from chicago who owns dozens of bamboo rods and recently purchased what he believes to be the last brackett made winston rod available on the retail market "its like playing with your favorite tennis racket you know just how it behaves you can close your eyes when you fish and feel the difference " he hopes the new winston rods will feel precisely the same way in twin bridges mr woodard takes a walk every day on his lunch break going north along the bank of the beaverhead river past the sweetgrass shop sometimes he looks in the window and sees mr brackett sitting at his workbench fingering thin strands of bamboo the men wave politely at one another at times mr brackett thinks how nice it would be go to back to winston back to the company he fell in love with when he was a boy learning to fish and his father and grandfather took him to the winston shops in san francisco and introduced him to the men who worked with bamboo "id go back in a heartbeat " he says but he knows its too late for that now
