big buyout firm prepares to sell stake to public blackstone would add to its financial clout a sign of market peak the king of private equity is expected to go public blackstone group the lucrative partnership that has grown rich taking public companies private is in advanced stages of planning an initial public offering of roughly of the firms core management partnership according to people familiar with the matter an offering of that size would conservatively value the entire enterprise at &# billion such a move would give blackstone even greater financial clout including more money of its own to invest in deals but it also may signal that blackstone partners think the days of low borrowing costs and a robust stock market could be ending a share offering would offer everyday investors the benefits and risks of participating in an arena that has been the sole preserve of sophisticated institutions and wealthy individuals the largest private equity firms most of which emerged only in the past decade have had plus annual returns in recent years while bringing one household name company after another from hertz to burger king to j crew under private ownership private equity firms buy either companies or divisions of companies on behalf of their own investors take them private and then sell them off within a few years a blackstone ipo might inspire other well heeled private partnerships whether other buyout firms or hedge funds which are private investment partnerships open only to the wealthy to follow should that occur it would signal a significant shift in the very concept of "private equity " these firms which include the likes of kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co and tpg the former texas pacific group have prospered from access to cheap credit and have made a business of enticing public company ceos with compensation packages typically beyond their dreams blackstone and several rivals have been exploring ipos in the wake of the successful stock market listing of hedge fund fortress group in january the speed of blackstones decision is surprising and may reflect the belief of stephen schwarzman blackstones co founder and chief executive officer that market conditions are worsening both mr schwarzman and blackstone president tony james have in recent weeks been privately and publicly warning about a turn in financial conditions especially in terms of their own firms ability to finance acquisitions via cheap and ever plentiful financing offered by wall street banks "theyre monetizing the reputation that theyve built " said colin c blaydon director of the center for private equity and entrepreneurship at dartmouth universitys tuck business school "that often means youre at the top " by going public blackstone would gain a source of permanent capital since money raised from on the open market never has to be returned blackstone then wouldnt need to depend on endless rounds of time consuming fundraising from usual investors in its funds public and corporate pension funds endowments and wealthy families it also would gain a powerful advantage over rival bidders since once listed it could offer its stock as well as cash to finance acquisitions blackstone is nearly done raising a &# billion buyout fund the largest private equity fund ever it has about &# billion of capital under management "they can use this to further institutionalize their business and make sure blackstone is around years from now versus relying on any one personality " says christopher bower chairman of pacific corporate group blackstones plans were reported earlier by cnbc blackstones core management company a partnership of about investors has been on a buying spree and owns properties from madame tussauds wax museums and mrs pauls fish sticks to the countrys largest office landlord equity office properties trust blackstone has separate arms that invest in hedge funds and advise clients on mergers and restructurings the personal wealth created for blackstone partners by a public offering could be staggering much of the proceeds of any initial offer will likely go to blackstones two founders pete peterson a former commerce secretary under president nixon and mr schwarzman who would get the bulk of it mr schwarzman who is said to be worth upward of &# billion now could double that around blackstone the joke for years has been that the firm is like a pool table with one leg shorter than the others so all the balls gravitate to that corner that leg was said to be mr schwarzman who often keeps half of a given funds returns since he holds the biggest stake in blackstone and is its biggest rainmaker the ipo would likely allow him and other partners to cash in their stakes over time though all the key individuals such as mr schwarzman and mr james his choice as successor would almost certainly commit to stay on for some time following the listing the founders of todays buyout firms have closely studied the listing of goldman sachs some years back according to the founder of a top private equity firm they saw that goldman partners who had retired didnt reap the benefits of the goldmine they built while the investment banks ipo generated a windfall for those who succeeded them mr schwarzman along with kkrs henry kravis has become a poster child of the private equity world but while mr kravis is associated with the early raw days of private equity in the s mr schwarzman is considered the new "king of wall street " as he was dubbed on a recent fortune magazine cover his recent th birthday celebration which featured singer rod stewart and was emceed by actor martin short was the talk of new york society such a high profile though could cause a public backlash in an environment of rising anger over what is seen as excessive compensation for top executives and a widening income gap in the u s in addition should small shareholders buy into blackstones ipo it would expose them to some of the risks of private equity funds that could attract more attention in a congress controlled by democrats lawmakers are already discussing ways to potentially limit how much money pension funds can invest in hedge funds to limit the risk a fund blow up could indirectly have on retirees in addition some senate staffers are examining whether to change tax rules in a way that would force hedge funds and private equity firms to pay higher taxes on their massive profits every time a private equity firm sells one of its companies of the profits go to the management company investors in funds run by private equity firms also pay management fees of about of the money under control so for its current &# billion round of fundraising blackstone will pocket about &# million in fees in addition private equity firms get an array of fees from the companies they buy just for sealing the deal to buy equity office properties last month for example blackstone got to share a success fee of &# million paid by equity office with its investors it also gets fees for arranging financing for its portfolio companies and for monitoring them there would be plenty of irony in a blackstone public offering mr schwarzman has for years evangelized against the failings of public market ownership to companies he hoped to acquire in a series of recent public appearances he has called public stockholding "a broken system" and criticized the sarbanes oxley corporate accountability law as having "taken a lot of the entrepreneurial zeal out of a lot of corporate managers " quarterly earnings reports for public companies he has said create a "tyranny " blackstones plans may augur a deeper shift in financial markets the lines between public firms and private concerns are continuing to blur the next few years a number of wall street denizens say might see the creation of hybrid companies that exist simultaneously in the public and private spheres indeed blackstones decision is likely to lead to a race by others to follow suit carlyle kkr and tpg have all been considering a similar step according to people familiar with the situation and may be forced to imitate a blackstone ipo if only to gain equal firepower the frenzied demand for the fortress listing showed investors are willing to pay to tap into alternative investment firms at the same time though when markets are volatile the advantage of going first may be considerable blackstone carlyle and tpg learned this lesson last year when kkr listed a fund in europe that would invest in its deals demand was so strong that kkr expanded the offer to &# billion from &# billion that left little demand for anything that followed leading rivals to abandon plans to launch similar units so far boston based bain capital has been about the only large private equity firm to show little enthusiasm for going public but senior people at bain concede they may be forced to consider such a move if all their competitors do so according to people familiar with the matter the fortress experience also offers a cautionary tale however just one month ago fortress stock was listed at &# and soared to &# on its first day it now trades at &# so investors who bought at the high point have lost about a quarter of their money tennille tracy and kara scannell contributed to this article
