war stress symptoms are nothing shameful i appreciated your march editorial "free walter reed " although a few words need to be added regarding the subject of war stress and combat post traumatic stress disorder first ptsd is not a sign of weakness of any nature but rather a sign of the courage and bravery manifest by the men and women who have volunteered to defend the nation second ptsd is not the result of psychological problems nor its symptoms a manifestation of psychological inabilities to adjust to war experiences besides the profound impact that war has on the psychological and emotional life of the individual which likely will last a lifetime ptsd itself is a physiological change in the highly complex stress control systems of our nervous system whose symptoms are felt and manifest in the psychological emotional experiences of the individual the intensity of war stress experience produces the physiological change and this change keeps war experience alive within oneself unfortunately ptsd in the minds of many means that some cannot "handle" the effects of stress nor have the "moral fortitude" to go through war experience as if it never happened at best this idea is one for fools it behooves the nation to not deny the realities of war stress whether manifest as ptsd or something else and it is not only a moral and ethical responsibility to address it through our health care institutions but also a matter of national security it is an imperative for our va health care systems in particular to provide for these difficulties and even to hold administrative officials at any level who dont do so as guilty of neglect and relieved of their position although it may be difficult for a service man or woman to accept the truth is there is no shame in having war stress symptoms or ptsd it is a sign of their courage and humanity dennis h grant m d phoenix ariz
