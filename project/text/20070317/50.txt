pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink communing with irish spirits in november a few weeks after john f kennedy won the presidential election celebrated irish novelist and critic frank oconnor came to washington and blasted the millions of irish americans who "do absolutely nothing for ireland " not only didnt they support foreign aid but "they dont even drink irish whiskey " oconnor lamented "go to new york on st patricks day and everybody is out having a glorious time of it " oconnor said "the pubs are kept busy by irishmen and so theyre all serving what kind of whiskey scotch " the worst offender in the novelists book was the president elect an irish american whose father had made a killing with a franchise importing scotch at the end of prohibition oconnor urged kennedy to give up scotch and take up the spirit of erin covering oconnors remarks for the washington post was a cub reporter named tom wolfe but even in ireland irish whiskey hasnt always been poured on march it wasnt long after ireland became a free state in that the countrys senate the seanad eireann determined that there should be no drinking at all on st patricks day in november irish legislators were debating the "intoxicating liquor bill " and an amendment was offered to close all pubs on the holiday sen p w kenny a proponent said "in some circles it was looked upon as an insult to and an absolute neglect of the saint if a person did not drown the shamrock in his honour " such ritual drinking kenny proclaimed was "a direct insult to the saint " rising in opposition was sen oliver st john gogarty a surgeon and wit now best remembered as the inspiration for buck mulligan in james joyces "ulysses" gogarty protested that when st patrick came to ireland "there was no word in the irish language to explain the condition of sobriety " he bemoaned the "rigidly righteous puritanical set of cranks" who had imposed prohibition in america "temperance is an excellent thing " gogarty said "but human liberty is more important " gogarty would eventually lose the argument and for decades irish pubs were closed on st patricks day this weekend no less in dublin than in the states the irish and irish wannabes will be downing noggins of irish whiskey and for most it will be a glass of jamesons standard blend or bushmillss but choices in irish whiskey have proliferated admirably over the past decade instead of two distilleries owned by one conglomerate the way things stood until the mid s there are now three separately owned irish distilleries putting out a variety of very good and interesting whiskeys to get a picture of the new spectrum of spirits i tried two different whiskeys from each of irelands three distilleries redbreast year old pot still malt and midleton very rare blend from the jameson folks michael collins single malt and connemara cask strength single malt from the cooley distillery and bushmills year old single malt and knappogue castle from the old bushmills distillery i cant say i disliked the midleton jamesons super premium blend though it does drift perilously close to blandness i cant see myself again spending anything like its &# a bottle cost far more satisfying and affordable from the same distillery is redbreast a big swaggering malt thick and viscous with just enough spice to cut through a sweetness that smacks of raspberries the cooley distillery founded in has been experimenting with whiskeys in the scottish style using barley malted over peat fires the tradition in ireland has been to bake the grain in closed ovens before mashing it and fermenting it which is why irish whiskeys have lacked the smokiness of their scottish cousins irish distillers have also triple distilled their whiskey as opposed to the double distillation of scotch which has generally made for a lighter bodied spirit the most scottish of cooleys whiskeys is its connemara brand with the peat asserting its presence not so much in smokiness but in the taste of hospital grade iodine which isnt to say it is bad whiskey especially when judiciously diluted with water its just not what one is looking for in an irish malt by contrast the iodine is well under control in the michael collins single malt which cooley makes for sidney frank importing co the michael collins has all the doughy sweetness one expects from an irish whiskey with just enough of the medicinal astringency associated with peat to produce a wonderful balance and then there is the knappogue castle and the bushmills year old which offer a demonstration of just how much a whiskey can be affected by its time in dunnage castle brands makes its knappogue castle vintage whiskeys entirely from year old barrels of single malt purchased from bushmills yet the stuff is remarkably distinct from the year old malt that the distillery itself bottles bushmills puts some of its whiskey in used bourbon barrels and some in old sherry casks castle chooses only to use the spirit aged in the bourbon oak and even then selects barrels in which the whiskey is particularly light and delicate the house style of bushmills comes through in its year old expression honey rich and rounded knappogue castle by contrast is bright and grassy with a tremendous amount of flavor for such a light bodied spirit irish whiskeys have come a long way in a short time and a good thing too because as a character in oconnors story "the eternal triangle" says "bad whiskey is the ruination of the world " email me at eric felten wsj com irish whiskeys very good knappogue castle &# composed
