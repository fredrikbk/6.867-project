remembrances roswell brayton jr steered brand woven into u s history into st century global economy roswell brayton jr the sixth generation to run woolrich inc tried to both preserve and expand one of the nations most venerable brands known for its woolen blankets vests and red and black "buffalo plaid" shirts a family owned clothing company with a history stretching back to woolrichs business has traced american history one of the nations oldest wool mills it boasts that its blankets were "a soldiers only comfort" during the civil war woolrichs railroad vests with a watch pocket were required wear for th century railroad conductors its "pennsylvania tuxedo" popularized by cartoon character elmer fudd has been worn by generations of hunters and outdoor enthusiasts as the country became more leisure oriented woolrich sold golf jodhpurs and the full body swimsuits favored by turn of the century bathers later it manufactured parkas for admiral richard byrds antarctic expeditions but when mr brayton the great great great grandson of english immigrant and founder john rich became president in he found he had inherited a company in trouble by the late s cheaper foreign companies were making manufacturing in the u s prohibitively expensive and woolrich eventually laid off nearly of its workers one of the few places in north america outside of mexico the company could find competitive labor was in prisons where today inmates in beaumont texas and atlanta earn cents to &# an hour to sew woolrich pants for the army and fire resistant jackets for air crews mr brayton who died march at age decided the future lay not in manufacturing but in leveraging the woolrich brand through marketing it was a bold move but not completely out of character for mr brayton who at first avoided family business traditions by spending four years as a minor league pitcher in the red sox organization while his harvard classmates were starting more conventional careers on wall street he joined the company as a salesman in it was also a radical strategy for a family whose brand was less a signature than a simple statement of what it produced wool which the company sheared from its own sheep as late as the s the company was so starkly generic that its village built by workers in the pennsylvania wilderness when orders were slack was originally known as "factoryville " some of the companys current workers had ancestors who worked for it a century ago when according to a issue of the williamsport pa gazette &amp bulletin "their help live in the rich houses drink the rich water eat the rich food live a rich life are as happy and contented as any people on earth " now mr brayton proposed to do away with the mills and the factories and turn woolrich into a marketing company that licensed its brand at overseas boutiques in france italy japan and elsewhere "l l bean eddie bauer they used to be our customers " mr brayton told the associated press in "they still are but they also are our competitors because theyve become brands " mr brayton introduced catalog sales and a web site he worked to extend the brands rustic outdoorsy feel to licensing cabin style furniture and household items ranging from rustic dinnerware to bath sets decorated with oak leaves and canoes in japan where it has a more youthful image the woolrich brand appears on bicycles he bottled woolrichs abundant chatham run watershed water which once powered john richs looms for the burgeoning bottled water market he hired new york designers and for the first time in the companys history began producing wool jackets designed specifically for women instead of producing the mens designs in smaller sizes and brighter colors "now were really designing womens sportswear for people who like the feel of the outdoors people who like to garden or bird watch" he told womens wear daily in "theres a lot of opportunity for a company like us because we are truly a lifestyle brand " it is difficult to gauge the success of the shift in the same interview mr brayton acknowledged the company "maybe made a mistake" by going global later than its competitors "the company was and still is conservative " he said "then and now we have always concentrated on functional product " in the s woolrichs concession to stylish marketing consisted of items such as its "mad mod vests" and "hip fringed vests " which the home furnishing magazine hfn once said had "a look that conjures images of lumberjacks listening to the who " as a closely held company woolrich doesnt release financial statements but it claims that after several years of losses in the s it is back in the black womens wear daily estimated the companys world wide annual sales at &# million in there were few protests in woolrich pa over manufacturing layoffs in part because most cuts were made elsewhere but an uproar ensued in when the new york post reported the company had retained an investment adviser to investigate selling the company "it was terrible i had people up here crying " mr brayton told the times of london "but we decided not to sell " woolrich recently revealed plans to introduce plus size womens clothing and is considering opening a store in manhattan but with mr braytons sudden death he collapsed at his office of an apparent heart attack questions about woolrichs leadership are unresolved only one of mr braytons seven children and no other immediate family members are involved with the company a spokesman says succession plans have been made and will be announced soon he adds roswell brayton jr s
