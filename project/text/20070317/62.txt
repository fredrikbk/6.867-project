pursuits sports ncaa tournament good coach bad mentor why some top college hoops coaches are better teachers than others on the basketball court coach roy williams is something of a legend first with kansas and now with north carolina mr williams has taken teams to the ncaa tournament straight seasons but as the de facto ceo of basketball operations at those schools mr williams has fallen short in at least one key area developing the managers under him while mr williams is a march madness regular his six most prominent former assistants have had a collective appearances in the tournament in their combined years of coaching just like in the corporate world where some companies are better than others at churning out standout ceos some basketball programs are better than others at grooming good head coaches and as a look at the teams in this years ncaa tournament shows that skill doesnt always correlate with the coachs fame former butler and nebraska coach barry collier had only three tournament appearances in seasons before resigning at nebraska last year but he has more to crow about when it comes to his former pupils he helped groom ohio state coach thad matta and current butler coach todd lickliter two rising stars who both made the tournament this season mr williams whose north carolina team plays in the ncaa tournament saturday didnt respond to requests for comment at a time when the salaries of college hoops coaches are growing rapidly compensation for head coaches in the major conferences now routinely tops &# million a coachs pedigree is an underappreciated area when schools hire head coaches they tend to give points to candidates that have served under famous head coaches but not necessarily to how that coachs other proteges have fared "i just dont think they think that far down the list of analytics " says paul swangard managing director of the warsaw sports marketing center at the university of oregon "its built on reputation not science and i guess people have made bad decisions based on that " arizona state athletic director lisa love says she isnt aware of athletic directors crunching the numbers on a head coachs "coaching tree" before hiring a former assistant on paper tommy amaker looked to seton hall like the ideal candidate mr amaker learned the ropes at duke under mike krzyzewski who has won three ncaa titles but in years as a head coach four at seton hall and six at michigan mr amaker a former star guard has made the postseason tournament only once michigan didnt respond to requests for comment about its hiring decisions one reason some of these coaches dont perform like their masters according to athletic directors and others is that basketball assistants dont always get the depth of training that their counterparts in other sports get in football for example it isnt uncommon to see figurehead head coaches who delegate much of the game strategy to their subordinates and professional baseball teams have minor league affiliates that they routinely use to give inexperienced coaches some seasoning those apprenticeships tend to be deep and long it can be years before an assistant in those sports gets his first head coaching job in basketball on the other hand assistants are more apt to get pigeon holed in narrower roles says herb sendek the coach at arizona state and they dont always have to wait as long for a shot at the top job college basketball coaching staffs consist of four coaches one head coach and three assistants some head coaches of course are known for giving their assistants more responsibility jeff van gundy now head coach of the nbas houston rockets got his feet wet at providence under coach rick pitino despite his position in which he was responsible for more menial jobs like checking up on players class attendance and coordinating travel mr van gundy recalls also being expected to bring new game strategies and help coach on the floor in practice plus mr pitino would hold coaches accountable for mistakes in front of the entire team a practice that made the assistants uncomfortable but which mr van gundy says was invaluable to their development mr pitino has one of the most impressive coaching trees in all of college basketball one that is both broad of his former assistants and players have become college head coaches and deep florida coach billy donovan who is going for his second straight national championships this year was a former pitino player and assistant kentucky coach tubby smith who also has a national title and has reached the tournament straight seasons is an ex pitino assistant as well so is ralph willard the holy cross head coach who qualified for his sixth ncaa tournament appearance this season meanwhile despite hugely successful seasons as a division i coach arizona coach lute olson has produced few notable proteges the list of graduates of the lute olson academy of coaching includes such obscure names as jessie evans san francisco phil johnson ex san jose state and ken burmeister ex texas san antonio the olson coaching tree also has been beset by ill fortune former denver coach floyd theard died at in while ex northwestern coach ricky byrdsong was murdered in but perhaps the most glaring example of great success on the court and a lack of it in mentoring assistants is mr krzyzewski dukes hall of fame coach while any coach would be hard pressed to match his accomplishments three national titles and ncaa tournament appearances in the last years several of mr krzyzewskis exes have had difficulty just holding onto their jobs bob bender quin snyder and tim otoole all former krzyzewski assistants have lost or resigned their posts in recent years mike brey of notre dame another of mr krzyzewskis assistants had a renaissance season this year winning the big easts coach of the year award and reaching the ncaa tournament but only after missing it the previous three seasons sports information officials at both duke and arizona said the coaches were busy with the tournament and wouldnt be able to comment for this article
