expanding davis bacon since the great depression american labor markets have been bollixed by a statute called the davis bacon act which requires any construction project receiving federal subsidies to pay "prevailing" wages meaning union wages to its workers now the democratic congress under the aegis of a wastewater loan program is quietly attempting to extend this decree yet further the water quality financing act passed by the house late last week reauthorizes a loan fund that lapsed in for state and municipal waterworks sewage treatment water conservation projects etc if it emerges from the senate in its current form the bill is projected to cost &# billion over four years a increase over current spending levels the bill not only extends the davis bacon regulations to all federal water infrastructure projects but also to those funded solely by states economists have shown repeatedly that the artificial wage floors of davis bacon freeze low income laborers primarily black or hispanic out of competition with their union counterparts small business contractors are especially hurt by the compliance costs davis bacon also dramatically increases the cost of government projects amounting to a mandate for more spending and all for the sole justification of satisfying the afl cio according to the bureau of labor statistics only about of construction workers are unionized alas when it comes to davis bacon the default political mode is acquiescence the water quality financing act passed the house with all democrats and republicans voting in favor despite the threat of a presidential veto perhaps some of the members question the fortitude of a white house that suspended davis bacon for reconstruction efforts after hurricane katrina only to reverse itself two months later under political pressure lets hope the senate shows a willingness to stand up for taxpayers and non union shops
