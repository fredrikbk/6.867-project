application to operate an industrial loan company a form of bank citing the "manufactured controversy" surrounding its july application to operate a so called ilc wal mart friday said it pulled the request from consideration by the federal deposit insurance corp it said it would instead expand further into other financial services that dont require an ilc charter such as check cashing and bill payment amid an outcry over wal marts application the fdic had put the retailers application and others like it on hold as congress mulled whether to disallow commercial interests from owning ilcs fdic chairman sheila bair applauded wal marts withdrawal as a "wise choice " wal marts critics primarily community banker groups such as the independent community bankers of america were also pleased the group friday pledged to keep backing national legislation aimed at keeping ilcs out of commercial hands wal mart of bentonville ark had repeatedly said it intended to use the ilc only to process credit card transactions not to operate its own bank branches in its u s stores ilcs chartered by states can offer most of the same products and services as regular banks including loans mortgages and credit cards criticism from union groups community groups and some lawmakers has dogged wal marts efforts since it made the ilc application months ago the latest controversy involved its revision of the wording of its leases with third party banks in its stores to allow the retailer to eventually offer services such as mortgages and consumer loans critics alleged that the changes signaled that wal mart meant to delve further into banking than it had claimed jane thompson wal marts president of financial services described the revision as a "one word change" to terms established in the leases long ago wal mart already had begun pondering dropping the ilc bid when the fdic in january extended its moratorium on such applications by a year ms thompson said in an interview "probably of what we did had to do with the bank but it was getting of the noise " she said "we just want to put the noise behind us " wal mart said it isnt ready to divulge the new financial services it intends to launch in lieu of the ilc charter wal mart doesnt report results for its financial services business but ms thompson said the divisions sales are growing by or more annually wal mart includes its

facing constraints on its growth rate already dominant in the u s the retailer is running out of new markets to conquer domestically its u s divisions sales increased at their slowest rate last year in a decade wal marts international operations accounting for of its overall sales arent yet large enough to continually displace its u s operations as the engine generating most of its sales gains without relying on massive acquisitions that leaves adding services as as a significant way to boost wal marts revenue with banking among the most lucrative options all told the more than u s community bankers garnered income of &# billion last year according to the independent community bankers of america wal mart previously made several unsuccessful attempts to enter banking including failures in oklahoma in in california in and a failed canadian joint venture in wal marts withdrawal of its ilc application "is an acceptance that the financial services industry is not one in the u s where theyre going to redefine their market larger " said morgan stanley analyst gregory melich who rates wal marts shares equivalent to neutral and owns none a wal mart spokesman described the theory of wal mart running out of options to maintain its growth rate as "nonsense " adding that the company sought the ilc charter not to open branch banks and generate revenue but to cut transaction processing costs the fdic insures deposits for the existing ilcs which control &# billion of assets roughly half of these ilcs are chartered in utah where wal mart filed its application several other
