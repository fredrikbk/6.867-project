the week ahead our take on coming events politics will voter fatigue figure in long campaign by gerald f seib theres a spring and a summer and a fall and a winter to go before new hampshire holds its presidential primary but that wont stop john mccain from making appearances in six different towns there this weekend nor will it stop barack obama from campaigning coast to coast this weekend going from new hampshire to california nor will it stop hillary clinton from well you get the idea its well established that the presidential campaign is starting far earlier than any race in history much has been written about how many hundreds of millions of dollars will have to be raised for a campaign of such duration already republican mitt romney has committed almost a million dollars to advertising less discussed is another possible effect of the unfolding campaign marathon what are the chances it will produce broad voter fatigue with all the candidates what if americans simply grow tired of them in the long months to come in this months wall street journal nbc news poll its possible to see the dangers that prolonged exposure may carry for the candidates the two most established and best known contenders sen clinton on the democratic side and sen mccain on the republican side also happen to be the candidates who generate the most opposition within their own parties when voters were asked which candidates in their party they "definitely" wouldnt vote for democrats were most likely to say sen clinton said they definitely wouldnt vote for her and republicans most likely to say sen mccain with saying they wouldnt pick him in a similar vein sen clinton is far and away the best known of the presidential candidates just of those polled said they dont know her or arent sure what they think about her but she also has far and away the highest negative reading fully of those surveyed said they have negative feelings toward her by contrast only said they have negative feelings about sen obama a democrat who is just starting to move up the getting to know you curve if as those numbers suggest familiarity doesnt necessarily breed fondness who stands to benefit on the democratic side the most likely beneficiary probably is former senator and vice presidential candidate john edwards who is quietly raising a fair amount of money and attracting attention in the early primary and caucus states but not wearing out his welcome nationally on the republican side its probably mr romney the former massachusetts governor who is an impressive campaigner but not yet well known across the land its also possible that "none of the above" could benefit that might open the door for newt gingrich on the republican side and al gore on the democratic side they both would carry lots of baggage into the race and lots of negative ratings of their own but they are two figures with the stature and fund raising power to step in if voters grow weary of the current crop during the long months that lie ahead for now mr gingrich says he is keeping his options open mr gore says he isnt interested in running but also hasnt ruled out the idea software oracles forecast to reflect success of its buying spree by vauhini vara oracle corp will offer a hint this coming week of how its bold acquisition strategy has played out so far its looking good on tuesday the redwood shores calif maker of software for businesses plans to report earnings for its third quarter ended feb and give a forecast for its fourth the forecast is of particular interest the fourth quarter is typically oracles busiest as salespeople scramble to close deals to secure their end of year bonuses so this coming week investors will get a fuller sense of how oracle fared in its first year of owning its two biggest acquisitions peoplesoft which it bought in january and siebel systems which it bought in february both companies make business software the year started on a so so note after the acquisitions oracle reported two quarters of lackluster earnings and investors worried that the company was having trouble bringing its new parts into the fold but the bears may have spoken too soon oracle rebounded from its early difficulties posting stronger than expected results in the next two quarters and sending its stock to a five year high in november all in all oracle has transformed itself with acquisitions in the past few years its approach has changed somewhat at first it looked to boost profit in a maturing industry by acquiring all the customers of its big rivals more recently it has sought new growth by acquiring smaller players that make specialized software for industries like banking and retail this month oracle announced that it plans to buy hyperion solutions corp a maker of business intelligence software for about &# billion "the big issue is do they always need to make acquisitions to get growth " says brendan barnicle an analyst at pacific crest securities in portland ore the answer may be yes but investors are now allowing that that may not be a bad thing kash rangan an analyst at merrill lynch in san francisco says oracles forward price earnings ratio is about half of what it was in before the dot com bust that indicates that investors increasingly see oracle as a mature company which means oracles approach is a logical one make acquisitions to buy more market share "people have gotten less nervous about oracle making deals and have started viewing it as a strategic differentiator for them " says heather bellini an analyst at ubs in new york "its the sign of a maturing industry the one that can consolidate the most market share is going to win " indeed other technology companies like international business machines corp hewlett packard co and cisco systems inc have taken oracles lead making more big software acquisitions of their own oracle expects third quarter net income to increase between and from a year earlier to between &# million and &# million revenue is expected to rise to to between &# billion and &# billion europe for eus th anniversary a case of continental drift by marc champion leaders of the european union get together in berlin next weekend to celebrate the th anniversary of the blocs founding treaty with a declaration that aims to define what the eu is all about finding the right words wont be easy the declaration is attracting attention because lately the eu seems to have lost its way the crunch moment came in when france and the netherlands held referendums on a planned constitution that would have given the bloc a foreign minister and president both countries populations rejected the idea calling a halt to an ambitious period for the eu in which it had adopted a common currency and expanded to include new countries since then enlargement the technical term for adding more nations in the eu has become a four letter word most politicians avoid because it is so unpopular having bent rules almost to the breaking point to get countries to take up the euro for example by allowing italy to join when its public debt was more than of gross domestic product twice the ratio allowed under the rules the eu is now insisting on fine print to keep new economies out next weeks berlin declaration is designed to put the eus toe in the water again on the constitution issue producing a short text that says what the eu stands for but britain says the word "constitution" cant be mentioned france wants europes social welfare model included as a core eu value others dont poland wants christianity mentioned france and most other nations dont germany as the current eu president has the job of negotiating a text "it is not going to be quite so easy to agree on values we want to put in the berlin declaration " german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier acknowledged to the european parliament this week the eu was always fractious and a text will be produced but a look at the eus latest candidate for a new unifying mission energy security makes it clear that the blocs drift is more than the usual squabbling the eu started out as a six nation organization to pool production of coal and steel in the goal was to ensure that the core industries needed to go to war were so intertwined that france and germany could never fight again so when russia last year turned off the natural gas and oil to its neighbors threatening security of critical energy supplies to the eu making a common energy policy looked like the perfect way to revive the blocs sense of purpose but russian gas doesnt seem to have the same unifying impact as the memory of two world wars some eu countries get all of their natural gas from russia others get none france generates most of its electricity from nuclear fuel while austria has banned nuclear power some want to break up national energy giants that control both the supply network and retail markets most feel more secure keeping them some countries like poland and the three baltic states are doing everything they can to diversify away from russian energy supplies germany is building a new gas pipeline direct to russia the slow progress in securing a common energy security policy is one reason an eu energy summit this month focused instead on climate change in europe pretty much everyone at least agrees that climate change is bad corrections &amp amplifications oracle corp bought peoplesoft in january and siebel systems in january an article in saturdays week ahead column incorrectly said the peoplesoft purchase was in january and the siebel acquisition was in february wsj march
