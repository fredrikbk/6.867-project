pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece spanning the impossible the building of the golden gate bridge defied the odds anatomy of a classic for years the soaring magnificence of the golden gate bridge has captivated millions world wide as one of the so called seven wonders of the modern world the building of the bridge is a story of mathematics and engineering genius combined with the fearlessness of those who braved the elements and danger to construct what many deemed impossible to build that such an audacious project could be envisioned and then built is a testament to a chicago engineer named joseph strauss born in strauss led an effort that would involve a highly expert team of engineers and designers along with construction workers who like their brethren elsewhere helped cap the s efforts in america that witnessed an explosion of enormously complicated yet iconic projects such as the empire state building the hoover dam the triborough bridge and lincoln tunnel the engineering aspects of constructing the bridge were daunting the golden gate strait at the proposed site was a mile wide the ocean currents run from to knots and instability of the shorelines on either side the depth of the bay at the site and several other factors including strong winds with gusts up to miles per hour often combined with thick fog contributed to the difficulty of even contemplating such a project if that wasnt enough the bridge sits only eight miles from the epicenter of the famed san francisco earthquake though strauss was the leading proponent of spanning the gate he still had to emerge from a competitive process that evaluated proposals submitted by bridge engineering firms nationwide strauss who had designed some drawbridges but never a suspension span was appointed chief engineer in but he was required to hire among others leon moisseiff one of the worlds experts in suspension bridge design the project benefited not only from the work of moisseiff but from that of a civil engineering professor at the university of chicago charles ellis it was ellis who turned moisseiffs suspension concept into reality the mathematical brilliance of ellis whose calculations all done with a circular slide rule and an adding machine filled several volumes was alone an achievement worthy of great recognition along with ellis strauss also employed the talents of irving and gertrude morrow a husband and wife team who would be instrumental in the ultimate art deco look lighting and color of the bridge the bridge design that emerged from the unique collaboration of those brought together by strauss would be the worlds longest suspension bridge utilizing at feet the tallest bridge towers ever constructed along with underwater foundation piers that exceeded the size of any ever constructed one pier of the bridge would rest on a bedrock ridge feet below the water line the other in the open bay some feet from shore more than feet below the water line to begin workers moved more than three million cubic feet of dirt and poured more than one million tons of concrete to construct the anchorages holding in place the main cables at feet long with a vertical clearance of feet at the center the span required main cables longer than any ever used on a bridge these cables each with a tensile strength of million pounds would be run from the anchors over the top of the two towers all this accomplished in unrelenting winds and fog at completion the statistics of the bridge were staggering the total length of the bridge including approaches was feet with the suspension portions running feet between the towers was the longest suspension span ever built at feet a record held for nearly years before the completion of the verrazano narrows bridge some feet longer the final price tag for the golden gate bridge would be &# million as the bridge was being finished the use of carbon black and steel gray for its color was rejected instead irving morrow selected the distinctive color called international orange that still graces the span and sets the golden gate bridge apart from any other similar structure the illumination of the bridge includes an emphasis on the tower lighting the final phase installed in as originally envisioned by morrow and featuring diminishing light at the top thus giving the massive structures the appearance of rising beyond the illumination as to how the bridge is holding up after years in the harsh environment of the bay engineers say it is in nearly perfect shape even riding out the loma prieta earthquake measured at on the richter scale an earthquake that did extensive damage throughout the bay area caused no damage on the golden gate bridge as a precaution however the bridge is currently undergoing several seismic retrofit projects also in the bridges main cables underwent a complete inspection dan mohn chief engineer at the time says today "we unwrapped the main cable at mid span drove wood wedges deep into the cable and took samples the analysis which was compared to samples of the original wire determined that there was no fatigue whatsoever " bridge general manager celia kupersmith sums up the great effort to build the bridge by reflecting on the gate before construction "i think what makes the bridge one of the most special structures in the world is that it is a man made object that actually enhances the natural environment because of the design color and placement its like the golden gate bridge always belonged here it is the exclamation point the strait needed to be complete " mr sobel a writer and on air political and military analyst served on the board of the golden gate bridge highway and transportation district correction the march leisure &amp arts article "spanning the impossible the building of the golden gate bridge defied the odds" incorrectly stated that charles ellis who was responsible for the mathematical calculations for building the golden gate bridge was a professor at the university of chicago he was instead a civil engineering professor at the university of illinois at chicago wsj march
