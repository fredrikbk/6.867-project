pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings fred r shapiro sets the record straight how the yale book of quotations was researched on the web it aint what you dont know that gets you its the things you know that aint so " thus spake anon or maybe mark twain and that celebrated piece of folk wisdom can easily be applied to apocryphal quotations from "elementary my dear watson" to "play it again sam " most of us know our fair share of sayings that didnt actually get said the way we recall them more than a few of which are commonly attributed to famous people who never said them in the first place "the yale book of quotations " recently published by yale university press is a thousand page compendium that endeavors among other good things to set its readers straight on the provenance of hundreds of questionable quotes was it twain who claimed that richard wagners music is "better than it sounds" no he quoted bill nye to that effect in his autobiography did voltaire really say "i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it" wrong again that oft quoted sentence was put in his mouth by s g tallentyre the author of a book about him part of why "the yale book of quotations" is so effective at straightening out these kinks in the chain of human knowledge is that fred r shapiro the editor has made use of what he refers to in his preface as "state of the art research methods " meaning the searchable online databases that are revolutionizing scholarly research mr shapiro and his associates have employed eighteenth century collections online jstor lexisnexis literature online newspaperarchive com proquest questia and the times digital archive assiduously and well as i learned by reading their book from cover to cover i now know for instance that the phrase "shop till you drop" is a paraphrase of a line in noel cowards play "still life " while i was staggered to discover that george orwell of all people appears to have coined murphys law in "if there is a wrong thing to do it will be done infallibly " even more fascinating are the gnarly misattributions that mr shapiro has disentangled having watched most of john waynes movies more than once i had good reason to suspect that the duke never said "a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do" though he came within spitting distance in "stagecoach " in which he says that "there are some things a man just cant run away from" i assumed it was a judy judy judy snippet of cinematic apocrypha until i looked it up in "the yale book of quotations" and found that it was actually said by john steinbeck in "the grapes of wrath" "i know this a man got to do what he got to do " some of my discoveries were humbling in i published a biography of h l mencken on which id been working for a decade i spent much of that time sifting through menckens private papers in which i found a wealth of invaluable information but i wasnt able to pin down the exact occasion on which he coined the phrase "bible belt " well mr shapiro and his trusty computer succeeded in doing what i couldnt do mencken first used it in a column published in the chicago tribune on nov as a drama critic i was no less embarrassed to discover that the line "i have always depended on the kindness of strangers" was not invented by tennessee williams a discreet cross tab in "the yale book of quotations" points you to the entry for w somerset maugham where you will find this line from maughams novel "the narrow corner" "you cannot imagine the kindness ive received at the hands of perfect strangers " should i have known that the author of "a streetcar named desire" stole its most famous line probably since id read "the narrow corner" three times without noticing the theft all this serves as a reminder of the myriad ways in which the web is transforming the way scholars do their work just the other day i was reading a collection of essays about aaron copland in which mention was made of the fact that all of coplands surviving letters to leonard bernstein can now be viewed online at the library of congresss web site as a once and future biographer i find this development little short of miraculous though i suspect that the continuing digitization of libraries will diminish the number of serendipitous discoveries made by those of us who now spend hours sifting through stacks of dusty documents in search of factual gold as any scholar can tell you theres no substitute for handling the thing itself be it a handwritten letter or a crumbling scrapbook on the other hand life is too short to spend too much of it running from library to library in search of information that you can acquire by clicking a few keys i learned more than i can say by going to baltimore to examine menckens papers but i would have been more than happy to read his old newspaper columns on my ibook in manhattan as for the allegedly anonymous quote with which this column began it turns out that an american humorist by the name of josh billings said it more or less in "it iz better tew know nothing than two know what aint so " i like my version better though mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
