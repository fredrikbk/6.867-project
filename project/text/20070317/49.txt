powershares pumps out niche etfs narrow focus feeds a frenzy and upsets mutual fund field wheaton ill powershares capital management is less than five years old and has about employees it is based in a defunct bed and breakfast on the outskirts of chicago the chief executives office still has the old jacuzzi despite the start up feel the unit of investment firm amvescap plc is a force behind the growth of exchange traded funds or etfs one of the hottest investment products to emerge in a decade etfs are baskets of assets including stocks or commodities and trade on exchanges as regular shares do as recently as years ago they were almost nonexistent now thanks to their low costs they are rapidly cutting into the mutual fund business because they can be traded easily they are also increasingly important to global speculators who use them in complex investment strategies powershares is one of the most aggressive and controversial companies trying to cash in on the frenzy it has launched so many etfs so quickly that ceo bruce bond has rung the opening bell at the american stock exchange where many etfs trade more times than any other issuer in recent history critics say the boom is spurring etf companies to develop gimmicky products that are riskier than many investors realize that is "where the real damage" could be hiding says don phillips managing director at fund researcher morningstar inc in the past two years powershares has issued increasingly narrow etfs that track nanotechnology clean energy and other market slices it launched a food and beverage fund that trades under the ticker symbol "pbj " other etf companies are using the same strategy issuing funds that track cancer treatment stocks the south african stock market and other niche sectors the industrys rapid growth has made powershares founder mr bond an overnight multimillionaire last year amvescap bought powershares in a deal that could be valued at more than &# million over several years if growth targets are met currently the company has about &# billion under management in more than etfs other etf start ups are cropping up too "the bond effect is real " said tom carter of alps fund services a provider of fund administrative services private investment firms like ftventures which helped fund powershares have plowed millions of dollars into start up etf companies another etf firm wisdomtree investments inc has seen its own stock price more than double since the beginning of although it has yet to report an annual profit mr bond years old says powershares offers products that are useful to individual investors "we think were in line with cutting edge investors and the market is coming to us " he says "this is how capitalism works " he defends narrow etfs as useful diversification tools "some of the most sophisticated investors are early adopters of etfs and tend to be a little more aggressive " he says perhaps no one has been more critical of the etf boom than john bogle founder of mutual fund giant vanguard group inc who stepped down as vanguards chief executive in he routinely likens the narrowest etfs to "a shotgun great for hunting but equally perfect for suicide " his main criticism many etfs are too volatile and narrowly focused tilting a portfolio away from broad diversification he also disputes that etfs are cheaper than mutual funds once brokers fees are factored in while mutual fund assets overall have increased in the past five years to &# trillion etf assets have quintupled totaling more than &# billion at the end of last year even vanguard itself is getting into the game a few years ago it started its own line of etfs and now has almost etfs sprouted in the early s but failed to take off until barclays global investors the largest etf issuer launched a major marketing push for its ishares branded etfs many years later barclays now controls about of etf industry assets that success attracted a host of rivals among them mr bond a talkative louisiana native mr bond started his career perhaps fittingly as a bond salesman marketing municipal bonds to institutions and wealthy investors in chicago he later joined investment firm first trust portfolios lp and then investment firm nuveen investments inc his notion of launching his own etf provider took shape in early when he ran into a former first trust colleague john southard who had experience developing the kind of complex investment formulas that could be used in etfs they discussed mr bonds idea for what are now the firms "intellidexes" customized stock indexes that would use computer models to scour the markets to find the most attractive companies "i finally said to myself do you really believe in this and if you really do you need to do something about it " mr bond says soon after he teamed up with mr southard to start powershares in may powershares launched its first two etfs initially the goal was to keep the product lineup small and simple so powershares salespeople could explain the still relatively unfamiliar etf concept to financial advisers powershares has asked regulators for permission to launch an additional products which probably means more amex bell ringing appearances for mr bond he was there recently to launch some etfs energetically shouting his standard refrain at these events "god bless america " he said "god bless the american stock exchange and god bless powershares "
