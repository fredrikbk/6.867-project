pursuits books snookered by love the trouble with what if the post birthday world by lionel shriver harpercollins pages &# "for secular westerners ritual is hard to come by " observes lionel shriver at the outset of "the post birthday world " her painstaking often painful examination of romantic love in an era of improvised ritual the secular westerners in question are two couples one american one british the americans are expatriates living in london irina a childrens book illustrator and her long term partner lawrence a think tank expert on terrorism their friends are jude irinas book collaborator and ramsey a professional and famous snooker player the ritual that sets events in motion is the couples habit of dining as a foursome each year on ramseys birthday when jude and ramsey divorce and lawrence has to be out of town at a conference on the annual date irina agrees to preserve the tradition by celebrating with ramsey alone far from the evening of awkward small talk that she feared in the past jude and irina would chat about their work while the guys discussed snooker her dinner with ramsey stirs in irina a powerful attraction the handsome cockney accented rake is in every way the opposite of staid disciplined lawrence irina who is in her late s finds herself at "the most consequential crossroads of her life " it is an important crossroads for the novel too and unlike irina ms shriver is free to explore in both directions after the first chapter sets up irinas dilemma the author proceeds to describe in alternating chapters two stories that ensue from the action she takes that night in one version irina kisses ramsey after their dinner and then endures three months of tortuous guilt and frustrated lust before she decides to leave lawrence as her romance with ramsey unfolds she finds herself consumed by the tempestuous passions and pitfalls of being a celebritys wife in the other storyline irina resists temptation and continues in her stable if romantically underwhelming life no matter which choice irina makes she wonders how things would have turned out if she had made the other and in neither is it clear that she made the right one one certainty is that ms shriver is not interested in fostering illusions about love whether with ramsey or lawrence irina is mercilessly trapped by the compromises and disappointments of real life in ramseys company she neglects her work and health in a whirl of snooker tournaments and late night carousing ms shrivers portrayal of this peculiarly british microcosm is highly entertaining and apt with lawrence she preserves her sense of stability and security by dutifully attending to his needs cooking elaborate dinners sewing buttons on his shirts and observing his rules no smoking very little drinking at the expense of creative inspiration and desire it is not possible it seems for irina simply to thrive perhaps the reason for this predicament is that irina is unable to conceive of herself alone "the only thing i cant live without is a man " she confesses to lawrence at the end of one scenario which has turned out to be as fraught as its alternative this remark is intriguing as a confession and as the subject for a current novel ms shriver treats irinas unhappy circumstances neither as humorous nor as exceptional "the post birthday world" is disturbing because it seems real irinas wavering and soul searching are not the comic vacillations of bridget jones and the choices she makes are not the pragmatic decisions of an emblematic woman ambitious to "have it all " moreover and all the more noticeable because ms shrivers last novel "weve got to talk about kevin " was concerned with obsessive motherhood irinas attitude is an interesting departure from the preoccupations of women in much contemporary fiction despite being in her early s by the novels end she seems to have given only the slightest consideration to whether she would like to have a child her only interest she says is in "true love that lasts " ms shriver is unflinching in portraying the frustration of this goal regardless of the course taken as inevitable the lasting sensation for the reader is the one irina experienced when her dilemma first arose that of "hurtling through this tunnel toward not romance but cynicism " ms gallagher is a writer in new york
