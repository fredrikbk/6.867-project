pursuits sports golf journal hollywoods dean of golf the bel air pro on a rat packers bad bets and why carts are all wrong los angeles bel air country club confected during the roaring s is a golf shangri la in the hills overlooking tinseltown howard hughes trying to impress katharine hepburn once landed his plane on the eighth fairway bentleys and maseratis vie for parking spots in the italianate porte cochere and players use an elevator to return to the clubhouse after finishing their rounds on the th hole eddie merrins aka the little pro has been holding court here since for the first years as head golf pro and more recently as head pro emeritus you might think surviving that long in such a glamorous setting would require a high wattage hollywood personality but mr merrins years old comes across more like a prep school headmaster hes all for fun of course but bel airs swashbucklers seem to value him most for linking the club to golfs grand traditions on the golf course the diminutive mr merrinss standard attire is a sweater vest with tie and an old fashioned golf cap around the clubhouse its a blazer rep tie and khakis even more distinctive is his unflappable manner of speaking "im still trying to figure out what that word emeritus means " he said last week unhurriedly selecting his words as if from a menu "i guess i am meant to be more or less an ambassador for the club " mr merrins frequently calls himself the luckiest man in the world pointing to a career that has intersected with virtually every significant player or event of the last half century beginning with his playing days in the early s with the likes of ben hogan sam snead and even walter hagen the biggest change for the pros in all those years he said is how much less fun they have these days "the image of a professional golfer back then included a cigarette in one hand and a cocktail in the other " he said "and they werent against cavorting a bit at night they didnt swing as well as todays players do and they werent as physically fit but the thing they had going for them was competitive spirit and a love for the game today with so much money at stake and so many good players waiting in the wings the pros cant afford to relax " mr merrins still comes to bel air every day hes in town operating out of a tiny memento packed office below decks he is sought after for lessons having produced several popular instructional books and dvds and usually lunches with members and their guests in the grill room from there with views of the putting green the first tee and the swinging footbridge that crosses a chasm to the th fairway anybody whos at the club sees anybody else whos at the club the biggest change for recreational players mr merrins believes was the advent of the golf cart "the player caddie bond was a great part of the game but starting in the s the caddies began disappearing like the buffalo " he said the bel air like most of the great old clubs still has a large caddie program but allows carts if mr merrins had his way carts would be limited to those with notes from their doctors he also regrets that amateurs generally have less time to play than they used to even though many of what he calls bel airs "entertainer members" including dennis quaid james garner luke wilson and mac davis do manage to play frequently "i think what they like most about the club is knowing they will be treated like one of the guys " he said "they can come and just play golf no autographs no photos " mr merrins has had a close relationship with almost all of bel airs celebrities "dean martin was a particularly good golfer a six handicap and played to it " he recalled mr martin and his playing partners "gambled for pretty good stakes but dean was the type of gambler who didnt really want to win your money so there was nothing left for him to do but to lose to the other guys he was like an annuity and so was always most welcome in the game " mr merrinss steel trap memory for dates and scores is astounding he recalls for instance that mr martin was paired with sam snead in when mr snead at set the competitive course record at bel air a and shot by shot details from later that week of mr snead almost winning the los angeles open at neighboring riviera that course like bel airs was designed by george thomas "jack nicklaus has played here twice that i know of " mr merrins said "the second time was when we dedicated the new first tee he shot a one under par on the front nine despite hitting his drive out of bounds on the last and suffering three three putts that was the day he and tiger woods who was met for the first time byron nelson was also in attendance " mr merrinss biggest fear is that golfs mystique based in its centuries old customs rules etiquette and language will be diluted "when average viewers watch golf on television they may not be able to put a finger on what it is they like but i think much of it is these trappings " he said "if you lose those you lose the whole thing if everyone just went out and did their own thing in golf it would be chaos soon there would be no game so these standards have to be preserved " email me at golfjournal wsj com
