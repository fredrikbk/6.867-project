loan relief legislation advances deal in house would let judges revise mortgages help urged in ohio cases several house judiciary committee members have agreed on a piece of housing legislation that would give bankruptcy court judges more flexibility to alter the terms of certain mortgages meanwhile ohios attorney general has asked state judges to dismiss or delay some foreclosure actions the proposed dismissals are meant to encourage mortgage companies to renegotiate terms of the loans to keep borrowers in their homes while the deal in the house indicates progress rep brad miller d n c an architect of the bill said the full house of representatives wont vote on it until next year so congress will probably recess this year without passing one major bill targeting the housing crisis also in the works but gummed up in the senate is a bill that would let the housing and urban development departments federal housing administration help more struggling borrowers and another bill that would change the ways mortgages are sold and securitized those moves by congress would be in addition to a much broader mortgage plan recently announced by the industry and the treasury department which would help some struggling homeowners either refinance or win a temporary freeze on their low introductory interest rates the bankruptcy issue before the house which was opposed by the mortgage and financial services industries has been perhaps the most sensitive public policy proposal to date aimed at helping borrowers struggling with their mortgages republicans and the banking industry delayed the matter arguing that it could raise interest rates for all homeowners and rattle the market for securities backed by these loans late last week democrats agreed to make significant changes to the bill and won the support of rep steve chabot r ohio the panel plans to vote today then the measure would be sent to the house floor although possibly not until next year the chances of the bills passing in the senate are uncertain under the agreement the bankruptcy law would expire after seven years and would give bankruptcy judges only the authority to alter the terms of subprime and nontraditional mortgage products originated between and earlier proposals didnt specify which mortgages could be altered in ohio motions have been filed in cases in five ohio counties since last month and more will be filed soon a spokeswoman for attorney general marc dann said the motions argue that the plaintiffs often banks that act as trustees for investors of securities backed by mortgages in the cases dont actually hold the promissory note and mortgage and so dont have a right to foreclose the situation occurs in part because mortgage documents and the contracts between borrowers and lenders may change hands multiple times and may not be assigned to the plaintiffs at the time the suits are filed whether those circumstances should lead to dismissal of cases is being debated across the country in ohio judges havent yet ruled on mr danns motions mr danns move follows a series of court rulings in ohio this year in which several federal judges dismissed dozens of suits on similar grounds in october federal judge christopher a boyko in cleveland dismissed foreclosure suits filed by deutsche bank national trust co writing that "the institutions seem to adopt the attitude that since they have been doing this for so long unchallenged this practice equates with legal compliance " deutsche bank declined to comment on the ruling state attorneys general have been responding in different ways to the wave of foreclosure actions that has come in the wake of rising defaults on subprime mortages earlier this year mr dann sued several mortgage lenders and brokers on behalf of individual borrowers alleging that they violated state consumer protection laws by pressuring appraisers to inflate home values he asked that the companies pay &# in restitution in each case so far the state has gotten a default judgment against one lender and has settled with two brokers according to mr danns spokeswoman in new york attorney general andrew cuomo filed a lawsuit in november against a home appraisal firm alleging it had defrauded consumers by allowing its biggest customer a national bank to exert pressure for higher property valuations to help ensure that loans went through mr cuomo has subpoenaed participants in the secondary market for mortgage debt including investment banks that sell mortgage backed securities in ohio the worst state in the nation by foreclosures of all loans were in foreclosure by the end of the third quarter up from in the second quarter according to a mortgage bankers association survey the number of new foreclosures in ohio rose by about in the same period lately some ohio state judges have ruled against banks for filing suits without showing proof that they hold the mortgage mr danns motions urge judges to review foreclosure filings in their courts and as warranted dismiss actions on the same grounds short of that he encourages judges to order mediation so that "parties can negotiate a workout agreement thereby resolving their dispute without resort to foreclosure "
