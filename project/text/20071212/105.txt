saudi industrial drive strains oil export role kingdoms use jumps as cities smelters bloom in the desert riyadh saudi arabia long the biggest spigot for crude oil saudi arabia now has broader ambitions it wants to become a big exporter of chemicals aluminum and plastic and in the process to create jobs so saudi arabia is on a building binge in the works are new seaports an extended railroad system a series of new industrial cities and a score of refineries power stations and smelters over the next dozen years such saudi investments are expected to consume &# billion but theyll also consume something else large quantities of saudi oil oil that otherwise could help slake other countries growing thirst much as china leveraged its asset of cheap labor to make an industrial leap the saudis and their oil rich neighbors are tapping their own prime asset to fuel development "the region is looking to the future by turning to industries that rely on oil a lot of oil " says john sfakianakis chief economist at saudi investment bank sabb an affiliate of hsbc "that means more oil stays here " the problem is that with output slumping in places like the north sea and mexico the world is counting on increased oil supplies from the middle east and above all from saudi arabia global oil demand now just over million barrels a day is expected to exceed million barrels a day within years so the question arises can the kingdom continue to satisfy the worlds growing oil needs at the same time as its own economic engine demands ever more crude within saudi arabia theres heated debate over the wisdom of staking development on industries that use so much energy a big aluminum smelter being built on the persian gulf coast for instance will consume upwards of barrels of oil a day because the saudis are turning to crude oil to make electricity yet the smelter will create fewer than jobs some boosters want to build smelters theyd devour nearly of the saudis current oil production abdallah dabbagh is a proponent of the industrialization push as head of saudi arabian mining co which is building the east coast smelter yet even he says "i think the saudi government will have to stop and think at some point if this is the best utilization of saudis crude " the saudi industrial leap which is mirrored in neighboring states like qatar bahrain and the united arab emirates has helped make the middle east one of the worlds fastest growing consumers of oil saudi arabia last year used more than two million barrels a day up from at a time when saudi oil production actually slumped by the whole of the region saw its demand jump while total world demand was growing just saudis also are guzzling oil in more traditional ways theyre clogging highways with shiny hummers and chevy suburbans saudis are now the worlds biggest oil consumers per capita at more than barrels a year per person thats twice the rate of south korea and well ahead of the u s which consumes barrels a year per person the result is that barrels of every the saudis produce stay at home compared with under of seven years ago forecasts from the u s energy department and the international energy agency say that by saudi arabia will be consuming more than a third of its own oil leaving a lesser share for american cars indian airliners and chinese factories the middle east remains awash in oil with more than of the worlds proven reserves saudi arabia says it has billion barrels which would be enough to supply the entire worlds needs at todays rate of demand for almost nine years but bringing fresh batches of oil to market has become harder even here average daily output in the kingdom at just over nine million barrels is almost identical to what it was years ago or for that matter as some wells decline the saudis must bring on line an additional barrels a day in production capacity each year according to various estimates their maximum capacity is about million barrels a day theyre aiming to lift that to million by a large chunk of the new capacity some barrels a day is to come from a three year expansion under way at the big shaybah field on the edge of a vast sand dune region known as rub al khali or the empty quarter many of these extra barrels will never leave the middle east a lehman brothers report predicts that oil needs in saudi arabia kuwait the uae qatar and bahrain will jump by almost barrels a day next year alone saudi leaders had a different model in mind when they launched their bid to remake their economy a decade ago the plan was to fuel the industrial boom from new power stations to petrochemical plants with fresh stocks of natural gas saudi arabia is thought to sit on the worlds fourth largest gas reserves after russia iran and qatar geologists spent years in the mid s identifying deep pockets of gas below giant oil fields but aramco has been slow in bringing this gas on line saudi arabia broke with longstanding practice starting in by signing deals with foreign oil companies to prospect for gas in the empty quarter despite more than &# billion spent the companies havent found commercial quantities of gas so the saudis switched course last year king abdullah mandated that crude oil be used to fire nearly all of the kingdoms soaring electricity needs natural gas the government said would be reserved increasingly for the booming petrochemical sector perhaps no one is more daunted by the kingdoms mounting thirst for energy than ali saleh al barrak the soft spoken head of saudi electricity co from his nd story corner office in riyadh he gazes across a tangle of cranes and skyscrapers to the citys widening sprawl what he sees "is more people which means more houses which means more appliances and more air conditioning " thirty years ago saudi arabia had fewer than eight million people now it has over million in the national power company had capacity to generate megawatts of power thats now up to over seven years mr barrak says the company will have to build six huge power plants to raise generating capacity to megawatts roughly that of the far more industrialized united kingdom "by any standard that is an unnatural growth rate " he laments saudis consume vast quantities of electricity because the government holds the price unusually low to keep the populace happy as it does with gasoline nearly two thirds of power goes to air conditioning saudis routinely keep their air conditioners on full blast even when on vacation the average saudi power bill mr barrak says weighs in at one fifth the cheapest tab in the u s "you try getting people to conserve at that cost " he says "its impossible " even oil rich countries normally scramble to avoid burning oil in their power plants because oil is so easily sold and transported on the international market while gas isnt but mr barrak estimates that by petroleum will fire nearly of saudis mounting electricity needs this has made him a vocal proponent of nuclear power thats a notion gaining momentum across the middle east as countries wrestle with the wisdom of burning oil to generate power to make cement or cool offices "nuclear is definitely the future " mr barrak says "future generations are going to think we were stupid to burn oil for power when we could have done it by other means " the natural gas crunch is creating bizarre scenarios in the region cement makers in the uae lacking sufficient gas this summer began firing their furnaces with south african coal building booms in the uae and oman have led both states to turn to qatar for extra gas bahrain home to a gigantic aluminum smelter that drains more than a third of the countrys electricity supply is relying increasingly on saudi oil for its refineries saudi arabia however faces a more immediate challenge oil has given it great wealth with an expected budget surplus of nearly &# billion this year what oil hasnt done is create many jobs at least of the nonmenial variety that saudi men will accept official unemployment runs over and some economists say the real figure particularly among the kingdoms restive youth is at least twice as high for the ruling royal family boosting employment and revamping education to put more emphasis on practical job skills are seen as key to saudi arabias long term stability the governments aim is to convert oil into jobs "we want to use our oil to move beyond oil " says fahd al rasheed a former aramco finance officer as deputy director of the saudi arabia general investment authority he is championing the creation of four new economic cities the goal of the cities plan is to create million jobs over a dozen years the projects are at the heart of an investment push with an even higher employment goal more than four million jobs to be created at a cost of over &# billion "we want to create jobs thats what the whole plan is about " mr rasheed says the first of the new cities the king abdullah economic city is being built along a barren strip of red sea coastline about an hours drive north of jidda for now its little more than an ornate stone entryway opening onto a network of roads lined by tall palm trees with the red sea shimmering in the distance mr rasheed insists the city will open at least in skeletal form by early the king he notes "wouldnt have given his name to something that isnt going to happen " the plans are nothing if not ambitious the residential area will feature apartments and villas scattered in enclaves surrounded by factories construction is under way on a seaport billed as the biggest on the red sea also in the works is a rail line to carry freight from the new port some miles across the desert to a persian gulf port dammam a megawatt power plant will provide electricity for king abdullah economic city the plant will burn oil the government has broken ground on a similar city about miles to the south at the port of jazan there the emphasis will be on heavy industries such as petrochemicals copper refining and aluminum smelting all huge consumers of energy aluminum corp of china ltd has signed a &# billion deal with a saudi consortium to build one of the regions largest aluminum smelters at the jazan economic city the smelters proposed &# billion power plant by one estimate could require more than barrels a day of crude oil the countrys mining giant called maaden recently plunged into a vast mining enterprise deep in the northern interior maadens mr dabbagh standing in front of a big map of the kingdom in his riyadh office traces how a new railroad line under construction will bring tons of bauxite phosphates and magnesite from the mine to the persian gulf city of ras az zwar "here " he says jabbing the map "we are going to have the largest sulfuric acid plant in the world the largest phosphoric plant and the largest ammonium plant " the factories he says "will make saudi arabia a major player in fertilizer in the same way we are already a major player in energy " the coup de grace is the &# billion aluminum smelter which maaden is building in partnership with rio tinto alcan a unit of rio tinto group the smelter will mark saudi arabias first plunge into one of the most energy intensive industries with others sure to follow and similar smelting projects are in the works for the uae qatar and oman "eventually " mr dabbagh says "everybody is going to come to the gulf to make aluminum because this is where the energy is "
