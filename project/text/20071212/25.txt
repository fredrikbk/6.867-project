common sense investor patience is in order as mortgage woes play out smartmoney all eyes have been on the federal reserve this week but chairman ben bernanke and his acolytes pursuing their stated policy of greater transparency pretty much told us to expect a cut the only suspense was whether it would be a quarter or half point and even that was a stretch since the overwhelming favorite a cut in the federal funds rate was what was delivered the cut in the discount rate was widely anticipated as well up until yesterday the markets had been celebrating future rate cuts for two weeks ever since the dow jones industrial average jumped back above on nov the average had been on something of a tear with further impetus from treasury secretary henry paulsons efforts to perform triage on the housing markets financial stocks in particular have benefited from the perception that the fed is "bailing out" the sector with lower short term rates plenty of liquidity and coercion to stem the rising tide of mortgage loan defaults foreigners have jumped in to buy big equity stakes in citigroup and just this week ubs does this mean that the worst is over for the financial sector many investors seem to think so and at recent prices many stocks look tempting financial stock prices are certainly cheaper than they were citigroup was over &# in late may yesterday it closed below &# though well above the &# level it breached a few weeks ago but that doesnt mean it cant go lower i thought i was clever when i bought wells fargo at &# during the selling panic of last august it fell below &# in november and has since struggled back to just under &# wells fargo has a reputation for some of the strictest lending standards in the business but even it announced a &# billion write off recently which though relatively modest shook investor confidence what investors seem to have trouble grasping is that the deterioration in american housing prices with the ensuing mortgage crisis and broader credit squeeze isnt going to end overnight whether or not the fed cuts rates whether theres a moratorium on foreclosures or whether another oil rich foreigner buys a big stake in a bank as long as more people continue to default on their mortgages banks and other investors will have to further write down the value of assets they hold just this week ubs announced another &# billion in write offs it would be nice to think that would be it but ubs said it has another &# billion in subprime exposure id also like to think that wells fargo has put its troubled assets behind it wells fargo said it is now liquidating &# billion of loans with a loan to value ratio of or more including many loans originated by other lenders how much will this portfolio of shaky mortgages actually fetch wells fargo said it holds an additional &# billion in loans in its home equity group portfolio how much is that portfolio really worth its hard to say given the continuing decline in housing prices and rising mortgage defaults especially in california a prime wells fargo market im focusing on wells fargo because its one of the few financial stocks i own its problems are hardly unique national mortgage news has an excellent web site data nationalmortgagenews com that details the mortgage exposure for a wide array of financial institutions i expect further write offs across the sector until housing prices stabilize and begin to rise lower short term rates courtesy of the federal reserve may well hasten the day when that happens but it hasnt happened yet and its still going to take some time as ive said many times patience is an unheralded but important virtue for any investor james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com commonsense
