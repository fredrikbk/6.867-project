the roots of the mortgage crisis on aug and the days immediately following financial markets in much of the world seized up virtually overnight the seemingly insatiable desire for financial risk came to an abrupt halt as the price of risk unexpectedly surged interest rates on a wide range of asset classes especially interbank lending asset backed commercial paper and junk bonds rose sharply relative to riskless u s treasury securities over the past five years risk had become increasingly underpriced as market euphoria fostered by an unprecedented global growth rate gained cumulative traction the crisis was thus an accident waiting to happen if it had not been triggered by the mispricing of securitized subprime mortgages it would have been produced by eruptions in some other market as i have noted elsewhere history has not dealt kindly with protracted periods of low risk premiums the root of the current crisis as i see it lies back in the aftermath of the cold war when the economic ruin of the soviet bloc was exposed with the fall of the berlin wall following these world shaking events market capitalism quietly but rapidly displaced much of the discredited central planning that was so prevalent in the third world a large segment of the erstwhile third world especially china replicated the successful economic export oriented model of the so called asian tigers fairly well educated low cost workforces were joined with developed world technology and protected by an increasing rule of law to unleash explosive economic growth since the real gdp growth of the developing world has been more than double that of the developed world the surge in competitive low priced exports from developing countries especially those to europe and the u s flattened labor compensation in developed countries and reduced the rate of inflation expectations throughout the world including those inflation expectations embedded in global long term interest rates in addition there has been a pronounced fall in global real interest rates since the early s which of necessity indicated that global saving intentions chronically had exceeded intentions to invest in the developing world consumption evidently could not keep up with the surge of income and as a consequence the savings rate of the developed world soared from of nominal gdp in to in far outstripping its investment rate yet the actual global saving rate in overall was only modestly higher than in suggesting that the uptrend in developing economy saving intentions overlapped with and largely tempered declining investment intentions in the developed world in the u s for example the surge of innovation and productivity growth apparently started taking a breather in that weakened global investment has been the major determinant in the decline of global real long term interest rates is also the conclusion of a recent march bank of canada study equity premiums and real estate capitalization rates were inevitably arbitraged lower by the fall in global long term interest rates asset prices accordingly moved dramatically higher not only did global share prices recover from the dot com crash they moved ever upward the value of equities traded on the worlds major stock exchanges has risen to more than &# trillion double what it was in sharply rising home prices erupted into major housing bubbles world wide japan and germany for differing reasons being the only principal exceptions the economists surveys document the remarkable convergence of more than individual nations house price rises during the past decade u s price gains at their peak were no more than average after more than a half century observing numerous price bubbles evolve and deflate i have reluctantly concluded that bubbles cannot be safely defused by monetary policy or other policy initiatives before the speculative fever breaks on its own there was clearly little the worlds central banks could do to temper this most recent surge in human euphoria in some ways reminiscent of the dutch tulip craze of the th century and south sea bubble of the th century i do not doubt that a low u s federal funds rate in response to the dot com crash and especially the rate set in mid to counter potential deflation lowered interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages arms and may have contributed to the rise in u s home prices in my judgment however the impact on demand for homes financed with arms was not major demand in those days was driven by the expectation of rising prices the dynamic that fuels most asset price bubbles if low adjustable rate financing had not been available most of the demand would have been financed with fixed rate long term mortgages in fact home prices continued to rise for two years subsequent to the peak of arm originations seasonally adjusted i and my colleagues at the fed believed that the potential threat of corrosive deflation in was real even though deflation was not thought to be the most likely projection we will never know whether the temporary federal funds rate fended off a deflationary crisis potentially much more daunting than the current one but i did fret that maintaining rates too low for too long was problematic the failure of either the growth of the monetary base or of m to exceed while the fed funds rate was assuaged my concern that we had added inflationary tinder to the economy in mid as the economy firmed the federal reserve started to reverse the easy monetary policy i had expected as a bonus a consequent increase in long term interest rates which might have helped to dampen the then mounting u s housing price surge it did not happen we had presumed long term rates including mortgage rates would rise as had been the case at the beginnings of five previous monetary policy tightening episodes dating back to but after an initial surge in the spring of long term rates fell back and despite progressive federal reserve tightening through long term rates barely moved in retrospect global economic forces which have been building for decades appear to have gained effective control of the pricing of longer debt maturities simple correlations between short and long term interest rates in the u s remain significant but have been declining for over a half century asset prices more generally are gradually being decoupled from short term interest rates arbitragable assets equities bonds and real estate and the financial assets engendered by their intermediation now swamp the resources of central banks the market value of global long term securities is approaching &# trillion carry trade and foreign exchange markets have become huge the depth of these markets became readily apparent in march when japanese monetary authorities abruptly ceased intervention in support of the u s dollar after accumulating more than &# billion of foreign exchange in the preceding three months beyond a few days of gyrations following the halt in purchases nothing of lasting significance appears to have happened even the then seemingly massive japanese purchases of foreign exchange barely budged the prices of the vast global pool of tradable securities in theory central banks can expand their balance sheets without limit in practice they are constrained by the potential inflationary impact of their actions the ability of central banks and their governments to join with the international monetary fund in broad based currency stabilization is arguably long since gone more generally global forces combined with lower international trade barriers have diminished the scope of national governments to affect the paths of their economies although central banks appear to have lost control of longer term interest rates they continue to be dominant in the markets for assets with shorter maturities where money and near monies are created thus central banks retain their ability to contain pressures on the prices of goods and services that is on the conventional measures of inflation the current credit crisis will come to an end when the overhang of inventories of newly built homes is largely liquidated and home price deflation comes to an end that will stabilize the now uncertain value of the home equity that acts as a buffer for all home mortgages but most importantly for those held as collateral for residential mortgage backed securities very large losses will no doubt be taken as a consequence of the crisis but after a period of protracted adjustment the u s economy and the world economy more
