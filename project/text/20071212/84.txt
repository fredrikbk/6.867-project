overhaul of greek pensions seen on track despite strike athens greeces center right new democracy government recently re elected to a new four year term is expected to press on with a social security overhaul despite an expected nationwide general strike opposing such change the strike scheduled for today has been called by greeces two powerful umbrella unions the private sector gsee union and its public sector counterpart adedy it is expected to bring tens of thousands of workers onto the streets and lead to a shutdown of many public services the size and scope of the protest will also act as a de facto referendum on the pace of change strong participation could force the government to slow implementation of reforms but if fewer people than expected participate it may embolden the government to move further faster "the strike isnt likely to dissuade the government from proceeding with pension reforms " said theodoros livanios a political analyst at the opinion polling company "though clearly the government is currently trying to gauge reactions and it may yet slightly adjust the timing for implementation " greeces fragmented deficit ridden pension system faces huge actuarial deficits estimated at anywhere between billion euros and billion euros &# billion and &# billion with a rapidly aging population and barring any reform those deficits are expected to start significantly affecting the governments budget in as little as years greece exited this year from special european union supervision for its past budget gaps after trimming its deficit to below the eu limit of of gross domestic product since being re elected in september the government has made pension overhaul the cornerstone of its economic policy it is expected to submit legislation reforming the pension system early next year possibly even as early as mid january to date it has publicly floated four major reform proposals as part of a dialogue with opposition parties the labor unions and employers groups those proposals have included incentives for workers to stay on the job longer slashing the different special work categories eligible for early retirement merging the countrys more than pension and health funds into fewer than funds and reducing the number of people claiming disability insurance but each of those general proposals their specific details remain unknown have engendered opposition from the unions either from the gsee and adedy or smaller unions like journalists doctors and engineers that would be directly affected by the proposals even the so called public dialogue has broken down into acrimony both gsee and adedy after initially participating have since withdrawn they accuse the government of failing to adequately discuss their key issue about how to finance greeces pension system and they charge that the dialogue is no more than a preprogrammed charade the strike "will be a major and vigorous protest " said spyros papaspyros president of adedy "the government shouldnt underestimate the message being sent to them " the unions have been preparing extra measures to ensure a high turnout last month gsee president yannis panagopoulos promised to stage a protest that would match the days long labor unrest which brought much of france to a halt in mid november also over plans to reform pensions the planned protests are a reminder of massive street demonstrations in the spring of the last serious attempt at greek social security reform at that time more than people took to the streets in a protest that nearly brought down the union friendly socialist government then in power despite warnings and historical precedent analysts say the government isnt likely to flinch in the overall direction of reforms even if it makes some adjustments at the margin one reason a recent public opinion poll shows that more than of greeks favor social security reform even though the same poll shows support slips slightly when respondents are asked to judge specific changes as well the protest may have represented a high water mark for the unions in some ways although they remain strong with some million members their influence particularly with a pro business government in power has waned "it will be a big protest though not necessarily on the level of the recent french protests " said george kirtsos political commentator and editor of the city press newspaper "but the situation in is very different from " in addition following the september elections the main opposition panhellenic socialist movement or pasok was left in disarray after one of its worst election showings in years since then pasok has been dealing with a leadership crisis and has been relatively silent about the social security reforms many of the reforms that the new democracy government wants to implement arent that different from what pasok wanted to implement in "essentially i dont see that there will be any big changes to the governments pension reforms " said opinions mr livanios "thats because much of the populace has grasped that something has to be done that the problems with the social security system have to be resolved and for the government social security reform is a basic principle of their election platform there may be an even bigger political cost for new democracy if they were to pull back from the reforms rather than if they were to continue "
