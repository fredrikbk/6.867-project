fiscally fit should we outsource our party the cullens weigh whether to cater this years family christmas dinner online edition my husband gerry and i are hosting christmas dinner for my extended family and making sure the party goes smoothly will take some planning which raised a basic question how much of the prep work should we handle ourselves and how much should we outsource gerrys biggest concern is the food well have roughly people stopping by throughout the day with half of them likely staying for dinner generally when gerry and i throw a big party we have the entire meal catered our last big party was for our son geralds birthday and our catering bill came to &# gerry and i love to cook but weve both found that we enjoy our parties much more when the only thing we have to worry about is whether the serving trays are still warm i also appreciate not having to deal with the kitchen clean up afterward but this is the first time were hosting christmas in a home big enough for my large family to have a sit down dinner so weve decided to try a more formal approach gerry urged me to have the dinner catered as weve always done he thinks a sit down dinner will be a bigger hassle for me than a buffet and that catering the food will help eliminate some stress but i love a sit down dinner especially at christmas we give prayers of thanks toast the occasion and share a true sense of family in preparation for the party i checked my catering services menus to see how much more expensive a formal dinner party would be the catering facility we use offers a complete holiday dinner ham turkey all the trimmings for &# per person assuming people in all feeding my entire extended family would cost about &# plus another &# in state sales tax i estimate i could buy the groceries needed to prepare the same dinner for about half that family members often bring desserts so we wouldnt have to pay for that i understand why gerry prefers the convenience of having the dinner catered but with christmas eve falling on a monday this year ill have the whole weekend to prepare much of the food in advance so ive decided to do the cooking this year i just hope my family doesnt end up wishing id had it catered too because people will be dropping in and out all day ill need plenty of snacks appetizers and finger food that job makes the most sense to outsource i have no patience for the tedious work of creating cheese and vegetable platters seafood dips and the like so well order a number of party platters our catering facility charges &# each for cheese fruit vegetable and small sandwich platters for a total of &# money well spent since were having a sit down dinner ill also need more chairs than the eight we already have gerry toyed with the idea of buying a set of nice folding chairs arguing that "if were going to do sit down meals it might cost less to buy chairs than to rent them " i searched for folding chair prices online and immediately quashed that notion the cheapest cushioned folding chair i could find was &# or &# for the chairs well need our local party supply rental service charges just &# a chair including delivery and pick up i thought buying the chairs made more sense since well have spent that much on rentals after six parties or so but gerry was more concerned about the space needed to store them the attic is the only place with enough room and he was dreading having to lug all those the chairs up and down so for &# well take the rentals years ago we bought a large folding table for &# and a smaller &# table for use at parties so we dont need to rent those i know what youre thinking and yes itll be a tight fit but with the kids seated at the inevitable kids table im hoping well have enough room my next stop was the housewares department i dont own enough fine china for people and even if i serve the kids with my everyday dishes i wont have enough matching dishes and glasses to go around renting a china set consisting of three dishes and a coffee cup costs &# per person at my supplier or &# for sets around what youd pay to buy just one set of fine china but renting was still not our idea of a bargain a thousand bucks for plates ill be spending the next few evenings searching online for less expensive dinnerware sets for which ill store in our pantry for easy access after the party is over one relief is i wont have to pay for additional cutlery over the years ive accumulated a number of sets so were covered there as for decorations we wont be doing anything different than we would during years when were not hosting parties so the outlay there is relatively small &# for a fresh tree pine roping and front door wreath now all thats left to do to prepare for our holiday dinner is make up my shopping list and get to cooking did we make the right choices i guess well know after the party do you prefer to have your parties catered or do you enjoy preparing the food on your own would you choose to buy additional chairs and dishes and store them for future parties or do you think rentals are the way to go write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com and then come join me in a discussion about
