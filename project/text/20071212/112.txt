the afternoon report fed unveils new tools online edition the new plans address a number of problematic areas in the financial system says vincent reinhart former director of the federal reserve boards division of monetary affairs who since october has been a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute only primary dealers can participate in the federal reserves open market operations the central banks most frequently used method of implementing monetary policy ben bernankes federal reserve showed off a few new tools today a day after a quarter point cut of the fed funds rate didnt impress wall street and set off a stock market tumble ahead of the open the fed said it has banded together with four other major central banks to announce a series of moves aimed at pumping more cash into global money markets the overall aim is to get persistently viscous credit channels flowing freely once again one way policy makers are looking to do it is through the creation of reciprocal "swap" lines between the european central bank for &# billion and the swiss national bank for &# billion such swap lines will let the ecb and snb make dollar loans to banks in their jurisdiction the inability of foreign central banks to inject funds in anything other than their own currency has been a factor creating the squeeze on bank funding in those markets such swap lines are nothing new in the world of central banks said marvin goodfriend a professor of economics at carnegie mellon university who studies monetary policy "its just a way of getting dollars in the hands of foreign central banks which dont have the right to produce them at will " he said another move the fed rolled out today is the creation of a "term auction facility" under which the fed would lend at least &# billion and maybe a lot more in four separate auctions at rates far below the those charged on loans the fed hands directly to banks at its "discount window " the ecb bank of england bank of canada and swiss national bank simultaneously announced parallel measures aimed at countering pressures driving up rates in short term funding markets so what do these bright shiny new tools let the fed do that its current bag of tricks doesnt the new plans address a number of problematic areas in the financial system says vincent reinhart former director of the federal reserve boards division of monetary affairs who since october has been a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute of primary importance is the attempt to try to get around the stigma attached to borrowing from the discount window a move which to the markets has long smacked of desperation "by having an auction theyre basically holding a party " said mr reinhart "theyre having a sale on discount window credit and theyre encouraging more participants to show up so it is less the individual firms initiatives " by attracting a crowd that includes rock solid institutions the auction may offer cover for others to step up and borrow there too the very same crowd if they show would also add to the number of conduits through which capital could sluice into to the broader economic system that will likely boost the efficiency of the transfer of capital out of the fed for example only primary dealers can participate in the federal reserves open market operations the central banks most frequently used method of implementing monetary policy and in light of the financial jitters sweeping through the markets primary dealers might be more tight fisted in loaning funds out to borrowers mr reinhart said financial jitters might also dissuade those primary dealers from coughing up the collateral required for open market operations its the same ultra safe government securities financial institutions like to hold during times of financial stress mr reinhart says this is another area in which the auction may offer an advantage since the fed says the new loans can be secured by the same broad variety of collateral that banks pledge for discount window loans mr goodfriend the carnegie mellon professor notes that the size of todays announced fed programs is relatively small "its not a huge program although it might make a difference " he said "i think the idea is to start relatively small and see what happens and then maybe improve some of the details over time if necessary "
