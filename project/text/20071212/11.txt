baghdad life warmth between iraqis and palestinians gives way to animosity and resentment online edition positioning himself as a defender of arab nations and as their outspoken leader saddam had paid special attention to arabs residing in iraq and made sure they were comfortable during the s when the egyptian national soccer team lost a match in the world cup angry egyptian workers rioted in a commercial district of baghdad destroying stores windows and doors much love has been lost between iraqis and arabs in general and iraqi and palestinians in particular since the u s invasion as soon as saddam was gone the affinity and amiability between iraqis and palestinians a hallmark of decades of baath party rule began to fade the mutual warmth friends and others say sometimes turned into hostility positioning himself as a defender of arab nations and as their outspoken leader saddam had paid special attention to arabs residing in iraq and made sure they were comfortable as a result and particularly during the s when iraq was prosperous many arabs especially egyptians palestinians yemenis and sudanese found in iraq not only an opportunity to work and earn money to send back home but also a place where they were well received and respected one example during the s when the egyptian national soccer team lost a match in the world cup angry egyptian workers rioted in a commercial district of baghdad destroying stores windows and doors many were arrested and thrown into jail i remember saddam appearing on television the next day ordering the workers release and compensation for the shop owners he said the egyptians were our guests and guests even if they misbehaved should be treated well as examined in a baghdad life dispatch on wednesday saddam reacted strongly to the palestinian intifada in forming the al quds army or jerusalem army the government called it a force of seven million iraqi men and women ready to sacrifice their lives to help their palestinian brothers i was compelled to be part of that force and eventually marched before saddam as he reviewed the jerusalem army in a massive ceremony in late in saddams iraq many ordinary iraqis coveted the treatment that palestinians received back then palestinian friends told me their families were given houses to live in stipends to live on and bonuses on iraqi national holidays and saddams birthday among other privileges their children went to kindergartens and schools and were able to assimilate in iraqi society so well that you couldnt tell the difference between an iraqi and a palestinian arab friends told me then that top colleges in iraq had seats reserved for students from other arab countries especially palestinians two of my college classmates for instance were from yemen and enrolled in the english department through a cooperative program between the iraqi and yemeni governments while most students in the english department had studied the language throughout their earlier education these two had only rudimentary english skills and eventually hired me as a tutor once while i was explaining excerpts from hamlet to them i asked how they managed to get into the school despite their weak skills they told me that they were sent by their government and hadnt been required to pass any tests since turning against saddam many iraqis have lost interest in the palestinians and some have turned hostile toward them immediately after the war for instance palestinians who had been given low rent apartments under saddam were evicted by landlords seeking to take back their property according to the united nations high commission for refugees more generally iraqis have shown their anger about the special treatment palestinians received and there is another big factor at play the conflict between the israelis and palestinians though a key issue for many arabs now seems far removed from iraqis weighed down with trying to overcome their domestic dilemma and bring security to their terrorism plagued country many arabs across the middle east are still big fans of saddam one morning in may i was in amman jordan to get my u s visa at the u s embassy a jordanian cab driver of palestinian descent noticed i had a different accent from his and asked where i was from when i told him he started to blame me for saddams ouster as if i were behind it while i told him that i had nothing to do with it he said all iraqis would claim that saddam was "the only real arab leader " he said and all others were corrupt puppets to the west "iraqis and all arabs lost a courageous leader forever " he added as i looked from the cab windows at the stores lining the streets a woven mat with saddams image embroidered on it caught my eye there are signs that the new animosity between iraqis and arabs extends to new communities into which both have moved a few weeks ago i was speaking with an iraqi who had resettled in michigan on a special immigrant visa program for interpreters who had worked for the u s army he told me he had been rejected for a job at an arab owned store because of his prior work for the u s in iraq "were being seen as defectors " he said back in new york a few months ago i was getting a haircut at my regular barber shop in my predominantly arab neighborhood we were watching an al jazeera report about iraqi police taking a group of palestinians to jail after they were suspected of orchestrating a bombing the palestinian barber though he knew i was from iraq started cursing all iraqis and wishing them a worse situation than the one they had already i asked him to calm down stop generalizing and remember the days when these same people marched for him and his people i seemed to have embarrassed him in front of other arab customers though still angry he bent his head picked up his scissors and continued to work
