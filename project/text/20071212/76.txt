nbc gives money back to advertisers unusual move shows networks vulnerability to the writers strike nbc universal is taking the unusual step of giving advertisers cash back for primetime ratings shortfalls from last season the move is a departure for nbc which like other broadcast networks typically gives advertisers additional tv spots called make goods when ratings fall short of expectations the unusual move shows the networks particular vulnerability both to the hollywood writers strike and to a new commercial ratings system being used this year for the first time the fourth place network is in a steeper ratings depression than its peers with no standout new shows in the fall season say media buyers that makes it harder for nbc to make up ratings shortfalls by giving away additional commercial air time the reimbursements were reported by mediaweek this week advertisers generally buy commercial time during the spring and early summer well before the fall season begins in what are known as the upfronts nbc sold an unusually high percentage of its advertising time upfront this year and then sold much of what it had left earlier this quarter media buyers say media buyers said it made more financial sense for nbc to pay the cash back now than carry that liability forward because if ratings continue to fall the network will have a harder time catching up the reimbursements are for ratings shortfalls from about september to may in a statement nbc said "this represents an extremely small portion of nbcs business and accommodates the changing needs of our clients marketing plans nbc is working with its clients to come up with creative solutions in a sales environment faced with a new business metric and a writers strike " giving money back to advertisers is usually a last resort say media buyers "thats my worst case scenario " says larry novenstern director of national broadcast at publicis groupes zenith optimedia a media firm whose clients include t mobile and whirlpool mr novenstern as of yesterday said he hadnt been approached about reimbursements he added "we develop a plan for every client for the year now youre telling me all this inventory wont get on the air in the fourth quarter " it is unclear if other networks will offer reimbursements to advertisers media buyers for instance noted that the cw has very few open advertising slots for the quarter cbs corp chief executive leslie moonves told a media conference last week that ratings "probably will not be as high without the influx of our great original programming " he said the network is fulfilling some "make goods" from last year but that cbs still has inventory available and isnt facing an end of year crunch yesterday a cbs spokesman said "we dont have a make good problem " abc cw and fox declined to comment even before the strike shut down production on most scripted programming the fall season had been a depressing one for the broadcast networks no new shows broke out as hits and ratings overall were down considerably across the board with more and more viewers watching tv on playback from digital video recorders nbc has had a particularly rough year following up on a disappointing season last year when only the comic book drama "heroes" took off as a modest hit nbc tried out four new scripted shows this fall "chuck " "life " "journeyman" and "bionic woman" none has managed to build a serious following so far this year is also the first that nielsen released commercial ratings for the broadcast networks fall shows until this season advertising rates were determined by live program viewership now they are determined by the amount of viewers who watch the commercials during the live broadcast of a show and on dvr playback for three days thereafter some networks saw a modest uptick in ratings from the conversion from live to commercial but nbc saw its ratings slip lower still now with the writers strike poised to drag on well into the new year disrupting not just this years scripted offerings but also the development season for next years advertisers are especially skittish to compensate for the absence of new scripted material the networks are filling their schedules with reality programs and repeats which executives expect to draw a smaller audience when they debut in the new year emily steel contributed to this article
