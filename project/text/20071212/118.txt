the informed patient keeping patients from landing back in hospital hospitals are taking steps to prevent the most common risk to patients after discharge landing back in the hospital due to complications that could have been prevented with better follow up care a revolving door of readmissions is driving up costs for hospitals and causing needless harm to patients especially elderly people with multiple chronic diseases nearly of medicare patients admitted to a hospital are readmitted within days of discharge accounting for &# billion in spending according to the medicare payment advisory commission the independent federal body that advises congress on medicare as a result readmission rates are coming under increasing scrutiny from regulators insurers employers and quality measurement groups who are considering methods to tie payment to lower readmissions "we have to start paying attention to peoples needs beyond the hospital door " says mary naylor a professor at the university of pennsylvanias school of nursing she has conducted a number of clinical trials on a model to help older adults with complex care needs after they are discharged "the experience of multiple hospitalizations can take a devastating toll on the human psyche and the quality of life for patients and their caregivers " she says there are about five million readmissions a year in u s hospitals with approximately a third occurring within days of discharge according to the institute for healthcare improvement a boston based nonprofit but with so called transitional care programs which follow patients for varying periods of time at home as many as of readmissions could be prevented says pat rutherford an ihi vice president the institute is working with hospitals to reduce readmissions its programs include identifying patients at risk for return scheduling follow up doctors appointments before patients are discharged sending nurses to patients homes within a few days of discharge monitoring patients at home and educating patients and families on how to adhere to medication schedules and self care regimens still hospitals often dont provide such services even patients who qualify for home care frequently dont get referrals that would help and in one survey of patients said no one at the hospital talked to them about managing their care at home part of the problem is that hospitals arent paid to coordinate care once a patient leaves but that may change large managed care groups and insurers are now experimenting with programs to cover such services both aetna and kaiser permanente the california based managed care giant are working on pilot programs based on dr naylors model her studies show that discharge planning and home care services for at risk hospitalized elderly patients can reduce readmissions lengthen the time between discharge and readmission and cut the cost of providing care if pilot programs in chicago and philadelphia do succeed in reducing readmissions for aetnas medicare members such programs could be rolled out more broadly says randall krakauer an aetna medical director "we believe this can improve the quality of care for members and more than pay for itself by reducing the costs of care by a larger amount than the cost of the home visits " dr krakauer says ihi and other groups are focusing in particular on follow up care for patients with congestive heart failure the leading cause of hospitalization among older patients according to ms rutherford almost a third of heart failure patients are readmitted within days of discharge with complications from the condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to the bodys other organs changes such as sudden weight gain can signal a crisis so diet and exercise must be closely monitored along with adherence to treatments such as blood pressure medications after a patient leaves the hospital st lukes hospital a cedar rapids iowa institution thats affiliated with the iowa health system collaborated with ihi on a program called ideal transition home for patients with heart failure working with local doctors and an affiliated home care group to coordinate follow up care among other things it uses a method called teach back asking patients and families to restate in their own words what theyve been told about how to follow care instructions at home patients are sent home with a refrigerator magnet that includes a list of symptoms to watch for and an emergency number to call gail nielsen clinical performance improvement education administrator for iowa health system says the program helped the hospital cut unplanned readmission rates in half to as of last january david dunn a year old retired golf course manager suffering from congestive heart failure diabetes and kidney disease was admitted to st lukes earlier this year to have three stents placed in blocked arteries with a history of repeated hospitalizations he was signed up for the home transition program which included follow up visits by home care nurses and special instructions to help his family monitor his condition "the care was so much better than anything wed experienced " says his daughter deb kacena who recalls other hospital stays marked by poor communication with doctors and little follow up care "it was really crucial because there were so many things going on with him " after patients who may be at high risk for readmission are discharged from kaisers san francisco medical center nurses visit them cutting through red tape if need be to get them quickly into doctors appointments "we form trusting relationships with the patient and we know what to look for and what could get them back in the hospital " says jill murray a nurse in the transitional care program one grateful patient is year old irwin goldner a retired clothing salesman who was hospitalized earlier this year with pneumonia and complications from heart failure and kidney failure after his discharge nurses in the program accompanied him to doctors appointments and followed up with phone calls to make sure he was taking his medication correctly and watching his weight mr goldner says he follows their instructions to the letter in order to avoid going back in the hospital "i call it self preservation " he says "i like living " email informedpatient wsj com
