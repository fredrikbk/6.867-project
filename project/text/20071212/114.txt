the evening wrap playing nice in iowa online edition stocks wild ride ends in gains stocks finished modestly higher after a session of wild intraday swings as investors digested the federal reserves announcement that it was teaming up with other central banks see item below republican front runners largely passed up a chance to get in a few final jabs during the last debate before the crucial iowa caucus early next month the high profile participants in this afternoons debate which was moderated by the editor of the des moines register largely avoided blatant finger pointing and head butting and struck a civil tone that contrasted with the rising levels of rancor seen lately in republican ranks some had expected fireworks between former massachusetts gov mitt romney and former arkansas gov mike huckabee whose campaign has recently eroded the once formidable lead of the romney campaign in the state but nothing much materialized likely meaning the debate didnt change many minds in iowa "i dont think this pushes the numbers one way or another " said dennis goldford a professor of politics at iowas drake university thats something of a surprise since mr romney fired a shot over mr huckabees bow tuesday airing a negative ad in iowa attacking the former arkansas governors record on immigration despite the old chestnut that iowans find negative campaigns a turnoff whether thats true or not is unclear according to mr goldford iowans expect hard campaigning and understand the difference between negative campaigns and dirty tricks though he admits that politics in the state tend not to be as much of a "bloodsport" as they are in some others at any rate the civil tone of todays debate probably helped mr huckabee a bit since it was his first debate after ascending into the ranks of serious contenders and he wasnt faced with some of the tougher questions about his record that have begun to crop up thanks to his new place in the spotlight mr huckabees rise in iowa underscores the fluidity in the republican race that extends outside of iowa where last weeks newsweek poll showed mr huckabee beating mr romney by a margin nationwide former new york city mayor rudolph giuliani continues to top the list of republicans according to todays washington post abc news poll though his support has sunk to its lowest point so far this year the post reports that mr huckabee by contrast has seen his support more than double since early november and now hes nipping at mr giulianis heels on the national stage stocks wild ride ends in gains stocks finished
