business are big bonuses still due after a bust give back that bonus that angry cry has been heard for years from governance consultants and shareholders seething at the way some chief executives grow rich as investors suffer usually such shouting is futile bosses defend their pay or simply ignore criticism either way they keep the cash perhaps agreeing to take leaner pay packages in the future then last week william mcguire the former unitedhealth group ceo agreed to give back prior compensation totaling &# million his was an extreme case growing out of alleged malfeasance in the way his stock options had been priced but mr mcguires retreat creates fascinating new possibilities what if more bosses could be cajoled into surrendering prior payouts that are viewed as grossly excessive even if those leaders arent legally at risk what if board compensation committees got the corporate equivalent of golfs mulligan a "do over" on particularly ill advised pay awards a new analysis by equilar inc a redwood shores calif pay consulting firm found plenty of noteworthy bonuses the firm identified well rewarded executives with cash bonuses of at least &# million in whose stocks have skidded at least this year such bonuses could be viewed as generous or even excessive equilar found of them at companies equilars list no surprise is dominated by home building and financial companies both sectors have been slammed by falling housing prices and the mortgage meltdown both also are known for pay plans tilted toward short term payoffs such as cash bonuses rather than slower stock based programs that vest over several years just because bonus recipients couldnt sustain their winning ways isnt automatically reason to go after them says joseph grundfest a governance expert at stanford law school many of those stumbles may reflect bad luck or slumping conditions in the executives industries thats life he says just as sports teams dont win rebates if a star athlete has a bad year "these contracts are decisions made among consenting adults " prof grundfest adds but some wipeouts happened so quickly after bonus payments that they invite closer scrutiny american home mortgage investment corp paid bonuses of more than &# million apiece to two top executives in or early in august the company filed for protection from creditors under chapter of the bankruptcy code mark indelicato an attorney for american homes creditors says he hasnt yet investigated the circumstances of those bonuses but adds "it is something we will look at " even if creditors arent able to win repayment of old bonuses lawyers observe the threat of litigation can sometimes help creditors win other concessions an american home spokesman declined to comment in another case countrywide financial corp decided last year to pay angelo mozilo mozilo as much as &# million for signing a three year contract to stay on as ceo mr mozilo has worked at countrywide for years he co founded the company mr mozilos defenders say the payments are justified because the ceo gave up &# million a year in retirement benefits by remaining on the job shareholders are so frustrated with countrywides overall performance the stock is down more than this year that the retention payments dont top their gripe list but charles elson a governance specialist at the university of delaware says the &# million payment strikes him as indefensible "where else was he going to go " prof elson asks "it doesnt make sense to pay founders for staying on at a company this isnt a retention bonus its a gift " countrywide officials declined to discuss mr mozilos compensation beyond what has already been publicly disclosed as prof elson sees it runaway bonus plans get approved because less assertive directors on compensation committees "feel overshadowed" by the ceo "that makes it very hard for them to confront him or her about compensation " he says at some big home builders ceos continued to collect multimillion dollar bonuses last year albeit smaller ones than before even as business prospects and their companies stock prices weakened robert toll the ceo of toll brothers inc got &# million in cash and stock stuart miller the ceo of lennar corp got a &# million cash bonus officials at both companies dismiss any suggestion that those bonuses were unwarranted even though the home builders fortunes have slid much further this year tolls stock is down while lennars is off each reported a hefty loss for the latest quarter lennar says mr miller wont get a bonus this year realistically shareholders and directors will be able to force bonus repayments only in extremely rare cases says paul hodgson a governance specialist at corporate library in portland maine those are likely to be situations where as with unitedhealth legal or regulatory pressures weigh on the ceo but the size of the mcguire payback means that talk of clawing back bonuses cant be laughed off anymore it is just enough of a possibility that tough minded directors or shareholders could use this threat to push for more palatable yet still substantial restraints in the ways that underperforming companies pay their top executives and in the tug of war between financially ambitious ceos and the people who are supposed to rein them in the forces of prudence need all the help they can get
