citigroups unlikely saviors pandit bischoff insiders relatively so plan revamp job cuts give me some time vikram pandit and sir win bischoff a little known duo who spent most of their careers working under the radar now must work under the glare of wall street scrutiny to fix citigroup inc the nations largest bank by assets in naming mr pandit and sir win as chief executive officer and chairman respectively the banks board yesterday tapped two insiders with relatively short citigroup tenures who came aboard as the result of previous acquisitions at the beginning of few people on wall street would have cited either as candidates to succeed charles prince a longtime lawyer at the bank who stepped down last month amid mounting losses but after a five week search it became clear that few executives outside the company would be equipped to manage the sprawling financial conglomerate also an outsider might be tempted to quickly dismantle the empire created a decade ago by sanford weill mr pandit said he will immediately begin reviewing the banks operations "they are different businesses and they need different strategies " he said in an interview a former morgan stanley executive who ran its institutional securities division mr pandit most recently has overseen citigroups investment bank and alternative investments operations "we would not be surprised if following his review certain businesses were either sold or restructured " wrote john mcdonald a banking analyst at bank of america in a research report indeed investors have been clamoring for dramatic action with many calling for a break up of the company whose stock has plunged about this year citigroup was down to &# at p m yesterday in new york stock exchange composite trading a person familiar with the matter said that messrs pandit years old and bischoff already are considering an overhaul that includes intensive cost cutting and job cuts other management shuffles may also be on the way the bigger issue however is whether they believe the sprawling financial conglomerate should remain one company or as some investors and analysts believe be dismantled "i will undertake an objective and dispassionate review of all the businesses individually and in aggregate to make sure we are properly positioned for the future " mr pandit said on a conference call with analysts yesterday he declined to comment on whether the bank might shed any of its businesses saying only "youve got to give me some time to go through due process " he said assembled by mr weill a decade ago citigroups sprawling empire has come under enormous pressure in the past couple of years the bank has struggled to curb expenses and increase revenue but hasnt consistently accomplished its goals it has been particularly hard hit by the credit crunch writing down billions of dollars in losses tied to mortgage related investments when mr prince stepped down the bank announced it was facing another &# billion in losses seeking to stave off a dividend cut or forced asset sales the bank recently received a &# billion capital injection from an investment arm of the abu dhabi government meanwhile citigroups u s consumer business is lagging rivals like bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co mr pandits appointment came as little surprise particularly because he had for weeks been considered a leading contender for the job the bigger surprise was the appointment of sir win who was named interim ceo last month when mr prince stepped down little known even inside citigroup he wasnt expected to remain in a high level post following the naming of a permanent ceo but robert rubin the longtime citigroup director who stepped in as temporary chairman when mr prince stepped down didnt want to stay in the position according to people familiar with the situation mr rubin will now return to his previous duties which include serving as chairman of the boards executive committee last year mr rubin pocketed about &# million in total pay making him the banks second highest paid executive after mr prince and a lightning rod for criticism among shareholders and employees frustrated by the banks weak stock price a citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment on mr rubins current compensation saying it will be disclosed in the companys proxy statement next year mr pandit and sir win are well versed in the sophisticated capital markets and banking businesses that are now under pressure but neither has much experience in the consumer businesses such as retail banking and credit cards that make up a big part of citigroups operations these businesses are expected to receive increased scrutiny next year as investors and analysts try to assess whether the rout in the nations housing markets will spill over into other consumer businesses already credit card delinquencies are rising from historic lows and banks are setting aside more funds to cover soured loans "we are a little disappointed citigroup did not look for a chairman with more consumer banking experience to complement mr pandit " said frank braden an equity analyst with standard &amp poors speaking with reporters yesterday mr pandit praised citigroups wealth management arm which includes the smith barney retail brokerage and the private bank and its overseas credit card operations as "growth businesses " low key and cerebral mr pandit spent most of his career at morgan stanley where he was once viewed to be in line for the ceo job since joining citigroup earlier this year when the bank bought his fledgling hedge fund for about &# million mr pandits stature within the bank has soared as the banks fortunes have diminished although he has been at the bank for only about six months he was promoted shortly after arriving and has played a leading role in the banks efforts to assess its exposure to its mortgage related investments as tumultuous credit markets have roiled wall street although frequently cited as a potential successor to mr prince someday it wasnt expected that he would step into the role so soon like mr prince before him mr pandit often shuns attention upon taking the reins of the alternative investments group earlier this year he politely refused to move into the office of the units previous chief saying it was too opulent "it would be embarrassing " he told an associate instead mr pandit opted for smaller digs that afforded him easier access to his team citigroup insiders also say mr pandit was mortified when the new york post reported in september that he paid &# million to buy the manhattan apartment once owned by the actor tony randall a native of mumbai india mr pandit arrived in the u s as a teenager he earned an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and a doctoral degree in finance from columbia university where he now serves as a trustee and was a junior finance professor at indiana university in the mid s before joining morgan stanley as head of morgan stanleys powerful institutional securities division from to mr pandit pushed the company into more electronic trading and helped build the firms prime brokerage services that cater to hedge funds he led the institutional securities business from until march mr pandit hasnt been shy about expressing dissatisfaction with the banks performance in his first address to members of citigroups markets and banking division last month for example he repeatedly noted that the investment banks productivity hasnt risen in tandem with increases in headcount and assets according to people who attended the meeting sir win as chairman of citigroups european businesses developed a reputation as a traditional banker who prefers working with clients over managing other executives he was chairman and chief executive at schroders plc which was acquired by citigroup in mr pandit for one hopes his status as a citigroup newcomer will be a strength "im fortunate that ive been at the company long enough to understand it but still come in with a fresh set of eyes which i think is a great positive " he said in the interview
