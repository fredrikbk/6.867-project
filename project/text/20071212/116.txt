the morning brief over guestimating a very cautious fed online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here if many investors seemed caught off guard by the federal reserves move to lower interest rates by just a quarter point the fed itself seemed to be acting out of caution bred by heightened uncertainty about where the economys going the steep decline in stock prices yesterday came when the markets didnt get the half percentage point cut so many analysts had described as "baked in" or "priced in" or whatever the jargon du jour happened to be when the fed lowered its target for the federal funds rate for overnight loans between banks to just the markets tanked the dow jones industrial average closed down points or at most asian markets suffered similar declines today and at midday all the major european stock indexes were trading lower as well bloomberg and others say this suggests a split of opinion between the fed and the markets but if theres a sense on wall street that as morgan stanley economist david greenlaw argues to the wall street journal "the fed doesnt get it " fed policy makers themselves might consider such ignorance the healthiest point of view fed predilections toward lowering or raising the cost of borrowed money stem from how they judge the balance of risks between the threats to economic growth and the threats of rising inflation yesterday members of the federal open market committee declined to express any guess on that balance instead they settled on stating that "recent developments including the deterioration in financial market conditions have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation " stung by the need to reverse their relatively rosier statement at the last fomc meeting on oct fomc members apparently want to wait and see what happens next the strains on financial markets seen to be easing in october have now increased while "incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending " the fed acknowledged and while the last rate cut was deemed pre emptive insurance against "adverse" economic problems to come yesterdays was described as the fuel for greater borrowing the economy needs now the feds last beige book compilation of regional fed reports suggested labor markets remained relatively tight overall meaning a nascent inflation threat remains and as the financial times reports the u s agriculture department warned of additional shortfalls in cereal stocks which could feed food inflation which like the high global petroleum costs can feed accelerated growth of overall consumer prices but whatever the fed said inflation isnt the bigger worry a lack of available credit for businesses to spend and build and hire is as the journal reports the fed is looking at a variety of other measures to further address the credit crunch "including another cut in the discount rate on loans it makes directly to banks longer term loans to money market dealers easier collateral rules for loans from the fed and other steps " because whatever the u s economy brings between yesterdays fed meeting and the next one in january it doesnt look good pandits chance to bat for citi citigroup yesterday named vikram pandit as its new chief executive and sir win bischoff as chairman two insiders who havent been with the financial giant long and joined the company through previous acquisitions as the wall street journal notes "at the beginning of few people on wall street would have cited either as candidates to succeed charles prince a longtime lawyer at the bank who stepped down last month amid mounting losses " the journal says "but after a five week search it became clear that few executives outside the company would be equipped to manage the sprawling financial conglomerate also an outsider might be tempted to quickly dismantle the empire created a decade ago by sanford weill " still mr pandit tells the journal he will start by looking at the banks far flung operations "they are different businesses and they need different strategies " he says and though mr pandits review pledge prompted speculation there could be significant change he said it was too early to reach any conclusions the financial times adds also of note washington post u s defense secretary robert gates sharply criticized nato countries for not supplying urgently needed trainers helicopters and infantry for afghanistan as violence escalates there vowing not to let the alliance "off the hook " he called for overhauling the alliances afghan
