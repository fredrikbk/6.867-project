a subprime gauge in many ways abx warts and all is only game in town ubs faults it but uses it when swiss bank ubs ag wrote down its subprime mortgage investments by an additional &# billion this week an obscure and sometimes maligned credit market index played a key role the index called the abx tracks the value of securities backed by subprime home loans people familiar with the matter say ubs looked to the abx as a guidepost in determining values for its holdings the development underscores the importance of this index in the subprime mortgage crisis it also raises questions about whether the market is sending the right signals about the severity of mortgage debt problems some portions of the abx are down as much as this year some analysts think actual losses may not be as severe as the index implies morgan stanley and citigroup inc have cited the abxs dive as a factor in giant write downs in recent weeks rating services and bond insurers are keeping a close eye on it and many hedge funds have used it to make bets against housing the index was launched two years ago by a london company called markit group ltd and is viewed as a proxy for the values of baskets of subprime mortgage securities because the securities themselves hardly trade the index gets direction from instruments called credit default swaps which trade more actively swaps values rise and fall based on investor perceptions of default risk among the underlying securities when default risks rise the index falls and vice versa some critics say the abx captures a narrow slice of the mortgage market and is prone to bets to the downside that depress it ubs chief executive marcel rohner maligned it as "extremely illiquid" in late october before turning to it for guidance the abxs rising prominence and mixed reviews highlight one of the biggest challenges of the mortgage crisis investors bankers auditors and market watchdogs dont have many tools to take the daily temperature of the opaque mortgage debt market in the stock market investors easily assess the landscape by looking at the performance of the dow jones industrial average the standard &amp poors index or prices of individual stocks market prices of individual mortgage securities however are hard to observe as they trade privately and infrequently during this years liquidity crunch the need for pricing information thrust the abx into the spotlight "the abx has been critical its produced market prices showing that subprime was in fact creating deep losses in important sections of the mortgage market that investors otherwise would not have been able to see " says christian stracke an analyst at debt research company creditsights "its the only game in town " the abx tracks subprime mortgage backed securities that have a total original value of roughly &# billion thats a small piece of the &# trillion subprime market yesterday freddie mac chief financial officer buddy piszel said the abx shouldnt be used as a benchmark for freddie because the indexs composition doesnt accurately represent the companys roughly &# billion worth of asset backed securities tied to subprime mortgages roughly &# billion to &# billion of trades take place in the abx each day that compares with &# billion in average daily trading volume in s&amp p index futures and options contracts on the chicago mercantile exchange critics say the relatively thin trading of the abx on some days makes it prone to being moved by a few large trades much of the trading in the index also has leaned in the same direction banks use it to hedge against mortgage risk and hedge funds use it to bet on further drops in housing both trades tend to depress it some analysts contend the value of some abx indexes imply a catastrophic outcome for the subprime mortgage market that seems remote for instance wachovia capital markets analysts glenn schultz and john mcelravey say the price of the abx that tracks aaa rated mortgage debt implies losses of around among pools of subprime mortgages issued in a cumulative loss of would be achieved if all subprime mortgages were to default and recover only half their value after foreclosing on the homes or if half were to default and recover nothing most wall street analysts expect to in cumulative losses for these loans as of august the delinquency rate on all subprime loans was around for subprime mortgages around have already been paid down many through refinancing and have defaulted other abx indexes such as one that tracks bbb rated securities show losses that are more in line with analysts forecasts but the indexs sharp movements have invited skeptics "weve completely overdone this " says jim bianco of bianco research still markit managing director ben logan says the abx has helped the market make a swift adjustment to the mortgage crisis and led to the unwinding of excesses on wall street "the correction is probably faster in coming and sharper than it would have been without an abx index but i think it will also be over faster " mr logan said ubs at first balked at employing the abx because of its volatility on oct when the swiss bank reported a &# billion write down of mortgage and cdo securities marcel rohner the ubs chief executive said "we do not mark against the abx index this index is extremely illiquid " as more banks used the index ubss view softened the bank realized it needed to pay heed to the market forces that provided pricing indications for its peers at an investor update yesterday chief financial officer marco suter included a slide that showed steep price declines for the aaa and bbb abx indexes tied to subprime mortgages "the only market observable out there is the abx " mr suter said ubs stuck to its own valuation model to come up with its markdowns it used the abx to check its assumptions the two checked out and led to another big write down auction results here are the results for yesterdays treasury auctions all bids are awarded
