business world deal of the century remember "old" economy and "new" economy well if a merger in australia comes to pass a new giant will be born in the same stupendous market bracket as microsoft or ge a company worth upwards of &# billion but its towering market cap wont be due to intellectual property or dazzling new technology the expected gusher comes from shoveling the most basic of industrial commodities iron ore into china for once the worlds premier corporate drama is taking place somewhere besides the u s a proposed merger of bhp billiton and rio tinto touches on many key dilemmas of the age including the growing role of government run enterprises in the global marketplace bhp and rio may not be familiar names to americans both are listed in britain and australia and run out of australia where their key assets are neighboring iron reserves in the countrys famed pilbara region the two have been digging up and shipping to china as much of the pilbara as they can earning profit margins of on every shovelful the mainland consumed million tons in at a delivered price of roughly &# &# a ton next year its expected to consume million tons at perhaps &# a ton investors foresee no slackening of demand they see china willing to pay just about any price to keep churning out an ever growing volume of domestic steel for buildings cars and appliances put aside for the moment whether the intoxicating outlook is true in november bhp floated a stunning all stock offer for its fellow miner instigating the bid was ceo marius kloppers a south african who took charge just two months ago after a career coach reportedly was hired to soften his hard edges he says that only by getting bhp and rio together can the companies ramp up production fast enough to keep the raw material of the chinese miracle flowing his pet phrase "more faster " his counterpart a new jersey born alaska educated american tom albanese has held the rio tinto top job only since may he acknowledges an "industrial logic" to the deal but says the proposed price about &# billion is off by "several ballparks " rio has lately been trading above the offer price and punters seem to anticipate an agreement they are probably right between here and there though lies some intense politicking mr kloppers has jetted round asia to sell steelmakers on the deal but the important resistance is coming from chinas vast state owned steel industry and inevitably its overseers in beijing they see a "monopoly" being created to exploit its main customer china all this presents a ticklish problem for kevin rudd australias newly elected labor premier he prides himself on being a mandarin speaker and recognizes the need to keep his countrys fastest growing major trading partner happy australia has traditionally been skittish about foreign ownership of resources it blocked shell from buying local oil producer woodside but mr rudd will likely have to wave through a freer hand for the chinese to buy up australian resources in order to make the bhp rio merger easier for beijing to swallow shots already are flying across his bow a chinese ore trading firm sinosteel last week sent buyout feelers to midwest corp an australian miner if mr rudd turns australia into a happy hunting ground for beijing to buy up australian mines and mineral rights it would mark an incalculable precedent in the global economys coming to terms with the sovereign wealth phenomenon noodling out this challenge has lately been on the agenda of americans too after abu dhabis snapping up of a stake in citigroup our bet is that the sovereign wealth panic notwithstanding the global markets still have the upper hand in the long run take the likely repercussions if the bhp rio merger goes through on the receiving end china has long resisted a shakeout of the vast and rickety government run steel industry which lives off bad loans from the state banking system beijing worries about unemployment but chinas biggest steelmakers are whispering that a bhp rio merger might actually be a good thing if it broke down political opposition to a market friendly consolidation or consider the dim view china usually takes of imports opening up domestic markets to foreign steel and finished products would be another way to beat the high cost of imported ore many of the worlds steelmakers including americas have their own local ore deposits and dont depend on the costly internationally traded variety we have no doubt that backers of a bhp rio merger have thought of all this bhp has offered shares not cash for its rival which would protect the intended synergies from any decline in commodity prices and if anything bhp has shown little trepidation in taking on china over ore pricing on the larger question australians and others worry that chinese government firms when investing across national borders let political motives trump commercial ones the fear is not unfounded but neither is government ownership any proof against the unowned global marketplaces demand for efficiency fail to meet that demand and sovereign wealth ambitions will quickly become self liquidating thats probably the best reason for taking a relaxed view of what might otherwise be a troubling phenomenon
