tax report last minute tips for trimming your taxes there is still time to take advantage of rules set to expire many taxpayers still have time to make last minute moves that could trim their tax bills significantly for these include traditional tactics such as dumping investment losers donating stock to charity and timing deductions and income carefully but taxpayers should also consider a few other strategies that stem from recent tax law changes such as an expansion of the so called kiddie tax next year and a charitable giving provision scheduled to expire at the end of this year making smart moves may be unusually tricky for some people because congress still hasnt completed work on legislation designed to protect millions of taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax or amt this is a parallel tax system that operates under many different rules from the regular system for one thing taxpayers affected by the amt cant deduct state or local taxes if congress does nothing nearly million people will be hit by the amt for up from four million for lawmakers are expected to resolve this issue soon by slapping a patch on the law that would limit the spread of the amt meanwhile here are some year end ideas from tax and investment advisers make a gift to your kids a law enacted earlier this year will expand the reach of the kiddie tax which generally requires a childs income above a certain amount to be taxed at the parents higher rate but this change wont take effect until next year thus creating tax saving opportunities this year for some families for investment income above &# for a child years old or younger typically is subject to tax at the parents rate assuming its higher than the childs starting next year the age limit generally will rise to kids who are or full time students over but under the expanded provision wont apply to some kids with paid jobs congress made the change after this column reported that some wealthy families were planning to take advantage of a separate tax change designed to benefit low income taxpayers since the higher age limit wont apply until next month there is now "a small window of opportunity" for some people to transfer securities that have gone up in value over the years to kids or older as of dec and who would be subject to the kiddie tax next year says james a seidel senior tax analyst at thomson tax &amp accounting in new york the kids could sell the securities this month at a lower capital gains tax rate under the so called gift tax exclusion you can give as much as &# a year to anyone you wish and to each of as many people as you want without even having to report such a gift to the internal revenue service donate high flying stock if you itemize your deductions instead of claiming the standard deduction consider making last minute gifts to qualified charities but dont just write out a check think about donating shares of stock or mutual funds that have risen sharply in value over the years that way you wont owe capital gains tax on the gain and you typically can deduct the full market value of your gift make a donation from your ira take advantage of a law scheduled to expire at the end of this month that could benefit many older taxpayers if youre years old or older you can transfer as much as &# this year directly from your individual retirement account to a qualified charity without having to pay income taxes on that money also the transfer counts toward your minimum required distribution for the year just make sure the gift is made directly from the ira to charity taxpayers should take advantage of this break this year because they "might not see it again " says don weigandt a managing director of jpmorgan private bank a unit of j p morgan chase &amp co keep better records if you itemize your deductions and want to claim charitable donations pay close attention to new recordkeeping rules cash contributions made in regardless of the amount cant be deducted unless you have a "bank record " such as a canceled check or a detailed receipt from the charity that includes the amount and date of your gift says thomsons mr seidel for more details see irs publication at www irs gov this rule has altered the way some people donate cash to charities such as religious organizations "instead of dropping cash into the plate as i did in past years i began using pew envelopes noting my name etc " says jpmorgans mr weigandt "dutifully each quarter ive received a summary from the church confirming my cash donations along with my pledge payments paid by check " dump your losers take a fresh look at your investments look for stocks mutual fund shares and other securities that now are selling for less than you paid for them if you have some and have been considering bailing out now could be a good time to do so there are some powerful advantages first you can use your losses to soak up your gains on a dollar for dollar basis with no limit second if your losses exceed your gains you typically can deduct as much as much as &# a year of net capital losses from wages and other ordinary income the limit is &# a year if youre married and filing separately from your spouse additional net losses are carried over into future years boost your retirement savings this year millions of workers who are under age can sock away as much as &# in a k plan up from &# last year those who are or older by the end of this month can put away an additional &# the same as last year thus the limit for is &# up from &# drain flexible spending accounts these accounts allow millions of people to pay for health care and dependent care with pretax dollars but theres a catch you have to spend every penny you set aside or lose whatever you havent spent if you signed up for an account check with your employer to see what the closing date is for draining your account the treasury allows employers to extend the deadline for months beyond the end of the plan year that would mean for example that an employer with a plan year deadline of dec could give employees until mid march next year to incur expenses and drain their account for but employers werent required to grant the extra time and some havent be wary of mutual funds be especially careful this month before you invest significant amounts of money in mutual funds especially those that invest in stocks through a taxable account otherwise you could wind up getting hit with a tax bill that could easily have been avoided its especially important this year because fund managers say this could be the biggest year ever for year end distributions and this is the time of year when many mutual funds distribute capital gains to shareholders if you get a payout its typically taxable unless youre investing through a tax favored account thus before you invest check the funds web site or call the fund to see if its planning a year end distribution if so find out how much the payout will be when and whether it will result in a significant tax bill for you if the distribution will drive up your taxes significantly consider waiting to invest in that fund until after the date to qualify for the payment adjust your timing try to time income and deductions whenever possible to achieve the maximum tax savings for example if youre a consultant or free lance writer it may pay to defer income into by waiting to send out bills until then conversely if you know you wont have enough medical expenses to qualify for medical expense deductions for but are relatively sure you will qualify for the deduction for consider delaying non urgent medical visits and payments until next year whenever possible briefs rep jim mccrery of louisiana the ranking republican on the house ways and means
