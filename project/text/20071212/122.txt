the u s should try to russia with love robert d blackwills "forgive russia confront iran " op ed dec was the most sensible commentary about russia i have read on your pages in years ive traveled to russia often and have come to understand some reasons for the current political climate there is more to vladimir putins popularity than oil fueled prosperity in the early to mid s i found young russians to be largely pro american they looked at the u s as a model for their country and were hopeful that the fall of communism would usher in an era of cooperation between the u s and russia however cold water was thrown on these hopes by the clinton administrations decision to support expanding nato to include former warsaw pact countries without any prospect that russia would ever be invited this decision was made in the face of the opposition of such "russia hands" as george kennan who famously authored the "containment" policy against the soviet union and who indeed can be considered the "intellectual godfather" of nato itself president clinton also lost much credibility with russia by pushing nato to intervene in kosovo in the bush administration many russians say added insult to injury by sponsoring nato membership for portions of the former soviet union itself the baltic states the latest flash point has become the proposal to place antimissile bases in poland and the czech republic another issue russians cite as evidence of hostility by the u s government is the failure of congress to repeal the jackson vanik amendment which still prevents full normal trade relations between the u s and russia they point out that the original reason for jackson vanik soviet restrictions on emigration have been basically abolished for the past years some members of congress have "re invented" a new justification for jackson vanik based on russias shortcomings in the area of democratization and human rights but my russian colleagues point out that even with recent "backsliding" under mr putin russias record is still better in these fields than that of china which for all of its economic reforms is politically still a one party communist state moreover trade restrictions similar to jackson vanik have been removed on china as well as the other "former" communist countries mr blackwill cites the problem of iran as a reason to mend fences with russia but there are also other reasons to do so particularly involving the middle east given that our alliances with both pakistan and turkey are getting "frayed around the edges " perhaps the u s should try to make up for missed opportunities to build a strategic relationship with a post communist russia james m klebba professor of law loyola university new orleans college of law new orleans
