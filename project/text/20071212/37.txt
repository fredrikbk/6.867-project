encountering the sublime a turner retrospective washington i did not paint it to be understood " the famously truculent joseph mallord william turner is supposed to have said "it" was one of his most extreme evocations of natures ferocity "snow storm steam boat off a harbours mouth making signals in shallow water and going by the lead " a swirl of nervous slashes of blue grays and murky browns lit with flickers of creamy yellow and cold white the typically over specific title which continues "the author was in this storm on the night the ariel left harwich" bears out turners avowed purpose "i wished to show what such a scene was like i got the sailors to lash me to the mast to observe it i was lashed for four hours and did not expect to escape but felt bound to record it if i did but no one had any business to like the picture " this grumpy justification may have been invented by turners ardent admirer john ruskin but when the painting was first exhibited at the royal academy london in critical responses suggested that the artist achieved his goal almost no one liked it "the gentleman has on former occasions chosen to paint with cream or chocolate yolk of egg or currant jelly here he uses his whole array of kitchen stuff " wrote the athenaeum when turner showed "snow storm " he was in the last decade of a long brilliant controversy ridden career a great celebrity elected to the royal academy at he was hailed as a genius but excited acclaim and distaste almost equally despite his towering reputation the incomprehension that greeted "snow storm" was not unusual and personally the crusty artist unabashedly ambitious and forthright about the business of art was seen as vulgar in regency and victorian england today its the most outrageous of turners paintings that fascinate the audacity of pictures like "snow storm" their apparent indifference to mid th century pictorial norms has led some th century viewers to claim the artist as a proto modernist even a proto abstract expressionist his eminence as an academician notwithstanding present day eyes ignore the clunky little figures who enact the stirring narratives imposed by turner on broad painterly effects and the poems he wrote about them and resist his claims of accuracy in depicting weather drama and natural phenomena they concentrate instead on his free paint handling his emotional intensity and his emphasis on surface studies color trials and loosely constructed private works that were never meant to be exhibited discovered in the vast hoard of his work left to the british nation have further cemented turners reputation as an abstract painter avant la lettre now a major retrospective at the national gallery through jan to be seen later at the dallas museum of art and the metropolitan museum of art gives us a chance to see turner whole organized both chronologically and thematically its a large concentration demanding show that includes both icons and surprises both public exhibited and private often experimental seeming works the thesis is that turner was indeed a radical but not in the sense that the proto modernist camp would have it an accomplished landscape painter in an age when history painting large scale figures enacting morally instructive scenes from the past was synonymous with serious accomplishment he strove to widen notions of excellence the exhibition tracks the efforts that established him as a major artist using oil paint instead of watercolor and transforming his landscapes from pleasing views of british landmarks to thrilling images of the sublime substituting awe in the presence of untamed nature for the comfort of recognizing the familiar finding stimulus in the smoke and steam of modernity rather than in imagined antiquity nature as both the embodiment of the grandeur of god and the revelation of the truth of scientific thought became turners principal subject especially the most violent aspects of nature those great forces beyond the control of man tempests blizzards and storms at sea compete with scenes of urban cataclysms and dizzying alpine scenery turner traveled extensively in europe making watercolors as he went that slashing brushwork and that strange color prove to be justified pace the proto modernists by fog mist reflections the light changing polluted air of industrialized britain and the emissions of coal fired steam engines occasionally the murk of the north give way to the moist brilliant light of venice in luminous harbor scenes that remind of us of turners reverence for the th century french master claude lorrains glowing evocations of the classical world the exhibition concludes with a bang with everything from big dazzling "public" canvases to direct private notations including the watercolors recording the burning of the houses of parliament all puddles of orangey red deep blue and shimmering yellow these startling works were probably painted immediately after turner observed the catastrophe firsthand the canvases that the vivid studies generated are exciting with their ragged impastos their swoops of orange and dull blue and their unstable reflections but the intimacy and intensity of the watercolors cant be beat turners watercolors in fact exert their magic throughout show devoid of bombast economical and expressive they transform th century concepts of sublimity into wholly contemporary terms ms wilkin is the curator of "color as field american painting " at the denver art museum through feb see related letter "letters to the editor two giants in their fields" wsj
