false savior the federal reserve cut interest rates again yesterday and equity markets promptly sold off because it was only a basis point reduction this is probably good if paradoxical news the fed has become so pavlovian in its response to wall streets begging that even this modest declaration of independence is a welcome reminder that easier money is not the solution to every economic problem wall streets argument is that the housing recession and credit crisis threaten a larger downturn the day t bill rate under has sunk far below the fed funds rate of after yesterday so the fed is said to be "behind the curve " were told the banks caught up in the mortgage problems also need more "liquidity" if theyre going to lend thus pesky details like &# oil and the flagging greenback can be reckoned with later life would be grand if central banking were that simple the feds main obligation is to protect the value of the currency especially in a world where the dollar is the main value of global exchange with commodity prices at record levels and the dollar close to record lows chairman ben bernanke and his colleagues are already perceived as responding too readily to wall street and capitol hill they cant afford any more citations for reckless driving and their caution yesterday seems more than justified in any case it isnt at all clear that more liquidity is the solution to what is fundamentally a solvency problem the world isnt suffering from a dearth of dollars but rather from the fact that mortgage and real estate assets are worth much less than banks and homeowners once thought the t bill rate is less a sign of recession than it is of a flight to safety so its also less useful as a guide to fed policy at the banks those mortgage losses have to be absorbed with the help of new capital and the good news is that there seems to be more than enough available ubs and citigroup have tapped sovereign wealth funds while fannie mae and freddie mac are issuing billions of dollars in preferred stock washington mutual is cutting dividend which is what citi should have done before going hat in hand to abu dhabi there will be much more of this to come as most of the structured investment vehicles sivs that banks sold under their brand names are inevitably brought onto their balance sheets this slow motion banking repair essentially shrinking the financial system down from its distorted bubble proportions is the path back to solvency this is where the fed and u s treasury should be applying much of their backroom muscle as for homeowners it is always a tragedy when tens of thousands of americans lose their homes the lenders were helping many with voluntary forbearance even before last weeks treasury plan but any attempt at a wholesale rescue will only delay the day that housing prices find a bottom which is when the entire market can begin to recover some on wall street want the fed to refloat the housing bubble and inflate away all of this bad debt but the cost of that in future price increases and perhaps a global run on the dollar would be far more damaging theres little doubt the overall economy is slowing as the fed noted in its statement yesterday a recession is possible though last weeks jobs report and economic indicators suggest a slowdown not contraction the consumer is cutting back but hes still spending new business investment ipos mergers and other signs of risk taking also continue to take place even if you expect a recession relying on the fed as savior is a mistake monetary policy is only one economic policy lever and it has to be used with care the other better tool is fiscal policy specifically a tax cut on present washington course we are falling back into the s policy mix of easy money amid tax increases whenever the economy slowed in the s everyone clamored for the fed to ease the result was ever shorter recoveries amid steadily rising prices the better policy mix is the one implemented by ronald reagan and paul volcker that broke stagflation in the s the fed restored dollar credibility and avoided asset bubbles while tax cuts spurred incentives to work and invest even on keynesian grounds a tax cut now makes sense if youre worried that the housing recession will slow consumer spending an across the board tax cut on marginal personal and corporate income tax rates would also attract capital from around the world increase the demand for dollars and thus make the feds job easier we realize its heresy to suggest a tax cut in todays beltway but we were outliers in the s too sooner or later investors and wall street will both rediscover that easy money has its limitations the smart presidential candidate will be the one who starts talking about a tax cut before everyone else
