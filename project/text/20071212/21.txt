business bookshelf how detroit can speed along its learning curve until the s toyota was a word that meant virtually nothing to americans it was around then that this tiny automobile company from faraway japan began exporting its first cars into california called toyopets they were hustled by a few import centered sales operations as one among a hazy group of overseas brands taken together the early imports had little effect on the car business then dominated by general motors ford and chrysler along with a few second level detroit lines the first toyotas those toyopets were designed not for the wide open spaces of america but for the tiny constricted streets of tokyo and other japanese cities they were fuel efficient but otherwise not all that appealing to american consumers who were then driving giant six and eight cylinder machines running on cheap gasoline after a few years of selling modestly in california toyota began to expand its lineup and with the jump in s gasoline prices to cash in on all those miles per gallon in it added the excellent lexus brand to compete at the top with mercedes benz and audi how toyota became # by david magee portfolio pages &# in "how toyota became gbp " david magee tracks the rise of this once obscure japanese company giving special attention to its success in north america his subtitle suggests that he is offering "lessons from the worlds greatest car company " admirers of daimler benz honda and other car makers may feel that "worlds greatest" is going a bit too far but mr magee often citing jim press toyotas north american president plays a strong hand there is no question that toyota holds a place in the elite tier of the automobile industry judged by the design and engineering of its cars of course but also by its management style and its sense of consumer trends most notably of late it has led the way with its gas electric prius hybrid models to make this advance though toyota had to overcome a prejudice among american consumers who once regarded japanese products as inferior "tinny " as the old expression had it even during world war ii it was believed that japanese airplanes and weapons were somehow cheap and flimsy that is until u s aviators encountered the mitsubishi zero discovering that it was in every way a ferocious flying machine it did not take long for the american military to grasp that japan ridiculed as a nation of "rice burners" was a mighty industrial power this status claim was gradually enhanced after the war when japanese electronic products overtook those of american manufacturers offering both high tech and low price not long after japanese cars began rolling in america now drives everything from reliable relatively cheap hondas to superb and expensive infinitis and lexus automobiles when it comes to toyotas success mr magee credits the companys internal realities he acknowledges that toyotas competitive edge like that of other foreign companies owes something to its labor costs so much lower per car than those of american companies but he celebrates toyotas willingness to acknowledge production problems quickly to adapt its methods to varying markets thus defying a stereotype of management rigidity and to ask for feedback from its workers thereby "empowering" them and offering "hands on teaching in something of a democratic environment " when toyota began manufacturing in america mr magee notes it put its core precepts into play immediately "be practical and avoid frivolity" and "strive to create a warm and homelike atmosphere " the trick one supposes is combining both precepts without the one canceling out the other surely detroit hemorrhaging money and desperately overhauling its labor relations can learn something from toyotas success indeed it is easy to imagine that for sheer survival the corporate culture of car companies if not their cars will begin to resemble one another in the years ahead yet the industry is frozen in another way technologically it is still churning out internal combustion engines running on petroleum based gasoline and diesel fuels and rolling on four rubber tires the modern automobile no matter where it is manufactured remains very much like its ancestor a century ago despite better engines stronger alloys and better brakes and suspensions this is hardly a complaint but sooner or later perhaps sooner given various market and political pressures a paradigm shift will come perhaps electric or nuclear or hydrogen power will replace petroleum or some maverick company will develop an entirely new engine or drive train until then toyota and all the rest of the front line auto makers will play essentially the same game working only to increase efficiency within an aged engineering reality mr yates is the author of "the hot rod resurrection of a legend " among other books
