europe sees society in decline for many europeans life has never been better living standards measured by everything from life expectancy to personal wealth have climbed in most regions particularly in the formerly communist east still when europeans consider how their lives and societies are changing large numbers are strongly dissatisfied and pessimistic about the future in a survey conducted for the wall street journal by market research group gfk half of the european respondents said global society is getting worse including who said things are getting a lot worse the survey was conducted in september and october polling about people ages and older in european countries a further people in the u s russia india and turkey were asked the same questions for comparison with continued conflict in iraq the threat of terrorism looming economic uncertainty and widespread environmental degradation it isnt surprising that people are worried about the state of the world but the level of negative responses to the survey was striking "when i talk to my friends there is a huge sense of frustration with the way the world is evolving " said sarah polack years old a health researcher in london "the environment is changing and getting phenomenally worse in the middle east i cant tell where things are going or how they will be resolved its a depressing state were in " the survey asked people about their fears for society as a whole and about their anxieties on a personal level it also asked them how they cope with worries what they do to improve the world and what gives them hope large numbers said they found solace in friends and family religion and the worlds scientific achievements and expanding wealth they also said they tried to improve society by living as a good person and by cleaning up the environment the most surprising detail of the surveys statistics was the overall negative outlook "it is striking how negative the attitude is in europe but even more so in the u s " where said society was getting worse said mark hofmans a managing director in gfks brussels office who analyzed the survey results "i think people are very much influenced these days by the media more so than in the past years there is so much negative news and it influences peoples opinions " the survey did not point to a single source of dissatisfaction among europeans but showed a diverse set of worries terrorism ranked as the biggest fear for of those surveyed issues such as war and global warming and environmental degradation were also major concerns by comparison in the u s moral decay was the single largest worry cited as the paramount problem by of respondents in europe of those surveyed said moral decay was their main source of anxiety india with its booming economy was the most optimistic country in the survey with of respondents saying global society was getting better by contrast of europeans and of americans said society is improving turkey where global warming was the single largest worry for of respondents was among the most pessimistic countries of those polled said global society is getting better while said it is deteriorating the most negative overall was greece which was devastated by forest fires last summer where said life is getting worse while the u s has been embroiled in the iraq war and its economy has been shaken by a faltering mortgage market europe has skirted conflict and is enjoying solid economic growth so why are europeans worried about the state of global society for some the very prosperity that should encourage feelings of contentment and security is creating worries about a burgeoning gap between rich and poor "we have a poor and increasingly radical islamic population in france it is a big concern " said genevieve rihouay who runs a management training company in paris despite worrying about how their societies are changing europeans are less actively trying to improve things than are americans when asked what they do to help improve the world of europeans of french and of germans said they do nothing only of americans gave the same response on top of that it seems few europeans place much emphasis on maintaining social equality when asked how they personally try to help improve the world of the europeans surveyed said they do so by supporting socialism or the equal redistribution of wealth thats slightly more than in the u s but still shows that most europeans dont see a great moral purpose in paying hefty tax bills the largest percentage said they try to improve the world by "living as a moral and good person " american respondents also listed that as their primary contribution to the betterment of the world europeans seem to have more worries than americans about their personal lives when asked about their personal anxieties of europeans said their greatest fear is death or serious illness or injury in their family sixteen percent of americans gave the same response thirty seven percent of the americans surveyed said they dont have anxiety by contrast of europeans gave the same response the united kingdom however which has experienced an explosion in wealth over the past decade was the most carefree country in the survey of respondents said they dont have any anxiety for europeans and americans the potential of a financial crisis such as an investment disaster or the loss of a job was the second most common worry listed by of respondents as their biggest source of daily anxiety this concern was acute particularly in greece hungary and poland in these places now prospering under the umbrella of european union membership the memory of financial hardship and lower living standards is still fresh among those surveyed the french are least worried about having personal financial problems "greece until recently was a country with a long history of political and economic instability " said sofia tzortzi a consultant from athens "the younger generation might not be so worried but the older generation remembers not having enough to eat to them its very important to own property and to have money in the bank in case something bad happens " looking forward while half of the europeans polled said they think society is getting worse the largest percentage said their friends family and colleagues give them hope for the worlds future twenty six percent of americans gave the same response with a larger group saying their religious faith gives them hope eleven percent of the surveyed europeans gave that response
