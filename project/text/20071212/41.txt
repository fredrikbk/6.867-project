euro zone to test debt issuance london euro zone governments and other triple a rated agencies will be among the first issuers to test credit markets early in and the response will prove a key measure of how much demand there is for investment grade bond debt and at what price these governments supranational institutions such as the european investment bank and other government agencies tend to issue a large chunk of their debt in the first half of the year investors may look cautiously at fresh supply in january after what will likely be an anxious festive break but they will likely favor what they would regard as ultrasafe assets in which to invest cash after billions worth of government bond redemptions in early "how those first few government supranational institution and agency deals go will signal to other investment grade issuers from other sectors just how strong investor demand is and how safe it is for the lower rated credits to come to market with further supply " said edward mizuhara director of debt syndication at credit suisse in london "they are the first signal of the markets health " ciaran ohagan strategist at societe generale estimates that european governments alone could sell a gross billion euros &# billion of new bonds next year "that is around billion euros higher than our latest estimate for " he said in a november research note other analysts put this figure lower at around billion euros benign borrowing conditions over the past few years have meant that governments supranational institutions and agency issuers as well as corporate and financial borrowers have been able to raise funding relatively inexpensively but worries about financial instability following trouble with risky home loans in the u s spilled over into other markets causing investors across the board to reassess risk secondary market liquidity has also dried up as banks have grown increasingly reluctant to lend to each other against this more testing market backdrop a bruised investor community has tended to look more favorably on financing triple a rated governments supranational institutions and government agency borrowers as they look for a safe harbor to invest their cash "borrowers that have zero event risk are what people are looking for right now " said mr mizuhara of credit suisse "despite the volatility in credit markets deals that have come from strong public sector issuers have been really well subscribed and have achieved funding levels which are relatively similar to or in some cases even tighter than they got earlier in the year before the crisis started "investors who dont want a risk to their portfolio will buy shorter dated paper for highly rated names " mr mizuhara added "they are certainly not looking at high beta financials or issuers further along the maturity curve " however norwegian government owned agency eksportfinans was forced to postpone its short dated benchmark bond issue at the end of november the deal should have been straightforward for investors but a slew of bad headlines in particular the rise in short dated euro swap spreads conspired to prevent lead managers citigroup deutsche bank and goldman sachs from locking investors into the deal people familiar with the eksportfinans situation said a swap spread is the difference between the swap rate and yield of government bonds of equal maturity the swap rate is the rate of the fixed portion of a swap as determined by its particular market this is the rate at which the swap will occur for one of the parties entering into the agreement other market participants suggested that eksportfinans struggled because it announced recently that it had taken mark to market losses on structured bonds it held for "liquidity purposes " so far this year investors have absorbed &# billion in bonds from governments supranational institutions and government agencies in the euro zone figures from data provider dealogic showed on dec in the figure was &# billion meanwhile financial borrowers have found it increasingly tough to raise funds amid concerns about the exposure of banks to subprime mortgages with issuance so far in this years fourth quarter at &# billion against &# billion in the third quarter and &# billion in the second quarter according to dealogic the market absorbed &# billion of bonds from financial borrowers in the fourth quarter of allied irish bank and the u ks abbey national bank were forced to abandon plans to issue covered bonds last month covered bonds offer dual recourse both to the pool of assets and to the balance sheet of the bank itself making them extremely safe the lack of liquidity in the secondary markets has created a discrepancy between secondary trading levels and new issue premiums according to martin weber head of high grade syndicate and origination at goldman sachs in london "its not so much a question of whether the market is closed or not it is whether investors can make the appropriate relative value call " mr weber said "when the market is moving in multiples of usual secondary trading ranges investors find it difficult if not impossible to evaluate the new issue propositions relative value discussions are tricky in extremely volatile markets " that makes it more difficult to find the right pricing level for new bond deals this could become especially problematic if too many issuers rush to sell new bonds in the weeks ahead potentially creating oversupply and forcing other issuers to pay even higher rates to entice investors to raise the billions of euros of financing needed "the lack of liquidity in the market puts pressure on investment banks in terms of trying to find the right price which means some borrowers may find themselves having to pay one or two basis points more in new issue premium to get deals away " credit suisses mr mizuhara said "even if there is not much liquidity out there in the secondary market there are prices for the bonds in this sector governments supranational institutions and agency issuers which other borrowers benchmark their issuance against " he added "there are always levels whereas this isnt always the case with other sectors where you just cant get levels " goldmans mr weber agrees "the environment in is likely to be very different to what we have seen over the last two years or so because the issuers will be competing for attention of a potentially fairly defensive investor base " because euro zone governments have been cutting net bond issuance over the past couple of years thanks to the pickup in euro zone growth resulting in strong tax receipts government borrowers should be able to tap into pent up investor demand investors though are likely to be increasingly shrewd about the credits they will and wont buy even among triple a governments supranational institutions and government agencies meaning some borrowers from this sector could have difficulties raising funds as investors place closer scrutiny on agency issuers "there will be a greater differentiation between the aaa credits within the sovereign supranational and agency sector with government guaranteed and supranational issuers the main beneficiaries " said mark wheatcroft managing director co head of european fixed income syndicate at ubs in london
