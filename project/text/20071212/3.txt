affluent boomers heirs may end up disappointed the greatest transfer of wealth in history may end up leaving heirs disappointed and could mean big changes for financial advisers as "mass affluent" boomer millionaires or baby boomers worth around a few million dollars start to turn forecasts and patterns in their retirement planning suggest that many may leave little or no substantial wealth to their children the affluent boomer crowd typically has plans for a fully funded dream retirement that lasts two decades or more having bankrolled kids through years of education and early adulthood these boomers feel less than obligated to pass along to their children much of their hard earned wealth for those clients who do want to leave a sizable inheritance financial advisers may need to lay out for them the difficulty of both living an active and exciting retirement and also leaving wealth to their children "invariably their reach exceeds their grasp " says milo benningfield founding principal of benningfield financial advisors simply having enough money to make it through retirement can be a challenge joe montgomery a managing director of investments at wachovia securities a unit of wachovia corp recently had to tell a client that his assets didnt match his dreams of an imminent retirement as mr montgomery phrased it "i dont think this dog hunts " adding to advisers challenge converting clients children into a new generation clientele may be more about capturing relationships for when boomers children accumulate wealth of their own than capturing actual assets while most of these clients are still years from retiring by most definitions the first members of americas enormous postwar population boom are fast approaching "were just hitting the tip of the baby boomer" retirement iceberg says dave liebrock executive vice president of fidelity investments one recent study by harrison group and american express publishing a division of american express co sketches the profile of mass affluent boomers the study describes a group of about million americans with annual discretionary income between &# and &# that is income after taxes mortgage and standard bills and an average net worth of &# million while holding &# million in assets at retirement would seem to ensure very comfortable leisure years paying for that leisure could mean little wealth is left at the end in fact more than half of the studys respondents reported worrying about running out of money before death as a result say economists and financial advisers when rank and file millionaire boomers are pushed to decide between living a full retirement or scaling back postcareer spending to preserve capital for their children or grandchildren a fully funded lifestyle is typically the victor "theyre a lot more worried about maintaining their lifestyle than about leaving everybody else wealthy " says mr montgomery academics also see a decline in october jagadeesh gokhale then a senior economic adviser to the federal reserve bank of cleveland and laurence kotlikoff a professor of economics at boston university identified what they called a "declining bequest ethic " they found fewer than half of those interviewed for the federal reserves survey of consumer finance believed it was "important to leave an estate to heirs " the steepest decline in sentiment during the s almost percentage points came from americans age and older dr gokhale who now works at the cato institute says the numbers havent changed since the initial report michael hurd an economist at rand corp says an american bequest ethic has never translated into actual behavior across the population since retirees with children have never preserved more of their estate at death than those who dont have offspring instead he says premature death or a fear of poverty are the forces that preserve assets for children fidelity investments recently released a retirement income evaluator program to test just how far the money of an average mass affluent retiree will travel in retirement the tool available to financial advisers is a built out version of the calculator available online to fidelitys retail investors in simulating a mass affluent retirement plan fidelity used a hypothetical couple retiring today with &# million in liquid assets their spending in retirement includes standard mortgage health and long term care insurance costs &# in annual discretionary spending a new luxury car on trade in every five years and even a golf club membership and ample travel budget through age the example retiring couple doesnt have any pension income reflecting the trend that retirement accounts are steadily replacing defined benefit plans if market returns during the couples retirement reflect historical averages fidelity found they are likely to exhaust their assets at around age under the conditions of a poor market such as if they retired immediately before the market downturn of for example the couple could see their assets run out as soon as age add a bequest ethic to the mix say a goal of leaving a &# bequest to children at death and the likelihood that the couples assets will last them through retirement declines the use of variable annuities to guarantee certain levels of income increased probabilities of the plans success but eroded net worth faster in poor markets as logic suggests guaranteed income has a price the willingness of parents to financially back their childrens undergraduate and graduate schooling and even support their first forays into adulthood with apartments and cars say advisers has left many affluent boomers loath to curb their retirement spending in order to leave money to the kids "if weve done our jobs " mr benningfield says talking as a parent "weve invested in our kids early "
