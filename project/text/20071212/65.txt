led zeppelins rocking return london a led zeppelin reunion is as unlikely as a beatles reunion much as the beatles would be unthinkable without john lennon and george harrison alive and on hand the death of john bonham in left led zeppelin with a seemingly unbreachable void and yet here were zeppelins robert plant jimmy page and john paul jones on the stage at the arena monday night as the headliners in a london concert billed as a tribute to the late ahmet ertegun the courtly influential co founder and head of atlantic records on drums for the reconstituted zeppelin was jason bonham year old son of the bands original drummer he first played in concert with the surviving members during a brief set at atlantics th anniversary celebration in filling his fathers shoes is asking a lot of jason bonham not only was john bonham an inventive and powerful drummer but his interplay with mr pages guitar lines is as responsible for the bands singularity as its musical wanderlust and mr plants bluesy helium like vocals that often intense interaction gave zeppelins live shows the possibility of surpassing their recorded music jason bonhams and the bands battle plan monday was immediately apparent they played old led zeppelin tunes with incredible raw power allowing for invention within familiar structures and sometimes not so familiar ones the band rarely resisted an opportunity to push the songs bending arrangements with sheer force and volume they reworked several numbers subtly to accommodate and exploit mr bonhams gifts and played one tune "for your life" from the album "presence" that theyd never performed in concert before for a band that hasnt been on stage together in almost years and almost a decade more than that for a full performance led zeppelin was as tight as a rock group could be its members mixed their brand of rock and metal with an authority that suggested they still might be the best rock band in the world and then they played the blues the year old mr page who broke his left pinkie last month pushing the show back from its original nov date was relentless volume can carry rock numbers but in an instrumental trio theres no place for a soloist to hide in the down tempo blues the group laced together a series of blues numbers that were inspired according to mr plant by robert johnson and others but they bore the zeppelin stamp of tense pauses punctuated by mr pages piercing playing under a shock of hair thats now more white than gray mr pages face often bore a hapless expression but it was completely misleading the guitarist was in control of his music until he decided to push himself to the edge as he did in "nobodys fault but mine" and "since ive been loving you " when it didnt work to perfection it wasnt for lack of adventure zeppelin wasnt the only act on the ertegun tribute bill the rhythm kings ex rolling stones bassist bill wymans band served as the backing group for several singers including year old paolo nutini the last artist at atlantic mentored by mr ertegun the talented mr nutini sang "mess around " a hit that mr ertegun wrote for ray charles and "bang bang my baby shot me down " a curious choice mr erteguns memory might have been better served by a couple of tunes from mr nutinis excellent debut disc "these streets " paul rodgers formerly of free and of bad company showed that his voice hasnt lost its gritty edge and foreigner played one tune "i want to know what love is " "if it wasnt for ahmet none of us would be here " said foreigners mick jones but that was preamble and the moment zeppelin opened with "good times bad times " the first song on their eponymous debut album all else was forgotten fighting a muddy sound system the quartet blasted through "ramble on " "black dog" and "in my time of dying" in each song mr bonham abandoned his fathers familiar riffs and played something of his own mr page responded with beefier playing that mr jones echoed on bass early in the show mr plants voice couldnt pierce the rumble and for most of the set he remained in mid range when mr plant at last unleashed a howl in a remarkable reading of "kashmir " mr page broke into a broad grin in large part though the singer adapted well his voice now has a burnished timbre that suits the bottom heavy muscularity of the group mr plant spoke to the audience of a rock bands obligatory songs on this night one was "dazed and confused " a potent blues that mr page marred as he did in the bands heyday by playing his les paul with a bow another such number was "stairway to heaven " which came late in the set mr plant wasnt up to the required vocal soaring and his ragged version was the evenings low point "hey ahmet " mr plant shouted to the rafters "we did it " barely the band also chose to ignore its folky side no "thats the way" or "going to california" and it would have been a pleasure to hear mr plant bring some of the techniques hes added to his vocal arsenal over the years to these tunes but led zeppelins two plus hour performance was so authoritative and so dynamic that it may have been a wise choice to leave the folk instruments in their cases and allow a highly charged audience to continue to roar there were some quaint backward looking touches on the stage the flaming hindenburg logo on mr bonhams kick drum the stylized letters "zoso " which some fans consider the real name of the album "led zeppelin iv " on mr pages amplifier but the band didnt act like old timers back together for a one off showcase they attacked their songs like they had something to prove and were better than even the most ardent zeppelin fan could have expected while they didnt directly address whether theyll play more shows next year mr plant already has some commitments for that might affect that decision the music with mr bonham in firm control behind the drum kit suggested led zeppelin has much more to say mr fusilli is the journals rock and pop music
