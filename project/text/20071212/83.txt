our alzheimers patients deserve better your front page article "prescription abuse seen in u s nursing homes" dec brought back sad memories of my mothers struggle with alzheimers disease like the patients in the article my mother exhibited some difficult behaviors because of her misunderstanding of caregivers intentions and her inability to communicate because she reverted to speaking the language of her childhood her most serious behavior problems however resulted from the antipsychotic medications that her doctors prescribed to treat her behavior when my mother was difficult to handle for example she pushed away the male staff member who wanted to undress her for bathing the nursing home administrator said that they wouldnt keep her unless she were medicated when the nursing home doctor administered medication her behavior would become more aggressive on five occasions she ended up in hospitals where psychiatrists prescribed the antipsychotic medications mentioned in the article and more over a period of less than three years when my mothers behavior worsened after starting a new medication i would plead to take her off the medication the doctor sometimes a different one each day would counter however that her worsening behavior was due to alzheimers disease and not the medication my mother suffered significantly more from these medical "treatments" than from the disease itself my recommendation to others is to find a private doctor who doesnt believe in prescribing medications for difficult behaviors dont use doctors associated with nursing homes because they are more likely to prescribe medication when the nursing home staff requests it also find a home that is designed for patients with alzheimers disease while theyre quite expensive and typically dont accept medicaid in my experience the staff is trained to deal more humanely with difficult behaviors george shoning longmont colo one year ago my dad died due to a combination of inappropriate antipsychotic drugs not only did the various authorities ignore a previous reaction he had to this family of drugs they also ignored the axiom "first do no harm" and the fact that the food and drug administration issued a warning on these drugs for people with dementia the problem however extends beyond the use of antipsychotic drugs by doctors and nursing homes it extends to the important legal responsibilities of the health care proxy and power of attorney in my dads situation the person who had these powers didnt have his best interests at heart and the family was left with no "vote " once he had an aberrant and predictable reaction to the antipsychotic drugs there was no effort to save his life rather than moving him to a facility to address the reaction he was provided "compassionate" death this equated to starvation and dehydration during this period he had periods of lucidity and was confused and scared he died days after receiving the drugs the person empowered with legal responsibilities for his care and the entities that had both the power and authority to override these decisions opted for "kevorkian" medicine although his death certificate says he died of pneumonia he died of indifference the millions of americans with alzheimers deserve better tom kennedy chino valley ariz your story didnt tell much about the horrendous and dangerous behavior exhibited by those alzheimers residents who are aggressive and combative if they are denied the use of antipsychotic drugs nursing homes will simply play their contracted trump card call the family and tell them to come get him at that time the nursing homes will find broad and strong support for whatever they administer to sedate richard bell houston your article validated my battle to get my late stage alzheimers mother off risperdal remember the only person who is going to advocate for your loved one is your family no matter what you might wish to be true ann williams brecksville ohio
