doha pursues the olympics when doha launched its bid for the summer olympics on oct with a sound and light show on the corniche overlooking the persian gulf the world responded with a mighty o h h h tokyo chicago madrid prague rio de janeiro and the mouse that roared but to those of us who chanced to be in doha qatar in december for the th asian games the second largest sporting event after the olympics attended by athletes and team officials from countries representing more than half of mankind the bid came as no surprise when i met with the energetic year old secretary general of the qatar olympic committee his excellency sheik saoud bin abdulrahman al thani a distant cousin of the royal family and a new mexico state graduate in engineering he walked me through the rationale for hosting the asian games to put qatar with the worlds third largest natural gas reserves but with low international profile "on the map" to increase tourism by establishing an annual circuit of international sporting events in qatar and to instill discipline in qatars young people by providing facilities to enable them to participate in sports an olympics in qatar was a key ingredient in that vision he added preparations had been in the works since qatar the sheik told me had put up &# billion to build a state of the art sports facility and to import some foreigners to run the doha asian games what he didnt say but numerous expatriates did is that the reason so many foreigners were needed is that qataris for whom the good life has come easily are not used to hard work in any case there werent enough of them with the skills to do the job to the standard event olympic menu the doha asian games added events including kabaddi a centuries old indian village tag game played barefoot which is also popular in pakistan and bangladesh you could learn as much about qatar and its olympic pretensions from the gold medal match between india and pakistan as you could about kabaddi itself although some people live in qatar a peninsula state about the size of new jersey jutting into the persian gulf from saudi arabia only are its citizens the balance are indians the majority numbering more than pakistanis filipinos iranians bangladeshis and a host of other groups who come to qatar in search of work and sometimes end up staying the rest of their lives as at most events very few qataris were seen at the kabaddi hall whose seats were filled mainly by the immigrants who do the work that keeps qatar running the doha games were executed almost flawlessly chinese gold medal weightlifter li hongli was among the many athletes i spoke to who felt that the accommodations the food and the competition facilities reached the highest standards the complex transportation system to the venues the media services and the computerized information system all functioned seamlessly and in the most memorable moment of the superb opening ceremony which lavishly traced the history of qatar from antiquity until today the captain of the qatar equestrian team mohamed bin hamad al thani the son of the emir galloped up a specially constructed ramp to the top of khalifa stadium to light the asian games eternal flame the closing ceremony following the theme of "a thousand and one nights " raised the bar for future olympic closing ceremonies perfection but a catering company from england fed the athletes and media villages a dutch company ran the lnfo system and asian games news service foreigners handled the accreditation did the announcing at the competitions and managed and operated the transportation system foreigners ran the athletes and media villages as well as the scoreboards the media centers and the tv camerawork foreign janitors did the cleanup and the volunteers who complemented the paid staff were drawn overwhelmingly from qatars immigrant communities seven hundred australians put together the opening ceremony program even the horse at the opening ceremony was trained in australia only in the security detail was there any identifiable qatari presence a simple "keif halaq" "how are you " addressed in arabic to a doha asian games worker almost always brought a blank response the opening and closing ceremonies aside there was little of the flavor of arabia at the doha games qatar simply gave the go ahead and wrote the checks to escalate from an olympic applicant city to a candidate city doha must answer by jan questions posed by the ioc dealing with motivation and legacy political support finances venues accommodations transportation and security the ioc executive board will use this application to determine next june if doha is qualified to be one of the finalists if chosen doha will prepare an elaborate "bid book " the host city will be announced in october with the support of the royal family doha will have no difficulty satisfying the economic requirements a price tag of &# billion beijings round figure investment was within budget sheikh saoud said where doha will fall far short of the current host beijing is in popular participation in what the ioc calls "sustainability " and in the legacy an olympic games in doha will leave behind beijing has made a maximum effort to use local resources and in the process is learning the ways of the world its tourist services its translators its caterers its computer technicians its tv cameramen will all be better for the experience doha on the other hand would bring in almost everything from outside the country its thousands of mostly expat volunteers could never match beijings at the end of a doha olympic games most of the imported skills will leave with the contractors already the writing is on the wall when you click on the media centre tab at www doha org up pop two contacts from the international image maker burson marsteller in beijing at the same stage in the application process the public face was chinese but the big unanswerable questionabout dohas bid is "what after " for the asian games qatar had hotel rooms to accommodate visitors beijing will offer more than hotel rooms after the beijing games china will still have the great wall the forbidden city and the temple of heaven to attract tourists to those rooms qatar only sea sun and sand on balance hosting the olympics would be a tremendous boon for qatar well satisfying doha s bid slogan "celebrating change " at the extreme it might force qatar to deliberate whether a country whose citizens are a minority can be viable in time this might force liberalization of qatars naturalization laws and by example influence other persian gulf ministates in analyzing dohas bid the international olympic committee needs to answer two essential questions is nation building on the agenda of the ioc are the olympic games up for sale if the answer to these is "yes " doha would put on a whale of a show mr kolatch is the author of the just published "at the corner of fact &amp fancy" jonathan
