me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q i am interested in purchasing one of the following suvs lexus gx bmw x mercedes benz gl or gl cdi i would appreciate your advice t m thomas richboro pa a after driving all four of those models i would choose the gl cdi because of how well its diesel engine fits the vehicle while it has just six cylinders and seems at first glance better suited to a midsize car the engine in the gl is deceptively powerful at low speeds it gets the heavy suv moving easily in the stop and go traffic that regrettably is where many of us spend a lot of our travel time the truck i drove also logged fuel economy of around miles per gallon without any special effort the gl an eight cylinder gasoline powered version of the same vehicle is too fuel thirsty and doesnt drive as smoothly as the diesel the bmw x rode and handled better than most suvs but its electronic gadgetry drove me to such distraction that i wasnt able to enjoy the drive i find the lexus gx clunky and primitive compared with others in this group q your article on nov mentioned the modern versions of winter tires where can i get them who manufactures them james archibald schenectady n y a it isnt too late to get winter tires which can make a difference in how your vehicle handles on snow and ice brands to look for include bridgestone blizzak michelin pilot alpin michelin x ice goodyear eagle ultragrip dunlop winter sport and continental winter contact some models are more performance oriented emphasizing handling in cold dry weather while others sacrifice dry weather handling somewhat for better grip on ice and snow either type is better suited to winter driving than the high performance "summer" and "all season" tires with which most cars are shod at the factory they should be available through your local tire shop some retailers like tire rack even sell packages in which the tires are mounted on a spare set of wheels that make seasonal switching easier q i am in the market for a large luxury sedan ive always purchased maintained and driven my cars for a minimum of years and have a great mechanic i am considering a new cadillac dts performance model a used audi al or or a used mercedes s awd or s awd or which would you suggest michael d trovini scarsdale n y a id much rather drive a two or three year old audi a or mercedes s class either can be bought for less than the &# price of a new dts performance version and i dont think two years of wear will hurt the longevity of either you might also consider the bmw li or lexus ls
