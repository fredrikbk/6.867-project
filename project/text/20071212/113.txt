the biggest budget buster the nations economic outlook may look troubling in the short run but these difficulties pale beside the economic consequences that will follow if we dont address the nations long term fiscal gap or the prospective mismatch between projected spending and revenues the fiscal gap does not arise as many believe primarily from the coming retirement of the baby boomers rather the rate at which health care costs grow will be the primary determinant of the nations long term budget picture a congressional hearing tomorrow will focus on new long term budget projections from the congressional budget office cbo projects that under current law federal spending on medicare and medicaid measured as a percentage of gross domestic product will rise to in and almost around from today the bulk of that projected increase arises from steadily growing health care costs per beneficiary the aging of the population although a less important factor will exacerbate the fiscal pressures created by rising health care costs for example largely reflecting demographic changes spending on social security in years will increase to from about of gdp today and then roughly stabilize thereafter such increases in spending associated with both aging and increased health care costs unless matched by significant reductions in other spending or increases in revenues would ultimately create outsized budget deficits that would raise government debt to unprecedented levels even if substantial future budget deficits could be financed by issuing additional debt they would seriously harm the economy by reducing national saving and national income averting such economic damage will ultimately require some combination of less spending and more revenues than what is now projected the bottom line is that while we need to address the effects of the coming retirement of the baby boomers and the projected imbalance in social security we have to pay even more attention to the health care costs that exert the dominant influence on our fiscal future policy makers will face both challenges and opportunities in trying to reduce these costs over long periods the cost growth per beneficiary in the medicare and medicaid programs has tracked cost trends in private sector health care markets as a result many analysts believe that significantly constraining the growth of costs for the public programs while maintaining broad access to hospitals and doctors under them will be possible only in conjunction with slowing cost growth in the health sector as a whole the interactions between medicare and medicaid and the rest of the health system can complicate long term efforts to reduce costs but its too soon to conclude that the fiscal picture is hopelessly dismal there remains the promising possibility of restraining health care costs without incurring adverse health consequences it may even be possible in some cases to reduce cost growth and improve health at the same time costs per beneficiary in medicare for example vary substantially across the u s for reasons that cannot be explained fully by the characteristics of the patients or price levels in different areas high spending regions do not generate better health outcomes on average than the lower spending ones when health care at some of the nations leading medical facilities costs half as much as care at other top rated facilities for the same types of patients something must be wrong with the system some academic research suggests that national costs for health care can be reduced by perhaps without harming quality understanding the reasons for such differences and finding effective ways to reduce them while ensuring high quality care will not be easy potentially promising approaches include generating more information about the relative effectiveness of medical treatments and enhancing the incentives for providers to supply and consumers to demand better care rather than just more care moving the nation toward a more efficient health system inevitably will be a process in which policy steps are tried evaluated and maybe reconsidered beginning that arduous process now is essential to securing the nations long term economic future mr orszag is the director of the congressional budget office
