tough bench u s indian tribal judges grapple with legal limits mr flies aways court offers second chances admonishing valentino peach springs ariz judge joseph thomas flies away a graduate of stanford and harvard is a national expert on indian tribal law but here in the hualapai tribes court a small windowless room fashioned out of a converted kitchen he seems more like a social worker "valentino you were just here now youre here again " asked the judge during a recent session mr flies away had known valentino washington and his family for years now the year old was facing jail after assaulting his mother and sister in a drunken rage as well as for not paying a previous fine unlike courts elsewhere in the u s the tribal reservation system doesnt guarantee all native americans the right to defense counsel so mr washington sat alone a situation that softened the judges usual businesslike demeanor after reprimanding the teen for his behavior judge flies away ordered him to perform community service mr washington was puzzled as to what that meant "you go and clean somebodys yard you wash cars you go work with the elderly " the judge explained mr washington will remain in jail until the fine has been paid in labor "valentino you might be in there a while " said the judge his low voice tinged with both sadness and resignation in this separate justice system crippled by arcane laws and decades of federal neglect mr flies away a year old hualapai indian is trying to make a difference he frequently ministers to defendants from the bench taking on the dual role of judge and adviser he has pushed for harsher penalties for repeat offenders and has clashed with federal authorities when they impinge on tribal business he helped create the corporation that runs the tribes various businesses sat on its council and has twice been tapped as chief judge mr flies away walks with his shoulders drawn forward and doesnt smile much he cant think of many success stories in this world where his fellow tribe members are plagued by alcoholism methamphetamine abuse and domestic violence but the idea of leaving the reservation and returning to the elite precincts where he was educated runs counter to his sense of duty "these are my people my relatives " mr flies away says "so despite the hardships and problems there is also family joy and possibility i have to keep thinking that or i might go off the deep end " the hundreds of judges who serve the nations tribal court systems bring strengths and weaknesses and a world of diversity to the bench they range from tribal council members without college educations to white law professors with impeccable resumes no matter their credentials the obstacles they face are formidable some tribes are too poor to hire public defenders simple matters such as who has the power to make arrests are not always easily solved and tribal courts which also rely on their own prosecutors have limited powers to mete out sentences lacking counsel some defendants enter guilty pleas almost by default victims can suffer as well since federal prosecutors take only a minority of cases another flaw of the system if a crime is committed by a non indian the tribes are virtually powerless as their limited jurisdiction generally doesnt allow them to prosecute outsiders by contrast if a tribe member commits a crime off the reservation some states can use past tribal convictions to augment a new sentence a number of piecemeal efforts have sought to unravel such complexities u s attorneys in several states including oklahoma michigan and north carolina have assigned federal prosecutors to focus on tribal crime in a bid to ensure that cases dont fall through the cracks nationally the federal bar association is pushing congress to relax sentence restrictions imposed by the indian civil rights act and to give tribal courts broader jurisdiction south dakota republican sen john thune has introduced a bill to give federal prosecutors funding specifically for pursuing crimes in indian lands "youre not apprehending people and if you catch them theyre not being prosecuted or if they are being prosecuted they arent spending any amount of time in jail " sen thune says "there is a federal role and responsibility " until these potential fixes are in place much of the procedural burden falls to judges like mr flies away the hualapai reservation sits on about one million acres along the grand canyon the tribe also known as the "people of the tall pines " is best known for tourism one attraction a new transparent skywalk suspended feet above the canyon yet tribe members are poor about half the adults in the member tribe are unemployed a third of all members live below the poverty line supported by family members and a patchwork of tribal and federal programs peach springs the tribes capital with a population of is split by the famed route much of the traffic is gone now taken by interstate highways it doesnt even have a gas station theres little in the way of activity aside from the milelong burlington northern santa fe freight trains which rumble through town every minutes forcing the lone hotel the hualapai lodge to give earplugs to patrons mr flies away was raised on the reservation where the impact of drugs and alcohol has taken a toll on his own family four of his mothers siblings drank themselves to death or committed suicide he says one uncle hanged himself in jail intense and studious for much of his life mr flies away earned a scholarship to study at stanford university after graduating in he returned here to teach seventh grade eventually he became involved in tribal government first as a planner who developed proposals for economic growth and revitalization of the tribe he left again for law school but quit his studies after a year when tribal elders asked him to become chief judge after one term on the bench he headed off to cambridge mass to study at harvards kennedy school of government from there he went to arizona state university where he received his law degree he could have joined a private firm and earned "more money " as he still recalls instead a sense of obligation led him back to the reservation in when he became the first chief judge of the tribal court with a law degree mr flies away is now in the middle of a two year term his court calendar is a full one aggravated assaults are some of the major crimes baseball bats and knives are the weapons of choice although it has only members the tribe handles about criminal cases annually the judge says the high number stems mostly from recidivists federal law permits him to hand down a maximum sentence of one year per charge even for the most heinous of crimes such as rape jail overcrowding leaves free some of the criminals hed like to lock up the result those people often commit new crimes mr flies away typically arrives at the court about a m and puts in an hour day the judge who is divorced and has no children spends much of his time building his administration or helping other tribes develop their systems his office is small and crowded with papers and books such as "federal rules of evidence " not shy to controversy the judge has challenged some of the tribes cherished legal prerogatives such as their protection against civil suits indian nations by law are effectively sovereign governments as such they can assert immunity against lawsuits that quirk has created tensions with non indians as some tribes build vast commercial enterprises including casinos the judge in his rulings has opposed such a blanket immunity on a recent typical day judge flies away headed to court for the afternoon session everyone stood as he entered the courtroom the judge wore a black ribbon shirt traditional american indian garb instead of the black robe that some other judges prefer "if i wear that robe i might as well put on a white wig too " he says although the docket was filled only with arraignments short procedures where defendants enter pleas mr flies away stayed for hours in judge flies aways courtroom some defendants actually prefer to take their chances solo relying on the judges sideline counsel appearing first before the judge was kermit marshall the year old was accused of attacking his parents lunging through the window of a car to punch his father and choke his mother he already had three past assault convictions the latest infraction then exposed him to the tribes maximum penalty one year per charge that also happens to be the maximum penalty congress says a tribal court judge can hand down to lengthen potential jail time some tribes file multiple charges for each crime committed as mr flies away began mr marshall quickly pleaded guilty to the battery and domestic violence charges against him the judge slowed the proceedings as he explained the ramifications of a guilty plea several times "you have the right to be represented by the office of the public defender you have the right to call witnesses and you have the right to question the witnesses against you " he said "you understand this i really want you to understand you have to know what youre doing " mr marshall stood by the guilty plea he has since been sentenced to one year in jail and ordered to undergo domestic violence counseling the local jail which sits just about yards from the courtroom is not under tribal control it is run by the bureau of indian affairs the federal agency that oversees certain tribal issues such as schools even though the facility houses criminals mr flies away has sentenced it is not bound by his or any tribal judges rulings or detention orders in some cases bia officials can essentially override the judges orders by releasing inmates early often for lack of space "its tough to have a good justice system without good detention " says mr flies away joel querta who worked for the tribes natural resources department also pleaded guilty to a charge drunken driving without speaking to a defense advocate it was his second conviction on the charge mr flies away sentenced mr querta to days in jail but given that years had passed since mr quertas last brush with the law he took the liberty of suspending the jail sentence in the end he fined mr querta &# he asked mr querta if that was agreeable the defendant said he didnt know for several minutes the judge tried to explain that mr querta wasnt going to jail another defendant meanwhile leaned over and whispered to mr querta that he was getting a good deal finally the older man looked at the bench and said "im quite satisfied" with the sentence the next defendant todd watahomigie was well known to the judge a situation common on tightknit tribal reservations he was in court as a fugitive accused of slashing his mothers face with a knife in march when he failed to appear for a hearing later that year authorities put out a warrant for his arrest but had been unable to locate him because he had no valid address "you are a hard man to find " the judge said the defendant told the judge he needed to be released "im trying to get a job i need to work because i have a medical bill to pay " he said the judge was skeptical compounding mr watahomigies problems mr flies away was well versed in the social services available on the reservation having been instrumental in obtaining them he peppered his charge with questions "what have you been doing for the last year why havent you been working and why do you have a medical bill why are you paying for treatment you can go over to indian health services and they will handle it and pay for it " the young man gave up making excuses when the judge suggested having the court check out his claims mr flies away set bail at &# a figure that he knew was too high for mr watahomigie to pay after being locked up for weeks he was recently released under home detention by another judge the most difficult case of the afternoon was valentino washingtons the judge has known the teen since he was a small boy when mr flies away placed him in protective custody after his alcohol abusing mother neglected him he landed here on a bench warrant for failing to pay a &# fine he incurred for underage drinking in the interim between the imposition of the fine and this court hearing he picked up charges for disorderly conduct domestic violence and battery years earlier mr washington had received a settlement of several thousand dollars after being hit in a car accident yet he said he couldnt satisfy the &# fine because his mother controls his money and she refused to pay it "you trust her with your money " the judge asked "no " replied mr washington "thats telling " retorted mr flies away to make up for the overdue payment the judge imposed community service mr washington had watched others enter pleas during the day and listened to the judge explain the proceedings he pleaded no contest to the new assault charges against him acknowledging that they were true according to court documents mr washington was drunk at a family members home when he threw a television to the floor and began yanking it apart as his sister tried to stop him he attacked her then his mother judge flies away repeated what he had told other defendants about the right to hear witnesses be represented by defense advocates and call witnesses on his behalf before setting sentencing weeks later mr washington was in detention awaiting transfer to a rehabilitation program after the defendants left mr flies away sat quietly on the bench "ive dealt with him a long time i had him as a child as a juvenile and now as a young adult its sad " he said of mr washington "todd and valentino they werent raised by anyone i wish i had the facilities to send them to where they could think about their problems and get to the root of those problems im afraid how this will end for them " back in his office the judge struggled to remember a case with a positive outcome he decided on catherine querta he had known ms querta an alcoholic since the tribe operated a wellness court which was designed to divert defendants into treatment and away from jail although it disbanded after federal grant money dried up ms querta continued to receive some counseling she found a job with the tribe and was a hard worker "she tried " the judge recalls in october ms querta was heading back to peach springs on foot along route when a car struck her she was killed tribal authorities say she was intoxicated at the time "people think that as a judge i love this job but id rather not deal with any of it " says mr flies away "there is much sadness " he feels compelled to stay he says in order to help empower his fellow tribe members "one time my grandma said to me you take care of them so i have done so "
