islamist radicals could best be fought by a civilian led government that also has the militarys backing these parties want gen musharraf to step down as army chief and allow elections and unfettered democracy gen musharraf galvanized the opposition last month with his dismissal of the countrys top judge for what the government called "misconduct " critics claim chief justice iftikhar muhammad chaudhry was removed because gen musharraf was unhappy with his rulings the dismissal sparked a series of violent growing protests against gen musharraf and his military backed government critics fear gen musharraf will use the unrest to postpone legislative elections due in october when his five year term expires president musharraf has announced his intention to seek another term but hasnt indicated he plans to resign his post as army chief of staff as required by pakistans constitution the political instability is increasingly worrying officials in the bush administration who generally view u s policy as wholly tied to gen musharraf the growing protests against his rule have raised debates within washington policy circles about who might succeed him but u s officials say they see few real alternatives particularly as opposition leaders such as former premier benazir bhutto have poor track records as rulers "theres no real plan b " said a u s official working in south asia even if polls are held this year mr musharraf is likely to hold on to the presidency pakistans president isnt directly elected but chosen by an electoral college comprised of the legislature and the provincial assemblies political analysts in pakistan say public anger with gen musharraf could turn against his major source of authority the military "the general has started the war within for only one reason to perpetuate his rule " asserts tariq hassan a harvard educated attorney and former world bank executive "he has not only denigrated the highest judicial institution in the country but has also caused grievous harm to his own constituency the army " meanwhile dozens of bearded students of a local religious school have been roaming the capital in recent days wielding sticks and demanding that video shops close for selling products in violation of islamic law hundreds of female muslim students of another radical school shrouded head to toe in black burqas have raided houses in residential neighborhoods in islamabad they claim are being used as brothels zealots are a common sight at traffic lights around the capital where they warn women to stop driving another supposed sin against islam the campaign in islamabad is led by two radical clerics maulana abdul rashid ghazi and his brother maulana abdul aziz the brothers have set up their unauthorized islamic court at lal masjid or red mosque where they are prayer leaders and head the adjacent womens religious school both openly support osama bin laden and urge holy war against the west as part of their campaign lal masjid clerics saturday issued a fatwa or religious decree calling for the sacking and trial of tourism minister nilofer bakhtiar who was photographed hugging her paraglider pilot after completing a jump in france the clerics deemed such displays of affection between the sexes un islamic and ms bakhtiar has gotten death threats the lal masjid clerics arent affiliated with a political party though their actions mirror the rise of the taliban whose law and order campaign was a path to power in afghanistan the islamist vigilantism in islamabad follows incidents in which religious radicals have attacked video shops and burned tv sets in northern border areas with afghanistan a sanctuary for taliban insurgents in these areas barbers have been warned since early this year not to shave beards and people are prohibited from playing music even at weddings women are barred from coming out of their homes alone gen musharrafs government has done little to stem the influence of islamic extremists many pakistani political analysts say the extremism presents a serious threat to pakistans political stability and regional security critics accuse the president of allowing radical clerics in islamabad to act with impunity to avoid confronting the possibility of more opposition from conservative muslims or provoking terrorist reprisals from militants "no one believes that the government is helpless or incapacitated against the religious extremists " says najam sethi editor of the independent pakistani newspaper the daily times "gen musharraf seems to be digging in for the status quo which is actually a recipe for islamic insurrection" in the long run jay solomon in washington contributed to this article
