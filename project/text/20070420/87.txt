the daily fix messi channels maradona on way to amazing goal online edition in a year and two days after argentinas diego maradona scored what would later be voted as the best goal in world cup history lionel messi was born the barcelona striker and fellow argentine has been named by maradona as his successor and on wednesday two months shy of his th birthday mr messi paid homage his goal for barcelona in the semifinals of the spanish cup against getafe was an astonishing bit of mimicry hewing closely to the lofty standard set by maradona as he scored the quarterfinals clincher en route to a world cup triumph "the two players both left footed short stocky and deceptively quick traced virtually the same course across two of the worlds most emblematic football fields maradona at mexico citys aztec stadium messi at barcelonas nou camp " sid lowe writes in the daily telegraph after pausing to note that yes the spanish cup is a far cry from the world cup mr lowe adds "both men ran for just over seconds maradona covering metres messi both touched the ball times and beat six rivals dashing past five of them and shooting home past the sixth " the times of london remarks "twenty one years on the similarity of the scintillating slalom the replica brilliance and balance was remarkable " today maradona is fighting the effects of his longtime drinking habit "messi dedicated the strike to argentinas finest footballer who is in intensive care as he battles against alcoholism " mr lowe writes "his team mates meanwhile ran to him with incredulity on their faces " no wonder all four of spains major sports daily newspapers too bad the u s no longer has one of these headlined the feat "messi scores maradonas goal " an enterprising soul stitched clips of the two goals into one comparative video on daily motion warning you may find yourself watching this over and over again the daily telegraph asks fans to comment on which goal was better not surprisingly several commenters on the british newspapers online forum say neither can top a memorable goal by ryan giggs for manchester united alex rodriguez hit his th home run in the new york yankees th game capping a rally from four runs down with two outs and no one on base in the bottom of the ninth inning with a clinching three run shot against the cleveland indians at this rate the year old third baseman will hit his th home run of the season and th of his career on may the yankees bizarre start has featured three wins on clinching final inning home runs two by a rod five other wins in routs by a combined margin of runs and six losses by just runs all those games save the five blowout wins have offered opportunities for clutch performance and a rod has delivered making possible a comparison that would have seemed laughable as he flailed away last october yes ahead of the yankees series against the boston red sox this weekend columnists are calling their favorite target new yorks david ortiz "rodriguez now is not just the most talented player but also the timeliest " joel sherman writes in the new york post "talent and timely that is tnt which is fitting for how explosive rodriguez has been this april move over big papi meet el hombre " the boston globes bob ryan cant get himself excited for the seasons first boston new york clash "what we have with the red sox and yankees now is manufactured fan nonsense " mr ryan writes "hate to tell you but no one in uniform hates anyone in the current yankees red sox state of affairs the players cant believe what they hear and what goes on in the stands or on the streets they cannot relate to any of it " on tuesday night philadelphia phillies manager charlie manuel lost his cool at a postgame press conference as chronicled in the fix on wednesday after some awkward questions and non answers about the previous night mr manuel told the press he was moving his no starter brett myers to the bullpen "there was five seconds of silence " writes dan steinberg of the washington posts d c sports bog "literally i timed it later then laughter much laughter the beat writers attempted to convince manuel that he was joking they stared at each other literally jaws were dropped one writer offered to bet manuel &# that he was kidding finally they realized he was serious and they launched into the pitching staff inquisition " philadelphia daily news columnist bill conlin interrupted his annual april vacation to weigh in with imaginings of what might have been if former phillies managers had tried this trick with their no starters such as say terry francona with curt schilling then mr conlin gets serious "this move was thrust on myers in a blinding flash of panic he is a pitching work in progress and we can only hope this knee jerk spasm by a doomed manager is not career altering " the philadelphia inquirers phil sheridan urges his media colleagues to evaluate mr manual on his baseball moves and his teams results rather than their perceptions of him "if manuel is fired it should be for the right reasons not the reasons harped on so often in the public dialogue about him " mr sheridan writes "heres a theory about a lot of the misplaced criticism many people have no idea what a good baseball manager really is " meanwhile the phillies are a woeful after their defeat of the washington nationals yesterday the nats are one game better which is happy news for the washington posts thomas boswell it suggests the team is at least one level above "breathtakingly awful " theres no guarantee that the nba playoffs which begin saturday can match last years postseason for excitement but they will seem familiar in at least one respect three of the first round matchups are rematches from last year no one gives the washington wizards minus the injured gilbert arenas much of a chance against the cleveland cavaliers and this years los angeles lakers are worse than the edition last year that took the phoenix suns to seven games "dont expect much from lakers in rematch" is the subheadline on steve dilbecks column in the los angeles daily news chicago bulls miami heat round ii promises more intrigue last year the bulls put a scare into miami and threatened to win their first playoff series since michael jordan wore red and black before the heat persevered and went on to win the title this season began with the bulls embarrassing the heat on their home floor then winning two close games and getting blown out by miami last month chicago stumbled into this series by losing its final game when a win would have set them up to play the undermanned wizards instead "the bulls and heat would have to be nuts to seriously prefer the other as a first round opponent " greg cote writes in the miami herald the ottawa senators and anaheim ducks joined the new york rangers in the nhl quarterfinals last night with victories to clinch series victories the senators had a surprisingly easy time dispatching sidney crosby and the pittsburgh penguins while anaheim struggled more against the minnesota wild than the final margin suggests "the wild brought shoulders sticks and a lot of heart into this first round series and with a couple of bounces might have extended this thing into st paul on saturday " mark whicker writes in the orange county register "the ducks were just a bit better in most areas and thats why theyre proceeding to the second round but first a little yoga and deep massage " so that the fix touches them all the four major u s sports plus soccer heres news a week ahead of the nfl draft that should give pause to the oakland raiders and other teams with early picks last years first pick the houston texans mario williams has a taste for speed mph behind the wheel while hes being videotaped from the passengers seat "williams can be heard laughing throughout " richard justice writes in the houston chronicle "hes young and playful and having the time of his life slow down mario " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion in the daily fix
