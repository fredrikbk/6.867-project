weekend journal taste review &amp outlook caught in the legal crossfire within hours of the virginia tech massacre pundits were speculating on lawsuits and understandably so we will leave to security experts the question of whether virginia tech should be held accountable for not informing students between shooting sprees that an armed gunman was possibly loose on campus the bigger question now concerns cho seung huis history of mental health problems what legal burden did they impose on virginia techs administrators and no less important what could school officials have done about this troubled student without colliding with student "rights" and other legal barriers to school authority cho had been sent by a judge to a mental health facility in having stalked two women on campus an english professor was so shocked by his classroom manner and grisly prose that she asked for help from her department head who took cho out of the class and notified school officials but because cho had not made any direct threats officials said there was little that they could do this is the catch that universities now face when it comes to governing a campus there is a lingering sense that they should act in loco parentis not least by protecting potentially dangerous or disturbed students from themselves and others and the tort bar is ready to pounce when they dont in harvard student sinedu tadesse was exhibiting antisocial behavior similar to chos eventually she stabbed her roommate to death and then hanged herself the roommates family sued harvard for "wrongful death conscious pain and suffering and emotional distress " in the parents of elizabeth shin sued mit after their daughter committed suicide the shin family claimed mit had "failed to provide reasonable medical mental health services " both cases were settled out of court a reasonable university administrator might conclude from all this that mentally ill students when there is even a remote possibility that they will be dangerous need to be removed from campus at least until their condition has improved but not so fast in george washington university suspended jordan nott after he sought medical treatment for severe depression officials said later that they were trying to act in mr notts best interests by forcing him to take time off to get counseling mr nott sued the university arguing that it had violated his rights under the americans with disabilities act the school and mr nott settled out of court last fall in the same rights based spirit virginia recently passed a law barring public colleges and universities from punishing or expelling students "solely for attempting to commit suicide or seeking mental health treatment for suicidal thoughts or behaviors " hard as it may be to believe removing cho seung hui from campus might have been deemed illegal by state authorities our hearts dont often go out to college administrators but they are in fact in a terrible bind as philip k howard the author of "the death of common sense " explained to us "the legal system has substantially disabled the judgment of the people with responsibility " not that a mere change in law will help very much he points to the absurd reforms following the columbine shooting that resulted in "first graders being suspended for drawing guns on pieces of paper " the problem is less legal than cultural students now see themselves as autonomous despite their frequent inability to meet even the minimum standards of adult conduct the protests of the s were said to have set students free from the shackles of grown ups and now we have a generation of parents those same boomers filing multimillion dollar lawsuits if a school official doesnt protect their children properly there is a certain irony here at virginia tech the families of the dead will want to know understandably why cho seung hui was allowed to remain at school and they will likely demand compensation for what they will argue was a potentially foreseeable tragedy at least part of the blame though belongs with those who long ago decided to "challenge authority" at the expense everything else including it turns out safety itself
