style &amp substance park avenue classic or soho trendy retailer seeks turnaround by tailoring its selections store by store around us standing on the main floor of the saks fifth avenue flagship in new york steve sadove chatted excitedly about designer shoes by august the chief executive of saks inc said the retailer will increase the number of womens designer shoe offerings at the store by nearly to about pairs "shoes are wonderfully important " he said calling them one of the "hot areas in the store these days " having the right merchandise is the key to mr sadoves strategy for turning around the tony department store chain that stumbled in recent years trying to attract young women with what one analyst described as a "hollywood bling bling look " rather than open new locations mr sadove is focusing on overhauling the selection of clothing and accessories at the companys stores around the country he also plans to spend &# million &# million a year on renovations "its all about making our current stores more productive " he says his efforts appear to be paying off for seven of the past eight months sales at stores open at least a year have risen more than those at archrival neiman marcus the unit of neiman marcus group inc which has stores and is looking to gradually expand that number to around by yesterday saks announced that mr sadove who is years old will take on the additional role of chairman when current chairman r brad martin also retires from the board on may but to be successful in the long term saks faces the challenge of figuring out who its core customers are and its research has shown that they differ significantly at saks stores around the country at the new york flagship which accounts for about a fifth of the companys &# billion in annual revenue saks considers its core shopper a or year old woman with a largely "classic" style especially in work clothes and a taste for slightly more modern looks when going out with friends on weekends by focusing on this woman the manhattan store has delivered double digit gains in the past four months but mr sadove determined that sakss selection elsewhere was too new york centric and he began to review each stores customer demographics and shopping patterns to see what could be done to improve sales "a saks fifth avenue in new york is very different from a saks in tulsa or an indianapolis or a richmond or a birmingham " he says shoppers on the saks web site meanwhile now the second biggest revenue generator after the new york flagship are on average about seven years younger than the typical saks customer and spend more per transaction over the past year saks has gone through this exercise at of its stores using a nine box grid on one side of the matrix are style categories "park avenue" classic "uptown " or modern and "soho " meaning trendy or contemporary on the other are pricing levels from "good" brands such as dana buchman ellen tracy lafayette to "better" piazza sempione armani collezioni and some ralph lauren to "best" chanel gucci louis vuitton oscar de la renta and bill blass by cross referencing the preferred styles and spending levels at each location the grid charts the best mix of clothes and accessories to stock at the store saks expects to finish the reviews by year end the nine box grid "permeates everything that saks fifth avenue does now " mr sadove says even closely situated stores attract different types of shoppers a greenwich conn saks for example caters to a slightly older shopper than does the saks in stamford about five miles away notes craig johnson president of the retail consulting firm customer growth partners stamford shoppers tend to be women who work in town while greenwich has a higher proportion of women who dont work "when you have stores and a couple thousand vendors among all these product categories its not simple " says ron frasch saks president and chief merchandising officer in birmingham ala saks discovered that its assortment was too narrow and too conservative for the brand savvy fashion loving and slightly younger customer base locals were traveling to atlanta to buy designer clothing and handbags saks decided to add prada fendi and dolce &amp gabbana accessories "we found out theres a woman who likes to spend money so lets find things for her to spend money on " says mr frasch in short hills n j there wasnt enough high end merchandise and mens offerings were lacking saks intensified its offering of armani collezioni added a gucci handbag boutique and brought in shoes by christian louboutin along with more prada shoes it also expanded the mens clothing lines to five from about three and offered more mens shoes mr frasch says saks has seen "tremendous response" from the changes "the guys in short hills all work in new york and tend to be sophisticated successful executives who needed a full range of product " he says several saks renovation projects including those recently finished in boston and beverly hills and one under way in manhattan focus on expanding womens designer shoe sections in new york saks is moving designer shoes to an expanded space on the eighth floor with access by an express elevator saks stores in new york and other major cities also benefit from the flocks of overseas tourists coming to take advantage of favorable exchange rates "were one of the larger tourist destinations in cities like new york l a san francisco chicago miami when people go to those cities shopping at a saks is a real destination " mr sadove says one trouble spot is in mission viejo calif where a store slated for closure a few years ago has remained open late last year saks restocked the store with merchandise it moved from a now closed saks in nearby palos verdes calif but mr frasch says the store still has a long way to go the store by store differences complicate efforts to project a personality through national marketing as saks discovered when it launched its "want it" ad campaign to highlight key fashion trends last fall one of the trends it promoted for men was velour but many men especially older ones and those who live in the south didnt cotton to velour saks tweaked the campaign to include more classic items with broad appeal such as the navy blazer featured for spring this year saks also plans to increase efforts to tailor its marketing to local markets its also testing a computer system that tracks customer shopping habits to help sales associates most of whom recently moved to commission based pay can boost their productivity mr sadoves attempts to turn around saks follow some huge shifts in the department store business macys parent federated department stores inc has closed about stores since the end of and last september converted more than former may co stores to macys doubling its size to stores mr sadove said in a recent meeting with wall street analysts that the approach at saks which focuses on the high end market is "not the same as a department store where you can in one fell swoop change the brand and throw it into stores " many designer brands seek to limit their availability so saks must add new designer merchandise gradually store by store he said founded in as a specialty department store serving the carriage trade saks fifth avenue was at first a joint venture between horace saks of saks &amp co and bernard gimbel of gimbel bros both of whom had independently operated stores in new york more recently it has gone through several changes in ownership it was a unit of b a t industries now known as british american tobacco plc and later bahrain based private equity firm investcorp before being bought by birmingham based proffitts in some observers say saks might be scooped up by a private equity firm once again though any potential buyer is likely to wait and see how mr sadoves turnaround efforts pan out with its results improving "the challenge will be for saks to distinguish itself from nordstrom neiman marcus and bloomingdales particularly as bloomingdales moves upscale " says kelly tackett a senior consultant at retail forward an independent research firm though saks has benefited from the continued boom in luxury goods it is still far less profitable than its rivals its average sales per square foot total &# compared with &# at neiman marcus and about &# at nordstrom in many key markets nordstrom has historically has a stronger shoe selection and neiman has had a greater depth of designer goods mr sadove says saks recently has patched things up with key vendors who were concerned by the retailers five year plus underperformance "there was such an uncertainty over saks and id be the first to tell you that people didnt have clarity about whether this company was even going to be around "
