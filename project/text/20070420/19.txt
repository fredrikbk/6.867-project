second time in less than two months a drop in chinese stock prices rattled markets across asia and was felt modestly in europe and the u s investors said chinese stocks are becoming a measure of tolerance for risk everywhere the main factor triggering the fall in the shanghai composite index it was down at one point yesterday before finishing with a loss was concern among chinese investors that beijing might move to brake growth in the worlds fourth biggest economy with an interest rate increase that would be the second move this year those worries were strengthened just after chinese markets closed when the national bureau of statistics announced faster than expected economic growth of for the first quarter the bureau also reported inflation and investment numbers that suggest the economy could be expanding too quickly chinas financial markets remain largely closed to foreigners but international investors are paying attention to the countrys markets reflecting chinas role in the global economy as the worlds second biggest exporter after germany and a favored destination for foreign investment an plunge in the shanghai composite index feb helped trigger a slide in stock markets around the globe although share prices have recovered analysts said they view the shanghai stock market as a yardstick of wealth in the chinese middle class as well as a proxy for chinas economic performance which some doubt is fully captured by official government statistics "were all looking at the shanghai stock market it is genuinely the only financial indicator we can get out of china today " said ben simpfendorfer an economist at royal bank of scotland in hong kong more broadly chinas stock markets are seen by some as an indicator of how long rallies in equities elsewhere can continue "its quite astonishing " said john vail chief global strategist at nikko am a money management firm in tokyo "the chinese perception of risk is having some influence on investor sentiment elsewhere " still chinas markets are unusual barometers the limits on foreign investors and the fact that chinas citizens have limited access to markets overseas are two factors that make it difficult to compare performance in chinese financial markets with those elsewhere no one doubts a significant economic hiccup in china would ripple through much of the global economy but at this stage the effect chinas markets are having internationally appears outsized some analysts said for instance the shanghai market yesterday helped set the tone for trading in the japanese yen unusual given that the volume of trading between the yen and u s dollar is estimated at more than eight times the &# billion in stocks that changed hands yesterday on the shanghai market and its smaller sister market in shenzhen the dollar fell about one yen in tokyo trading to finish at yen some analysts said the inflation and investment data china released could mean the stock markets bull run over the past year thanks to individual investors and big funds raises the likelihood of more interest rate increases at yesterdays close of the shanghai composite index was up this year and above the eight year low it touched less than two years ago china also has faced calls to cool its economy by allowing additional volatility in another financial market the currency the dollar ended at between yuan and yuan
