politics &amp economics deeper discontents buffet world bank wolfowitz dispute unleashes long simmering complaints about how institution is run a dispute about paul wolfowitzs leadership as president of the world bank is pushing to the surface many long simmering dysfunctions at the bank and sparking discussions over the need to overhaul its structure yesterday afternoon the banks executive board met to rule on how to handle mr wolfowitzs granting of a generous pay and promotion package for his girlfriend a bank employee mr wolfowitz is increasingly in trouble not only because of hostility from european and other governments but because a rebellion among the world banks staff members is spreading the seeds of trouble were sown long before mr wolfowitz arrived at the year old institution in june for years the banks professional staff which represents nearly countries has chafed at the centralized top down management of the world bank whose president is always handpicked by the u s the banks largest donor mr wolfowitzs predecessor james wolfensohn also faced heavy scrutiny from the banks inner ranks rank and file staffers have been itching for a bigger say in bank decisions says alison cave head of the staff association which functions like a union for world bank employees days after she took the post in january ms cave wrote an unusual letter to the top u s representative at the bank at the time the association she said should have a say in picking the next world bank president at a time of "major changes" in the banks operations that request was turned down but ms caves prediction in the letter that "the new president is likely to have a huge impact on staff" proved prescient mr wolfowitzs nomination by president bush to take over as bank president sent shock waves through the organization within two days nearly employees had written to ms cave on an internal web site expressing concerns over how the then u s deputy defense secretary with his reputation as a chief architect of the iraq war might affect the banks effectiveness reputation and credibility upon arrival mr wolfowitz did his best to tamp down the unease he spoke openly of his warm feelings for the banks "extraordinary group of professionals " where ph d s are common even among junior staffers and embraced the banks antipoverty mission vowing to shake things up he elevated some relatively junior officials to some high level posts he dined in the basement cafeteria and urged staffers to email him with concerns top aides said mr wolfowitz on several occasions deleted the senders names and forwarded those emails to them to follow up on several occasions "the first thing he said to me was dont be afraid of me " said ms cave an urban planner who rides her bike to work "i told him im not dont be afraid of me our success is your success " the amity didnt last long within months ms cave and others began to complain that mr wolfowitz was cutting the staff out of meetings with bank vice presidents and disregarding long established rules for competitive and transparent hiring procedures as he brought in several personally selected advisers some aides had direct ties to his previous work within the bush administration another major irritant was mr wolfowitzs campaign to push the bank back into iraq some bank staff saw that as a sign that mr wolfowitz cared more about advancing the interests of president bush than the banks own antipoverty agenda tensions spiked in early when mr wolfowitz began to ramp up his anticorruption initiative along with calls to curb official corruption among countries benefiting from bank assistance mr wolfowitz noting a few "bad apples" can damage "the reputation of a whole institution " spoke openly of the need to deal with corruption within the institution itself the campaign rubbed the rank and file the wrong way as mr wolfowitz and his aides made clear that a real focus would be on staff wrongdoing many staffers were already piqued at how mr wolfowitz had turned over key positions to a number of close aides among them a tough former white house official named robin cleveland some staffers began a quiet inquiry into mr wolfowitzs role in promoting and awarding a big pay increase to his girlfriend a seven year veteran of the world bank named shaha riza he initially proposed to avoid any conflicts by recusing himself from any official interaction with ms riza but the ethics committee turned down that proposal and under a subsequent arrangement she was detailed to the state department to avoid any conflict of interest as part of that transfer mr wolfowitz dictated the terms of the pay package she would receive but whistleblowers homed in on the riza case as a way to highlight what they considered to be mr wolfowitzs own penchant for nepotism and favoritism last week ms cave held a public staff meeting in the banks atrium and called for mr wolfowitzs resignation over his involvement in the riza case mr wolfowitz while making clear that he didnt intend to resign has apologized for how he handled the riza matter and has suggested a willingness to make management changes to win board support other critics have jumped on the bandwagon "this has further damaged an already weakened american credibility " said house financial services chairman barney frank a massachusetts democrat "what this has led to are questions about the american role in the bank in general and its part of a pattern of this administration diminishing americas ability to influence events in a range of international forums " on wednesday one of the banks most respected senior managers new zealands graeme wheeler urged mr wolfowitz to step down there are sharp divisions within the board over how to proceed a group of european nations among them the united kingdom germany and france have been most vocal in raising concerns that the controversy has damaged the banks credibility mr wheelers confrontation with mr wolfowitz which set off a hurried round of consultations yesterday among european allies appeared to further embolden critics "concern is increasing not declining " said one european official familiar with yesterdays discussions "the pressure is ratcheting up " mr wolfowitz has drawn support from an alliance that includes poor countries many of them in africa as well as canada and the u s the dispute could have potentially far reaching ramifications for the banks future operations the staff revolt against mr wolfowitz imperils his core anticorruption mission and could weaken an effort to replenish the banks development coffers by some &# billion the controversy is also emboldening reformers who want to weaken the u s hold over the bank an increasing number of international representatives argue that the banks leadership should reflect a changing world throwing open the president selection process critics say could give developing nations a bigger say in bank policymaking the outcry comes at a time of widespread debate over the need to reform other major post world war ii institutions including the international monetary fund and the united nations one of the toughest overhaul challenges the u s faces in this regard is how to accommodate growing demands to enlarge the u n security council to include new powers such as india and brazil
