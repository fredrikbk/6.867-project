the real world bank scandal by the time this is published i dont know if paul wolfowitz will still be president of the world bank regardless of his fate many of the problems and agendas underlying his current predicament will remain unresolved and must be confronted if much needed reforms have any hope of implementation before addressing those matters directly a few words about the shaha riza situation are in order ms riza is of course mr wolfowitzs companion who left the world bank to join the state department when he became the banks president first the shabby treatment ms riza endured at the world bank began long before mr wolfowitzs nomination was unanimously approved by the banks board of executive directors in i should know i represented the u s on the board from to without board authorization or knowledge several members of senior management including several now trying to dust their tracks pressured ms riza to leave the world bank while mr wolfowitzs nomination was pending second ms riza is a well known advocate of womens rights in the middle east a reputation that made her unpopular among some of my board colleagues well before mr wolfowitzs nomination in my opinion the pressure to which she was subjected was typical of a culture that many female employees frequently complain is oppressively sexist moreover mr wolfowitz acknowledged the conflict promptly upon his nomination i believe that he consistently acted in good faith attempting to carry out the boards wishes that the conflict be resolved without unduly penalizing her for making a career move she did not seek he would have avoided much grief if he had simply presented the details of the arrangement to the ethics committee if in fact he didnt but it wasnt unreasonable to assume he was acting as directed especially since the committee expressed satisfaction with the outcome a clearer public explanation also would have helped but no fair reader of the released documents would call his actions a "scandal " those interested in the success of the world bank should be under no illusion as to what is really motivating the staff revolt now playing out and what the consequences are likely to be many are opposed to mr wolfowitzs anti corruption emphasis some on the good faith basis that he is placing disproportionate emphasis on the issue at the expense of other development priorities others however are opposed on the selfish basis that elevating anticorruption and governance considerations will result in lower lending levels and more difficult negotiations with borrowing governments still others may fear exposure of corruption among staff itself and possible adverse donor reaction if widespread corruption appears to plague bank operations regardless of the fates of mr wolfowitz and the anticorruption initiative the bank faces an existential financial problem because of the combined effect of its declining relevance and attractiveness as a funding source for many middle income countries like china india mexico and russia and an annual administrative budget exceeding &# billion its a positive development that many countries no longer are dependent on bank lending but the income consequences to the bank need to be addressed because the administrative budget is a serious burden on the worlds poor and donor taxpayers the most important cost drivers are staff salaries and headcount and it is here where some of the most pernicious effects of the staff associations union characteristics are felt over the years the banks legal department has constructed a complex set of rules and procedures governing employment practices particularly terminations designed to avoid a court of law somewhere imposing something more onerous in the name of "due process " the unfortunate result is a system of such dickensian complexity that virtually all bank managers have concluded that no one can be fired this and the tendency of many board members to intervene in individual cases to protect or promote their nationals has resulted in far too many employees many of whom are widely viewed as incompetent and costly salaries and severance packages compared to which ms rizas package is a pittance other unfortunate results are an unreasonably low mandatory retirement age of and the retention of an army of consultants nearly as large as the banks regular workforce many consultants are former bank staff the permanent nature of bank employment also complicates needed reform of its whistleblower policies which are frequently abused as another tool of entrenchment all of these and other factors have added up to a bloated budget in which an unusually honest and candid senior budget official who met with mr wolfowitz in my home pending board approval of his nomination to avoid detection by more senior bank staff identified specific examples of wasteful spending adding up to about &# million annually mr wolfowitzs first steps to rein in the banks unsustainable cost structure are another important reason many staff and their board allies want him gone unless he and his successors and the board address the cost structure the bank will be in danger of collapse the bloated permanent staff is also an obstacle to a necessary re assessment of which activities the bank should really be engaged in the kind of constructive critical thinking regarding the post world war ii multilateral institutions of which the "next generation" project led by frank gavin at the lbj school of public affairs is a good example in my opinion the bank does first rate work in research and in acting as a clearinghouse and opinion leader in promoting and disseminating best practices in development its annual "doing business" report is an excellent resource promoting foreign direct investment and encouraging developing country reform but many of its other activities including much of its lending are of more questionable development impact the bank needs to narrow its focus on areas of comparative advantage a threatening idea to turf conscious entrenched bureaucrats mr wolfowitz is also under attack because he brought with him some trusted advisers from outside the bank and has encouraged the departure of several senior managers this has disrupted the status quo and caused job insecurity for many career staff whose long held assumptions regarding what is necessary to make their way up the career ladder have been challenged i havent agreed with nor am i aware of all of his personnel decisions or with their timing but any bank president who relies exclusively on career staff is unwise and any who doesnt challenge the status quo is not doing his job many staffers have also reacted to mr wolfowitzs insistence on accountability in bank operations in the manner of dracula being exposed to a cross without staff accountability for results however there is little hope that the poor will be helped by the bank the nature and composition of the board itself is also at play needless to say a person board is hopelessly unwieldy as an effective policy making much less operating body the boards structural ineffectiveness is compounded by the frequency of its turnover with tenure averaging less than two years hardly enough time to learn all the acronyms much less who you can trust the imperatives of gaining loan approvals for borrowing country directors never once in four years did i witness one such director oppose any loan and the comparatively high compensation enjoyed by many board members other parochial foreign policy interests including those of the u s especially in the form of a mind numbing and influence diminishing number of legislatively mandated voting requirements are also a serious impediment to board effectiveness many board members would love to see the boards power relative to the president enhanced all others should be horrified at the thought finally there is no question that many resent the tradition by which the nominee of the president of the u s becomes the president of the bank the resentment has been exacerbated by the staffs political preferences roughly the same as that of most college faculty good philosophical arguments can be made for a more open presidential selection process however the same arguments can be made with respect to many other multilateral institutions such as the imf the african asian european and latin american multilateral development banks and last but not least the u n the unproductive free for all that would be unleashed if all such understandings were abandoned would not be a pretty picture nor in my opinion an improvement as for the bank itself the idea of the board reaching consensus on desirable objective non parochial job qualifications for its president is an amusing thought and the exercise might be entertaining and edifying if the banks opaque disclosure policy was amended to allow it in my opinion ideal qualifications would include experience running both a large hostile government bureaucracy and a large multinational corporation success in a turn around situation and business experience in developing countries unfortunately that list would be short and the few who might be on it are not likely to want the job after observing mr wolfowitzs ordeal mr holland represented the u s on the world banks board of executive directors from to
