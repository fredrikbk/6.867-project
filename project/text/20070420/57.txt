police want to see my files all they have to do is ask " as a consultant specializing in helping companies land deals in foreign markets mr arcaini is part of a murky and controversial industry multinational companies often turn to consultants for help navigating perplexing markets and cultures especially in the developing world such hired guns can bring language skills local knowledge and valuable contacts but several recent scandals have raised questions about their involvement in bribery u s authorities are investigating whether a consortium whose investors included a unit of halliburton co used agents or subcontractors to bribe nigerian government officials to facilitate a contract for a multibillion dollar natural gas liquefaction project the houston based company said in a securities filing in february halliburton said it was cooperating with the investigation and that the unit has since gone public as a separate company british authorities recently looked into whether london based bae systems plc made illicit payments through travel consultants to help secure saudi arabian defense equipment contracts the british government halted that investigation in december citing national security concerns bae denies any wrongdoing and says it cooperated fully with investigators in december siemens said it uncovered million euros or about &# million in "suspicious transactions" spanning seven years german authorities have arrested several former and current siemens managers in connection with the probe mr arcaini hasnt been questioned by prosecutors or charged with any wrongdoing he says he isnt the focus of the investigation he knew of corruption in foreign countries by the munich based company he says and he blew the whistle to senior managers siemens declined to comment about mr arcaini citing the ongoing criminal investigation the company says it is cooperating with authorities and that any wrongdoing in recent years was the work of renegade managers in recent years european authorities have adopted a new outlook on corporate bribery until german companies were permitted to write off as business expenses any bribes they paid in foreign countries many european countries didnt outlaw paying bribes abroad until the late s two decades after the u s tackled the issue by passing the foreign corrupt practices act while many european companies abandoned the practice others appear to have tried to circumvent the new rules efforts to crack down on money laundering in the wake of the sept terrorist attacks made it more difficult for companies to hide bribe payments that may have led more companies to use third parties to handle illicit payments "its much more difficult to detect bribery when funds are channeled through intermediaries " says patrick moulette head of the anticorruption division at the paris based organisation for economic co operation and development "today it seems this is a prevailing trend in international bribery schemes " german prosecutors conducted a surprise search of siemenss offices in november they suspect employees of funneling money through layers of consulting contracts into slush funds in europe and in offshore havens according to warrants issued as part of their investigation the prosecutors suspect that a network of consultants would then bribe potential customers the
