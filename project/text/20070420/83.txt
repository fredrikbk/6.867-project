studios have new respect for direct to dvd films fresh off the hit tv show "heroes " masi oka landed a role as a tech geek named bruce in "get smart " a movie starring steve carell based on the old tv series about a bumbling secret agent but before production even started warner bros went to the actor with another proposal to play bruce in his own separate movie this is not the standard hollywood spinoff though in an effort to make as big a splash as possible in the summer of the burbank calif studio plans to release the offshoot comedy "get smarter bruce &amp lloyd out of control " on dvd just days after its main attraction "get smart " hits theaters made for a fraction of the cost of "get smart " warners major release for the summer next year "get smarter" is part of a new push warner is making into the direct to dvd business even though dvd growth is slowing low budget and well marketed made for dvd films targeted at specific audiences are enjoying pockets of success warner bros a unit of time warner inc is by no means the first to make such a move walt disney co and general electric co s nbc universal have been big players in direct to dvd for years and most other studios have since jumped on board but warner is attempting to set itself apart with a more creative approach including experimenting with releases like "get smarter" and the use of top filmmakers joel silver the producer behind "the matrix" series has forged a deal with warners new premiere unit to make direct to dvd movies over the next three years for instance his first project a sequel to the horror movie "house on haunted hill " will give viewers the option to pick different story lines and four alternative endings direct to dvd has shaken off much of the stigma of its early days once considered a dumping ground for movies that werent good enough for theatrical release it is becoming a place that top flight filmmakers are considering taking their projects with studios curtailing the number of feature films they are releasing direct to dvd is a low risk way to extend franchises and increase profit "its not the biggest part of the market but its the most important slice of home entertainment today due to the enormous growth potential for each studio " says amir malin a managing principal at the media investment fund qualia capital who oversaw such early dvd hits as "barbie" in his previous role as a studio executive still its a crowded market the number of direct to dvd titles has grown from around in to about last year according to adams media research one of the keys is clever marketing with that in mind warner brought in marketing expert diane nelson to run warner premiere ms nelson came from global brand management where she was responsible for the studios big budget "harry potter" franchise among other things ms nelson plans to release between and movies a year with budgets expected to range between &# million and &# million as little as the average cost of a theatrical release she may then spend up to the same amount marketing each movie the goal she says is to be more inventive than just churning out the sequels and prequels that have dominated direct to dvd to date "relying solely on sequels and prequels does nothing to elevate the category and make it a viable first choice for entertainment " she says cheap looking dvd sequels are something disneys head of animation john lasseter has also long grumbled about although it has been home to the biggest selling direct to dvds of all time disney too is trying to spruce up its act with better quality product original stories will still take advantage of some kind of existing brand however ms nelson says the studio has done a deal with comedian george lopez for instance to make two latino themed dvds each year tagged "george lopez presents " the movies will feature the comedian in front of or behind the camera mr lopez says he aims to fill a gaping hole "the latino audience is not catered to or embraced by major pictures " homing in on a particular demographic is also at the heart of a deal with alloy entertainment to make dvds based on the popular tween books called "the clique " les morgenstein president of alloy entertainment says the firm may run online contests involving fans of "the clique" to cast two movies a year mr silvers deal will similarly build on his "dark castle" brand of movies and include horror thrillers and urban action "you can really experiment and take more risks in direct to dvd " says mr silver one of the more experimental parts of warner premieres strategy is what ms nelson calls "parallel content " that involves tapping filmmakers working on movies for the main warner label to scout out opportunities for companion stories unlike other studios ms nelson reports to both the head of production jeff robinov and the head of home entertainment kevin tsujihara that was how "get smarter" came about running down a list of warners coming feature films ms nelson decided to approach the filmmakers for "get smart " which hadnt yet gone into production the writers came up with an idea for a companion piece focusing on two secondary characters from the main movie bruce and his geeky sidekick lloyd played by the actor nate torrence "our initial concern was that we wanted to make sure we wouldnt be sending a confusing message to audiences " says charles roven the producer whose previous projects include warners "batman begins " they agreed that advertising for "get smarter" wouldnt start until after the main movie had opened their hope is that the buzz around the spinoff might even keep "get smart" in theaters longer mr roven says this lets consumers have something else original quickly after enjoying the film " thats a concept hollywood mavericks todd wagner and mark cuban have long lobbied for they have been releasing movies in theaters and dvd simultaneously but have been boycotted by theater chains that want to maintain the gap between theatrical and dvd release "theres no reason exhibitors will have a problem with get smarter " ms nelson says "its a distinct stand alone story " while doing something new is the goal warner premiere will still sometimes take advantage of sequels and prequels mr silver says hollywood cant give audiences the same old rubbish but sequels can be innovative too
