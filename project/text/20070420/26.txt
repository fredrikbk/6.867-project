darfur and diplomacy if hand wringing alone could make the world a better place darfur today would be as prosperous as switzerland and as safe as singapore but good intentions do not stop genocide in the hands of the u n and the rest of the "international community " they often facilitate it were reminded of this once again this week as yet more evidence emerges that the sudanese government in khartoum is violating u n sanctions by arming the janjaweed militias directly responsible for most of the mass killing mass rape and mass evictions in darfur khartoums support for the militias isnt exactly news but its dishonest denials of the fact credulously believed by some and disingenuously accepted by others have helped stave off international action against it now those denials ring completely hollow as a u n investigation produced photographic evidence of sudanese cargo planes painted white to resemble u n aircraft off loading howitzers and other military equipment at darfur air bases the investigation has also documented more than cases of "aerial bombardment" by sudanese planes between october and january just yesterday reuters reported that a sudanese air strike destroyed the darfuri village of jemmeiza you might have thought all this would finally have prompted the u n security council to go beyond the mostly inconsequential steps it has taken so far the first a arms embargo was imposed on both sides thereby helping to render the principal victims of the conflict defenseless the second a resolution imposed an asset freeze and travel ban on just a handful of people instead the chinese who speak openly about their "profound friendship" with khartoum and buy of its oil while supplying it with weapons have indicated they will not go along with any further u n sanctions the chinese also objected to the public release of the u n investigation ditto for the russians while our sources at the u n describe the french attitude as "wishy washy" and the british one as scarcely better meanwhile u n secretary general ban ki moon in his debut as a diplomatic soloist has been earnestly negotiating with sudans dictator omar bashir mr bashir has reportedly agreed to allow several thousand mainly african u n peacekeepers into darfur mr ban considers this a signal breakthrough though the agreement is a retread of a similar one negotiated last year by former secretary general kofi annan not to mention previous agreements mr bashir has agreed to and ignored even if implemented and even if the u n force is extravagantly well supplied the blue helmets could do little to police much less stop the killing taking place across an area the size of france that leaves the endlessly maligned bush administration which is the only government that has shown any spine on darfur on wednesday president bush announced that the u s would take unilateral steps against sudan including sanctions against government controlled sudanese companies and the blocking of any dollar based transactions conducted by khartoum if khartoum didnt meet its commitments to the u n similar kinds of sanctions were shown to be effective against north korea at least before the state department negotiated them away speaking of the state department our sources also tell us that it has been lobbying the white house on mr bans behalf working to postpone any unilateral u s action until the u n plan has been given a chance to work how long is that supposed to take a year for similar reasons we hear that state has resisted a white house proposal to impose a no fly zone on sudan we agree that a no fly zone would be a difficult and expensive undertaking to enforce far better would be to destroy khartoums air force on the ground at a single go the next time evidence emerges that mr bashir is using it against darfur in the s millions of diplomatic man hours were fecklessly squandered trying to reach a deal with serbian dictator slobodan milosevic over the status of bosnia billions of dollars were also wasted on u n peacekeeping efforts that did more to hinder than promote an end of the conflict this isnt exactly ancient history so why are its lessons never learned
