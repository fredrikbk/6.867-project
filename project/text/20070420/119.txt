weekend journal tastings new zealand places bets on red in pinot upsurge not all are winners more stuffing please new zealand has been one of the wine worlds great success stories in the past decade fifteen years ago its primary grape was the undistinguished muller thurgau then it decided to place its bets on sauvignon blanc and the rest is history imports of new zealand wine into the u s have risen fold in years its signature wine has become so popular and famous that winemakers all over the world tout their "new zealand style" sauvignon blanc now new zealand has its sights set on pinot noir in a decade its plantings of pinot have grown from about acres to nearly it has more acreage devoted to pinot than even chardonnay and more than all other red grapes combined thats a big bet indeed but it turned to pinot at a good time just before americas interest in the grape rose with the release of the movie "sideways" in the result exports of pinot nearly quintupled between and wine lovers have been very excited about new zealands pinot for some time now considering what the industry did with sauvignon blanc why not weve written about new zealand pinot for years but we have never conducted a broad blind tasting because there havent been enough of them on shelves nationwide that has changed while they are still not as ubiquitous as say australian shiraz new zealands pinots are becoming more widely available so we decided it was time we bought the first we saw from stores in florida illinois new jersey and new york we didnt set a price limit but most cost &# to &# and only a few cost more than &# pinot noir is of course the great grape of red burgundy that has become a surprising success story in both california and oregon although experts said for years that the u s couldnt make a fine pinot it has now become a more reliable choice on wine store shelves than either merlot or cabernet sauvignon even though pinot is a notoriously fickle grape at its best pinot makes a wine that is complex and haunting with a bit of funk a great deal of earth and many layers of flavor that slowly reveal themselves in time there are often raspberry cherry berry flavors and sometimes a lovely silky texture but its hard to make a good pinot and bad ones can taste flat dull and unpleasant we tasted our new zealand pinots blind over several nights as always we werent looking for "the best" new zealand pinot noir but were trying to get an overall sense of the current state of the grape what we found is that new zealand is on the road toward good pinot but still has a way to go the wines reminded us of the early years of american pinot before the u s industry really got it right overall the wines rated ok to good they generally had good pinot flavors but they lacked depth and complexity we wrote in our notes "not enough there" or "watery" way too often its almost as though the winemakers know what tastes they want but they dont yet have the experience with the grape and perhaps the vines dont yet have the age to provide the stuffing that makes for a really fine pinot it also is possible that some winemakers are still intimidated by the grapes notorious reputation as a petulant heartbreaker some wines tasted as though the winemaker didnt trust the grapes enough to leave them alone the result was wines that tasted as though they had been interrupted on their way to becoming truly memorable they werent complete some came so close that we wanted to stand at the finish line and coax them over it cmon with just a little bit more you can do it we also felt that too many vintners were covering up the lack of rich fruit and depth with a hint of sweetness and sometimes a heavy dollop of cream from too much oak even a little sweetness or too much oak in a pinot is a killer by the way the best known name in new zealand sauvignon blanc is cloudy bay so we included the cloudy bay pinot in two flights and found it pleasant enough but not among our favorites now all that said we still tasted quite a few winners that found the balance among fruit earth funk and acidity they still were generally light but often classy and interesting unfortunately while a third of our sample cost less than &# just one of our eight favorites came in under that bar and it was &# we found that the younger wines generally tasted better and that nearly all of these should be drunk sooner rather than later given a choice wed buy the youngest vintage we saw where does this leave us if we were going to simply pick up a pinot for dinner tonight wed still go to the california or oregon shelves because those wines are more consistent for the price but if youre curious and eager to sample new trends wed urge you to buy a new zealand pinot noir sometime soon and then try another in a few months as a newer vintage becomes available we think were in the midst of a developing situation here and it should be fun to watch and taste you can contact us at wine wsj com
