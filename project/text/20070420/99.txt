time warner may regret lost deal when time warner inc unveiled a &# million offer for swedish online advertising company tradedoubler ab this year it expected to wrap up the deal quickly instead shareholders demanded a higher bid and time warner ended up walking away time warner may regret giving up while tradedoubler isnt well known in the u s it stands at the center of a small but fast growing ad market in europe cost per action internet marketing in which advertisers pay publishers only if the ad triggers a purchase or a customer sign up cost per action represents only about a th of online advertising in both europe and the u s according to industry estimates most still goes to cost per impression in which advertisers pay for the number of times a web page is viewed and cost per click in which they pay for the number of times the ad is clicked on but a rising number of companies eager to tie their ad spending more closely to sales are pushing for cost per action deals as tracking technologies become more sophisticated "its in the mix more often than it has been in the past " says david schruers the london based head of online advertising at initiative a media buyer tradedoubler acts as a broker offering online ads from more than advertisers to a network of about web site publishers it has built up since setting up shop in it monitors activity and handles billings between advertisers and publishers charging advertisers a commission advertisers that have tapped into the network include computer maker dell inc and british gas a unit of centrica plc the business model is working well for the company which has been listed on stockholms stock exchange since late management expects revenue to grow to this year after a jump to billion swedish kronor &# million in about four fifths of its revenue is tied to cost per action according to industry estimates major rivals among online marketing companies in europe targeting the cost per action business include germanys zanox valueclick inc s commission junction unit and advertising com owned by time warners aol unit but while figures on the business model are scarce industry trackers say tradedoubler appears to be in the drivers seat it has developed an on the ground presence in european countries comfortably ahead of competitors online advertising grabs less than of overall ad outlays in many of those countries but growth is accelerating more quickly than in more mature internet markets such as the united kingdom or the u s the first mover advantage is particularly important in europe brokers have to navigate a maze of borders with different languages laws and business cultures setting up a reliable and extensive network of publishers for advertisers across such terrain can take years "we certainly regard them as a leader " says nate elliott an online ad analyst in berlin at jupiter research of tradedoublers market position in europe cost per action is drawing heightened attention in the u s google inc recently began testing a cost per action model as an alternative to the cost per click model it traditionally employs when it agreed to buy online marketing group doubleclick inc last week google also acquired performics a doubleclick unit and a big cost per action player in the u s google has yet to experiment with cost per action in europe but it may just be a matter of time "a lot of our advertisers obviously would like to have this option " says stefan keuchel a spokesman for google germany time warners aol unit viewed tradedoubler as a strong complement to advertising com and a quick route to diversifying its cost per action business on the continent advertising com employs a "push" model buying up empty real estate on publisher web sites and then auctioning it to advertisers tradedoubler employs a "pull" model whereby publishers belonging to its affiliate network can grab ads that the swedish company has posted from advertisers swedish investors blocked time warners planned takeover because they said the offer undervalued the growth potential of tradedoubler "there are very few unique companies like this " says peter van berlekom who oversees equities investments at swedish pension fund alecta alecta is tradedoublers largest shareholder with roughly a stake an aol spokesman said the offer for tradedoubler was "full and fair" and the u s company has no plans to return with a higher bid he added that aol will "continue to aggressively expand" its advertising com business in europe which is growing "rapidly " some industry watchers say it may only be a matter of time until someone comes knocking again at tradedoublers door with a takeover proposal the stockholm company has a stock market capitalization a bit under &# million for now william cooper tradedoublers year old chief executive says management is drawing up a two or three year expansion plan on the assumption it will remain a stand alone company among the options it is weighing expansion into the u s and asia with some acquisitions "its at the research stage " says mr cooper
