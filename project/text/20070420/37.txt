of its core money management unit the giant mutual fund family may have also provided a glimpse of succession plans for its longtime chairman fidelity said its chief operating officer robert r reynolds will be retiring from his position atop the money management arm and his position wont be filled many analysts see this as a sign of continuing unease with the firms investment and asset gathering performance just four months ago mr reynolds took over an effort to reorganize investment management at fidelity after the departure of the man previously tasked with that job stephen p jonas in may mr jonas took over the responsibilities of abigail p johnson who was president of the unit fidelity management &amp research co which runs &# trillion in mutual fund assets in a possible preview of succession at the top fidelity separately announced a dramatically expanded role for ellyn mccolgan who has served as president of fidelitys brokerage arm since in her new role she will also oversee several other sales departments including those that sell funds to institutions and life insurance customers she will manage employees nearly half of fidelitys overall compared with roughly before after the departure of mr reynolds who is years old fidelity said the money management arm will be run by a three person team that used to report to mr reynolds the team in turn will report to edward c johnson iii fidelitys chairman and the head of the family that controls the firm placing him in more direct control of the fund operations the year old mr johnson who keeps a full time schedule has been involved in the fund group since its launch but now there is "no sort of middle tier between johnson and the people on the ground " says dan lefkovitz an analyst with the chicago research firm morningstar inc he called the new arrangement "unusual if not unprecedented" at closely held fidelity the changes to the money management arm could place one of the team members walter donovan in a more prominent position says james lowell editor of the independent fidelity investor newsletter mr donovan is currently president of the equity division where funds are managed and stock buying decisions are made mr donovan could have "more control and power on a daily basis in terms of leading" portfolio managers mr lowell says messrs reynolds and jonas led efforts to revamp fidelitys investment management as the firm had been losing market share and has seen sagging performance at some of its mutual funds but while they made sweeping changes fidelity still hasnt returned to the level of performance it had before the tenure of ms johnson a member of the firms controlling family "im not sure bob was the problem but he wasnt the solution " says mr lowell referring to mr reynolds spokeswoman anne crowley said fidelity executives wouldnt be available for interviews yesterday in a statement mr reynolds said that after years at fidelity and the past seven as operating chief "i feel its time for some new experiences like so many other american baby boomers im contemplating the exciting challenges and opportunities that lie ahead of me " analysts said mr johnson couldnt have been entirely pleased with overhaul efforts in the division as fidelity has continued to be outsold by competitors last year fidelity said just of its stock funds beat peers in compared with in although fidelity is the largest mutual fund company by assets three competitors had higher net sales of fund shares last year than fidelity did they included american funds at no followed by vanguard group and barclays global investors according to financial research corp of boston as of april fidelitys funds were beating more than of peers according to lipper inc a new york research firm as of the end of february fidelity was lagging behind five other fund companies in sales according to frc to a "large extent " the money management arm is the "most prominent portion of the firm " says mr lefkovitz "the fact that theyve been losing share on that side has been a black eye " after ms johnson was transferred out of the flagging money management arm in mr reynolds was considered by some to be a possible successor to mr johnson the chairman that talk faded last fall when mr reynolds was named as a candidate to become national football league commissioner and he said publicly that he would consider taking the job if he got it he didnt get that position but the fact that he was interested in leaving fidelity touched off speculation that he knew he wasnt a successor candidate for the chairman position at the fund firm "that showed he didnt have the right stuff to lead fidelity into the next decade " mr lowell says many fidelity watchers now believe ms mccolgan could be a successor to mr johnson "it will be ellyn " predicts mr lowell "shes the most capable and driven " he said she has the ability to inspire employees as president of fidelitys brokerage arm which sells mutual funds through fidelitys investor centers phones and the web ms mccolgan has been a star and has recently been the public face of the company at more industry events mr lowell says the number of accounts opened by customers through the brokerage business has grown since the fall of when ms mccolgan took over fidelity says in an email ms crowley said ms mccolgan has "driven a top to bottom overhaul of the business grown the business significantly and in turn shaken up both the retail and institutional competition" among brokerage firms in her new role as president of distributions and operations she will continue to oversee the brokerage business but will now also oversee three other sales and operations departments fidelity said ms johnson and ms mccolgan will "share leadership" of the sales and operations side of fidelity in a statement mr johnson said "in ellyn and abby we have two strong leaders who will work in tandem to provide effective solutions to clients across all stages of their financial lives and through whatever channels they choose to do business with us "
