competence man republicans won a big victory this week shooting down a democratic plan for more government run health care the gop victors and free marketeers might send their thank you notes to dr mark mcclellan dr mcclellan is the year old internist who until recently held the thankless job of running medicare he was handed the further thankless task of designing and implementing congresss tepid medicare reform and hes the big brain who then wrung every last ounce out of that authority to create a striking new model for medicare competition that is today not only performing beyond expectations but is changing the political health care debate high praise yes but borne out by this weeks gop defeat of a bill to allow the government to fix medicare drug prices that was a top democratic promise this last election as the party sought to play off public anger over health care costs liberals saw it as an important step toward their all government health care nirvana nancy pelosi and harry reid also felt this was an issue on which they could once again roll republicans by flashing the impoverished senior citizens card instead dr mcclellans new model came online and wowed the older class private companies have flocked to offer a drug benefit giving most seniors a choice of innovative plans the competitive jockeying has slashed prices from an expected &# a month premium to an average &# the cost of medicare part d for taxpayers was below expectations its first year unheard of in government and medicare advantage which allows seniors to choose between private insurers has grown to encompass nearly one in five beneficiaries this success has rebutted democratic criticisms of the drug benefit and shown up those who tar the bush administration as incompetent the programs success emboldened republicans to vote for free market health care this week democrats have seen flagging public support for their program of more government and fewer drugs while mr reid held his caucus together this week some are worried about bashing a drug benefit that has an senior approval rating "congress only wishes it had an approval rating " chuckles former democratic sen john breaux an author of the reform "a lot of folks campaigned last year on were going to fix this program only to be told by seniors wait a minute it aint broke " none of this was inevitable but goes back to the competent dr mcclellan president bush came to town pushing medicare reform and had a shot at an historic overhaul the gop could offer the carrot of a new drug benefit in return for opening the entire decrepit program to private competition instead bush and co became more interested in claiming credit for an &# trillion entitlement and settled for meager reform dr mcclellan nonetheless took this pared down opportunity and used it to show private competition can work his success in particular with the drug benefit rests in two broad ideas the first was to design a program that immediately attracted a critical mass of private players to provide price and choice competition at the time nobody thought that possible mr breaux remembers congress worrying that so few private players would participate that whole areas of the country would lack private drug plans dr mcclellans solution was a program that gave companies maximum freedom to design plans bundle drugs and turn a profit he was a salesman talking up the opportunities and even traveling to new york to reassure wall street it worked and by the first days of business most seniors were being courted by anywhere from to plan sponsors those numbers have only grown creating so much competition that sponsors are eliminating deductibles lowering premiums offering more drugs its also led to smart cost cutting and efficiencies an estimated of medicare prescriptions are now for generics dr mcclellans other strategy and the flip side of the coin was to get seniors enrolled quickly his team designed an internet program that allowed seniors to punch in their information and examine the best plans his agency reached out to local organizations church groups community centers and enlisted their aid in explaining details a call center at one point handled plan questions a day today some of medicare recipients are enrolled in the benefit numbers that have further attracted private players further spurred competition further lowered prices "this is how you come in under budget increase satisfaction " says the man himself dr mcclellan he adds humbly "nobody should think this is perfect yet but its clearly accomplishing some good things " good things or no the reforms are still at risk there was a time when democrats believed in medicare reform but now most prefer it as a political stick to beat president bush there are also liberals henry waxman pete stark who understand this is a crucial moment in the national debate over government versus private health care and will do what they can to sabotage the reforms expect therefore more votes over medicares right to price fix if a broad bill cant pass liberal politicians will instead target individual high cost drugs arguing that since medicare foots most of the bill for these products it should have the right to "negotiate " the real goal will be to get any foot in the price setting door making it harder for private companies to craft flexible drug packages and laying the groundwork for more price setting down the road expect too a push to starve the competitive programs of cash critics know how effective this is having siphoned dollars out of the old medicare advantage program in the s causing private plans to drop out and giving the program a bad name dr mcclellans reforms and a republican congress have re energized the program but the key to future success is in the budget republicans would do well to spend more time touting the competition successes of the reform rather than the drug giveaway in a perfect world the bush administration would never have swallowed that entitlement in the first place in our imperfect world it at least had the wisdom to hand the reform challenge to a guy who was able to demonstrate the merits of health care competition and optimistically pave the way for broader reform down the road see related letters "letters to the editor the architects of medicare drug
