weekend journal the finicky traveler my cabo runneth over is there such a thing as too much service drawing a line in baja as i lounge poolside at the one&amp only palmilla resort in los cabos mexico the stream of goodies from smiling white garbed staffers keeps coming a cool misting spray with moisturizer assorted frozen fruit pops head and knee pillows chilled towels a soothing gel eye mask bottled water when a young man offers to clean my sunglasses though i finally say no thanks but i just want to sit and read my book with its over the top service luxurious rooms and lush setting its easy to see why palmilla ranks as one of the most popular oceanfront resorts along the los cabos corridor a mile stretch of coastline at southernmost baja california between the pacific and the sea of cortez where whales frolic and pelicans dive for their dinner palmilla epitomizes the boom thats transformed cabo from a sleepy backwater and theres no end in sight such high end rivals as las ventanas al paraiso and esperanza face new competition for example puerto los cabos with a planned slip marina luxury homes two golf courses and hotels but palmilla has seniority once a laid back room guest house that drew s celebrities like lucille ball and desi arnaz the place morphed into a sprawling room hotel its the centerpiece of a acre complex that includes the acre resort a hole jack nicklaus signature golf course and eight residential communities a goldman sachs fund and other investors own half of palmilla and kerzner international run by south african casino and resort mogul sol kerzner owns the other half palmilla was closed down in for a &# million expansion and renovation and reopened a year later under kerzners "one&amp only" brand joining luxe properties in such places as the bahamas and dubai though wed stayed elsewhere in cabo my husband and i decided to try palmilla recently for our annual anniversary trip when we try to pick places where we can chill out feel romantic and do absolutely nothing at palmilla as in other high end sun spots the price tag for doing nothing is steep an oceanfront junior suite goes for &# a night without meals through mid may palmillas lowest priced rooms go for &# in high season and &# in summer our experience there made me wonder if there may be such a thing as too much service palmilla even offers "doggie turn down service" for pets including a bed perfectly sized for guest dogs a selection of biscuits and a chew toy menu but we really felt like we were getting some bang for our buck butlers kept materializing outside our room to offer help delivering newspapers messages and an evening snack and we loved the hand over heart gesture every staffer uses to greet guests even when whizzing by in a golf cart at the airport a hotel driver picked us up in a big black suv and made the first of many offers of cold towels and bottles of water we arrived at palmilla after a minute ride through the rocky hilly terrain instead of a front desk check in a golf cart whisked us to the second floor suite wed requested at the far end of the resort away from pools and restaurants up some stairs past an open air loggia with romantic candles it was one of just two rooms on the landing the suite had a king size bed with a striking bright orange and white embroidered headboard a generous seating area travertine floors with terra cotta colored marble accents and a big "wet room" style shower and bathing area with mosaics and separate soaking tub a wall of sliding glass doors led out to a large terrace with a view of the ocean across a lawn with palm trees linked by hammocks our butler who serviced several rooms including ours settled us in with nuts and olives and a welcome ceramic jug of tequila with salt lime and printed instructions for doing shots a good thing as i havent had to call on the salt then tequila then lime rule since the s he pointed out the amenities such as free wireless web sunscreen kits beach sandals beachbags and telescope for whale watching there were so many that before we left for dinner we forgot to check on a form what kind of aromatherapy scent we wanted with evening turndown service the pristine housekeeping standards especially impressed us though we almost felt guilty using tissues and toilet paper in every resort bathroom the staff incessantly folded starter sheets for both into a perfect fan design but charlie trotters c the glitzy restaurant operated by the chicago based chef shook this positive vibe on the first night the indoor table wed reserved was in a separate empty annex brightly lit and unromantic with a minute wait for another table we ended up on the windy dark chilly patio we could barely see our food including a barbecued thai duck that might have been tasty had the trip from the kitchen not cooled it off fortunately the same patio was nice for breakfast the next morning and we had a better experience at c on a different evening for dinner in the main dining room the lounge chairs were stacked pretty close together at the family pool and practically on top of each other at the separate adult pool but at least you didnt hear the kids shouting "marco polo " in the water the family friendly resort has a kids activity program the big excitement most afternoons the bartender blew a horn to signal whales surfacing close by a thrill that got us off our duffs for the sight theres a swimmable beach but we just walked along the rocky shore exploring hidden coves where the hotel has placed large outdoor poster beds and trapeze like net contraptions suspended between rocks ostensibly for sunbathing we noticed the beds had "reserved" signs they can be rented with butler service for &# a day instead we tried hoisting ourselves into the nets only to end up like a couple of caught porpoises trying to untangle ourselves and flip out without harm we tried the resorts golf course which boasts lovely desert flora ocean views and hair raising cart paths through arroyos the hotels spa gym and yoga classes were fine too yoga instructor tony sanchez put us through our paces and we had a great couples massage in one of the large private treatment villas with hot stones that seemed to melt every sore muscle dining was memorable more for atmosphere than food the agua restaurant has an airy high ceilinged main dining room with painted mexican tiles and moroccan lanterns and little dining pods on the edge of an oceanfront cliff best of all one night we dined under the stars near palmillas charming small traditional chapel used twice a week as a restaurant the staff invited us to use a giant telescope next to the chapel i saw saturn with its rings in a perfect miniature view we didnt have many requests for the butlers who worked in shifts but one was there when we needed him when i found a swarm of teeny spider like bugs crawling all over my laptops keyboard and screen he found a can of compressed air and some colleagues with a tank of pesticide the extra services arent over the top says edward t steiner managing director of one&amp only palmilla and kerzners regional vice president for mexico i spoke to him by phone after my stay as usual i dont disclose my wall street journal affiliation during hotel visits mr steiner adds that the hotel keeps trying to think of more services the idea of a sunglass cleaning staffer for example came one day when mr steiner was on the beach and salt spray fogged over his glasses palmilla which employs more than is planning to add villas of three and four bedrooms with private pools on the last night we returned to our room to find a design of pink petals and leaves laid out on the comforter and a note identifying the work as traditional mexican flower art next to it stood a little wooden dustbin and miniature broom clearly meant for me to sweep up the petals before we turned in it was the first time id lifted a finger to do anything for myself in a week
