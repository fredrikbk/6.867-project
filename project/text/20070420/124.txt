college student in was more narcissistic than the average student in employers say the praise culture can help them with job retention and marriage counselors say couples often benefit by keeping praise a constant part of their interactions but in the process peoples positive traits can be exaggerated until the words feel meaningless "theres a runaway inflation of everyday speech " warns linda sapadin a psychologist in valley stream n y these days she says its an insult unless you describe a pretty girl as "drop dead gorgeous" or a smart person as "a genius " "and no one wants to be told they live in a nice house " says dr sapadin "nice was once sufficient that was a good word now its a put down " the gottman institute a relationship research and training firm in seattle tells clients

been very praised in their childhoods particularly need praise to both their child side and their adult side " adds dolores walker a psychotherapist and attorney specializing in divorce mediation in new york employers are finding ways to adjust sure there are still plenty of surly managers who offer little or no positive feedback but many withholders are now joining americas praise parade to hold on to young workers theyre being taught by employee retention consultants such as mark holmes who encourages employers to give away baseball bats with engravings "thanks for a home run job" or to write notes to employees kids "thanks for letting dad work here hes terrific " bob nelson billed as "the guru of thank you " counsels to companies a year on praise issues he has done presentations for managers of companies such as walt disney co and hallmark cards inc explaining how different generations have different expectations as he sees it those over age tend to like formal awards presented publicly but theyre more laid back about needing praise and more apt to say "yes i get recognition every week its called a paycheck " baby boomers mr nelson finds often prefer being praised with more self indulgent treats such as free massages for women and high tech gadgets for men workers under he says require far more stroking they often like "trendy name brand merchandise" as rewards but they also want near constant feedback "its not enough to give praise only when theyre exceptional because for years theyve been getting praise just for showing up " he says mr nelson advises bosses if a young worker has been chronically late for work and then starts arriving on time commend him "you need to recognize improvement that might seem silly to older generations but today you have to do these things to get the performances you want " he says casey priest marketing vice president for container store agrees "when you set an expectation and an employee starts to meet it absolutely praise them for it " she says sixty year old david foster a partner at washington d c law firm miller &amp chevalier is making greater efforts to compliment young associates to tell them theyre talented hard working and valued its not a natural impulse for him when he was a young lawyer he says "if you werent getting yelled at you felt like that was praise " but at a retreat a couple of years ago the firms lawyers reached an understanding younger associates complained that they were frustrated after working hard on a brief and handing it in theyd receive no praise the partners promised to improve "intergenerational communication " mr foster says he feels for younger associates given their upbringings "when theyre not getting feedback it makes them very nervous " some younger lawyers are able to articulate the dynamics behind this "when we were young we were motivated by being told we could do anything if we believed in ourselves so we respond well to positive feedback " explains year old karin crump president of the member texas young lawyers association scott atwood president elect of the young lawyers division of the florida bar argues that the yearning for positive input from superiors is more likely due to heightened pressure to perform in todays demanding firms "it has created a culture where you have to have instant feedback or youll fail " he says in fact throughout history younger generations have wanted praise from their elders as napoleon said "a soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon " but when it comes to praise today "gen xers and gen yers dont just say they want it they are also saying they require it " says chip toth an executive coach based in denver how do young workers say theyre not getting enough "they leave " says mr toth many companies are proud of their creative praise programs since the employee bronson healthcare group in kalamazoo mich has required all of its managers to write at least thank you or praise notes to underlings every year universal studios orlando with employees has a program in which managers give out "applause notes " praising employees for work well done universal workers can also give each other peer to peer "s a y it " cards which stand for "someone appreciates you " the notes are redeemed for free movie tickets or other gifts bank of america has several formal rewards programs for its employees allowing those who receive praise to select from gifts "we also encourage managers to start every meeting with informal recognition " says kevin cronin senior vice president of recognition and rewards the company strives to be sensitive when new employees are hired managers are instructed to get a sense of how they like to be praised "some prefer it in public some like it one on one in an office " says mr cronin some young adults are consciously calibrating their dependence on praise in new york web developer mia eaton admits that she loves being complimented but she feels like shes living on the border between a twentysomething generation that requires overpraise and a thirtysomething generation that is less addicted to it she recalls the pre paris hilton pre reality tv era when people were famous and applauded for their achievements she says when she tries to explain this to younger colleagues "they dont get it i feel like im hurting their feelings because they dont understand the difference " young adults arent always eager for clear eyed feedback after getting mostly "atta boys" and "atta girls" all their lives says john sloop a professor of rhetorical and cultural studies at vanderbilt university another issue to win tenure professors often need to receive positive evaluations from students so if professors want students to like them "to a large extent critical comments of students have to be couched in praise " prof sloop says he has attended seminars designed to help professors learn techniques of supportive criticism "we were told to throw away our red pens so we dont intimidate students " at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania marketing consultant steve smolinsky teaches students in their late s whove left the corporate world to get m b a degrees he and his colleagues feel handcuffed by the language of self esteem he says "you have to tell students its not as good as you can do youre really smart and can do better " mr smolinsky enjoys giving praise when its warranted he says "but there needs to be a flip side when people are lousy they need to be told that " he notices that his students often disregard his harsher comments "theyll say yeah well i dont believe they really hear it " in the end ego stroking may feel good but it doesnt lead to happiness says prof twenge the narcissism researcher who has written a book titled "generation me why todays young americans are more confident assertive entitled and more miserable than ever before " she would like to declare a moratorium on "meaningless baseless praise " which often starts in nursery school she is unimpressed with self esteem preschool ditties such as the one set to the tune of "frere jacques" "i am special i am special look at me " for now companies like the scooter store continue handing out the helium balloons katie lynch is the firms "celebrations assistant " charged with throwing confetti filling balloons and showing up at employees desks to offer high fives "they all love it " she says especially younger workers who "seem to need that pat on the back they dont want to go unnoticed " ms lynch also has an urge to be praised at the end of a long hard day of celebrating others she says she appreciates when her manager burton de la garza gives her a high five or compliments her with a cellphone text message "ill just text her a quick note you were phenomenal today " says mr de la garza "she thrives on that we wanted to find what works for her because shes completely averse to confetti "
