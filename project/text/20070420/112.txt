weekend journal review film fracture knits battle of wits into fine thriller hopkins gosling duel over perfect murder green is erratic fun fracture" provides a cure for seasonal affective disorder this hugely entertaining thriller is whats needed to banish a winter long case of movie blues you might not guess it from the beautifully moody title sequence anthony hopkins studying large dark marbles as they travel the tracks of an intricate kinetic sculpture but the whole movie is an intricate kinetic sculpture pulsing with energy and sly wit essentially its a battle of wits between combatants of matching arrogance mr hopkinss ted crawford a structural analyst for the airline industry is arrested for what may prove to be a perfect crime while the prosecutor in the case willy beachum a young assistant district attorney played by ryan gosling considers crawfords conviction a foregone conclusion willy has reason to believe hell prevail crawford has not only shot his unfaithful wife at point blank range but admitted to having shot her then signed a confession to that effect whats more the cops have his gun but willy has either not seen "the silence of the lambs" or failed to register its relevance for the man mr hopkins plays here a monster with a malign twinkle in his eye could pass for a relatively vegan hannibal lecter far from having lost any marbles crawford is scarily smart endlessly manipulative and cheerfully perverse as well as implacably evil in another movie this resonance might seem exploitive but "fracture " which was directed by gregory hoblit is genuinely smart in its own turn so its less a matter of exploitation than deft evocation and pleasing tribute especially since the script by daniel pyne and glenn gers gives crawford a worthy adversary willy seething with ambition has his eye on a prize higher than any available in the los angeles district attorneys office hes been hired by a downtown law firm that can make him rich and the contracts await his signature "just be sure you sign the one with the devil in blood " hes told by nikki gardner a gorgeous attorney and his mentor to be "its not binding otherwise " the day he crosses paths with ted crawford is supposed to have been his last day as a deputy d a but willys relentless will to win leaves him tempted by the prospect of a slam dunk case indeed crawford a student of character flaws as well as structural flaws thus the movies title which could be stronger tells willy that his weak point is precisely that hes a winner thats nice almost half a century ago "the hustler" introduced us to the concept of the loser truly you never heard that said of anyone until george c scotts bert gordon said it of paul newmans eddie felson now "fracture" may have us accusing one another of compulsive winning but the film is full of nice touches willys overweening concern about furniture and decor in his new office crawfords recollections of a job he once had candling eggs the first scene that ive seen set inside disney hall the strong crosscurrents at a dinner with nikkis family a bit of business with two cellphones that i first took to be a familiar plot device its actually a pivotal prod to willys associative thinking and all of it enhanced by kramer morgenthaus elegant cinematography within the conventions of the thriller genre "fracture" functions both as a morality play will willy with his manifold flaws manage to achieve redemption and an acting festival its hardly a surprise when anthony hopkins gives a fine performance but he brings a special lilt plus graceful restraint to this one after chewing so much scenery as hannibal lecter he seems eager to savor more subtle flavors ryan goslings commanding work in last years "half nelson" raises great expectations that are amply fulfilled by suggesting unplumbed depths while willy is still navigating the shallows of careerism this formidable young star sets his character up for a heroism thats fueled in equal measure by shrewd thinking and clear feeling and the supporting cast is all of a piece the extraordinary english actress rosamund pike as nikki david strathairns district attorney joe lobruto billy burke as detective rob nunally cliff curtis as detective flores and embeth davidtz as crawfords wife jennifer "fracture" is very much a genre film i dont want to oversell a piece of entertainment as a work of art but its an artful film that makes one grateful for substantial favors the director gregory hoblit came to feature films after a distinguished career in tv on such series as "hill street blues " "l a law" and "nypd blue" his showmanship and technical facility are impressive as they were in the excellent courtroom thriller "primal fear " and so is his emotional warmth as it was in "frequency " at a time when so many feature films seem to have been dashed off by callow kids whod been hired because they were cheap or obedient or both the script that daniel pyne and glenn gers wrote flatters its audience with solid carpentry abundant nuance an entendre doesnt have to be double to be good complex characterizations and an ingenious plot that actually parses im still puzzling over a few last points but that in itself constitutes high praise most genre movies these days fade from thought as soon as they fade from view everythings gone green the script for "everythings gone green" was written by douglas coupland the canadian novelist who coined the term "generation x" in his first novel "generation x tales for an accelerated culture " this is his first screenplay and it shows in a cheerfully discursive quality but also in a reliance on gestures contrivance and dialectic speeches rather than dramatic development and conflict the film directed by paul fox and set in vancouver follows the crabwise but picturesque progress of ryan an amiable slacker pushing whos played engagingly by paulo costanzo the dialectic is simple enough on one side is paradise lost a world fixated by money and seized by consumerist rapture on the other is paradise screwed a world of petty schemers and not so petty swindlers in the middle is likable ryan trying to make his way toward a state of grace but drawn into a borderline swindle that depends on his odd job with the provincial lottery the movie is least successful during literal minded debates about whos corrupt and who isnt but mr couplands screenplay of polarities also makes worthwhile stops to smell the surrealism a beached whale that seems to have come from another planet diminutive aliens from "mars texas " a tv show shooting across the street from ryans parents house a peripatetic palm tree used by tv set directors to make vancouver look like southern california and "everythings gone green" is downright delightful when ryan spends quiet time with ming a lovely chinese canadian set decorator played by steph song though hes slow to know it shes paradise found dvd tip ryan gosling was terrifyingly brilliant or brilliantly terrifying as danny balint the title character in "the believer" danny is jewish a conceited bully of a yeshiva boy grown into a pugnacious young man danny is also an anti semitic skinhead who wants nothing more than to kill jews henry beans remarkable film shows the ability of the human mind to hold and even cherish diametrically opposite thoughts
