brotherhood blogs in egypt offer view of young islamists like many young bloggers shaza essam uses her personal web site to list her favorite hollywood movies talk about a popular song and complain about her studies but some of the postings by the year old dentistry student in cairo are far less typical in an entry about her childhood ambitions among becoming a doctor a photographer or an actress she adds "i dreamed that i was one of the mujahideen in chechnya or palestine and that i was blowing myself up among as many enemies as possible so that i could be like the martyrs " ms essam is one of a growing number of young members and supporters of the muslim brotherhood a fundamentalist islamic group in egypt who have joined the blogosphere in recent months the brotherhood which officially renounced violence in the s though group leaders endorse "armed resistance" in lands they consider occupied says it wants an islamic state through peaceful means that respects the rights of minorities the brotherhood has branches outside egypt and spawned the militant palestinian group hamas in egypt it is a growing force and constitutes the largest political opposition group but some of its views and activities remain highly controversial banned by the egyptian government the group has long used web sites that promote its ideology and provide its leaders with a platform but until recently online windows into the personal lives of individual members have been rare the new blogs by young brotherhood members often mix political views and diary like reveries capturing the attempts of some to reconcile free expression and adherence to strict doctrine and the tensions that can result ms essam a conservative muslim who wears a veil started her arabic language blog molotoofy blogspot com in february she says she picked the name which roughly translates as "my tongue is a molotov cocktail " because "my words are the only thing i can use to resist any injustice and express my opinion also i am usually blunt without meaning to be my words may come out like bombs when i am talking to a friend " topics range from her political views she admires ahmed yassin the late spiritual leader of hamas to her entertainment picks the will smith movie "men in black " for instance unlike many brotherhood members she keeps her affiliation a secret at her university for fear of harassment by authorities but she has gradually begun giving the blog address to trusted colleagues "when these people get to read about my likes and dislikes they will know that i am an ordinary person just like them " she says across the middle east islamic groups with varying backgrounds including al qaeda have used the internet to advance their causes political blogs have also become a tool for activists challenging their governments and clamoring for democracy muslim brotherhood members are increasingly starting blogs as the egyptian government has stepped up its efforts against the group arresting many members and freezing the assets of some the crackdown further intensified after a december protest in which around students who belong to the brotherhood appeared in military style black uniforms and balaclavas that prompted accusations that the group is establishing a military wing which it denies the muslim brotherhood distances itself from groups like al qaeda and condemns their attacks it runs charities and social services that help make it popular among many egyptians but critics charge that the groups strict hierarchy and opaque way of operating are at odds with stated democratic aims and that its conservative views would preclude freedoms especially for women the new blogs by brotherhood members are laden with political messages largely adopting the organizations views and campaigning for the release of jailed members a few refer to acts of violence such as one that posts the will of a palestinian suicide bomber mixed with the political messages are favorite songs diary entries and vignettes on personal relationships some from well known junior figures in the movement and others from relative unknowns such as ms essam magdy saad a year old who works in marketing and is an active member of the brotherhood described in his blog how he anxiously awaited a response from the family of a girl whose hand he had asked in marriage two days later he broke the news he was turned down "god i accept your decision " he wrote readers responded with sympathy "god willing hell give you someone even better " wrote one he has received support but also criticism from some brotherhood members for blogging about personal details and thoughts "the egyptian society is conservative and has many areas that are out of bounds when it comes to personal affairs " he said in an interview "the brotherhood has more of these out of bounds areas because theres a great emphasis on the moral side so some people think that talking about this human and personal side runs contrary to morals " abdou el monem mahmoud a journalist and a well known member of the brotherhood was one of the first to start his own web site the site ana ikhwan blogspot com says it has received more than hits since it started in october mr mahmoud posts messages from the families of jailed group members and describes how their imprisonment is affecting their children "aisha started screaming father father can you see me she yelled and cried when she saw her father but wasnt able to kiss him " he wrote on feb "these scenes have really left me exhausted " the latest entries on the blog are not by mr mahmoud but by others giving updates on his own jailing mr mahmoud was arrested last sunday accused of belonging to the banned brotherhood and of inciting students to stage a military style parade according to abd el monem abd el maqsud a brotherhood member and the groups lawyer mr abd el maqsud says no such parade was held the paris based reporters without borders a nonprofit group that defends press freedom this week called for mr mahmouds release accusing the egyptian government of "increasingly repressive policies toward online dissent " julien pain head of the press groups internet freedom desk said that in addition to a crackdown on the brotherhood the arrest is "also a way to tell other bloggers that from now on they should be careful " egyptian authorities wouldnt immediately comment young brotherhood bloggers say the effort is grassroots and some even see it as a potential catalyst for change within the organization "our life is not all about arrests and politics we eat drink get married sleep laugh and joke " asmaa el erian daughter of one of the brotherhoods prominent members wrote on her blog but some critics believe that blogging is part of a coordinated strategy by the brotherhood to project a modern image and widen its support beyond its traditional base "theyre trying to seize the imagination of the young and see this as an area that shouldnt be just left for the liberal forces " says amr el choubaki an expert on islamic groups at cairos al ahram center for political and strategic studies "its part of the groups strategy to infiltrate the different institutions of society " even if the blogs were introduced by grassroots members "the leaders up high at least didnt object " mr el choubaki says mr mahmoud says the blogs are useful "people dont know what a muslim brotherhood member is like as a person and some are wary of the brothers " he said in an interview before his arrest "we want to tell them that we are ordinary egyptians we want our freedom just like the seculars leftists socialists or poor egyptians do the only difference is that we have an islamic identity " islam online members of the muslim brotherhood in egypt have increasingly started blogs that combine political and personal observations some excerpts i love freedom justice equality dignity al ahly soccer team french fries pasta and intellectuals ibrahim el houdaiby i have given all the people at home a headache talking about the idea of blogging and its pleasures aya khaled i found out that some people really like the idea of us talking about our feelings especially since we the islamists shy away from that but i found others who objected i will not be defeated in the battle for blogging magdy saad
