the secs mr consensus cox brought calm but does his style delay resolving prickly issues when christopher cox took over as chairman of the securities and exchange commission in he brought a sense of calm to an agency racked by divisions under its previous chairman instead of the split partisan votes that had become the norm under his predecessor mr cox a former california congressman brought a politicians desire to seek the broadest support possible the commission unanimously approved rules relating to disclosure of executive pay and using technology to improve the proxy process under his leadership every vote on a proposed rule has resulted in a decision but now critics are expressing frustration with this approach arguing that because of the time mr cox takes to reach a consensus the sec is moving too slowly on important topics leaving wall street and investors without guidance on key issues the debate gets to the heart of big questions about the role of an sec chairman should he push for fewer unanimous decisions that will endure or should he target contentious changes even if he alienates colleagues and interest groups difficult issues still unresolved with two years left on the bush administrations clock include altering the most contentious parts of the sarbanes oxley corporate accountability law developing a policy on penalties against companies that improperly backdated stock options tackling mutual fund governance and most controversial whether shareholders should be allowed to put their own election related proposals on corporate ballots mr cox has said all four will be addressed this year "if you insist on unanimity then obviously the people who are disagreeing have some sort of veto " says peter wallison who worked with mr cox in the reagan administration and is now a fellow at the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank to make big changes you have to outvote the opposition "and that means you make enemies " in a speech earlier this year agency commissioner kathleen casey a republican said that the commission has to provide "clarity and certainty as to the application of our rules we simply do not have the luxury of avoiding the tough issues particularly in todays competitive environment " supporters of mr coxs approach argue that unanimous decisions make for better rule making decisions are often later overturned "if you want something durable that wont keep getting challenged at some level then you need to find some level of consensus " says david chavern a vice president overseeing corporate governance policy issues at the u s chamber of commerce the nations largest business lobby which has sued the sec successfully on its mutual fund independence rule that was passed under the former chairman perhaps the biggest test of mr coxs approach is the question of whether shareholders should be able to put their own election related proposals on corporate ballots that could for example lead to shareholders nominating their own director candidates on corporate ballots and would substantially increase shareholder clout in an interview mr cox said the sec is "deadly serious" about sticking to its timetable which would result in a final vote on the matter later this year in time for next years proxy season the issue is particularly thorny because at first glance there is little room for a compromise that would please everyone business groups oppose the move and want the sec to reaffirm its current stance which allows companies to reject such submissions shareholder activists want the sec to adopt the idea part of a broader push to bolster shareholder rights mr cox plans to leave the agency after the next presidential election and knowing his legacy is starting to be written may use this issue to leave his mark one possible way out of the philosophical logjam in classic cox style would be to offer a bone to everyone the sec is looking into whether companies can settle disputes with shareholders through arbitration rather than in the courts a move that would please republicans at the sec the sec could package that option alongside changes to the way directors are nominated which has the support of democrats of course such an approach could alienate everyone the question of nominating directors is "not an issue that lends itself to compromise " said thomas lehner director of corporate governance issues at the business roundtable a washington d c group that represents corporate executives "you either believe in this notion or you dont " the business roundtable and chamber oppose giving shareholders nomination rights saying it could turn boardrooms into political battlegrounds for special interests "the top line questions such as whether shareholders should be able to elect their directors are philosophical no brainers " said mr cox adding that he believes shareholders should have more access to corporate ballots "but in writing a rule there are a number of technical details that have to be resolved " the sec is studying the british and canadian models of director elections he said the sec took the issue on in proposed by then sec chairman william donaldson the idea of giving certain shareholders the right to nominate directors on company ballots was so controversial that it was never made into a formal rule it lay dormant until last september when a federal appeals court in an unrelated case said the sec needed to clarify its position mr cox pledged a quick response but the sec has delayed putting together a proposal three times asked if he would break his streak of votes to pass a rule on the matter mr cox said "of course thats just as true in this rule making as in any other but its also vitally important to have every commissioner given the opportunity for maximum input and influence on the outcome " at least one of mr coxs predecessors says he can tolerate a delay says harvey pitt a former sec chairman who is now a consultant for corporations "its more important that they get it right than that they get it in time "
