atheists gain new zeal in their struggle against the forces of light its ironic that michel onfray "frances high priest of militant atheism " used an auditorium named after alexis de tocqueville to lecture on "hedonist philosophy" "the new crusaders as religious strife grows europes atheists seize pulpit " page one april mr onfrays worldview couldnt be further from de tocquevilles in "democracy in america " tocqueville wrote "despotism may govern without faith but liberty cannot religion is more needed in democratic republics than in any other how is it possible that society should escape destruction if the moral tie be not strengthened in proportion as the political tie is relaxed " confrontational atheists like mr onfray arent interested in tolerance or accommodation theyre zealous about suppressing religious expression consider just the examples cited in the article mina ahadis group of atheist ex muslims "is lobbying european union officials for restrictions on the veil " other atheists demand "that jesus be removed from nativity plays and that christmas parties be called winter festival gatherings " some like elton john would even ban organized religion quoting th century french writer nicholas chamfort mr onfray claims to believe that the foundation of all morality is "to enjoy and make others enjoy without doing ill to yourself or to others " too bad he doesnt practice what he preaches his radical agenda harms others by attempting to squelch their religious liberty charles d eden atlanta thank god er science for the atheists this topic is possibly the most important issue of our time it is refreshing to hear that an anti religion movement is finally gaining some ground i cant wait for it to spread to america and the world religion is the greatest threat to the advancement and very likely the survival of mankind history is replete with religiously motivated killing all in the name of god peace love thy neighbor charity and a host of other buzzwords i was a devout christian for most of my life but my eyes opened with the light of truth i found in the study of astronomy biology and human history think of the productive hours that could be used to solve the worlds problems just by focusing on the tangibles of science and research in lieu of the never ending time wasters of prayer hope prayer guilt and more prayer i champion the individuals who seek to show that one doesnt need a religious backdrop to live a moral and productive life religion will be the death of civilization science gives us hope and a way to go and with a lot less violence bryan stone salt lake city these modern atheists want to present their ideology as a defense of civil rational tolerant non discriminating humanism there isnt one sound plank in the whole platform it relies on the modern ignorance of history in europe as in the u s to get away with the claims the truth is that atheism and secularism have an appalling record of contempt for democracy duplicity persecution cruelty and mass execution atheism has shown itself to be neither reasonable nor humane nor tolerant nor gentle the rise of militant atheists even though agnostics effectively have the levers of control of modern society in their hands is a sign not of confidence on their part but of their fears they intuitively know that when push comes to shove atheism will be found today to be as tinny fragile disorganized and unconvincing as it has proved to be in the past it is concerned only with the present when it is hedonistic and peaceable but transmutes into a vicious emotional irrational ideology when it wants to seize power in order to forcibly divert it into unreasonable channels to set up atheist control systems for society in the future mark f withers lancaster calif unfortunately mr onfrays war on all religions doesnt seem to include the religion of political correctness the religion of violent environmentalism the religion of the victims of imaginary grievances and the holy and apostolic religion of global warming hyperbole fear mongering and profit centers charles k sergis calabasas calif europes atheists are to be applauded for their efforts to energize and unify those who embrace a wide variety of non religious beliefs as an organized community atheists have much to contribute to the discourse of a secular society and provide a bracing impetus for dialogue with followers of religious traditions it will be interesting to see however if evangelized atheists can replicate one of the central attractions of conventional religions world wide the ability to create a loving nurturing and compassionate community to support people from the cradle to the grave there are few religious people who match atheists for their delightfully snarky sniping at stodgy formalities and beliefs that elude the most elemental principles of logic and science on the other hand has there ever been a community of atheists who ministered to the sick visited those in prison forgiven their enemies for unspeakable atrocities and provided sincere loving care for the most frail elderly sometimes for decades i would further enjoin atheists not to abandon traditional religions altogether many atheists happily belong to religious organizations and attend services regularly to enjoy the warmth traditions and collegiality they offer in fact some clergy are themselves nonbelievers with no apparent ill effects on their flocks religion isnt an all or nothing proposition the spiritually inclined welcome all even the "de baptized " l holt trenton
