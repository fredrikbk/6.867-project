politics &amp economics u s backs plan on trying suspects in hariri killing new lebanese proposal bypasses parliament to establish u n court washington the bush administration is backing a lebanese plan to potentially bypass beiruts parliament in establishing a united nations court to try suspects in the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri u s officials hope to use the court to step up pressure on syria which has been linked to the murder but the move could further destabilize lebanons already fractious political environment u n investigators have implicated elements of syrias intelligence services in the car bombing that killed mr hariri and others a charge damascus denies but so far syrian president bashar assads political allies in lebanon particularly the shiite political party and militia hezbollah have blocked parliamentary approval for the establishment of a u n court lebanon has been in political paralysis for nearly five months after hezbollah pulled out of prime minister fuad sinioras coalition government in november the shiite party cited in part the siniora governments endorsement of a broad u n mandate in the hariri tribunal hezbollah says lebanese judges should have more control over the process parliamentary speaker nabih berri a close ally of hezbollah has subsequently refused to convene a vote on the hariri court due to the lack of shiite ministers in the cabinet under lebanons constitution both the countrys parliament and cabinet membership must meet certain religious quotas mr hariris death set off nationwide protests that forced mr assad to withdraw all syrian troops from lebanon for the first time in nearly three decades syria has subsequently been charged with involvement in a string of other political assassination and bombings in lebanon in what some allege has been part of a bid to disrupt the establishment of the tribunal the bush administration wants to use the hariri probe to strengthen the siniora government drive syria permanently out of lebanon and potentially pressure mr assad to stop funding militants operating in iraq and the palestinian territories eager to push the court forward senior u s officials say they are now prepared to support an expected call by mr siniora for the u n security council to circumvent lebanons parliament by passing a so called chapter resolution which would allow for the international tribunal to be established independently the u n security council approved its own draft regulations governing the tribunal in february u n and lebanese officials said they hope the court could be functioning within the next months as a u n investigation team pushes to complete its nearly two year probe into mr hariris death there is no guarantee that the u s france and britain would succeed in getting the security council to pass the chapter resolution china and russia as well as some nonpermanent members of the council such as south africa and qatar are seen as potentially opposing its passage diplomats said the bush administrations decision to push the tribunal at the u n while intended in part to strengthen the siniora government could also further destabilize an already tense political situation in lebanon middle east experts said hezbollahs leaders have said in recent days that lebanon could fall into civil war if the hariri tribunal goes ahead without its consent hezbollah supporters have camped outside mr sinioras office since december to oppose his policies violence between shiites and sunnis who make up mr sinioras largest political base has increased inside lebanon in recent months lebanese security officials said syria could seek to further destabilize lebanon if the tribunal process moves forward lebanese police said hundreds of battle hardened militants from iraq have infiltrated into northern lebanon via syria in recent months some fear that these fighters may have been involved in a string of recent bombings and shootings inside lebanon lebanese prime minister siniora wrote u n secretary general ban ki moon last week detailing the difficulties his government was facing in ratifying legislation needed to establish the court the lebanese leader didnt directly ask for the security council to pass a chapter resolution but said he was seeking "alternative ways" for the tribunal to be established lebanese diplomats said the letter was accompanied by a petition signed by of lebanons legislators calling for the u n tribunal to go forward mr ban this week dispatched the u n s top legal counsel nicholas michel to beirut to try and educate lebanons various political factions on the legal mechanisms that could be used in establishing the court mr ban is scheduled to meet next week with mr assad in damascus and the two men are expected to discuss the tribunal u s and lebanese officials said they arent optimistic that the u n can persuade hezbollah and its political allies to support the court syria along with iran is hezbollahs principal supplier of arms and funds any indictments of senior syrian leaders could potentially upset damascuss military alliance with hezbollah while potentially bringing economic sanctions against syria hezbollah and other lebanese opposition figures have also voiced concerns in recent months over the potential mandate of a u n tribunal the u n and mr sinioras government have widened the investigation beyond mr hariris murder to include other politically motivated attacks including last novembers assassination of lebanons anti syria industry minister pierre gemayel hezbollah officials have voiced concerns that the tribunals mandate could be expanded further to include terrorist attacks that washington alleges hezbollah has committed but that the party denies the moves to press ahead with the tribunal could undercut hopes driven by democrats that washington might reach an accommodation with damascus a string of lawmakers including house speaker nancy pelosi d calif have visited mr assad in syria over the past few months to try and strengthen ties senior bush administration officials for their part said they have seen no signs that damascus is serious about promoting stability in the middle east they said they believe syria in cooperation with hezbollah and iran is actively seeking to topple mr sinioras government their action has "effectively paralyzed the lebanese government and is further eroding the lebanese economy " said david welch assistant secretary of state with the political stalemate in lebanon many u s officials say pushing for a chapter resolution may be inevitable the u s has pressed mr sinioras government to draft a new letter to mr ban calling more specifically for the security council to act the timing u s officials said is critical as two of the strongest champions of the tribunal process french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair are scheduled to leave office in the coming months "we have to do chapter and we have to do it quickly " said one u s official working on lebanon
