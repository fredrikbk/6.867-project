weekend journal review theater nothing but shock for shocks sake blackbird manhattan theatre club city center stage i w th st new york &#  extended through june the life of galileo wilma theater  s broad st philadelphia &# &#  closes may new york forbidden love has always been a favorite topic of playwrights who like nothing better than to add an extra touch of drama to the old old story unfortunately or not the list of officially proscribed romantic partners grows shorter every day thus making it harder to portray any relationship however outre as illicit once the merest hint of homosexuality was enough to send a delicious shudder through most any audience but that was then david harrowers "blackbird " in which we are invited to contemplate the coupling of a year old man and a year old girl is ever so much more up to date "blackbird" is a two person show almost i cant tell you anything beyond that played out in intermission free minutes of real time the setting is the anonymous looking break room of a suite of offices somewhere in corporateville the action begins immediately after una alison pill shows up from out of the blue to confront ray jeff daniels who molested her years ago shes furious hes terrified ray it seems did a stretch in prison for statutory rape changed his name found a job got married and somehow managed to put his life back together the last thing he wants is for his victim to blow his cover as the play unfolds though we learn that ray and una are still obsessed with one another and before long they start reminiscing about their brief painful involvement i wouldnt dream of calling it an affair much less a relationship in the manner of long separated lovers the rest ill leave to your imagination save to say that the author pitches a not altogether unexpected pair of curve balls at plays end "i want people shaken up " mr harrower has said fine but why or to put it another way to what end has he chosen to use such lurid occurrences as the subject matter of a play for what makes "blackbird" shocking is not its subject matter or the explicit language in which una and ray describe what they did in bed but the fact that mr harrower has suspended his characters in a moral and factual vacuum we know nothing of them beyond what they tell one another and one of the things ray goes out of his way to tell una is that she was the only young girl in whom he has ever been sexually interested "those people those sick bastards i was never one of them i was never that " nor does mr harrower present him as a stereotypical pedophile instead we are left with the impression that ray like una is a person to whom something happened a victim of circumstance and that he too deserves our sympathy this is where im supposed to say that i found "blackbird" challenging disquieting disturbing you know the litany no doubt some trendy critic will even call it transgressive but what i find most disturbing about "blackbird" is that in the absence of any moral frame for the events mr harrower is describing its hard to see a point to his play beyond mere prurience i dont mean that he should have stopped the action and inserted an audience comforting sermon moral points can be made in vastly more artful ways remember the scene in "chinatown" in which noah cross admits to jake gittes that he raped and impregnated his young daughter "most people " cross says "never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place theyre capable of anything " maybe but what makes the scene work is the fact that we already know this person to be capable of great evil which puts his confession in a very different light not so ray who comes across as a more or less ordinary guy who made a really big mistake if you dont buy that and i didnt you wont buy "blackbird " mr harrower isnt widely known in this country but "blackbird " which won the olivier award for best new play of the season raised a ruckus in london and appears to be doing the same thing over here the off broadway premiere directed by joe mantello has received enthusiastic reviews and is reportedly being considered for a transfer to broadway given the success of "spring awakening " another show about adolescent sexuality and its discontents i can see why i should also add that mr daniels and ms pill are both dead center perfect it never occurred to me that mr daniels who hasnt set foot on a new york stage for more than a decade would be capable of giving so beautifully sustained a performance in front of a live audience i only wish he were giving it in a play that had more to offer than shock for its own sake philadelphia bertolt brecht wrote three different versions of "the life of galileo " and each time he added a fresh layer of moral complexity to his fictionalized stage biography of the italian scientist who proved that the earth orbits around the sun then recanted his discovery in order to escape the fires of the inquisition the first version is a marxist parable of reason enlightening the world in the second written after hiroshima brecht rethought his blind faith in science as the engine of human happiness in the last version written after he returned to east germany and was forced to choose between supporting a totalitarian regime or having his theater company shut down he sharpened his portrayal of galileos self protective opportunism after "mother courage " "the life of galileo" is brechts finest play but it doesnt get done nearly often enough in this country so far as i know it hasnt been staged in new york since thats why i made a point of going to philadelphias wilma theater to see the american premiere of david edgars new translation this production directed by blanka zizka is a lively plain spoken modern dress staging devoid of the heavy handedness that can make brecht awfully hard to swallow i wish that john campion had been less blustery and more vocally varied as galileo but his performance was serviceable while several of the supporting players especially david howey and greg wood were quite striking mr edgar who is best known for his stage version of "nicholas nickleby " has created a hybrid performing edition of "the life of galileo" that draws on material from all three versions its perfectly playable though charles laughtons translation of the second version prepared in close collaboration with brecht for the legendary production in which laughton played the title role is far more felicitously pointed laughton "then welcome to my gutter dear colleague in science and brother in treason " edgar "welcome to the gutter brother in science and cousin in betrayal " no matter any production of "the life of galileo" is worth seeing and while this one is short on poetry it gets the job done mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
