politics &amp economics voters fence sit in france parsing presidential hopefuls mixed messages paris frances presidential elections are mobilizing an unprecedented number of voters yet a third of them say they are undecided leaving the race wide open just two days ahead of sundays first round ballot though conservative candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal are leading in the polls the electorates high indecision rate highlights how far the front runners have strayed from traditional party lines on key economic social and security issues the legacy of frances most recent presidential elections is also prompting voters to think twice in voters ballots were scattered among candidates allowing far right anti immigration candidate jean marie le pen to slip through to the second round "i want my vote to be useful " said cyril bertrand a year old waiter at a paris cafe this week "i dont want to repeat the mistakes of the past " voter interest in this years elections to succeed jacques chirac who has held frances highest state office for the past years has been intense in february two separate episodes of a political television show during which ms royal and mr sarkozy took questions live from a panel of voters each drew nearly nine million viewers by comparison million viewers tuned in for frances world cup soccer championship semifinal match last july the highest television audience ever registered polling agency ipsos estimates that some of the french electorate or more than in will go to the polls to choose among candidates the two winners of the first round will face off in a second and final vote on may during the campaign the leading candidates have veered off their traditional party terrains ms royal years old has proposed military training for young delinquents and urged people to be more patriotic by displaying the french flag in their windows the year old mr sarkozy has taken to quoting socialist icon leon blum and criticizing chief executives who received huge paychecks while their companies flounder even though his center right ump party counts much of the french business community among its supporters mr sarkozy is at in polls compared with ms royals according to a survey yesterday by bva agency which gave a two percentage point margin of error "the candidates have blurred party lines creating less party adhesion than in the past " said vincent tiberj political science professor at the institut detudes politiques university in paris "even french voters who identify themselves with the right or the left have a choice between two or three candidates the hesitant voters could determine which candidate reaches the second round or not " confusing messages from the leading candidates have allowed a third man to emerge centrist francois bayrou whose platform calls for debt reduction balanced budgets and promises to take the best aspects of both the ump and socialist policies pierre giacometti co managing director of ipsos france said mr bayrou who is third in the polls with around is behind half of the national indecision florence dalle a year old literature tutor was leaning toward ms royal earlier in the campaign drawn by the candidates pledge to raise the minimum wage but ms dalle has since cooled on the socialist who hasnt given specifics on how she plans to finance more generous social welfare plans ms dalle is now contemplating mr bayrou "hes more steady and reliable " she said another reason for national hesitation is the memory of frances last elections in the first round voters cast their ballots in protest against establishment candidates including mr chirac and socialist politician lionel jospin mr le pen who garnered the support of voters frustrated with frances rising number of immigrants in addition to the protest votes made it to the second round left and right segments of the political spectrum banded together to elect mr chirac although this year people say they want to be more careful voters are tempted by the colorful candidate palette mr bertrand the waiter says he is torn between ms royal and jose bove a farmer who gained notoriety for vandalizing a mcdonalds in an antiglobalization protest mr bove is expected to get of the vote but because of a french law mandating equal radio and tv air time to all the candidates in the final two weeks of the campaign mr bove has received the same visibility in the media as the front runners have so have other fringe candidates who include a baby faced mailman a hunting aficionado and several communists the result is that voters have been bombarded with faces platforms and promises as the campaign winds down in france there also are strict limits to campaign spending to ensure all candidates are on equal footing candidates arent allowed to buy television ads for example mr tiberj the professor says the two second round candidates in messrs chirac and le pen collectively spent million euros &# million on their campaigns less than was spent for the u s presidential race in in u s presidential campaigns candidates also focus on targeting slices of the electorate such as white suburban mothers or church going men who can decide elections in crucial swing states "id be pulling my hair out trying to figure out who these people were and how we could get their votes " said david mercer a political strategist for the u s democratic party who visited the french candidates campaign headquarters last week mr mercer said a typical u s campaign would shoot for an undecided toll of to on the eve of an election as voting is direct in france in a one man one vote system there is nothing like the u s electoral college that gives swing states like ohio and florida more weight moreover french campaign managers say targeting techniques jar with the nations ideals of egalitarianism and justice "its out of question for us to resort to that sort of small campaign recipes " said eric aziere a campaign organizer for centrist mr bayrou "it isnt a french republican tradition " added a representative for ms royals campaign frances iconic tv show "les guignols" a spoof nightly newscast done by puppets that mock political and media elites has turned its acid wit to undecided voters jean paul the puppet of a characteristic undecided voter has shaved half of his face leaving the other half with a thick brown beard because he couldnt decide which looked better in one scene jean paul asks for a baguette at his local bakery "no give me a whole wheat one instead " says the hapless puppet "no ill take one cut into slices or a strawberry tart apple tart croissant ill take a croissant " marie valla contributed to this article
