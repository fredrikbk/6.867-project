berlusconi joins telecom italia fray former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi offered to use his vast media empire to help ensure telecom italia spa doesnt fall into foreign hands but his involvement will only further politicize the heated battle for control of the company "we are ready to buy into telecom to guarantee its italian ownership but we dont want to control it " he said during a speech at a political conference in florence he added "my offer should be understood as an act of patriotic generosity and if there are any problems with it i would back out immediately " mr berlusconis offer is the latest twist in what has become a long running soap opera that pits telecom italias major shareholder marco tronchetti provera against italys center left government prime minister romano prodi has been trying to prevent mr tronchetti provera from selling part of his controlling stake in telecom italia to foreign players instead mr prodis government has rallied a group of italian banks to try to ensure that the countrys former phone monopoly remains under italian control the future of telecom italia has been in doubt for months since mr tronchetti provera resigned as chairman in september after feuding with mr prodi since then mr tronchetti provera has tried to woo foreign investors in the hope that an industrial alliance with another large telecom firm could help boost the companys sagging share price earlier this month he entered into talks with at&amp t inc and america movil sa to sell a stake in the holding company olimpia spa that controls telecom italia but at&amp t withdrew earlier this week citing the uncertain regulatory climate surrounding telecom italia spains telefonica sa also is considering investing in olimpia according to people familiar with the matter though mr prodi wants to find an italian buyer for telecom italia there are few takers mr berlusconis mediaset spa which dominates italian broadcast television would be a natural partner for telecom italia but it would deepen the conflict of interest between his business holdings and his role as leader of the countrys center right opposition in addition under current regulations mediaset could only buy a small stake in telecom italia thursday at mediasets annual shareholder meeting chairman fedele confalonieri said the media company is "obviously interested in telecom italia " but he noted that regulatory hurdles dont allow mediaset which already owns three television channels to acquire a controlling stake in telecom italia whose media unit controls two tv stations "we would never even think about acting alone " mr confalonieri said "the regulatory framework doesnt allow us we could be involved in a telecom italia deal only with a noncontrolling stake " mr berlusconis offer to come to the rescue of telecom italia coincides with the governments effort to rewrite the countrys media law which critics say is skewed in favor of mr berlusconis companies the current law was passed while mr berlusconi served as prime minister it also provoked the ire of members of government who are keen on limiting the reach of mr berlusconis media empire "the only thing were still missing is having berlusconi as a shareholder in telecom italia " said pino sgobio a leading member of the italian communist party which is part of the governing coalition "berlusconi already controls of the countrys media " giada zampano contributed to this article
