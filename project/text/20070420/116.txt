weekend journal taste de gustibus transforming trousers i think most of us can agree that theres nothing like a good pair of khakis you can abuse the darn things any old way and they still look cool even when theyre rumpled or ragged you can throw them in the washer hang them up and forget ironing you can select pleated or plain front cuffs or straight baggy or trim they go well with everything t shirts summer blazers even winter tweed jackets and they dont cost much if you dont have at least one pair hanging in your closet we might want to check your citizenship papers but there is another aspect to their appeal no matter where you buy them from madison avenue in manhattan to buddys outfitters in front porch ala one pair of khakis looks pretty much like all the others when theyre on a set of legs walking down the street there is a tocquevillian rightness to such apparel it is democracy in action obliterating social classes without all the ordeal of revolution which creates a problem for retailers how are you going to get folks to buy your khakis and not the other fellows gap launched a beauty of a national campaign in the s involving famous people in the arts sciences and politics photographed wearing khaki trousers "emil von furtwangler world famous conductor of the ruritanian national orchestra wears khakis " it played off that pants classlessness by implying a reverse snobbery who are you to look down on brown if celebrities dont gap which has sold khakis by the short ton for a generation is now in the midst of a comparable advertising blowout to blow off the competition but it is a campaign with peculiarities gap is anthropomorphizing its khakis in the individual ads a young man is wearing "khakis with attitude " in a separate accompanying ad a young woman is sporting "the boyfriend trouser " i imagine alarming difficulties for the purchasers of such clothing as brad puts his right leg into his new gap pleated front cuffed baggy khakis the cloth twists and a voice says "get your leg outa there man " brad screams flattens himself against the wall and stares in horror at the crumpled pants the voice says "yo listen to me you bought khakis with attitude you saw the sign thats what i got now put me back in the closet ill go out with you when it warms up " brad assumes the fetal position convinced that he is mad as blaire slips on her new gap khakis she feels an odd sensation as if the cloth is gently moving emitting a cry of fright she starts ripping off the pants "please i love you " a voice says blaire adopts the kung fu attack crouch she learned in a personal defense class and confronts her rebellious trousers "what the hell are you " she screams "im the boyfriend trouser i thought thats why you bought me that you needed a boyfriend " naturally blaire recoils in disgust and yet ill bet the gap campaign is good enough to move khakis out the chains outlets at the buttered hotcakes rate the key is to make sameness different and presenting pants with "personality" is not a bad way to go another way is to sheer off the sameness and concentrate on something else the manufacturers of jeans khakis older and bluer cousin have long marketed their product with such "oblique" ads they focus is on the action in the photograph and the pants are seemingly incidental there were for instance what i think of as the "hog wallow" ads of recent memory in which mud covered young men and women were pictured wrestling in either bogs or barnyards it was difficult to tell the participants in the rather erotic grappling were presumably wearing the bluejeans that were mentioned prominently in the typography accompanying the ads were the hog wallow ads marketing genius perhaps it takes a certain virtuosity to sell a product by covering it with dirt but that is one advantage of the sameness quality when it comes to the basic material jeans is jeans and khakis is khakis you dont need to see it many jean brands have been tarted up resulting in the now common term "designer jeans" and sold for insultingly staggering prices but if you clip off the labels and the fancy stitchwork or beads theyre still bluejeans and thank god they are think of the distance we have traveled the social evolution you can see khakis in the sepia photographs of the th century british army in india and blue jeans on the gold miners of the american old west in mid th century america it was repairmen and gas station attendants who wore khakis and farmers who wore jeans today its everybody a gentleman is perfectly acceptable wearing khakis with his sport coat at a fancy garden party a lady can meet her friends for lunch at an expensive restaurant wearing say a barbour jacket ferragamo loafers good jewelry and jeans neither will be entitled to show much "attitude " even if their trousers do mr crabb is the journals letters editor see related letter "letters to the editor khaki vulgaris" wsj april see related letter "letters
