passing lane gms chinese partner looms as a new rival learning from detroit shanghai automotive pushes its own cars shanghai garment company owner li xianjin was planning to buy a new buick this month "then i saw the roewe " a new chinese made sedan he says "its quite a bit bigger and more luxurious" and "it looks a lot like a jaguar " mr lis change of heart points to a challenge for general motors corp in the worlds second biggest car market the roewes maker shanghai automotive industry corp has been gms partner in making buicks in china for a decade and it has learned a lot from gm now the chinese company using that know how and the money earned from selling joint venture cars could become a serious competitor gm says the bargain it made access to the chinese market in exchange for transferring technology and expertise was worth it "we made a big bet back in and its paid off for us very well " says chief executive rick wagoner gms joint venture which also makes chevrolets and cadillacs is the biggest car maker in china by volume bringing gm hundreds of millions of dollars a year in profit thats a rare bright spot for a company that has trouble earning anything in its home north american market gm is also a minority partner in a successful shanghai automotive led company that makes minivans and minicars in southwestern china see article on page a still the question lingers did gm give away too much its chinese partner could end up competing against gm both in china and someday abroad shanghai automotive owned by the shanghai city government already makes cars that rival gms in a joint venture with volkswagen ag hu maoyuan chairman of shanghai automotive says he wants to "build a global chinese brand " his company he says will "take full advantage of the technical and management experience weve accumulated" in the gm and volkswagen joint ventures as dozens of chinese makers ramp up production competition is threatening everyones profits average vehicle prices in china have been falling by about annually in recent years gms profit from china operations in the final quarter of fell nearly for the full year it was up about to &# million "it did give us an advantage being first it might have been nice to have had that advantage longer " says nick reilly head of gms operations in asia "but you live with that " the four door roewe that mr li plans to buy is no cheap knockoff shanghai automotive based it on plans acquired from the now defunct mg rover group ltd the project included british veterans of rover along with chinese engineers including some who trained at the joint operations with gm the sedans list price about &# to &# depending on options is up to &# less than that of the buick lacrosse made by the joint venture shanghai automotive started production of the roewe four months ago at a factory in jiangsu province near shanghai and it says it has sold so far it plans to introduce a new model every year for the next five years building a range of cars from subcompacts to suvs the latest model a midsize sedan is set to debut this weekend at the shanghai auto show chinas car market grew last year making it the fastest growing in the world among major countries by the country may surpass the u s to become the worlds no market for cars and trucks other global car makers banking on growth in china are also seeing their local partners turn into potential rivals under pressure from the central government all of chinas major state controlled car companies are seeking to build their own brands meanwhile foreign companies are hampered by a chinese law that says they must have local partners if they want to produce for the domestic market and cant own more than half of a joint venture beijing is following the auto industry pattern in other high tech industries as well it is pushing foreign manufacturers of airplanes power generation equipment and electronics to share technical know how with chinese partners chinas modern auto industry dates to the early s when a government owned company in beijing signed a deal with american motors corp to produce jeeps and volkswagen went into business with shanghai automotive in the early days foreign companies didnt want to make major investments in what was then a tiny market joint ventures remained essentially assembly operations in the chinese government dissatisfied with the pace of progress imposed stiff tariffs on imported vehicles and parts and laid down requirements to speed knowledge transfer soon after china opened the bidding for a new generation of auto joint ventures foreign companies were told they would need to hand over detailed plans and specifications for cars and production equipment toyota motor corp wasnt willing to play ball gm and ford motor co were after almost a decade of economic reforms capitalism was beginning to create an urban middle class and the market for passenger cars finally seemed poised to take off the two detroit makers tried to outdo each other in their offers of technical cooperation in gm landed a deal it agreed to create a &# billion joint venture with shanghai automotive called shanghai general motors gm promised to customize vehicles for the chinese market and set up a research and development center chinese engineers and managers would work alongside foreign colleagues at the joint venture in exchange gm thought it would have protection from luxury car competitors says michael dunne who worked as a consultant for gm at the time and now heads an asian unit of research firm j d power &amp associates it didnt work out that way the year after shanghai gm started producing cars in honda motor co began making accords with a local partner more surprisingly shanghai automotive and its other partner volkswagen began to produce the passat a sedan that competed directly with shanghai gms buick new century gm protested but shanghai automotive said it had to treat its two foreign partners equally people familiar with the situation say in chinas government added another wrinkle pushing domestic manufacturers to build their own brands and not merely serve as partners for foreign companies by government policy decreed china "should become a major auto manufacturing country " making a virtue of necessity gm has worked to build its relations with shanghai automotive it set out to turn its joint venture into chinas most advanced car maker in manufacturing distribution and finance today the shanghai general motors jinqiao south plant on the outskirts of shanghai builds buick regals with sophisticated equipment the average car takes about hours to build about the same as at the best gm plants in the u s japanese made robots put windshields in place german machines marry the cars chassis to their bodies adjustable conveyors keep the cars within easy reach of workers in bright blue coveralls last year shanghai gm made more than passenger cars by the partners plan to boost capacity to a million cars annually the venture already exports a small number of cars and gm officials say exports to developing markets could grow engineers at the joint gm shanghai automotive r&amp d center work with their counterparts at gms engineering headquarters in warren mich and other design centers the shanghai center is working on a hybrid car which is powered by a combination of a gasoline engine and an electric motor mr wagoner the gm chief has said the company will have a hybrid on the market in china by the olympics in beijing "were like the ultimate training ground in many respects for the industry in china " says raymond bierzynski president of the joint venture r&amp d center some of the talent honed by gm has ended up at shanghai automotive helping to create its roewe lineup engineers marketers and finance experts move back and forth between the joint ventures and the chinese company shanghai automotives head of research and development used to work at gm and delphi corp its head of international operations is philip murtaugh the former head of gms china operations mr murtaugh left gm in march for what were described as "personal reasons " his duties include overseeing a south korean auto maker in which shanghai automotive holds a majority stake in shanghai automotive bought blueprints and production rights to the rover model from mg rover group after mg rover folded many of its engineers went to work for shanghai automotive they worked side by side with chinese engineers first to recraft the rover for the chinese market and now to design new cars "weve made very rapid progress " says david lindley a rover veteran who heads engineering for shanghai automotives own brand technical center mr lindley points to the narrow space between the hood and the top of the front fender "the old rover had a big gap here " he says "the cars made by saic are much better " why "a lot of the engineers have come from the joint ventures " while shanghai automotive had said it might start exporting vehicles to britain as early as this year mr hu the chairman is now more circumspect he says exporting is a "long term strategy " but for now the companys "top priority is the domestic market " shanghai automotive officials say they remain deeply committed to their joint ventures with gm and volkswagen they play down the potential for competition between shanghai automotives own models and those made by shanghai gm "they are two different customer bases " says zhu xiangjun a shanghai automotive spokeswoman the roewe "follows british taste its totally different from current gm design " roewe is already pulling at least some buyers away from gm such as mr li the garment company owner he found his roewe at a shanghai dealer that sits directly across the street from a large buick showroom many of the new roewe dealers across china also own dealerships for gm and volkswagen brands the roewe has luxury features such as electronic stability controls leather seats and a touch screen navigation system yuan meifa a year old construction company executive paid about &# for a black roewe last week "this cars bloodlines are really good " he says he figures shanghai automotive is good at building cars thanks to its ties to gm and volkswagen while it is also a "chinese national brand " mr yuans dealer told him hell have to wait until july for delivery because of a waiting list of more than people mr reilly the head of gms asian operations says gm was well aware from the start of chinas intentions to promote its own car makers "they didnt try to hide their aspirations " he says but gm "decided it was better to be in it "
