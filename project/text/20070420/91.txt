sign up for the e mail here the french on sunday begin the process of choosing their first president in years who isnt jacques chirac concluding a campaign that has focused on personality over ideology as much as any in the countrys recent past only three or possibly four of the official candidates stand a chance of making it to the second round of voting two weeks later and one of the final pair will almost definitely be nicolas sarkozy the conservative former interior minister best known for his hard line positions on immigration and a less than sympathetic response to unrest among the second and third generation immigrant communities on the outskirts of frances major cities in one of the last surveys out ahead of the vote a tns sofres unilog poll taken for le figaro and television channel lci indicates mr sarkozy will get of the first round vote it suggests socialist candidate segolene royal will get and that the center right candidate francois bayrou a veteran of past cabinets that included mr sarkozy will get jean marie le pen whose unrepentant hostility toward those in society he considers less than truly french shamed most of the country when he made the second election round in would get the votes of of respondents but several factors complicate any parsing of the polls not least the fact that french political surveys come with no margin of error making it hard to judge the statistical strength of their results in past elections mr le pen generally finished stronger than polls predicted in part it is thought because some of his supporters dont wish to admit it to the pollsters ms royals numbers have fluctuated throughout a series of gaffes from the candidate herself that have frustrated her strategists and as the daily liberation points out at least one poll saw a disappearance of the small margin she has over mr bayrou last month adding to the confusion most of all as the wall street journal reports is the fact that while the polling agency ipsos estimates of voters will cast their ballot in the first round significantly more than in a third say they still havent decided the center right mr bayrou whose prominence wasnt foreseen before the campaigns has been trying to profit from center leftists doubts about ms royal liberation reports he has promised to appoint a prime minister from the left assuming the parliamentary elections that follow the presidential contest allow him such a choice but the veteran socialists whose names he has floated including world trade organization chief pascal lamy havent responded positively while mr sarkozy courts mr le pens first round voters telling "those who do not like france" that theyre not obliged to stay and ms royal offers a populist potpourri of social and economic reforms mr bayrou has tried to profit from distaste generated by the other two his success at doing so some polls have indicated mr bayrou would vanquish either opponent in the second round if he makes it prompted former socialist prime minister michel rocard to suggest he and ms royal join forces but as the economist notes both refused at least ahead of the first round mr sarkozy and ms royal each decided to include a nod to the u s among their closing campaign themes apparently hoping to soften his image mr sarkozy quoted martin luther king jr s "i have a dream" speech as the new york times reports and ms royal picked a tried and true defiance of the u s that has been employed by french leaders across the political spectrum drawing cheers at a rally when she declared "we will not genuflect before george bush " nacchio guilty of insider trading one of the last big dotcom era criminal trials came to a close yesterday with the guilty verdicts on counts of insider trading for

the latest of a string of high profile prosecutions of corporate executives that it began earlier this decade " and it came with a dramatic finish for mr nacchio and his family in reading the verdicts
