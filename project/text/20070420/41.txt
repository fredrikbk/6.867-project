immigration countdown will congress actually pass immigration reform this year the debate these days is not only about policy while there are still critical issues to be decided the surprising news is that key democrats and republicans increasingly agree on the outlines of what needs to be done what could hold them and the country back is the politics of the elections in contrast to last year when there really were two starkly different visions of immigration reform on the table members of both parties are coalescing senators who are otherwise polar opposites especially jon kyl r ariz and ted kennedy d mass now agree on a fundamental tenet enforcement alone is not enough both men recognize immigration laws must be enforced on the border and in the workplace but they agree that this must be accompanied by more worker visas and a practical answer for the million illegal immigrants already here this is what people mean by "comprehensive" reform it is what president bush has long argued for and it is what as poll after poll shows most voters have come to see as the best option depending on the survey between and of the public understands that we cant solve the problem of illegal immigration without dealing with the illegal immigrants already in the country and that the best way to deal with them is to allow them to earn citizenship over time sens kyl and kennedy still disagree sharply about the terms of a comprehensive bill what exactly should illegal immigrants have to do to earn citizenship should workers who come in the future be strictly temporary or would they be allowed under some conditions to assimilate and stay permanently perhaps most important how many visas short and long term are needed to meet our economic needs through legal rather than illegal immigration the two men are working hard to arrive at a compromise first on a partisan basis and now together a small group of republicans and democrats have been meeting privately two or three times a week for several weeks this is unusual for washington ordinarily senators let their staffs sweat the details so these meetings are a measure of how badly these legislators want to reach a consensus the white house shares their urgency and has been helping drive the talks forward but the bigger question is whether the political climate leaves room for an agreement as we head into what may be one of the most contested presidential elections of our lifetime both parties are deeply divided on that question divided between members of congress who want to get to a deal this year and those who would rather exploit the issue in think of it as the battle between the dealmakers and the blame gamers just as there are would be dealmakers in both parties sens kennedy and kyl are merely the most prominent so there are a good number of equally powerful blame gamers democrats relishing the prospect of gop presidential candidates looking obstructionist as they scratch each others eyes out over immigration republicans already writing the campaign spots that pillory democrats as the "amnesty party " for every member eager to pass reform theres another who would rather see it fail and then point fingers and for every member struggling to find the sweet spot in the back room theres another waiting outside the room to say the deals not good enough to tell sens kyl and kennedy that theyve compromised too far and that it makes more political sense to hold off for a couple of years to pass a bill which camp is likely to prevail in part it depends on the back room talks if democrats and republicans can find their way to agree on an overhaul that genuinely solves the problem while taking account of both sides fundamental principles then it will be that much harder for the naysayers to shoot them down but theres also another factor another player that could be decisive and thats the public frustrated by the broken status quo and hungry to see congress get something done i know ive heard them firsthand in recent months in focus groups and other forums around the country employers who cant find enough workers to grow their businesses latinos with friends or family living in the shadows ordinary voters increasingly angry that washington cant solve the problem these voters may just grow so impatient that even the most calculating members of congress have no choice but to come through with results it may sound like a long shot its easy to be cynical about washington but sometimes even politics as usual has to give way to that other kind of politics the politics of what voters want time is running out congress probably has until august at the latest before presidential politics utterly rule out any deal but its too soon to give up hope theres still a chance that the dealmakers will outrun the blame gamers that the two parties will come together around a workable bill that solves the problem rather than go on playing political football with one of the most important issues we face ms jacoby is a senior fellow at the manhattan institute
