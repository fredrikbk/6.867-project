weekend journal review books gentle sort of land grab last harvest by witold rybczynski scribner pages &# its not just us even the founding fathers couldnt stop thinking about real estate in the long list of "injuries and usurpations" that forms the heart of the declaration of independence thomas jefferson made sure to note that king george had been busy "raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands " meaning the old tyrant was making it harder and harder for the average homeowner to trade up obstructing the administration of justice dissolving our legislatures quartering large bodies of troops without our consent these were wicked enough but trying to price us out of the real estate market you bet it was time to dissolve the bands as witold rybczynski points out in "last harvest " several of the founders were what today wed call real estate developers including george washington samuel adams patrick henry and jefferson himself the reputation of developers has taken a tumble since the time of washington who could not tell a lie to some the real estate developer is a despoiler of nature a spreader of sprawl an apostle of heedless and vulgar profiteering to others he is a modern embodiment of crony capitalism manipulating zoning rules and compliant local governments for his own enrichment to me hes the guy who re graded the neighbors lot so that my basement floods every time i water the lawn and who to this day refuses to replace the landscaping that his neanderthal subcontractors but i digress my point is the reasons to dislike developers vary widely from the political to the personal the dislike is pretty much universal however in public esteem real estate developers now rank somewhere below anna nicole smiths boyfriends though above journalists anyone who knows mr rybczynskis earlier books including wonderfully readable works on architecture and design a near perfect biography of the great landscape architect frederick law olmstead and a buoyant history of believe it or not the screwdriver will not be surprised to discover that he takes a far subtler and far more generous view of real estate development and the men who commit it an architect himself as well as a professor at the university of pennsylvania mr rybczynski is the most fair minded of writers and absolutely immune to the seductions of current wisdom in "last harvest" he tells the story of new daleville a subdivision in rural chester county pa miles west of philadelphia it makes for an improbably compelling narrative from the subdivisions earliest beginnings as a twinkle in a developers eye to its hard won consummation several years later in the summer of when the first happy family takes possession of a four bedroom cape cod with off street parking mr rybczynski was drawn to write about new daleville because of the unusual ambition of its developer joe duckworth mr rybczynski has long been a booster of new urbanism the neo traditional movement that aims to return urban and suburban planning to an earlier era of small lots narrow leafy streets walkable commercial centers and close together houses with front porches to encourage neighborliness seeding the landscape with mini colonial williamsburgs may seem like a splendid idea but so far with a handful of exceptions like the resort town of seaside and the disney designed community of celebration both in florida neo traditionalism remains mostly just an idea for reasons of economy of scale and personal preference developers and homebuyers alike remain stubbornly attached to the ideal of the s and s large houses on large lots scattered along wide streets leading to distant commercial strips accessible only by car but mr duckworth a veteran developer in his s thinks that he can make neo traditionalism pay he envisions new daleville as a tnd a traditional neighborhood development the acronym is a new urbanist coinage popularized by the movements more fervent evangelists who lucky for mr duckworth have made disciples among the municipal authorities that oversee the land he hopes to develop tim cassidy for example is both an architectural designer and a local planning commissioner generations of his family have been born and buried in the rural community around new daleville and his conversion to neo traditionalism came when developers began chewing up the land adjacent to his ancestral property "i now have a new crop of vinyl where the corn used to grow " he tells mr rybczynski messrs cassidy and duckworth are only two of the characters in this multi character story and mr rybczynski conveys their complicated motivations ranging from greed to public spiritedness to personal pique with great skill and sensitivity the painful processes involved in getting mr duckworths development designed and approved "permitted" and then built and sold might have been unbearably boring in less accomplished hands step by step we see compromises modify the urbanist ideal inexpensive vinyl siding appears in place of classier shingle and stone and fewer than a quarter of the houses end up with those neighborly front porches for mr rybczynski new daleville is an instance of what happens when ideas come to earth when an abstract view of the good life meets the real life of commerce bureaucracy and self interest but with real estate it has always been this way as mr rybczynski demonstrates through absorbing digressions on the history of development and design from th century holland to st century california "last harvest" explains why america looks the way it does those of us who arent crazy about the way it looks especially in the further reaches of exurbia will likely be unmoved by mr rybczynskis sympathetic account of mr duckworths grand ambition indeed some jaundiced readers may conclude that new daleville and other tnds are merely the means by which cunning developers try to increase the density and therefore the profit margin of their developments under cover of the snooty aesthetic of new urbanism mr rybczynski sees it otherwise for him real estate developers are more often exemplars of the entrepreneurial spirit energetic visionary nervy and above all optimistic about the country and their capacity to make it better hes such good a storyteller that he almost had me convinced and then i went to water my lawn mr ferguson is the author of "land of lincoln adventures in abes america " forthcoming from atlantic monthly press
