cut wage and benefit costs that underscores the difficulties private equity may face as it looks to invest in and turn around detroits auto industry cerberus is among the private equity firms looking to acquire daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group and the uaw has expressed skepticism over such a deal delphi bonds have taken a hit this week as talks stalled with the spread on its coupon bonds due may rising to percentage point over treasurys yesterday from monday indicating increased borrowing costs and greater skepticism people familiar with the matter said cerberus had assumed delphi would have less market value after bankruptcy than partners appaloosa and harbinger capital partners the third largest delphi shareholder had assumed these people said that in part led cerberus to demand deeper

gm spokeswoman renee rashid merem said gm "remains committed to working with delphi on an agreement that makes sense for all involved parties " uaw president ron gettelfinger also is under great pressure and faces contract negotiations with gm this year "he might squeeze a few hundred millions dollars more out of gm" for delphi but then "gm will just come back in two months during national talks and want blood for that " said a uaw official familiar with delphi talks mr gettelfinger and other union officials are worried that private equity funds will be long gone in a few years and also are resisting equity fund demands for shorter labor contracts such as for just two years said this a uaw official gm and the uaw both have indicated they want delphi talks to wrap up before uaw talks with gm ford motor co and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group begin in june delphi said yesterday it will try to amend the investment agreement and is meeting with its creditor and equity committees to discuss cerberuss likely exit it expects the creditors committee will consider taking more equity in placeto help fill in the &# billion gap left by cerberus expected departure delphi said it is "hopeful" gm will support the amended framework agreement under delphis current plan framework agreement gm would receive seven million shares of common stock and &# billion in cash and the "unconditional release of any alleged estate claims against gm " one option would be for gm to close any gap by taking more delphi shares and less cash said a person familiar with the talks although cerberus hasnt given delphi official notice of termination the company nevertheless announced the possible changes on yesteday thursday delphi said the changes dont preclude its intention to file a reorganization plan by july when its exclusive right to file a plan expires delphi said it plans to emerge from chapter later this year previously the company said it planned to emerge in midyear
