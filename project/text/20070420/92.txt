the numbers guy gun policy advocates on both sides of issue push dubious figures the virginia tech shootings have reignited the gun control debate with both sides marshalling suspect numbers gun violence "is costing this country over &# billion a year " new york rep carolyn mccarthy who is pushing tougher gun control laws said this week on cnbc citing the gun control advocacy group brady campaign the brady campaign in turn cites research by duke economist philip j cook and georgetown public policy professor jens ludwig but the estimate based on a phone survey isnt a direct measure of cost the researchers used a technique called contingent valuation in which they surveyed respondents about how much theyd pay for a reduction in gun violence extrapolating the survey results to the general population they concluded that americans are willing to pay &# billion for that outcome extending that to a theoretical reduction of gun violence and factoring in the costs of suicide and injury by firearm profs cook and ludwig arrive at &# billion the researchers themselves noted drawbacks to their technique they were measuring willingness to pay for a decrease it isnt clear whether people would pay at the same rate for further reductions more fundamentally the willingness to pay or wtp method assumes survey respondents can quantify the value of a public good and trusts them to give honest answers to a hypothetical that may prod them to present themselves favorably most economists agree "that none of the available methods for measuring wtp are entirely satisfactory " profs cook and ludwig write in their paper another argument for gun control the u s has the most gun murders per capita in the western world three of people annually that claim holds if the western world is defined as the u s and western europe if latin america and eastern europe are included then slovakia el salvador albania costa rica uruguay and mexico all had higher gun murder rates in a recent year according to the latest u n figures the u n cautions that the figures are self reported and as a basis for comparison between countries are "highly problematic " meanwhile opponents of gun control have written online commentaries claiming that americans use guns million times yearly in defense against crime the number originates in research more than a decade old conducted by florida state criminologists gary kleck and marc gertz they conducted a phone survey of defensive gun use asking respondents if they or members of their household had used guns in self defense and extrapolated their findings to the general population defensive gun use or dgu doesnt necessarily mean the gun was fired which happens in relatively few of these incidents the researchers found prof kleck cites as corroboration for his findings a survey conducted by profs cook and ludwig for the police foundation a washington law enforcement research group yet those two researchers concluded that their own numbers and prof klecks are inflated they explain that surveys can inflate results for rare events the logic goes like this some people who engaged in dgu will deny it to surveyors while others will invent it because dgus are rare by any estimate the latter group is a far greater pool of potential liars so even if the lying rate is lower in that group false positives could outweigh false negatives prof kleck countered in an email that surveys typically underestimate controversial behavior and that criticisms of his research show the critics own bias toward undercounting another number that has emerged from the antigun control camp ties multiple victim public shootings to restrictions on carrying concealed weapons john lott jr visiting professor at suny binghamton and university of chicago economist william landes counted references to multiple public shootings more than one killed or wounded at one time in the lexis nexis news database for a book they matched trends from to with right to carry laws and found that when states allowed the carrying of concealed weapons the rate of these attacks declined by but another study published in in the journal homicide studies found "virtually no support for the hypothesis that the laws increase or reduce the number of mass public shootings " this later study counted only shootings with four or more murders used fbi crime data to supplement news reports and unlike the lott landes work included shootings that were byproducts of other crimes such as gang murders grant duwe a researcher on the later study said the news archive approach was likely incomplete because the media dont always give publicity to multiple shootings prof lott wrote in an email that he counted less severe incidents to get enough data for statistically significant results he justifies his exclusion of gang murders because gun usage by chronic criminals "would not be directly affected by the passage of right to carry laws " that seems to be precisely the reason to include them for a full picture of the effect of these laws of course the complete picture frequently goes missing in this debate email me at numbersguy wsj com read more about these gun
