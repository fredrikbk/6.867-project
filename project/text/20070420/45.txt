in indonesia a fight for soy sauce crown heinz unilever view condiment as entry into lucrative market jakarta indonesia when h j heinz co snapped up a majority stake in indonesian soy sauce maker abc in it had visions of expanding its product line and rolling across parts of asia on a river of the black condiment but two years later unilever nvs indonesian unit bought a majority stake in bango the countrys no soy sauce maker and heinz was drawn into a battle with the global consumer goods giant a dutch british company with much deeper roots in the worlds most populous muslim nation soy sauce is believed to have been taken by chinese traders across asia and the rest of the world today soy sauce generates about &# billion in global sales every year both unilever and heinz see their indonesian soy sauce businesses as an entree into the hearts and minds of indonesias working and middle classes but heinzs abc has been losing market share to unilevers bango and now it is at a turning point while heinz has scaled back its global soy sauce ambitions the pittsburgh company says abc has nonetheless emerged as its most profitable asian business the brand generates &# million in annual sales world wide mostly in indonesia even nelson peltz the dissident heinz shareholder who picked up two board seats last year has stopped agitating the company to consider divesting itself of abc heinz with a market capitalization of about &# billion doesnt disclose how much of its sales come from asia however it says sales in china indonesia and india its largest asian markets are growing at double digit percentage rates and that its "emerging markets" business is expected to account for &# billion in sales in its fiscal year but abcs share of indonesias &# million soy sauce market fell to in from in while bangos nearly tripled to in the same period according to market research firm euromonitor international heinz challenges that analysis saying its market share has remained steady and noting that abcs sales and profit have doubled since heinz bought its stake abc is hoping to maintain its place by tapping the growing number of indonesians buying frozen pizzas canned sardines and shrimp pastes in a variety of forms one recent morning monica s solichien abcs head of research and development stood in the kitchen of fara kuswandari as the year old housewife tossed chopped onions garlic and chili peppers into a skillet next came meatballs and boiled noodles then a slathering of kecap manis as thick sweet soy sauce is known here ms kuswandari who began cooking regularly after leaving her job as an accountant to care for her young daughter swirled the concoction with a spoon "tastes good i hope " she said nervously putting the spoon to her lips ms solichien peppered ms kuswandari with questions seeking insight into her daily routine there are essentially two types of soy sauce kecap manis a molasses thick sauce often sweetened with palm sugar and kecap asin a thin salty sauce when abcs kecap asin was introduced in the mid s it was sold in a glass bottle at a premium price eventually abc expanded into kecap manis as well as lower price smaller plastic bottles and single use packets that now cost about rupiah two u s cents helping it develop a loyal following among working class rural indonesians heinzs acquisition in came on the heels of southeast asias financial crisis but heinz executives quickly learned they had underestimated the potential to extend the abc brand in indonesia both in soy sauce and other higher margin packaged food products such as chili canned sardines and a line of flavored beverages popular among indonesian youth it accelerated the brands expansion but exporting abc soy sauce to other markets particularly china proved a tougher proposition china is a highly competitive market and soy sauce taste preferences are as varied as those in indonesia after unilever bought bango the brand used unilevers extensive distribution network to move beyond jakarta and quickly began stealing market share from abc and smaller soy sauce companies facing bangos threat in abc hired ms solichien as technical services director overseeing research and development ms solichien studied chemical engineering and food technology at iowa state university before spending nearly a decade at one of indonesias largest food companies she recalls her surprise at how disorganized abc seemed employees for instance kept recipes in their heads she ordered them to write down the recipes so each batch of soy sauce would be consistent and hired experts in product packaging soybeans and chili her team began studying indonesian housewives one insight abcs soy sauce was saltier than bangos too salty for some consumers abc spent six months tweaking the kecap manis formula reducing the salt dosage and increasing levels of other spices such as licorice last november abc hired iriana ekasari muazd as its marketing director snatching her away from unilever she gave abcs packaging its first upgrade in nearly years the new pouch has a metallic finish to stand out on store shelves one top corner is designed to control the flow of soy sauce so it doesnt spill next month unilever will fire its latest volley in the soy sauce war bango will start selling rupiah soy sauce packets nationwide it has also shortened the soy sauce name to "kecap" from "kecap bango " aiming to position the bango brand to move beyond soy sauce but abc will have to work harder to win back consumers such as darsini a year old department store cosmetics clerk who like many indonesians uses only one name for years ms darsini used abcs kecap manis but after seeing bangos ads she switched "the taste of bango is blended not too salty not too sweet " she said one humid afternoon standing in a jakarta market between rows of cardamom and lemon pepper and slabs of raw beef bangos premium price isnt an issue "whats important is the taste " she said adding "im loyal "
