friars who owned polluted mine get all sorts of help they risked costly fines over arizona toxic waste prayer and a good lawyer gila county ariz when brother tom nichols treasurer of the franciscan friars of california inc first hiked to the deserted gibson mine here in he was shocked by what he saw junked cars rusting barrels piles of mine debris and old tunnels oozing a bright turquoise copper containing acid into nearby streams the friars had inherited partial ownership of the mine in from a donor who said it had great "potential for the future " over the years operators had leased the land miles east of phoenix and then abandoned it the friars who got a small income from the operations had rarely thought about the mine but now the state was threatening to sue them over the mess brother nichols returned to oakland calif where the order is based and showed his superiors pictures of a turquoise stream containing sulfuric acid that could dissolve barbed wire copper levels exceeded toxic limits by times "this is not your typical alpine lake " the year old former electrician told them the friars who take a vow of poverty and spend much of their time helping the poor had little money but praying was an option "we turned this whole issue over to a higher power " explains father melvin jurisich the provincial minister of the franciscans "it was our deep conviction that if we did the right thing we would be helped " more than abandoned mines scar the west and pollute of its streams according to the u s environmental protection agency the mines which once produced gold silver copper and other valuable minerals are called "hardrock" to distinguish them from coal mines theyre also known as orphans because their owners often declare bankruptcy or disappear once theyre finished excavating "its done all the time " mike ford the franciscans lawyer told brother nichols the owners the lawyer said dont want to bear the cost or the risk that theyll do the cleanup wrong and be hit with big government penalties abandonment brother nichols knew was not a route that the franciscans could take they were followers of st francis of assisi the th century italian who said that man has a profound "kinship" with the land and must protect it and its creatures the order would have to find a way to clean up the mine but it wasnt clear how low copper prices made it impossible to sell the mine six other part owners were theoretically liable but most were living in nursing homes and had little money the franciscans use most of their money to help the poor in san francisco "weve operated in the red ever since ive been here " explains brother nichols who joined the order in "we always rely on people making donations to us to help us survive " mr ford a year old partner in phoenix at the bryan cave law firm began representing the friars in donating his time to the cause mr ford who is catholic urged the franciscans to take full responsibility to get maximum leeway in negotiations with the half dozen government agencies monitoring the effort and he persuaded the other owners to hand over their stakes in exchange for being relieved of liability he also asked other clients of his firm to help as a result crews from metal management inc a chicago recycler spent a week at the mine removing junk free of charge "this was a community effort for the franciscan fathers " says kenneth p mueller president of the companys arizona branch meanwhile arizona began thinking twice about suing the friars "who in the world wants to go out after a bunch of franciscan friars " says steve owens director of arizonas department of environmental quality instead the state awarded them more than &# in grants to clean up area streams as a condition of the grants the franciscans were required to explain the cleanup project at a community meeting in nearby miami ariz while brother nichols wore jeans and hiking boots at the mine he put on the orders familiar plain brown robe and leather sandals for the meeting jeb l dalmolin general manager of a family owned excavation company says that his father attended the meeting and was reminded of the history of the franciscans who established a chain of th century missions in california that helped settle the west mr dalmolin at his fathers urging later agreed to move truckloads of the mine material at a discount the companys profit margin was "slim to none " he says "but when my dads impressed im naturally happy " the cheapest place to haul the stuff was to bhp billiton the huge australian british mining company which owns a mine site close to gibson mine bhp at first refused to take the waste after copper prices began to rise the company opened its gates tracey t whitehead a company representative said it was part of bhps "community relations and environmental plan " last year carlota copper co donated &# for the disposal of the mines most toxic debris that happened after carlota was bought by quadra mining ltd a vancouver based mining company edward kirwan a quadra vice president said he hoped the donation would encourage the state to allow it to expand nearby mining operations but he adds the company would have "put up some portion" of the grant in any case "you figure if you want to make it with the big guy " he says "you better get in good" with brother nichols some arizonans werent so well disposed to the friar tom hale a neighboring rancher was so furious that debris leached cooper into streams whenever it rained that he refused to let the friars cross his property to get to the site he didnt budge until threatened with a lawsuit "these guys may go away some day and youre left with colored water and property that has no value " he says today an estimated &# million cleanup of the mine is almost complete mr owens the head of arizonas environmental agency calls it a "win win" situation for the state and the environment pejman eshraghi who managed the cleanup for brown &amp caldwell an environmental engineering firm that also worked for the franciscans at discounted rates says it was more than that "bringing all these things together was nothing short of a miracle i dont care what faith you practice " the franciscans say they plan to turn the mine site into a real estate development to recoup the &# of their own money that they spent on the cleanup much of that money was generated by the sale of donated desert land that once appeared worthless but gained value during last years frenzied housing boom around phoenix walking through the newly uncluttered mine site brother nichols says he can sense that st francis would be pleased "the earth is appreciating being unburdened " he says
