weekend journal review television unexpected gifts made for tv films about characters like the crew in "after thomas" a disabled child a troubled family and a dog tend to raise apprehensions mainly

monday p m edt the thomas of the title is the dog an irresistible key character though not the kind that inspired the old bit of actors wisdom which warns against working with children or animals neither the dog nor the child here manages much upstaging of the adults parents flailing away at each other and at the misery of a once happy life reduced to an exhausting struggle to get through a day with their severely autistic child kyle the film establishes early the grim nature of that life in all its chaos and stunted hopes not even the bond between two intelligent and loving parents nicola keeley hawes and rob graham ben miles is proof against the exhaustion and fear poisoning their lives for rob existence with kyle andrew byrne is no life at all its a holding action against the constant threat of emergency it takes after all only a word whose sound he doesnt like to throw his unreachable child into violent tantrums the same is true for nicola who nonetheless persists in hapless efforts to train kyle to adapt to a normal world the films opening scene renders the reality shes up against with a fearsome clarity nicola has gone forth to buy six year old kyle new shoes an encounter that soon has him screaming and kicking with a ferocity that continues as nicola wrestles him out of the store and down the streets matters dont improve when they get home either theres only

mother pat sheila hancock an optimist suggests getting a dog enter the golden retriever puppy to be named thomas after kyles favorite train engine thomas may not steal scenes exactly but no ones eyes are going to wander from this creature once he hits the screen first as a pup and then as a grown dog all that follows from his entry on the scene testifies to the skill behind this production director simon shore writer lindsey hill which goes on to the end extracting life and even suspense from the most predictable of circumstances in "after thomas" nothing feels predictable even given a theme as reliably sunny as a boy and his dog no small tribute to this gem of a film gen william tecumseh shermans travels through georgia are among the least obscure events in civil war history but
