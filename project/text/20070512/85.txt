has candidates scrambling for position by jackie calmes senate majority leader harry reid is sticking by his plan to bring an immigration bill to the senate floor next week over republican objections sparking a debate that will spread beyond the capitol and roil the presidential fields especially the republicans with the white house and congressional leaders unable for months to cut a deal on an issue president bush hopes to resolve as a legacy democrat reid of nevada is seeking to force action by making good on an earlier vow for a vote before memorial day he will bring up the same comprehensive measure tougher border enforcement steps along with citizenship paths for illegal immigrants already here that the senate passed by a bipartisan margin last year it died amid an impasse with the house but the politics have changed mightily since then republicans never warm to mr bushs and businesses zeal to accommodate the mostly hispanic illegals in the country lost their house and senate majorities last november one factor was anti immigration fever among many republican and independent voters even senators who sponsored last years bill now concede it must be toughened prominent among them is arizonas sen john mccain the republican so active last year with democrat edward kennedy of massachusetts has been largely absent in recent talks as he campaigns for his partys presidential nomination sen chris dodd of connecticut campaigning recently in iowa to be the democrats nominee tweaked mr mccain for being m i a and potentially dooming the effort a mccain adviser

illegal immigrants front runner rudy giuliani from immigrant rich new york showed his liberal colors on the issue by identifying with reaganite optimism to "solve our immigration issue including illegal immigration from our strengths not our weaknesses " even more than mr mccain mr giuliani has been on the defensive among conservatives as mayor he directed city employees schools and hospitals to serve everyone regardless of immigration status as for mr mccain he emphasized at the first debate that on immigration "im proud to work with" mr bush this issue is a dicey one for democrats too if not so much as for republicans they dont want to anger hispanics whose anger at hard line republicans has dashed mr bushs hopes of enticing them into his party yet many democratic voters including some in organized labor are upset with illegal immigration the field includes new mexico gov bill richardson who seeks to be the nations first hispanic president
