colombias media scorn gores ridiculous actions in regard to mary anastasia ogradys april americas column "one righteous gringo" i was in bogota recently where there were numerous articles in the newspapers and magazines decrying the ridiculous actions by former vice president al gore the conclusion reached by the colombian media is that mr gore is more concerned about his run for the presidency or a possible nobel peace prize than he is about truly helping the environment and supporting the president of colombia who has done more for democracy in south america and more for the environment via the fight against narco criminals than any other person how sad that a former vice president would choose to turn his back on a leader who has transformed a country that a little over five years ago was so dangerous that one could not leave the capital without fear of kidnapping or death into a vibrant thriving democracy i am deeply saddened when i know that someone supposedly as smart as mr gore is not wise enough to see through the typical south american politics at play here as a gringo myself i believe in the future of colombia and i know that while we in the u s may have the luxury of choosing whether or not to help fight the war on drugs the people of colombia have no choice they have to fight or they will be doomed to a life of misery and death as was seen in the pre uribe years we have an obligation to support this country with a strong free trade agreement because after all its the gringos in this country with insatiable appetites for drugs who have caused so much misery for this people lewis r fisher irvine calif
