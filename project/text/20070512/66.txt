pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations everything old is new again who woke up old europe france ireland and england this week showed us the future they were the center of the new it looked good we can learn from them first ireland which tuesday formalized a peace that most who love that country would not have thought possible in our lifetimes and it was barely noticed as sometimes happens with good news but the protestants and catholics of northern ireland ratified a power sharing agreement in which they will govern together and forswear violence everyone knew it was coming the voters had backed it yet the sight of it the ulstermen and catholics standing together in the stormont and the words took ones breath away here is year old ian paisley the unionist firebrand whose life was shaped by his passionate advocacy for the protestants and against the ira there was pain in the past he said but "that was yesterday this is today and tomorrow will be tomorrow from the depths of my heart i can say to you today that i believe northern ireland has come to a time of peace a time when hate will no longer rule " what a way to mark the new century what an example for the world we learn what we already know and need always to be reminded breakthroughs can happen even in the oldest most tortured conflicts hearts change so much of irelands energy the past hundred years the past has gone to conflict what will that energy go to now what will it make it will be exciting to see in france it was a spirited political fight one with meaning purpose and perhaps promise socialist segolene royal attempted to become the first female french president nicolas sarkozy attempted to be the first serious conservative president in generations at issue how to make france modern how to wake it up and make it new again she said she could bring reform with "calm and serenity " he said greater vigor is needed and a break with the past cut taxes cut government leave more room for markets they were not tweedledum and tweedledumber it comes as a relief to admire france again and not only or even primarily for the comparative wisdom of its choosing the conservative its how they did it a short and intense campaign between candidates who were impressive interesting historic voter turnout and the great debate watched by million people who learned in all this france showed style in the deepest sense of a manner a spirit an approach revealing of character and aspirations the debate wasnt guys in ties in a row it was a man and a woman sitting face to face across a table they were eyeball to eyeball and you got to see who blinked the moderators were modest in the background not the star even the two candidates were not the star what they think and who they are was the star at one point as they disagreed on the facts of the mainstreaming of exceptional children ms royal accused mr sarkozy of "the height of political immorality" and of "lying " she said she was "scandalized" and "very angry " she meant to show her steel puncture his imperturbability and reveal his rumored dark temper look what happened sarkozy calm yourself madame royal no i will not calm down sarkozy you need to be calm to be president of the republic i dont know why mrs royal who is normally so calm has lost her cool royal i have not lost my cool i am angry sometimes it is right and healthy to be angry the president of the republic should be angry at injustice sarkozy you fly off the handle very easily it was a clever flipping of intent he showed her temper watching it you could imagine unseen subtitles i did not call you a liar monsieur liarface i did not call you emotional madame hotflash ms royals frustration and the look she got when she realized shed dug a hole was as revealing as mr sarkozys enjoyment of the inflicting of pain he seemed to show a mild version of that great old word of french derivation sadism madame royal is not madame rodham france is not america and too much is being made of the parallels with hillary clinton but the french race might have shown a certain rough template for how to puncture mrs clintons persistent air of inevitability and for one big reason what mr sarkozy had going for him in the debate is that he was not afraid of ms royal because she was a woman he was not undone by her femininity american candidates seem much more awkward in this area when up against a strong woman male candidates dont know what is appropriate and standard political aggression and what is ungentlemanly bullying mr sarkozy was not afraid or tentative he was poised he seemed to think he was facing a formidable adversary and it didnt matter whether it was a man or a woman it mattered that she was a socialist and socialism isnt helpful and so he approached her as a person who is wrong she was not afraid of the boy he was not afraid of the girl he granted her no particular mystique she granted him no particular advantage they were appropriate mr sarkozy also did something with ms royal that might be usefully remembered by mrs clintons foes ms royal when the unexpected happened "calm down " showed she wasnt so good at improvising she didnt react with any tactical grace this reminded me of mrs clinton who also seems unsure and unsteady when pushed off script or put at the mercy of happenstance she cant rely on her instincts because deep down she knows her instincts are no match for her will shes not light on her feet her foes would do well to keep this in mind finally in england this week tony blair gracefully announced the end of his downing street rule he returned to his old district sedgefield where hed begun his career and spoke of what he honestly felt hed done right and what he knew hed done wrong or unsuccessfully he spoke of the personal and yet higher context of his journey as he called it "sometimes the only way you conquer the pull of power is to set it down " he leaves as he presided with spirit and dignity an example to american political figures and one would hope an inspiration so peace passion and a bit of profundity it is good to see old europe rock a bow to their excellence is in order
