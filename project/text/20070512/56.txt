politics &amp economics a fuel gold rush fires up california plan spurs race for new ethanols madera calif gov arnold schwarzeneggers plan to reduce co is sparking a gold rush as energy companies and entrepreneurs race to develop alternative fuels for a piece of the states &# billion fuel market many scientists and environmentalists believe the contest to develop a fuel resulting in less carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will be won by businesses that go beyond corn based ethanol the states new fuel standard to take effect in is a big part of californias drive to lower greenhouse gases that scientists say cause global warming about of the states emissions come from vehicles mr schwarzenegger unveiled the plan in january directing that the carbon content of passenger vehicle fuels be reduced by at least a tenth by though the regulations are still being drafted oil companies will have to show the carbon content of their fuel is dropping starting in those that cant meet the standard might be able to buy credits from producers who sell low carbon fuel under the plan market forces will decide which alternative fuel producers win or lose when it comes to helping the oil companies meet the new standard "i think of it as a boxing ring " said david crane special adviser to mr schwarzenegger one contender is bill jones chairman of pacific ethanol inc his company once scavenged spoiled beer to make ethanol in this state where little corn is grown more recently it built californias first modern ethanol refinery here in the fertile san joaquin valley he figures that to meet mr schwarzeneggers target the state would soon have to raise the ethanol blend to of most gasoline sold from the current "that will make a lot of room for additional production out here " he said two of the biggest oil companies selling fuel in the state bp plc and chevron corp hope to leapfrog mr jones by mounting big research programs to find ways to make ethanol out of such things as elephant grass and wood chips the companies contend that these materials would score much better than ethanol in terms of how much carbon emissions are created by renewable fuels other contenders are betting on converting vehicles to burn natural gas california which taken alone ranks as the worlds sixth largest economy once was skeptical of corn based ethanol but it now consumes more of the stuff than any other state it is likely to scarf up still more because corn ethanol appears to be the easiest near term way to meet the governors carbon reduction goal more effective low carbon products may be on the way a team of scientists is tracking the life cycle of alternative fuels to see how much oil and coal is consumed in making them daniel sperling a professor at the university of california at davis said the effort is being guided by new studies that show carbon emissions from farming practices used to grow corn "can be quite large " according to him and other state experts corn is the source of of the nations ethanol fertilizers used to grow corn release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other warming gases during planting season according to the studies the studies also show that some ethanol refineries now burn coal resulting in more total emissions than are created by the gasoline that the fuel is supposed to replace the state is expected to use these studies to make a ranking of low carbon fuels those that require the consumption of large amounts of oil gas and coal in their manufacture will earn oil companies fewer credits toward their required cut in carbon based fuels robert sawyer chairman of californias air resources board which will implement mr schwarzeneggers new standard thinks that "cellulosic ethanol " which is made by breaking out the sugar from the fibrous structure of plants could emerge as an option "were really keen to find something that works " he said how mr schwarzeneggers energy policy plays out is being closely watched in europe which has called for a similar low carbon standard and in washington where congress is weighing president bushs proposal to mandate the use of billion gallons of alternative fuels by mr bushs proposal intended primarily to reduce the nations dependence on imported oil could push new fossil fuels such as oil made from coal and oil shale californias edict discourages them mr jones thinks his ethanol retains an edge because though it is made from corn hauled in from iowa his refinery produces a byproduct a wet mash that is fed to dairy cows in lieu of the original corn this might allow him to claim more credits than other ethanol producers because the corn he is using is still going toward feeding cows so the fertilizer and fuel used to make the ethanol may not count as much against him bp thinks it has a more renewable solution steven koonin bps chief scientist said that counting all the oil and gas used to make corn based ethanol the average gallon of ethanol lowers carbon emissions compared with gasoline his company is donating &# million to the university of california at berkeley to create a laboratory whose goal is to commercialize cellulosic ethanol which he said could reduce carbon emissions one source bp has in mind for replacing corn is elephant grass one of the worlds fastest growing plants it requires little or no fertilizer "ideally we would like some quick wins but if we saw something on a five year time scale wed be delighted " mr koonin said chevron meanwhile has formed a partnership with weyerhaeuser co the big forest products company based in federal way wash to develop a "brand new energy crop " said rick zalesky a technology manager for chevron possibilities include wood chips or a perennial plant called switch grass both of which could yield low carbon ethanol "the world is going to begin to see these things within five years " he predicted even t boone pickens the legendary oil man has thrown his hat in the ring he is the biggest shareholder in clean energy fuels corp a seal beach calif company that sells natural gas to fuel buses trash trucks and taxicabs converted to burn it because it generates a fourth less carbon emissions than gasoline natural gas will earn the company credits said clean energy president andrew littlefair under the emerging california program companies with credits probably will be able to sell them to oil companies that may need them to meet the states new standard "that will help us expand this further " said mr littlefair referring to the natural gas stations the company already operates in california see related letter "letters to the editor ethanols lower mpg and energy output" wsj may
