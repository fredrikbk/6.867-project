pursuits sports golf journal better than augusta our writer played there but heres how a scruffy local course topped it my first three rounds of golf in couldnt be more different one round was royally high end to say the least another was at a friends respectable but not lavish home course the third took place on what some might describe as a cow pasture but that might be an insult to cows ill remember all three with affection the last maybe even more than the other two that crystallizes for me something special about golf its a great leveler it doesnt matter where you play or how good you are sometimes when you return home to see the parents and eat a mom made dinner it can be just as wonderful as a meal made by a four star chef maybe even more so this sport that some consider elitist can be about as democratic as it gets as a a milne the creator of winnie the pooh and an oft quoted sage in my household once wrote "golf is so popular simply because it is the best game in the world at which to be bad " a bad golfer can better his normal score by just a shot or two and be walking on air similarly while its a treat to play the name courses sometimes an afternoon walking with a caddie down a perfectly manicured fairway isnt as fun as a casual evening carrying your own bag at a scruffy muni with your friends to that end my first round of golf this year was in january with a former journal printing plant manager in orlando he picked me up at the airport and we headed straight to the first tee of his home course bypassing even the driving range the two of us hacked around neither writing down a score at our ages numbers already take up too much of our lives and while i play fast i couldnt keep up with my friend who often teed off before i could pick out a club i hit the ball about as you might expect for the middle of winter and not so fresh from three hours cramped in coach but neither of us cared lothar wanted to hear the latest office gossip and i was happy to be stealing a round so early in the year my next round dont hate me was last month at augusta national golf club this was of course a lifelong dream of mine and about a billion other golfers i played with three other members of the media all of us picked in the lottery the club holds to play on the monday after the masters rules officials and other invitees accounted for the rest of the or so lucky golfers we played the same hole locations that the pros had played the day before the gallery ropes were already gone a good thing the way i was driving the ball the caddies in their white jumpsuits and the drive down magnolia lane to the clubhouse did plenty to jangle my nerves we spent much of the time talking about masters highlights the larry mize chip in and now the zach johnson chip to inches the tiger woods chip on greg normans collapses the arnold palmer charges jack nicklauss bear tracks and everything else that most every golfer knows in his dreams conjuring up such moments didnt help my game we played from the members tees making the course about yards shorter than the one the pros had played on the seventh hole at the tournament i had watched from the crowd as davis love iii left his long putt up the hill about feet short the following day with the same putt i wanted to better mr loves feeble effort of course i powered my ball up the hill over the crest and completely off the green gaining some insight into why "dl three" had been so tentative but while he was visibly disgusted with his bogey five i reveled in my double bogey six for perverse reasons only golfers can understand this is the first story i tell when asked how my round went and my golfing faux pas came after the greens were heavily watered overnight and not cut that monday morning those guys are good perhaps the strangest thing about following so close behind such good golfers was finding spike marks on the greens spikes are still allowed on the tour but theyve long been banned from the greens where we normal golfers hack around while i made a footer for bogey on hole i missed a ton of short putts and it was fun to have the spike marks to blame again after the club had a buffet for us in the stately but simple clubhouse grillroom we stirred our drinks with green stirrers shaped like golf clubs the augusta national napkins were thicker than the towels at my aiken s c hotel that week i was literally and figuratively breathing it all in my score for the day wasnt particularly important my third round was with my middle son brian who has been playing golf for nine years and was disappointed that i played augusta without him he can belt a good one about yards we played at a nine hole iowa flat course with no yardage markers this years masters champ who describes himself as "a normal guy" from cedar rapids has never played there its a field basically all of yards greenskeeping is too lofty a term for course maintenance here as we stood on the first tee brian admitted to some nerves having to hit in front of the other golfers i calmed him down by telling him that everyone else was nervous about embarrassing themselves in front of such a young kid once off the tee and brians tee shot was better than most we walked down the fairway my son and i we were happy to be with each other on a golf course score didnt matter here either now as summer approaches in the northeast the regular group is starting to play the early bird sunday nine holes before church there of course score means everything john paul newport is off email golfjournal wsj com
