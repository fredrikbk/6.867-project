actually i did say what i shouldve said in his interesting commentary "blame america first" editorial page may stephen rademaker states that "those who in essence agree with the views of a noam chomsky that the united states has led the way in refusal to abide by the article vi obligations of the nonproliferation treaty need to explain why they are not similarly exercised by the failure of all other npt states to satisfy their article vi nuclear disarmament provisions " what i should have written then is that "none of the nuclear states has met its obligations" under the npt and that as long as all the nuclear states reject their obligations "it is unlikely that the bargain will be sustained " as i did clearly and unambiguously right in the same passage i should also have gone on to explain in detail the basis for the conclusion which will surprise no one familiar with the mainstream literature that the bush administration "has led the way" as i also did contrary to mr rademakers charges and innuendos while also refuting other remarkable statements in his article admittedly truth would not have conformed to the story line but it may have some other merits noam chomsky institute professor retired massachusetts institute of technology cambridge mass
