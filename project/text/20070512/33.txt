encore a special report quiet exhilaration adventures in later life can come in all shapes and sizes by most ordinary measures you could say i flunked adventure travel id had doubts when dear friends in california suggested that my husband and i join them on a two week eco tour of costa ricas biological preserves last winter the trip brochures warned it was not for the feeble our schedule would be fast paced and we should be prepared to walk two or three hours a day who was i kidding since undergoing cancer surgery seven years ago id been propelled ahead into old age a painful spinal deformity left me now at age winded after pushing a cart of groceries around a wal mart my exercise routine consisted mainly of an aquatic rehab program at the gym simply holding myself upright could be taxing inside however i still had the wanderlust of a teenager costa rica had long been on our list of dream trips and the rare chance to see our faraway friends was an added inducement to go would mean i had not completely succumbed to my disability wrestling with such decisions is an inevitable part of aging to varying degrees we begin to make small accommodations to advancing years handing over the heavy garden work to a strapping teenage neighbor say or deciding its finally time to give up downhill skiing in my experience none of these concessions comes without an internal battle too often they feel like defeats costa rica would be my proving ground i finally decided where id test my remaining endurance and perhaps surprise myself so we stuffed our backpacks with collapsible hiking staffs mosquito netting and even some glue id found in the drugstore for emergency repair of a broken tooth and took off in a february snowstorm by afternoon we were in the airy lobby of our san jose hotel sipping tropical smoothies our fellow travelers mostly retirees in their s were a genial intrepid bunch some were old hands at the adventure travel game with visits to nearly countries notched in their belts it was abundantly clear that i was out of my league the first sign of trouble came on day three when the plan called for rafting the rapids of the rio sarapiqui in costa ricas central highlands id pumped myself up for a thrill ride only to be told by the river guide that i couldnt go because my physical limitations made me a poor risk for the trip fine i reasoned they were being responsibly cautious the following day we split into two groups for an uphill climb through the lush rainforest traversing a rickety foot suspension bridge over the sarapiqui i brought up the rear most of the way and by hikes end i was seriously winded and near collapse sputtering apologies and reluctant to recite my full medical history to this clutch of near strangers i cringed to see their obvious puzzlement and concern needing rest i bailed out of that afternoons tour of a pineapple plantation the others reported back that they had never tasted fruit as ambrosial as what they had sampled that day peak experiences were slipping by me one morning we suited up in crash helmets and leather harnesses for the much touted high point of the trip flying through the forest canopy on a zipline again a washout i couldnt make it up the mountain to the jumping off point "at least you tried " our friend bill said gently as we slunk back to the lodge i was not the sole casualty one woman was hobbled by a broken toe and another injured her tailbone on a water slide during the hot springs excursion but an ebullient year old widow seemed to have no difficulty participating fully and every evening one couple took an extra hike to reach their personal goal of steps a day my plight aroused the sympathies of a retired nurse in our group along with our costa rican guide she rushed to my side when i became the only turista in our party to be felled by a stomach bug waves of nausea overtook me later that morning when we gathered in a pungent smelling barnyard to watch a farmer process sugar cane with a team of oxen when i tried to make a dash for the bus across the corral i found myself face to face with a huge untethered bull could this get any worse i wondered as our guide frog marched me to safety later my husband happened to mention how on an earlier vacation i had to be airlifted out of the yukon wilderness during an allergy attack one man in our group remarked "ellen youre beginning to sound pretty high maintenance " indeed my public outing as a weakling was especially galling at home comfortable in my predictable everyday routines i could usually fake it convincing the world and myself that my limitations were fairly trifling here there was nowhere to hide it was at this low point that i discovered why id come one night we were offered an after dinner "bat tour " most of the group squeamish hit the bar or turned in early a few of us opted for the naturalists talk to my surprise i found myself eagerly volunteering to hold a small rather ugly bat even though i have always disliked being close to fluttery creatures whether butterflies birds or bats i watched the bat slurp up sugar water with a cat like pink tongue i felt its incredibly soft wing membrane and was astonished to see that the bone structure of each transparent wing resembled a human hand and then i released it gently and watched it flutter off into the dense jungle it may seem like a small thing but my encounter with that bat taught me that exhilaration so important in jogging us out of ruts can come upon us quietly yes the adrenaline rush of swinging through trees or shooting rapids makes us feel vibrantly alive but so does the act of trying something new and difficult that winds up changing how we view the world the bat and i were mere specks in the cosmos yet each of us was intricately designed and obviously connected by mastering my fear of an unfairly maligned little mammal i got a firsthand sense of natures staggering abundance and interdependence best of all this was a thrill that required no stamina whatsoever indeed i probably would have skipped the experience entirely had i been fit enough to spend the day on an exhausting hike from that night on i began to relax and savor more sedentary pleasures notably the visual feast all around us one morning it was the sight of eight yellow billed toucans perched in a row on the lodge bird feeder then it was the all night pyrotechnics of an erupting volcano and everywhere there was vegetation worthy of jurassic park with cascades of fiery blossoms and ferns the size of cars back home my doctors and i have concluded that rugged globe trotting is probably no longer in the cards for me thats a big loss but an enchanted night in the costa rican jungle convinced me ill still have adventures and i wont have to break a sweat ms graham is a writer in virginia she can be reached at encore wsj com
