pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings short is good the concise joys of condensed books and the virtues of brevity new york orion books one of englands top publishing houses has just brought out the first six titles in a series of abridged versions of such classic novels as "anna karenina " "moby dick" and "vanity fair " the covers of these paperbacks which have been shortened by as much as bill their contents as "compact editions " "david copperfield in half the time " as one entry promises malcolm edwards the series publisher told a times of london reporter that "many regular readers think of the classics as long slow and to be frank boring " not surprisingly orion has been taking a beating from british highbrows "its completely ridiculous a daft idea " one london bookseller told the times "how can you edit the classics " daft it may be but no less a literary light than somerset maugham once undertook to prepare abridged versions of the best novels ever written his choices which included "the brothers karamazov " "pride and prejudice" and "war and peace " were unexceptionable what kicked up a row was maughams cheeky claim that "the wise reader will get the greatest enjoyment out of reading them if he learns the useful art of skipping there is nothing reprehensible in cutting " i havent seen any of orions compact editions theyll be published in the u s starting in august but im not inclined to be snippy about them because it happens that i grew up reading abridged novels an experience that did me no harm whatsoever my parents were among the many americans who subscribed to readers digest condensed books a once popular series of volumes published between and that offered its readers abridged versions of such popular novels as "advise and consent" and "the caine mutiny " like orions compact editions condensed books came in for a fair amount of teasing betty comden and adolph green for instance wrote a very funny song in which they speculated on how the digests editors might have summed up "gone with the wind" "scarlett oharas a spoiled pet she wants everything that she can get the one thing she cant get is rhett the end " i started dipping into condensed books in elementary school and found them so engrossing that i talked my parents into becoming charter subscribers to another now defunct series readers digest best loved books for young readers it was this series launched in that introduced me to "the scarlet pimpernel " "treasure island " "twenty thousand leagues under the sea " and the sherlock holmes stories among many other good things as i grew older i sought out the full length versions of these books and found them even more rewarding and i expect that more than a few of the readers of orions compact editions will do the same thing and if they dont then at least theyll profit from having been exposed to a slimmed down but well chosen selection of the literary cornerstones of western culture whats more i suspect that some of the books they read will be the better for having been trimmed dr johnson described "paradise lost" as "one of the books which the reader admires and puts down and forgets to take up again none ever wished it longer than it is " thats how i feel about "moby dick " an indisputably great novel that is nonetheless full to the gunwales with excess baggage everyone should read it once but fewer and fewer people do and i cant say that i blame them of course great art deserves to be experienced on its own uncompromising terms flaws and all but the older i get the more i appreciate those artists who say what they have to say then shut up is there a more powerfully moving novel than f scott fitzgeralds word "the great gatsby" or a funnier film than buster keatons minute "sherlock jr " or a more profound meditation on the brevity of human life than "anakreons grab " hugo wolfs setting of goethes line poem about the grave of an ancient greek poet "the happy poet rejoiced in spring summer and fall now at last this mound of earth protects him from winter " id trade any number of operas for that exquisitely wrought three minute song perhaps my growing appreciation of the virtues of conciseness arises from the fact that i am no longer young to cross the th meridian is to be ever more acutely aware of the need to "use well the interval " as cardinal newman put it malcolm edwards said the same thing less poetically but more pithily when he remarked that "life is too short to read all the books you want to " i regret to admit that there are a good many great novels that i have yet to read some of which are long enough to make me quail at the thought of taking them on so late in the game ive never read charles dickenss "bleak house " which is words long and one of my new years resolutions for was to do so i picked it up in january and put it down again in february having gotten only a quarter of the way through alas i was too busy to stick with it so i note with interest that the next six volume installment of orions compact editions includes "bleak house " yes im tempted mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs
