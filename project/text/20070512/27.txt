dynastys dilemma for bancrofts dow jones offer poses challenge murdoch bid tests familys cohesion sell grandpas paper "what the hells the matter with my red sox " these feisty last words of year old jessie bancroft cox brought to a tragic end what was supposed to be a joyous evening the th anniversary of dow jones &amp co held in april at a private room inside manhattans famed "" club collapsing at her table mrs cox was rushed past horrified relatives who had gathered to celebrate she soon was pronounced dead the occasion proved to be a turning point for the family which has controlled dow jones the publisher of the wall street journal since mrs coxs prolific pound step grandfather clarence barron took ownership in the clan lost its spirited chief signaling the start of a diffusion of leadership for decades control over dow jones was concentrated in the hands of a small number of bancrofts who were bound by close personal relationships and a shared belief in the companys mission with their roots in boston the bancrofts have lived in a world of show horses sailing and mountainside estates they have done so while being fiercely protective of dow jones and its independence from suitors memorialized in a family maxim "never sell grandpas paper " the family has since spread from hawaii to rome consisting of republicans and democrats genteel farmers and a speedboat champion lacking a new matriarch or another strong leader the family now must cope with its most challenging test a surprise &# billion buyout offer from rupert murdochs news corp that is a premium over dow joness share price at the time of the bid and it would boost the value of the bancrofts stake in the company to &# billion a number of family members distrust mr murdochs media conglomerate people familiar with their deliberations say these family members worry that mr murdoch would subordinate the journals journalistic independence to his own business and political interests following the offer dow jones said that family owned shares representing of the companys overall voting power favored rejecting the offer "if you give it over to rupert murdoch itll be ruined " says william cox jr mrs coxs son and the only living family member to spend his entire career with the company he says he wouldnt sell if news corp offered more than &# a share "its been in the family for a long time " he adds "i want to see it stay in the family " a major shareholder outside of the bancroft family james ottaway jr has also expressed concern about mr murdoch mr ottaway cited what he called one sided coverage by news outlets owned by news corp such as the new york post and fox news channel mr murdoch has publicly brushed off such criticism saying hell invest in dow joness growth not meddle with its journalism mr ottaway controls of class b dow jones shares which carry times the voting power of the more widely held class a shares the bancrofts and their trusts own of the class b shares according to dow jones filings behind the scenes however family members have been on nonstop conference calls trying to establish a consensus on whether to engage mr murdoch or potentially seek other buyers of the company despite the tentative no to mr murdochs &# a share overture the situation remains in flux some of mrs coxs grandchildren frustrated by the familys hands off approach as dow jones owners have been agitating privately for better performance on their dow jones holdings for years children of mrs coxs daughter jane cox macelree are among those pushing the family to change how it responds to such offers and they are at least willing to hear what mr murdoch has to say one of these children leslie hill who serves on the dow jones board has been opposed to a murdoch bid but remains open to other options says a person familiar with her thinking meantime another of the familys four representatives on the dow jones board christopher bancroft remains opposed to the murdoch bid a person familiar with the matter says the year old mr bancroft who runs a small investment firm in texas serves as a trustee for of the familys class b shares the familys ties to the journal began years ago when jessie waldron a wealthy widow with two daughters married mr barron a dow jones correspondent mr barron bought the company for &# the barrons passed their shares to ms waldrons older daughter jane who married hugh bancroft a successful boston lawyer after mr bancroft committed suicide in the shares moved to a set of trusts benefiting the bancrofts three children and their grandchildren today more than trusts exist according to people familiar with the matter each serving an overlapping set of beneficiaries that can include different generations and family members of different branches as with any trust the beneficiaries dont directly decide what to do with the assets in the trust that is the job of trustees most of the bancroft trusts have two to four trustees drawn from family members and professional managers at the familys boston law firm hemenway &amp barnes and a colorado law firm holme roberts &amp owen these are the people who must decide whether to accept news corp s offer but its sometimes a challenge to get consensus says one person with knowledge of the familys discussion thats because the trusts require a unanimous vote of trustees a standard that can create gridlock as a rule trustees have a fiduciary duty to serve the interests of the beneficiaries but the bancroft trust documents generally dont stipulate that the trustees must maximize the value of the trusts holdings of dow jones shares the heyday for the bancrofts and their relationship with dow jones came between world war ii and mrs coxs death in during those years mrs cox and her sister jane bancroft cook held sway over family matters circulation and profits were growing at dow jones and the company was expanding "they were very proud of the journals independence and integrity " says warren phillips the former top editor of the journal and later chairman and chief executive of dow jones mr phillips says mrs cox and her sister "took great pride in the papers standards and what those standards were all those things went right to their heart " mrs cox relished entertaining at the familys room estate overlooking cohasset harbor in massachusetts the "oaks " as it was known in the family was staffed by a butler cook and a maid who served mrs cox breakfast in bed each day on fine china with equestrian related designs she was an avid sailor and pony cart racer as well as a horticulturist her attic was filled with historical artifacts such as mr barrons canes and hats her vast garden was filled with flowers white her favorite color she kept a large orchid collection the offspring of which now are tended by some of her grandchildren people familiar with the matter say short and ribald mrs cox enjoyed surprising friends and family with brash comments one visitor to the oaks recalls her telling a story about traveling across the atlantic as a young girl and playing mah jongg with franklin d roosevelt the new york governor and later u s president she told of catching fdr cheating and calling him on it mrs cox made clear to the men in her life that she expected them to be involved in the company her son william cox jr was a national advertising relations manager for dow jones her grandson william cox iii worked for the company for years in various positions including as head of sales and marketing for dow jones global indexes the seven hill children grew up near philadelphia offspring of the matriarchs daughter jane cox macelree and her former husband louis hill the hill childrens paternal great grandfather louis g kaufman was a wealthy banker who helped finance the empire state building but his descendants had squandered the family fortune the family branch descended from mrs coxs sister jane cook is viewed by some other members of the family as the most fervent about maintaining the wall street journals independence the late mrs cook was tall and shy she gave to charities anonymously and avoided the limelight her sister enjoyed mrs cooks three daughters live in quiet parts of new england some family members pursue equestrian sports and live on small well groomed farms one daughter elizabeth steele owns a real estate development company focusing on environmental projects another daughter martha robes is married to a cabinet maker and spends half the year on her boat docked in st john in the u s virgin islands ms robes has told family members that she refuses to be in the same room with mr murdoch while others in the cook branch refuse to entertain any offer people familiar with the matter say for decades the family was happy to entrust the companys operations to dow jones managers as profits rose steadily "my mother taught us it was a kind of sacred duty not to interfere " mrs cook told the journal in the journal which had a daily circulation of just in the s repositioned itself as a national business newspaper under the leadership of legendary editor and later chief executive bernard kilgore circulation topped one million in the s family questions about management first began to surface in the mid s even amid circulation and advertising gains dow jones missed a series of opportunities that the likes of reuters plc and time inc capitalized on in dow jones bought a stake in a nascent cable television company continental cablevision but it sold the stake within five years meanwhile time continued investing in the business and through a series of mergers built what is now time warner cable inc with a &# billion market capitalization meanwhile the leadership of the bancroft family grew more diffuse although william cox jr who served on the dow jones board until acted as an informal family patriarch the bancroft clan continued to grow separated by age and geography many members of the younger generation had little contact with their cousins some pursued careers one became an airline pilot others are teachers while still others built lives around pastimes such as horse breeding and sailing a few members of the family grew disenchanted with dow jones management in the mid s when the company failed to make a success of its purchase of telerate a provider of real time market data although telerate seemed a natural extension of the business from the start some bancrofts privately questioned the deal in family meetings people close to the situation say in any case telerate didnt compete successfully with more sophisticated products from bloomberg lp and reuters the telerate situation worsened in and pinching earnings two family members elisabeth "lizzie" goth and her cousin william cox iii who had tried to raise concerns within the family began publicly criticizing how dow joness then chief executive peter kann was running the company older members of the bancroft clan felt the two had violated the familys privacy and temporarily excluded them from family meetings on the business say people familiar with the situation a passionate equestrian ms goth recently married for a second time and uses her new husbands name chelberg she divides her time between prague and kentucky where she breeds saddle bred horses and isnt actively involved now in family affairs she declined to comment mr cox quit the company after the public flap and left dow jones in he lives in rome and couldnt be reached to comment still some family members credit the pairs efforts with helping to prod management to jettison telerate and bring more prominent business figures to the board as outside directors dow jones sold the unit for about &# million to bridge information systems inc in at a loss of more than &# billion with the economy booming in the late s the companys fortunes showed a temporary upturn the journal was thicker than ever thanks to a boom in technology advertising by the stock price topped &# a share more than double where it had been when mrs chelberg and mr cox first went public with their criticisms then the internet bubble burst shares fell back to their old level and the journal was forced to cut staff in early dow joness board started a formal succession process for mr kann that was intended to last a year but as the newspaper industrys advertising woes deepened family members grew impatient at a november board meeting where directors were slated to discuss whether to engage an executive search firm to look for outside candidates leslie hill and michael elefante two of the familys four representatives then on the board pressed to decide on a new ceo immediately according to people familiar with the matter mr elefante a hemenway &amp barnes partner took over in as a director from roy a hammer a longtime bancroft family adviser some directors initially balked "the essential point was that the succession process needed to be carefully thoughtfully and thoroughly done to get the right outcome " says irvine o hockaday jr a senior director and retired ceo of hallmark cards inc ms hill and mr elefante were adamant "leslie and mike made the point that they felt that the progress the companys business was making had been slow and that they thought a change could accelerate the process " says mr hockaday what followed was a quick discussion in which the board picked richard f zannino then dow joness chief operating officer as the new ceo in the preceding months a special committee of directors had identified mr zannino the first non journalist to hold the companys top post as a leading candidate say people familiar with the deliberations mr kann had left the boardroom during the deliberations as is customary in such cases mr hockaday went out and told mr kann of the decision mr zannino took his job the following february mr zannino a year old former retail industry executive who had joined dow jones as chief financial officer in shook up the companys business operations and cut costs he also pursued initiatives such as the new saturday edition the acquisition of the financial news web site marketwatch com and purchase from reuters of the remaining half of factiva a news and information service in shareholder return was a relatively solid including dividends but dow joness share price remained mired in the mid s on may that all changed dow jones shares rocketed to a five year high of &# on the new york stock exchange after cnbc disclosed that mr murdoch had made his &# billion offer suddenly the fate of dow jones and its flagship newspaper was thrust into the familys hands mr zannino and mr murdoch had breakfast on march a meeting mr murdoch initiated according to a person close to dow jones near the end of that meeting a wide ranging discussion of the media business mr murdoch expressed interest in acquiring dow jones though he didnt make a formal offer say people familiar with the meeting mr zannino immediately informed joseph a stern the companys general counsel of the overture he also told outside counsel art fleischer of fried frank harris shriver &amp jacobson mr kann the outgoing dow jones chairman incoming chairman m peter mcpherson and mr elefante the bancroft family lawyer say these people the offer hit the family like a bombshell amid a flurry of conference calls one theme came through the rich offer validated a view held by many that the company was undervalued but further consensus was slow in coming bancroft family members conducted an informal poll but didnt reach any conclusion by april when dow jones directors conferred by phone some family members were upset that mr zannino even met mr murdoch in their perception this suggested that mr zannino favored a sale of the company people familiar with the situation say mr zannino says he has not advocated any position on the offer on april the board received a formal offer in writing from mr murdoch on the following day directors discussed the offer at a regularly scheduled board meeting shortly thereafter bancroft family members from around the country gathered at the boston offices of hemenway &amp barnes to discuss mr murdochs approach those who couldnt make it called in some family members including william cox jr openly expressed their opposition the discussions led to another tabulation which concluded that about of family owned shares were in hands opposing taking action on the offer that represented of the companys overall voting power the ottaway family which controls about of the companys overall voting power soon announced publicly that it also was opposed for the moment that is where matters stand if mr murdoch raises his price or another bidder steps in the familys divisions could re emerge family members plan to discuss the issue again prior to a dow jones board meeting scheduled for may some younger family members continue to see merit in keeping their options open people familiar with their thinking say these family members want more information from and about mr murdoch they worry that as an independent company dow jones wont have the resources to invest enough in its businesses and that quality could suffer mr cox says he thinks there are "a few" in the family who would sell probably because they are "motivated by money " still its unclear whether the full family including the younger members are ready to part with the wall street journal even if they had compelling evidence that a sale would help the company grow faster the rich price offered by mr murdoch is "a dream come true for a number of people " asserts andrew klink who was married to mrs coxs niece bettina bancroft before her death in "but its a deal with the devil "
