encore a special report health matters is your wife pushing you to see a doctor read this and go in late phil starkes wife began pressuring him to go to the doctor although he didnt feel great he was pretty sure he knew why work and family demands and a busy travel schedule had left him tired and jet lagged he had two young children at home and a third on the way he was remodeling his home and had just given up caffeinated beverages cold turkey and he was years old of course he was tired "im not a year old " says mr starke a resident of san jose calif and manager of a software company "there are going to be things that dont work the way they used to im fairly comfortable with that " his wife rachael saw things differently her normally active and energetic husband wasnt just tired he was fatigued and exhausted he had lost weight relatively quickly and he was drinking bottles and bottles of water she became convinced he had diabetes "he was so drawn and thin i burst into tears " she says "hes thinking im hormonal but i told him youre sick and you wont go to the doctor " but mr starke dismissed his wifes worries noting that he had no family history of the disease "she watches a lot of medical shows " he says doctors say that the starkes situation isnt unusual and that its common for a wife to begin pushing her husband to visit the doctor long before a man thinks he needs to go to be sure plenty of wives are also guilty of neglecting their health but surveys show that men are far less likely to have a personal physician than women and even when prenatal visits are excluded women are still twice as likely to visit the doctor as men the health of a womans husband is an important medical issue for both genders because men put off going to the doctor they typically are diagnosed with diseases at a later stage when they are more serious and difficult to treat and that has major implications for a womans long term well being seven out of female baby boomers will outlive their husbands and can expect to be widows for to years more than half of the elderly widows living in poverty today werent poor before the death of their husbands according to the u s administration on aging physician harvey simon editor of the harvard mens health watch newsletter says its common for men to "blame" their wives when they finally do visit a doctor "when men will finally come in they are often mute for a while " says dr simon "and then they pull out a paper and say my wife told me to ask about this they still feel the need to hide behind their wifes questions " ridwan shabsigh director of urology at maimonides medical center in brooklyn n y says a male friend of his also refused to see a doctor the mans wife had noticed signs of erectile dysfunction and was concerned about his heart health she pleaded with him to see a doctor but nothing worked desperate she finally told him she wouldnt sign the couples joint tax return unless he made an appointment the strategy worked her husband went to the doctor and came home with prescriptions to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure "he had an early warning symptom of erectile dysfunction and he had a caring wife " dr shabsigh says "but he didnt care about his health its typical " doctors say wives are in a unique position to persuade their husbands to seek medical care because erectile function is an important barometer of a mans health a wife often is the first to notice subtle changes that could signal a health problem like heart disease and because women typically have regular contact with the pediatrician and their own obstetricians and gynecologists they can ask for advice and referrals to the right doctors even if their husbands wont last year mrs starke expressed her worries about her husband to her childs pediatrician during the babys two week checkup the doctor gave her a home test strip her husband could use to check his blood sugar her husband was headed out

appointment in two weeks mrs starke called back and insisted the doctor see her husband immediately he was diagnosed with adult onset diabetes and dangerously high blood sugar today with medication and lifestyle changes his blood sugar is under control and he feels well "theres an old jimmy buffett song where he tells his girlfriend you treat your body like a temple i treat my body like a tent "
