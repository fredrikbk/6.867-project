chasing rumors with cash buyout speculation fuels stock option purchases buying stock options based on rumors that a company may get bought makes about as much sense as buying lottery tickets as part of a retirement plan but with a wave of speculation on the next big buyout sweeping the financial markets a lot of investors have been making those all or nothing bets market watchers attribute the craze to the number of high profile buyouts announced in the past year that were preceded by heavy trading in "call" options so investors are now using heavy trading in call options as a signal that a takeover and easy money are on the way but such speculative trading is an easy way to lose money in the long run call options are contracts that give their holders the right to buy a stock at a certain price by a predetermined date they appeal to speculators because they require less cash to buy than do stocks and they can return far greater profits when they are sold after their value rises what is problematic though is that call options can quickly lose their value if a rumored deal doesnt occur and unlike stocks options eventually expire "many people lose money trading options because they buy the wrong option for the wrong reason " says michael schwartz chief options strategist at oppenheimer &amp co tom sosnoff chief executive of options brokerage thinkorswim group and a former options market maker in chicago says "i think that generally speaking to buy something on a rumor or to speculate on a deal getting done is fools play " speculative options trading has been widespread in a recent report deutsche bank securities compiled a list of companies whose options have been targeted by buyout speculators it includes e trade financial corp automatic data processing inc csx corp and radioshack corp in many cases the activity is tied to a single assumption that individuals with privileged information about a coming deal have placed large options trades in order to profit from it and those who have spotted them in the markets can profit as well "there are many reasons to buy upside calls " says stacey briere gilbert chief options strategist at susquehanna financial group so assuming that trading in call options is the work of insiders positioning for a coming buyout can be a mistake large trading volume preceding deal announcements has prompted regulators to investigate their legality which may not be much of a concern to rumor chasers in a prominent recent example investors who bought call options to position for gains in dow jones &amp co stock before a bid for the parent of the wall street journal by news corp was made public recently generated returns of as much as regulators have said they are investigating unusual trading in dow jones options and the securities and exchange commission has already brought charges related to trading of dow jones stock before the bids disclosure but more often than not rumors of a takeover dont lead to anything of substance and traders who paid high prices for call options wind up with money losing positions
