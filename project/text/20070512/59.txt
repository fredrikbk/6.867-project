politics &amp economics veto threat clouds democrats budget washington as democrats near agreement on a budget the white house is threatening to veto any domestic appropriations bill that exceeds president bushs spending requests for the fiscal year that begins oct thats a much tougher stance than mr bush took when republicans ran congress and if implemented would result in multiple vetoes that would play havoc with the democratic legislative agenda this summer and next fall budget director rob portman said he feels compelled to take a stand now because the new majority has been so aggressive in adding to the administrations spending requests chiefly for domestic programs "this is my effort to be clear and transparent about our concerns over spending " mr portman said in an interview "our fear is if we dont put out a marker in the early stages the spending will overwhelm us " mr bush has proposed a cap of &# billion for all fiscal discretionary appropriations but house and senate negotiators are expected to settle on a number that could be as much as &# billion higher on top of that democrats have proposed adding another &# billion this spring as part of an iraq war funding bill for the remainder of fiscal ending sept mr portman is an important player in the talks to resolve the war funding dispute after mr bush vetoed the first bill the white house appears willing to accept the security related and veterans health care spending demanded by lawmakers but its strong position on holding the line on spending seems designed to put more steel behind the administrations bargaining on spending as well if mr portmans threats are strictly applied almost none of the domestic spending bills will be signed into law in a letter friday to budget negotiators the budget director warned "i will recommend the president veto any appropriations bill that exceeds his request until congress demonstrates a sustainable path that keeps discretionary spending within the presidents towline of &# billion " in the absence of an agreement on total government spending that effectively means the administration will insist that congress adhere to how the white house has allocated money among different agencies funded through the annual spending bills "its a monument to nonsense " said house appropriations committee chairman david obey d wis mr portman left some flexibility about defense funds stating in his letter that congress must ensure the pentagon "has the resources necessary to accomplish its mission " but his get tough standards will also require some judgment calls as the earliest appropriations bills covering the interior or agriculture departments for example are typically among the smallest and the margins of difference with the white house will be less "if its within reason we will try to work something out " mr portman said when republicans controlled congress individual domestic bills often exceeded mr bushs requests and it became common practice to shift funds from defense and foreign aid accounts conservatives were increasingly critical that mr bush didnt use his veto but in fact the whole budget process collapsed last year in large part because republicans were divided themselves over mr bushs domestic spending cuts
