pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece a speech that made abolition history on may william wilberforces parliamentary oratory began to turn the tide against slavery anatomy of a classic it is rare indeed that a single piece of oratory can spark not just a change in the law but also a tidal shift in global opinion today we are so used to glib telegenic speakers with their teleprompters and their ranks of speechwriters that we forget that speechmaking was once a true art if ever there was a case for an oratorical masterpiece it would have to be for the four hour tour de force made by william wilberforce to britains house of commons in from the very start wilberforces words have a resonance and gravitas that make our modern speeches seem insipid by comparison "when i consider the magnitude of the subject which i am to bring before the house a subject in which the interests not just of this country nor of europe alone but of the whole world and of posterity are involved it is impossible for me not to feel both terrified and concerned at my own inadequacy to such a task the end of which is the total abolition of the slave trade " for wilberforce this speech was to be the start of a most arduous road it would last a full years and culminate in britains abolition of the slave trade act which came into force years ago but even on may when wilberforce laid out the case for the abolition of slavery his speech was recognized as a defining moment in british history with this one speech wilberforce had thrown down the gauntlet to the slave traders many of whom were actually watching from the galleries it was to be printed many times over including a verbatim account in cobbetts parliamentary history of england and it was these printed copies that were to spark a firestorm of moral outrage wilberforce had been elected to parliament only nine years earlier at the age of he was a wonderful speaker and was known as the "nightingale of the commons" though as regards his appearance wilberforce was short and snub nosed the diarist james boswell described him as "a shrimp " five years after he joined the commons wilberforce had become a devout christian and it was this that galvanized him into joining the committee for the abolition of the slave trade two years later the trans atlantic slave trade had started in the th century and although it was engaged in by many european countries the british were to become its most ruthless practitioners they developed a "trade triangle " shipping goods out to africa in exchange for slaves this wretched human cargo packed tight beneath the decks would then make the infamous "middle passage" across the atlantic to the new world the last stretch of the trade triangle was back to britain with the slaves now exchanged for rum and molasses its estimated that over two centuries more than million west africans were forced into slavery at least a th of these wouldnt even survive the trip across the atlantic many more would not survive a year in bondage but the slave trade was to be phenomenally lucrative for the british in just one year it brought in the immense sum of gbp million to the city of liverpool and on the back of it were built a dazzling array of buildings and monuments this then was the formidable moneymaking operation that wilberforce found himself up against when he took on the slave traders before taking to the commons floor in wilberforce had been meticulous in his preparation an anglican priest thomas clarkson had traveled thousands of miles all over the country to provide a wealth of detail about the slaves appalling conditions this was crucial because the slave traders had marshaled every argument at their disposal but as it happened they overplayed their hand almost purporting that the slaves were living in the lap of luxury one liverpool slaver a mr norris claimed the slaves were fed several meals a day and that as they washed after breakfast "their apartments were perfumed with frankincense and lime juice " norris even had the gall to continue "song and dance are permitted the men play and sing while the women and girls make fanciful ornaments with beads with which they are plentifully provided " wilberforce had spent two years mastering his brief and it would have been all too easy for him to have been whipped up into a fury of moral outrage but his speech was a model of restraint in which piece by piece he ripped apart the slavers arguments "the truth is that for the sake of exercise these miserable wretches loaded with chains oppressed with disease and wretchedness are forced to dance by the terror of the lash and sometimes by the actual use of it " the real oratory though came when wilberforce changed the whole tempo of the speech and started appealing to the slavers better natures today weve heard variations of these exact words so often that we are almost inured to them but the first time that they were used in public the atmosphere was electric "i mean not to accuse anyone but to take the shame upon myself in common with the whole parliament of great britain for having suffered this horrid trade to be carried on under their authority "we are all guilty we ought all to plead guilty and not to exculpate ourselves by throwing the blame on others " days later many newspapers assumed that wilberforce had carried the day but after sustained pressure from the slavers the abolitionists were to lose year after year of ballots in the commons on the eve of one crucial vote scores of mps didnt bother to show up because theyd been offered free tickets to the opera wilberforce was physically attacked and publicly vilified with even lord nelson railing against "the damnable wilberforce and his hypocritical allies " gradually though the swell of public opinion was turning and in february the bill was yet again brought back to the commons wilberforce was in tears as speech after speech was made in its favor the bill was passed by a landslide gaining its royal assent on march this act marked the end of the slave trade in britain and was to become a talisman for abolitionists world wide but wilberforce had to wait more years before the arguments over compensation could finally be thrashed out and slavery itself abolished he heard the news just three days before he died on july and said with all the easy elegance of the true orator "thank god that i have lived to witness a day in which england is willing to give twenty millions sterling for the abolition of slavery " mr coles is
