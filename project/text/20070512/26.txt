encore a special report giving and receiving more investors are finding that gift annuities can meet two financial needs at once while most people get an appointment book or a mug in exchange for their charitable gifts harold marcus of olympia wash gets something far more practical a stream of income for the rest of his life his strategy the year old makes his donations by using charitable gift annuities unlike commercial annuities which are sold by insurance companies charitable gift annuities are offered directly by nonprofit organizations like charities universities and hospitals and while they do have some pitfalls more and more people are discovering these products as a neat solution to both their charitable intentions and their desire to create more reliable income in retirement "i know that if i live until im ill still be collecting income " says mr marcus a retired industrial engineer who has given a total of &# to three groups through charitable gift annuities over the past four years or so and collects some &# in income each year charitable gift annuities work like this an organization accepts your donation cash stock or even real estate and in exchange promises to pay you a fixed annual sum you can then take an upfront tax deduction for a portion of your donation typically between and depending on your age and other factors to make up for the rest of the deduction you havent taken you receive generally to of your annuity payments tax free until you reach your life expectancy which is determined by an actuarial life expectancy table supplied by the internal revenue service how the remaining portion of the payments is taxed depends on how the charitable contribution was made if it was a cash donation the payments are taxed at your regular income tax rate as ordinary income if you contributed appreciated assets such as stock or property part of the remaining payment is taxed as capital gains and part as ordinary income how much you will be charged at the capital gains rate versus the regular income tax rate which can be as high as depends on how much appreciation is embedded in the donated assets once you live past your life expectancy the entire annual payment is taxed as ordinary income upon your death the nonprofit keeps whatever portion of your contribution is left in the annuity while charitable gift annuities have been around for more than a century they caught an updraft around when interest rates started plummeting to all time lows "these annuities are particularly attractive during periods of low interest rates because their payments compare favorably with income received on fixed income investments " says frank minton chairman of the american council on gift annuities in indianapolis yet regardless of what happens to interest rates simple demographic trends are likely to continue fueling the popularity of these annuities mr minton says "most people who like gift annuities are age and up " he says "and that percentage of the population is growing " doug moore u s head of estate and charitable planning for citi trust a trust company within citigroup inc says because these annuities generate fixed payments that are likely to be eroded by inflation over time they generally make most sense for people age or older current rates on charitable gift annuities are if you are age if you are if you are and if you are in contrast average interest rates on one year certificates of deposit are while charitable annuities are regulated by states and rules vary somewhat in most states you have some flexibility in how you structure your annuity for example you typically can arrange to receive payments over both your lifetime and your spouses in case you predecease your spouse you may also be able to create a gift annuity in someone elses name or create a gift annuity today and wait to start taking payments later transferring appreciated assets whether shares of stock or property can have some big tax benefits if you donate say stock or real estate valued at &# with a &# cost basis you can transfer the entire &# and pay no immediate capital gains tax yet your deductions and income will be based on the &# to use real estate which is becoming a popular option at some charities the property must first be appraised the charity gets an appraisal to determine the terms of the annuity contract while the owner must get one for tax purposes the title of property is then transferred to the charity upon the signing of the annuity contract another way to turn a charitable donation into lifetime income is with charitable remainder annuity trusts which guarantee a fixed lifetime annuity and charitable remainder unit trusts which give you a variable payment that grows or shrinks depending on how your underlying investments perform you contribute a lump sum and draw income for your lifetime or the trusts term you also qualify for a deduction equal to the amount the charity is expected to receive because of expenses associated with charitable trusts it generally makes sense to use one only if youre putting at least &# into it says larry h mayfield a chartered life underwriter at brewer insurance services in columbia s c in contrast even small amounts can make sense through charitable gift annuities typically required minimums set by nonprofit groups are &# to &# for example the minimum at the american red cross is &# and the process of setting up a charitable gift annuity is so streamlined that "depending on when you make the gift its conceivable that you can receive your first payment within a month " says rebecca lock director of gift planning at the american red cross in atlanta but dont let the simplicity of these products prompt you to jump into one too quickly "be sure youre doing it for all of the right reasons no that you have charitable intent " says tom spychalski a partner at weiser llp an accounting firm in new york "the fact that you get an annuity payment shouldnt be your main reason for choosing one of these " if your priority is to find the most fixed lifetime income possible you will most likely come out ahead by buying a regular commercial fixed annuity from an insurer because it offers higher rates says mr minton in indianapolis "even factoring in the tax deduction you get with the gift annuity you would still be financially better off by doing a commercial annuity " he says one of the potential downsides of charitable gift annuities is that the nonprofit group promising you lifelong payments suddenly folds "with big organizations like the salvation army the american red cross and harvard you can feel pretty comfortable but with smaller charities i would ask what steps they have in place to guarantee your payments " mr mayfield says fewer than of charities reinsure their gift annuities to ensure they can meet obligations to donors according to the american council on gift annuities when they receive your contribution they use part of it to buy an annuity from an insurance company that will cover your lifelong payments whether the charity is around or not if you are considering a nonprofit of questionable financial standing and it doesnt reinsure its gift annuities consider hiring an accountant to review the groups financial information financial statements of nonprofits are public information simply ask the charity for its annual financial statements and audit reports would be donors also should be wary of offers with unusually high annuity rates to calculate your annuity payments most nonprofit groups use interest rates proposed by the american council on gift annuities the rates are intended to leave charitable groups with an average of of the donations they receive through charitable gift annuities but if you are offered a rate that exceeds the councils recommended rates by more than a percentage point or so be careful mr mayfield says if the rate is too high there may be virtually nothing left for the charity upon your death and the irs may declare that the amount given through the annuity wasnt in fact a gift "then it may not allow your tax deduction " he says if your favorite charity doesnt offer charitable gift annuities dont assume that it wont dick taylor of colorado springs colo says he persuaded one of his favorite nonprofits the national association for interpretation a group for workers at parks museums and other areas that educate about heritage to introduce a gift annuity "it was my third gift annuity " he says "but it was the charitys first " ms hube is a writer in westport conn she can be reached at encore wsj com
