politics &amp economics critics target trade deal for not going far enough washington some critics are already complaining that a breakthrough trade deal between democrats and the white house doesnt go far enough in requiring u s trading partners to adhere to international labor and environmental standards but the deal is giving a boost to the bush administrations trade priorities including reinvigorating stalled global trade talks and securing support for renewing the presidents soon to expire authority to negotiate trade deals without congressional amendment "this is a big movement forward " said william rhodes senior vice chairman at citigroup inc who is deeply involved in business community efforts to shore up support for trade in congress "it shows there is a bipartisan group a coalition that wants to move on trade " the symbolism of democratic leaders announcing the deal thursday at the capitol with top bush administration officials was not lost at the world trade organizations headquarters in geneva where there has been skepticism about whether the new democratic majority in congress intends to support free trade "that puts that to rest " said one international finance official under the deal the u s and four trading partners peru panama colombia and south korea would commit to abide by core international labor and environmental standards for the first time those standards would be enforceable under the same mechanisms that ensure enforcement of business priorities in bilateral trade agreements negotiated by the u s the trade agreements which have already been negotiated are awaiting approval by congress with the deals with peru and panama expected to go first thursdays deal was a major victory for congressional democrats who want to spread globalizations benefits more evenly among income groups and to protect developing economies from environmental degradation still as details of the agreement emerged some labor and environmental groups pointed to what they viewed as some significant limitations many businesses had worried the deal would make international labor provisions enforceable against american employers on friday u s chamber of commerce president tom donohue said in a statement that the chamber is "encouraged by assurances that the labor provisions cannot be read to require compliance " that doesnt sit well with afl cio president john sweeney who said the agreement doesnt give enough "ability to challenge u s laws " he also complained that in the event of violations "there is no guarantee the executive branch will enforce any new rights workers may gain through these negotiations " he said his organization would reserve judgment on the deal for the time being some environmentalists raised concerns that big potential loopholes remain for foreign investors particularly oil and gas companies that have made large investments in south america in addition to worker and environmental protections the deal calls for quicker access to generic drugs for developing countries democrats had made inclusion of such a measure a priority but brand name drug makers had fought it billy tauzin president of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america said his group has been "extremely concerned during this process that core american intellectual property rights remain protected " drug makers said they will try to win back lost ground in other coming trade battles in congress this summer manufacturers meanwhile complained that many of the new worker and environmental protections will be hard if not impossible to enforce they urged the u s to focus more on currency manipulation theft of intellectual property and other unfair trade practices the longer term hope is that the new political consensus will build enough confidence between congress and the white house to ensure renewal of the presidents "fast track" trade negotiating authority which expires at the end of june that authority means that the president can cut market opening trade deals and submit them to congress for approval without amendment debate over renewal is being closely watched abroad as an indicator of whether the u s intends to remain engaged on trade especially the doha round of global trade talks those talks continue next week when u s trade representative susan schwab travels to paris and brussels the talks have been deadlocked for years as a result of disputes over farm supports and industrial tariffs among other things progress on doha could give democrats impetus to renew the presidents trade negotiating authority renewal of that authority in turn could give u s officials fresh leverage to bring doha to a close this weeks agreement opens the door to more protections for workers and communities that are adversely affected by trade that could prove to be an important bargaining chip when negotiations over renewal of fast track authority begin in earnest
