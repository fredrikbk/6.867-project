encore a special report germ fighters a travel clinic can offer a dose of preventive medicine before you head overseas for the health conscious traveler staying well while abroad once amounted to little more than drinking bottled water and avoiding uncooked meats and vegetables but the ease and frequency of international travel these days means that germs and diseases are getting around more too and health scares in recent years think sars avian flu new strains of influenza are now prompting even the most adventuresome among us to think twice before leaving home to address these concerns a growing group of physicians are beginning to specialize in preventive medicine for travelers by staying abreast of real and imagined threats in remote corners of the globe these doctors advise clients of precautions to take abroad and more important what measures to consider before they depart we asked the owners of one successful "travel clinic" to explain how their practice goes beyond the basics weve all read about in travel guides and public health brochures in addition to vaccinating and alerting travelers to risks in specific regions mitchell blass and robert capparell of world travel care in atlanta say they help clients understand why their state of health and fitness at home plays a large part in defining their vulnerability overseas at the end of a hallway plastered with maps and vintage quarantine posters the two physicians discussed subjects ranging from allergies vaccines and foreign hospitals to illnesses like rabies hepatitis and dengue fever the wall street journal how would you define travel medicine and the concept of a travel clinic dr blass its preventive medicine a subspecialty of infectious diseases that focuses on preventive medicine for the individual traveling abroad and availability of care in the event of trouble when they come back wsj what drives the demand for services like yours dr capparell a couple of things one is just the desire for travel in the american public i had no idea there were so many international travelers going to exotic places where there are dangers the other thing is the corporate world and theyre driving it because they want people placed in india southeast asia china south america wsj what do you offer clients that they wouldnt get from a general practitioner or the basic dos and donts from a public health clinic dr capparell were trained in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases and once you take an interest in this area you can really focus on a lot of the information thats out there the world can be a very dangerous place and it takes a long time to learn what we do how we do it how we address the people who travel dr blass its the way we approach a new client when they come to us we look at what you bring to the table as a client or patient looking at your underlying medical conditions what medications youre taking and the status of your health then we look at the destination that youre going to and what you plan on doing while youre there it would be very different for the corporate traveler who may be staying at a luxury hotel versus the college student who may be going to raft in the amazon river so we look at the planned itinerary and then review specifically for what diseases are endemic there which are preventable by vaccines which areas would require malaria prophylaxis and then talk about other common problems that patients may run into like travelers diarrhea from there you actually counsel them with regard to what may be recommended and help the client choose what vaccines may be appropriate for them for example if a person with an underlying immunodeficiency is deciding to travel it would not be wise for them to take some vaccines wsj we often assume that certain regions like europe are safe how do travelers know if they really need medical advice before a trip dr capparell i think western europe may be the only area that is relatively safe and even so i would recommend that people get vaccinated for hepatitis a heck we should get vaccinated for hepatitis a here in the u s there was a huge outbreak in pennsylvania in when people got sick from the same restaurant and its more than just vaccinations even though thats where we hang our hat and where we generate most of our business we do a lot of travel recommendations things that you should watch for things that you should look out for wsj such as dr capparell well water its not a cliche it really isnt if you dont watch what you drink youre bound to get sick in most places let me tell you bottled water only make sure the cap is on normally and hasnt been broken do not use their tap water to brush your teeth dont get ice cubes dont eat anything thats been washed in their water its just not safe people dont take this seriously enough wsj what are other important areas of prevention dr blass insects people should carry repellent in areas that have illnesses that are transmitted through the bites of mosquitoes that may be malaria but it could also include other things like dengue fever dengue also known as breakbone fever is a tropical mosquito borne disease that causes joint pain headaches rashes and a high temperature dr capparell other animals too our best advice to people who travel is dont go near pets or animals of any kind dr blass any dog in a foreign country could be rabid the thing to remember about rabies and that i always tell clients and patients is that rabies is a universally fatal illness after symptoms set in wsj theres a sign in your lobby that says "mosquitoes do not know the difference between third world and first class " dr blass they dont know the difference and again the no problem is food and water safety and you still dont know who the first class resort is employing in their kitchen either hopefully theyre following that sign that says wash your hands after leaving the restroom wsj aside from insect water and food borne diseases are there any particularly common illnesses that affect travelers dr capparell influenza its world wide and in many places in the world its year round which means a lot of these travelers think "oh gosh its may we dont have influenza anymore i dont need that vaccine " but they do if theyre going to a place that has year round influenza they need to be vaccinated so if they skipped it this year they should get the shot wsj what should travelers do if they get sick overseas dr blass that was a question just a couple of days ago when i had a woman in the hospital her choice when she was in rural india visiting her son in a small town with no western anything available was either eat the food thats there or not eat so its a problem sometimes and what do you do have a plan in your own mind how do you get out and how do you locate a health facility how can i access medical care and how do i find and pay for that care and how do i get evacuated if i need to be know where the american consulate is in the country and know where western hospitals are wsj what sort of health papers or documentation should travelers carry dr blass your passport and a certified copy of it in the event that it gets lost a certificate of your vaccines is very important dr capparell a list of medications that you take and your allergies dr blass your health insurance card and it would be nice to know whether your health insurance will cover you while youre overseas wsj what advice do you give older travelers dr blass think of it this way an year old who goes to west africa and acquires malaria is going to have a hard enough time as it is recovering from that you add heart disease diabetes and kidney disease to that mix and that same case of malaria that same bite from that mosquito may be lethal i dont want to scare a person age from traveling but the reality is they have to have an understanding of their underlying medical conditions the medicines that they are taking and be cognizant of those things with any infectious disease related problem the older the individual is the more co morbid medical problems the more likely that illness is to be more complicated or perhaps fatal co morbid medical problems are two or more separate conditions that may occur concurrently but independently in a patient wsj do older travelers often forget their age dr blass you arent going to find an year old thats in general fit enough to climb kilimanjaro dr capparell im sure plenty have tried it people need to understand their own limitations when they travel abroad leaving the country and going on an adventurous journey you tend to start breaking your own rules you really have to be cognizant of them if somebody says "hey lets climb up the eiffel tower " think "well lets take the elevator " mr prada is a staff reporter in the wall street journals atlanta bureau he can be reached at encore wsj com
