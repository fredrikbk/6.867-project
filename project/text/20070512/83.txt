the mcdermott affair the rights and duties of the press are in the news these days and so were pleased to report that an appellate court decision last week left all of us a little freer were referring to the d c circuits ruling in boehner v mcdermott a decade long saga of sleazy behavior by a congressman that threatened to damage freedom of the press jim mcdermott was ranking democrat on the house ethics committee in when he was handed the recording of a discussion among gop house leaders that had been illegally taped by a florida couple the conference call concerned ethics charges against then speaker newt gingrich and ohio republican john boehners cell phone was overheard on a police scanner by john and alice martin the martins sent the tape to their congresswoman whose office declined to open the envelope and recommended that it be turned over to the ethics committee mr mcdermott listened and promptly leaked it to friendly reporters who wrote it up making such a recording is a federal crime and the martins eventually copped a plea and paid a &# fine but mr boehner now minority leader sued mr mcdermott for passing the tape to the press and the democrat defended himself by saying he had a first amendment right to disseminate the information the case has bounced around the federal judiciary but last week the d c circuit issued an en banc ruling that repairs some of the first amendment damage from earlier decisions a majority found that mr mcdermott didnt deserve first amendment protection because he had violated ethics committee privacy rules but and this is the good news for a free press a majority also found that mr mcdermott could not have been punished merely for disseminating the tape in other words mr mcdermott is a scoundrel who deserved to be punished for violating house rules but his personal dishonor shouldnt set a precedent that could damage the right of others especially the media to disseminate such information the ruling largely squares with the supreme courts opinion in bartnicki v vopper in that case the high court limited the use of federal anti wiretapping law when the person who disseminated an illegal recording took no part in making the tape reporters often gain possession of tapes or other information that may have been illegally obtained by someone else but that is of public interest and deserves to be published if reporters could be punished for publishing such information the chilling effect on the press would be significant and when that information involves public officials the medias role as a government watchdog would be unduly constrained this doesnt mean the press should always print such information as weve said about national security secrets sometimes the press has a duty not to publish illegally taping other peoples conversations is wrong and journalists should think carefully about using the fruits of an illegal wiretap thats especially true when the tape relates to private matters as opposed to public figures in the course of official duties we should admit we got this issue wrong ourselves at first in praising earlier court decisions that went against mr mcdermott well plead an excess of distaste for his "ethics" hypocrisy as judge david sentelle described mr mcdermott in his dissent "a public official charged with the oversight of the ethics of his colleagues willfully dealt with felons and knowingly received unlawfully obtained evidence on the chance that he might be able to use something contained therein to embarrass one of the colleagues whose ethics he was charged with policing " classy guy the hill newspaper reports that mr boehner offered to drop the suit four years ago if mr mcdermott would admit wrongdoing apologize and make a &# donation to charity mr mcdermott has refused and now faces &# in damages plus perhaps &# more to cover mr boehners legal costs rather than a lawsuit the proper remedy was censure or expulsion by the house in the event mr mcdermott resigned from the ethics committee which found he had violated the "spirit" of its rules but took no formal action against him we guess he met community standards mr mcdermott could appeal to the supreme court but we hope he concludes hes already done enough damage
