hot topic fuel economy back in the saddle congress moved closer to requiring improved mileage from car makers for the first time in two decades this past week despite heavy opposition from detroit a senate committee approved a bill that would raise the fuel standard for passenger vehicles by about by past attempts to tighten fuel economy standards have never gone far but this time the bill enjoys broader political support as congress looks for ways to curb carbon dioxide a global warming gas produced when fossil fuels such as gasoline are burned the move to boost gas mileage also comes as gas prices reach record highs for this time of year leading to predictions that prices could hit &# a gallon this summer heres a closer look at the debate when were fuel standards implemented congress enacted corporate average fuel economy standards also known as cafe for passenger cars and light trucks in in the wake of the oil embargo over the next decade passenger cars doubled their fuel economy reaching a peak of miles per gallon in average mileage has decreased slightly since then as pickup trucks and suvs which have lower fuel standards have become more popular accounting for nearly half of new car sales what changes are being proposed the senate bill would raise the fuel standard for passenger vehicles to miles per gallon by from the current mpg the bill also mandates a annual increase in mileage for medium and heavy duty trucks and would mark the first time that a fuel standard had been set for trucks larger than pounds detroits big three auto makers warn that changes will further burden them with costs by targeting their best selling pickup trucks and suvs at a time when they are already trying to stem losses by shedding thousands of jobs and shuttering plants one government estimate places the cost of annual increases in mileage standards from to at &# billion for detroits big three the bill allows the government to suspend standards if they impose severe economic hardships for auto makers consumers could expect to pay about &# more for new cars but would recoup those losses within five years with gas prices at &# a gallon and sooner if gas prices increase how would tighter standards cut carbon emissions the bill could cut global warming pollution from cars by to by the equivalent of taking about million of todays cars off the road according to david friedman a research director at the union of concerned scientists light vehicles generate about of u s carbon dioxide emissions auto makers worried that theyll be singled out for environmental improvements are beginning to call for an economy wide carbon cap which would spread the economic pain to such other sectors as power producers and oil companies it costs the economy less to curb a ton of carbon emissions by targeting power plants which are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide than by targeting cars and trucks many studies say already this year congress has five different proposals to regulate industry with a carbon cap and trade regulation and in january california passed the first law requiring low carbon fuels from fuel providers what alternatives could be considered some studies say that fuel economy improvements alone wont curb fuel consumption because consumers will drive more miles if their cars go more miles on every gallon of fuel so some economists favor raising the gas tax which would give consumers an economic incentive to buy more efficient vehicles and to drive them less but a gas tax remains politically unpopular polls show that americans overwhelmingly favor requirements for tighter fuel standards while opposing increases in the gas tax nick timiraos points of view cafe is like trying to combat obesity by forcing clothing manufacturers to manufacture only small sizes its doomed to failure because the market mechanism isnt at work " bob lutz vice chairman global product development general motors "efforts to address global warming and oil addiction should not turn into a bunch of kids pointing at each other saying not me he did it " david friedman research director union of concerned scientists facts overall fuel economy for cars and light trucks peaked at miles per gallon in falling to mpg in meanwhile cars and light trucks have increased from an average of pounds to pounds the federal gasoline tax has been cents per gallon since the average tax including federal state and local taxes is cents per gallon taxes are highest in new york cents and lowest in alaska cents cafe is credited with the demise of the station wagon which declined in popularity in the s as sales of the minivan and later the suv rose classified as "light trucks " minivans and suvs face less stringent fuel economy standards about of new vehicles purchased in the u s have a cylinder or cylinder engine in europe where average fuel economy is about mpg of cars have a cylinder or smaller engine and nearly half the new car fleet has diesel engines which are more efficient than gasoline engines
