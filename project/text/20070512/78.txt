remembrances james abegglen he chronicled the rise of japan inc and its distinct brand of capitalism wounded at iwo jima and enlisted to assess the impact of u s bombing of hiroshima james abegglen later returned to japan to chronicle the postwar rise of japanese industry for u s businesses eager to do business there an outspoken contrarian he sought to dispel western images that he argued both exaggerated japans strengths and its weaknesses he was among the first to portray a capitalism distinct from americas one where workers firms capital and government cooperated in ways unprecedented in the west "jims big contribution was identifying that japan was a different kind of economic animal " says clyde prestowitz chief trade negotiator with japan during the reagan administration and now president of the economic strategy institute a washington based think tank among nonspecialists mr abegglen who died may in tokyo at age is best known for introducing the notion of "japan inc " although he didnt coin the term that became shorthand for a view he didnt endorse "it provided a simplistic description and therefore the public and reporters liked it " he told the magazine j pan inc in "it veered from my attempt to convey a complex combination of cooperation and competition to a paranoid view of lockstep japan its all one big plot and theyre winning " in the s and s mr abegglen warned a complacent corporate america that japan should be taken more seriously in the s mr abegglen combated images of japan as a rapacious economic power out to grab market share by selling below cost and propping up industries in the s he disputed the image of a sclerotic giant unable to solve its bureaucratic and banking problems in his ninth and most recent book "st century japanese management" he called the s the "decade of redesign " and portrayed it as a time when japan adjusted to having a mature economy from one of rapid expansion "to describe it as lost is simple nonsense " he told japans daily yomiuri newspaper in born to a wisconsin cheese maker mr abegglen volunteered as a marine in world war ii and saw action on iwo jima and guam he studied japanese to become a battlefield translator and was a natural candidate for the u s strategic bombing survey after the war that measured among other things the impact of american atomic bombing of hiroshima on japanese morale when mr abegglen returned to japan in on a ford fellowship to study industrial relations the country was still recovering from the devastation of war "in those days the conventional western view of japan was that it was like a bumblebee it wasnt supposed to be able to fly " mr prestowitz says "in the s and s " mr abegglen "warned that this is a juggernaut " mr prestowitz recalls "he described the economy in a way that took the mystery out of it " says george stalk a senior partner at boston consulting group an international business consultancy "he would say profits are for now or for later westerners want their profits now japanese want growth now and profits later " mr abegglen founded boston consultings tokyo office in to advise american companies seeking a toehold in the japanese economy among his clients texas instruments inc eastman kodak co and weyerhaeuser co according to thomas hout who spent three decades with boston consulting in japan "he taught us how to drink he taught us how to write he taught us how to pack a suitcase " mr abegglen fought what he saw as an overly simplified western view of japan in a wall street journal interview in he called it "the notion that somewhere in tokyos bureaucracy theres a guy with a long beard and a big computer and if we could find him and shoot him wed solve the problem " mr abegglen decided in to become a japanese citizen in the journal interview he said it was "difficult and painful" to renounce his u s citizenship adding "it cost me just about &# in accountants and lawyers fees just to do the paperwork " his daughter karen von bismarck says the decision was prompted by several factors including a concern for social injustice in japan he was pleased to live in an orderly society where the salaries of chief executives didnt reach multiples of hundreds of times those of average workers his family and friends say "he was republican in his economics and democratic in his concern for social justice " mr stalk says in a interview with the daily yomiuri mr abegglen looked to japans future "in my era japan was a very exciting place in the next era its going to be a very dull place very wealthy and very dull its going to be like a very large switzerland and thats not a bad thing " alfred d chandler jr helped establish field of business history by chronicling shifts in corporate america historian alfred d chandler jr helped establish the field of business history with books that captured key shifts in corporate america including his pulitzer prize winning "the visible hand the managerial revolution in american business " mr chandler took a comprehensive view of the rise of american business which he attributed both to structural factors such as railroads urban markets and electrification as well as a revolution in managerial skills that allowed the creation of giant well integrated firms "what counts are people their skills knowledge and experience " he once said mr chandler who died wednesday in cambridge mass at age began his career with biographies an early effort was helping industrialist alfred p sloan write his autobiography "my years with general motors " but he made his reputation with big themes including "strategy and structure chapters in the history of the industrial revolution" "pierre s du pont and the making of the modern corporation" and "the coming of managerial capitalism" he followed these with a remarkable series of late career case studies including "inventing the electronic century" which chronicled the proliferation of consumer electronics and "shaping the industrial century" on the rise of big pharmaceutical companies raised in delaware and with longstanding family connections to the du ponts his middle name mr chandler opted early for history and said that as a youth he read through the schoolboys primer "elementary history of the united states" times following family tradition stretching to the th century he attended harvard where he returned to study under sociologist talcott parsons after serving in the navy during world war ii he wrote his doctorate on the career of his great grandfather henry varnum poor a founder of standard &amp poors corp and noted railroad analyst mr chandler taught first at m i t and johns hopkins university while helping edit the letters of theodore roosevelt with whom he shared a passion for hunting and the papers of dwight d eisenhower which were published in five volumes in that same year he joined harvard business school a steady stream of books continued to flow from his tape recorder he dictated everything after his retirement in in an interview with fortune last year he depicted the modern business environment as a continuum with the past "the most important difference and this has been happening since the s is the continuing transformation of big business by high technology firms when a new science appears they commercialize it globally in the s the new technologies were electricity and steam the germans commercialized them first pretty soon you could telegraph china and ship your products to the chinese dye industry today its biotech " stephen miller theodore h maiman physicist designed first working laser the laser one of the most successful inventions of the th century had many fathers but the first to design one that actually worked was theodore maiman a young physicist at hughes aircraft co when he unveiled the device at manhattans delmonico hotel on july there was no obvious need for what seemed closer to science fiction evoking a reporters question about whether it could be used as a death ray "there is no present indication " mr maiman replied he spoke vaguely of using the laser to encode communications or sterilize surfaces lasers stemmed from masers an acronym for microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation a wider technology discovered and developed in the early s by columbia university physicist charles townes mr townes noted in that an optical maser or laser the "l" standing for light was possible and soon labs around the world were racing to develop one the principle was to shine ordinary light which has many wavelengths into a medium whose atoms would re emit it at a single wavelength the challenge was to find the right medium and method for concentrating the incoming light mr maiman designed a small ruby tube coated with mirrors to concentrate incoming light that produced a red beam the first ever laser after his first attempt to publish his result in a leading physics journal was rejected mr maiman held his news conference so other researchers couldnt claim they had invented it first in frustrated by hughess lukewarm support for the device he left mr maimans wife kathleen says to join technology development firm quantatron inc of santa monica calif in he told an interviewer from the new york times that "a laser is a solution looking for a problem " the problems werent long in coming as lasers soon found a place in an array of emerging technologies including communications manufacturing medicine computers entertainment and defense where lasers are used to guide bombs but death ray weapons remain on the drawing board despite years of research while mr maiman who died in vancouver british columbia on may at age made a living as a laser technologist at several start ups and as a consultant he didnt get rich other more efficient designs for lasers with media other than rubies soon superseded his he was passed over for the nobel prize but was awarded several other prizes including the wolf prize in physics in and the japan prize in electro optics in he often told the story of meeting bette davis at a party the movie star asked "how does it feel to be responsible for all that death and destruction " it took until the end of the evening for the reticent mr maiman to formulate a reply "i dont know of anyone whos been killed by a laser even by accident but i do know several people who have been healed by lasers " stephen miller email us at remembrances wsj com
