condition began exercising each of the following individuals who will be competing in louisville came late to the table all say the senior olympics were not their goal at least at first and few envisioned qualifying for the games but all discovered that they were capable even late in life of pushing themselves and their bodies further than they imagined carol yunker age remembers playing "every sport allowed" in high school including field hockey basketball and softball once she entered middle age though athletics fell by the wayside by her early s she says she was "overweight and depressed " a turning point came in during a trip to washington mrs yunker was riding the subway to the airport when a fire broke out on the train tracks no one was injured but mrs yunker recalls lying on the floor of the subway with smoke filling the car trying to calm a mother with several children and coming face to face with her own problems "here i was over pounds " she says "i remember thinking this cant go on " returning home to groveland mass mrs yunker joined weight watchers and began swimming laps at a local high school she had swum briefly in the early s in april she entered her first major swim meet "i was scared " she recalls "i didnt think i was good enough to compete but i went and i did fine that really opened my eyes " today she practices three days a week one hour in the pool on tuesdays and thursdays swimming just under two miles and two hours on sundays swimming about three miles at the moment shes entered in six swimming events in louisville its important to note mrs yunker says that most athletic events for older adults particularly the hundreds of contests held each year at the local and state level have participants at all skill levels "you dont have to be a masters competitor to do this " she says "they have everything volleyball basketball softball if you like something go do it " eric hubach had been a swimmer in college and in the army but beyond a "bit of walking " he rarely exercised in the years that followed he retired from a career with the defense department at age "about pounds overweight " he says and battling high blood pressure today at age mr hubach who lives in norco calif is preparing to swim six events at the senior olympics the meter backstroke is his strong suit "i never imagined doing this " he says "but once i started it felt really good " the spark he says was a steady and alarming increase in his weight after retiring in november he climbed into a local pool "i couldnt do more than a few laps " he says "but i told myself im just going to work at this im a swimmer i know how to do this " at the end of a month mr hubach was able to swim for almost an hour he worked his way to laps in each session and regularly swims laps in training today as his stamina increased and his weight decreased he began entering senior swim meets last summer he qualified for louisville as much as hes looking forward to the olympics mr hubach says he is already thinking about competition beyond the games "im taking up breaststroke " he says "there are always challenges " stephen johnson ran track in high school but "really didnt exercise much at all after that " now age he recalls a moment three years ago when as part of a health assessment the word "obese" first appeared on his medical chart "that was tough to take " he says but that assessment and a no nonsense trainer "changed my life " says dr johnson interim dean of the college of arts and sciences at clarion university of pennsylvania in clarion pa the trainer developed a diet and workout plan which began with dr johnson walking on a treadmill walking led to jogging and jogging three months later led to his first race a five kilometer run "i never imagined running three miles in my life " dr johnson says "but my trainer kept working with me thats so important having someone who is knowledgeable about exercise and diet and who keeps encouraging you and challenging you " in june only a year after that first race dr johnson won the meter run in his age group at the pennsylvania senior games last summer he qualified for the national senior olympics in the same event "im as stunned by this as anybody " dr johnson says laughing "diet and exercise who would have guessed " william camperlino who will be competing in two track events in louisville likes to quote oliver wendell holmes the noted jurist "people dont stop playing because they become older they become older because they stop playing " mr camperlino says he stopped playing for the most part after graduating from college he had always enjoyed athletics wrestling in particular but once he entered his mid s "i got busy with business " he says today he works as a land developer and runs his own real estate company in syracuse n y as he neared his th birthday mr camperlino decided to make some changes "i was pushing pounds and im feet inches tall " he says "there was nothing i could do about my age but there was something i could do about my weight " he began running at the local high school track starting with one quarter mile lap now nine years later he runs to miles a week mr camperlino is quick to say he has "never been a star " his reward he says comes from finishing races and spending time with other athletes "when you go to the senior olympics and see all these people in their s s and s they all have a strong work ethic its nice being around people like that who arent giving up because of their age " louisville will be mr camperlinos fourth senior olympics joe vicars will be competing in his first senior olympics this year hes entered in the kilometer road race about six miles and the triathlon which consists of a yard swim a kilometer bicycle race and a five kilometer run he echoes many of his colleagues when he says his success in athletics stems in large part from training with others "if you do things with a group its a lot easier thats the thing that helps me the most the social part is so important " mr vicars who lives in louisville retired from general electric co in he had done some running "off and on" during his working years but never regarded himself as much of an athlete a year after mr vicars retired though a friend who was active in local triathlons and road races was diagnosed with colon cancer mr vicars and several others made a promise to their friend they would join her in her races and triathlons if she would fight to get well she did and they did in the years since mr vicars has competed in about three dozen triathlons he works out seven days a week with a different activity running swimming cycling weight training each day most of these sessions are done with friends "the youngest person in the training group is a year old woman and the oldest is a year old man " mr vicars says "were not just a bunch of jocks we like to enjoy ourselves go to lunch go out together its so good for both your physical and mental health " as a teacher for years and mother of three children joann sampson certainly lived an active life but when she retired in at age she judged herself to be in "fair shape " at best the following year she saw an article in her local newspaper about the south florida senior games "i had never in my life heard of a senior games " she recalls i said let me see what this is about " ms sampson registered for the meter dash "i thought that would be the easiest " she says and asked a friend to help her train three months later she found herself competing in the games against eight other women in the age group she walked away with a gold medal and has been running ever since ms sampson who lives in hallandale beach fla says fitness has become a tonic she describes herself as "dedicated determined and disciplined" and speaks when shes not training to civic groups and students at local schools "im spreading the gospel " ms sampson says "im in much better shape now than when i was " she has also improved her time in the meters to seconds from seconds in her first race five years ago she hopes that will get her a medal in louisville "a lot of seniors dont think they can do this " says ms sampson now years old "but age is nothing but a number its what you have in your heart that matters " mr ruffenach is a reporter and editor for the wall
