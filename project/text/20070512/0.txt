a word to the wise in iran dont ever wear a tie to work men too now must worry about the fashion police barber shop dos &amp donts tehran iran mohammad eftekharifard head of the union of mens hairdressers last week wrote a stern letter to the iranian capitals or so registered barber shops it ordered them to trim their services stop plucking eyebrows and drop cosmetic facials he also told his barber colleagues not to wear a tie to work mr eftekharifard who takes pride in his neatly trimmed hair and finely tuned political antennae says he knows that "not everything from the west is bad " but he wants to make sure barbers dont get arrested he wants to avoid risky "signs of too much freedom " the islamic republic of iran has long been known for its firm views on how women should look they arent to go out in public without a head scarf and are sometimes detained for showing too much hair now under a new national campaign to enforce "islamic norms " men too are becoming victims of islamically correct fashion hair gel is ok in modest dollops but hair dyes of odd colors are out as are shaped and trimmed eyebrows mohawk cuts and conspicuous spikes men are not supposed to wear cosmetics and they are not to wear ties ties are too closely associated with memories of the late deposed shah decency crackdowns are something of an annual ritual here each spring authorities warn women not to shed their head scarves with their winter coats and men with tattoos which are viewed as an affront to islam are ordered to cover up too police make a few arrests this year though the campaign is far more robust and reflects a desire by hard liners led by president mahmoud ahmadinejad to revive the lost zeal of irans revolution at the start of the crackdown late last month more than women and about men were cautioned in a single week according to iranian media police are now hunting streets and parks for immodestly dressed women and wildly coiffed men haberdashers have been told to remove ties from their window displays the fashion blitz has run into flak from members of parliament and even some officials but speaking at friday prayers last week in tehran ahmad janatti an ultraconservative ayatollah vowed to resist their "carping and cursing " outside the vast prayer hall islamic zealots handed out copies of hezbollah an intemperate hard line paper it cheered the assault on "indecency" as a "golden page in the book of honor" of irans police and reviled critics as part of a liberal plot by enemy agents many ordinary iranians roll their eyes at such rhetoric and predict that the fashion fury will pass as these things usually do until that happens however tehrans union of mens hairdressers is working to keep its members out of trouble "its not easy being a barber " sighs its chief mr eftekharifard a jolly year old who began his hairdressing career before the islamic revolution most iranian men wear their hair short and avoid any unconventional flourishes but a few youths particularly in affluent areas indulge in elaborate exercises of hair topiary "sometimes it looks as if theyve planted carrots or cabbage on their head " says mr eftekharifard some fashion conscious young men have started shaping their eyebrows and even wearing makeup mr eftekharifard blames the trend on satellite television and the proliferation of unregistered underground hair salons he has three sons himself but says "they have a good understanding of my position so never went wild " unlike the rules governing womens appearance those relating to men are more fluid there are no laws dictating mens grooming or dress only the example set by the countrys governing elite islamic clerics have bushy beards and keep their hair covered with turbans bureaucrats prefer short stubbly beards and pudding bowl haircuts they shun short sleeved shirts shorts and ties as un islamic the absence of clear rules leaves much to the discretion of barbers hamid bonakdar the manager of a mens salon in central tehran says a young man visited recently and wanted to dye his hair orange "i told him this is not a good idea right now theyll arrest you " recalls mr bonakdar who supervises five barbers he says he told the customer how to dye his own hair at home but urged him to wait most of mr bonakdars customers work in the nearby oil ministry and other government offices so "our work is closely monitored " he says none of his barbers are allowed to wear ties even though he says "personally i have no problem with them " barbers wearing ties are considered bad role models because barber shops here as elsewhere are places where men often think about fashion the tie went out of style when the pro american and often tie wearing shah fled in at the height of revolutionary turmoil men wearing ties were marched into city squares to have their cravats ceremonially sheared whether addressing the united nations in new york or meeting like minded anti western leaders from venezuela to zimbabwe irans president mr ahmadinejad never wears a tie nor do irans nuclear negotiators for servants of the state casual dress is not something reserved for fridays it is compulsory outside government ties do have their admirers especially among doctors hassan abbasi an orthopedic surgeon says he was ordered to dump his tie while treating soldiers wounded in irans war with iraq he refused "they needed me so they let me keep it " he says government hospitals now generally have a no tie policy but private clinics dont dr abbasi ridicules irans tie phobia as empty posturing "everything we wear is western shoes shirts pants " he says his patients who include islamic clerics trust doctors who wear ties says dr abbasi other iranian men including some barbers have come to see neckties as hip and modern and also as a thumb in the eye to conservative clerics authorities now are trying to get back to revolutionary basics at a shopping arcade near the british embassy in central tehran police last week raided shops selling ties the owner of one store says they forced him to strip clothing dummies of neckties and ordered him to take down an ad featuring an italian in a suit and tie he now hides his contraband neckwear in a plastic bag behind the counter the police unit responsible for maintaining public decency the department for the monitoring of public spaces has also been in touch with mr eftekharifard it wrote a letter asking him to remind barbers of the norms of islamic attire which he took to mean no ties a second police letter asked him to help halt eyebrow plucks and makeup for men so mr eftekharifard last week relayed the instructions to his members "we strongly recommend colleagues to follow police orders " he wrote see related letter "letters to the editor the great purification" wsj may
