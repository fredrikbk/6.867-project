hot topic obamas auto history barack obama blew into detroit on monday where he offered a tart indictment of "the tyranny of oil" and by extension the u s automotive industry "for years while foreign competitors were investing in more fuel efficient technology for their vehicles american auto makers were spending their time investing in bigger faster cars " he declared "and whenever an attempt was made to raise our fuel efficiency standards the auto companies would lobby furiously against it spending millions to prevent the very reform that couldve saved their industry " where to begin the democratic presidential candidate was extolling corporate average fuel economy cafe standards which require auto makers to produce cars that get a certain mileage across their entire fleet these mandates currently stand at miles per gallon for passenger vehicles and miles to the gallon for "light trucks" like minivans and suvs they were enacted in on the heels of the arab oil embargo and raising them has now become an all purpose political gesture toward reducing carbon emissions and dependence on foreign oil mr obama would ratchet up cafe standards by a year beginning in or about one mile per gallon per year congressional democrats are pushing legislation that would raise them to miles per gallon by and the bush administration is hawking its own more modest plan as well this is all the triumph of politics over experience since domestic fuel economy has risen by about the gains initially came through sharp reductions in the size and weight of cars think of the pinto or chevette since the s improvements have been driven by technological advances but over the same period oil imports have increased americans use more gasoline than ever and hence emit more as well thats because the indirect tax of mileage standards is an exceptionally inefficient way to influence consumption cafe doesnt affect how many vehicles are on the road a figure that keeps going up and by making cars and trucks more fuel efficient it may encourage people to drive more if you get more miles to the gallon then driving becomes cheaper so driving demand goes up and offsets any overall efficiency gains designing high mileage vehicles is relatively easy theyre all over europe and such cars have been introduced to the american market in the past consumers have plenty of such options to choose from now but aside from fads like the prius americans have proved unwilling to buy them the miles per gallon advances over the last years have translated into bigger more powerful cars with more features these are the vehicles americans actually want not without reason either there is a tradeoff between safety and efficiency the national academy of sciences concluded that cafe standards contributed to as many as additional fatalities each year because downsized cars are less safe in accidents other studies from the brookings institution and the competitive enterprise institute put that number significantly higher so much for senator obamas claim that fuel efficiency is the savior of gm chrysler and ford their problems rather are due to public perceptions of quality and to legacy labor costs pensions and health care cost detroit an estimated &# or more per vehicle than foreign competitors and raising cafe standards wont do anything about that mr obama generously offered to let the government pick up of the big threes health care tab in exchange for assurances on fuel economy which means putting taxpayers on the hook for union and management mistakes going back years cafe would only add to that burden on detroit the congressional budget office estimates that raising cafe standards by miles per gallon would cost &# billion per year which would reduce consumption by over years the national highway traffic safety administration estimates this would add &# to &# to the price of an american vehicle the united auto workers says it could cost the jobs of auto workers and auto parts workers what exactly would that get us in terms of reducing emissions or oil use almost nothing passenger vehicles account for about of u s carbon dioxide emissions a cut of is just this would not make a huge difference in domestic oil consumption either because passenger vehicles account for of u s oil demand so a cut reduces total oil consumption by these reductions are negligible compared to global emissions and energy demand senator obamas detroit speech was cast in the press as bold truth telling yet the quickest and most efficient way to deter gasoline consumption if that is his real objective is not cafe standards but higher gasoline prices i e through a carbon tax consumers clearly dont want to pay more for gas however so senator obama wasnt so bold or truth telling as to suggest that it seems he has his eye on the voter market more than the car market
