when a car behind him started honking and flashing its lights for him to speed up "that was the very moment i knew i needed to get out of the rat race " he recalls mr rumford went home that day in and dropped a bomb on his wife maggie remembering a bed and breakfast they had visited recently on pender island a tranquil setting with residents located between vancouver on the canadian mainland and victoria island mr rumford told his wife "i think we should go up there and offer to buy it " "my first reaction was youve got to be kidding me " says ms rumford who at the time was still working as the administrative dean of human resources for a local community college but her husband was persistent and she agreed to return to the island for a second look they both realized they loved the peace and quiet and the fact that they could see eagles and sea otters from the b&amp bs deck as it turned out the inns owners were willing to sell with that ms rumford gave notice at her job and a few months later the couple packed up and moved north "our friends and families were a bit shocked because we just moved lock stock and barrel " says mr rumford age who at the time had been retired for eight years from his job as chief of security for the golden gate bridge but now his children and grandchildren enjoy visiting the couple on pender island and taking a break from their own hectic lives the rumfords met in in san francisco bill had held a series of high stress public service jobs including chief of the police force for bay area rapid transit and member of the berkeley city council so he turned to boat building in his mid s to let off steam a "midlife crisis" in took him to tacoma wash to build fishing boats and he fell in love with the pacific northwest he returned to

through october the inn sits near their own home on the same property "bill spends a lot of time entertaining the guests and maintaining the property while i do the operations so it works out well " says ms rumford she has become something of an expert breakfast cook decorator and gardener even though she didnt spend much time on domestic activities in her previous life the couple who are about to receive canadian citizenship make enough to live on from the inn without having to tap their pensions the rumfords say theyve had no trouble adapting to a slower pace of life pender island has no stoplights but it does have shopping centers doctors and even a small community theater if they need to buy supplies for the inn the mainland is two hours away by ferry and vancouver island just minutes "we wouldnt come back to the bay area for anything " mr rumford says "here there are no memos staff meetings or board meetings its been a complete change of life for us and we are very happy " he buys he fixes entrepreneurs like gordon black never really retire the year old who started a market research firm in that went on to become harris interactive inc a prominent polling company tried to stop working but he soon found himself starting another business albeit one that took him in a completely different direction mr black took harris public on nasdaq in and spent five years as chief executive the firm long known for its public opinion barometer the harris poll made a splash when it became the first outlet to use internet polls to correctly predict the outcome of the presidential election mr black retired in with generous amounts of time and money on his hands but he soon decided he didnt want to spend the rest of his days at his home in rochester n y "i didnt want to stay in the middle of the snow belt and the high tax belt " mr black says laughing looking for sun and a place where his windfall would go further he settled on the island of st thomas in the u s virgin islands "i came down here because its gorgeous but it also happens to have an attractive tax situation so i immediately started thinking of setting up a new company " within a few months he hit upon the idea of starting a real estate business after buying and renovating a villa for himself and his fiancee annika van wambeke mr black decided to buy additional properties to fix up and sell "we bought a second house and then a third and my real estate business just sort of happened " says mr black who so far has purchased seven homes four of which have already sold he looks for high end homes selling for more than &# million that are in a state of disrepair some have been hit by hurricanes and then renovates them from top to bottom with fixtures imported from the u s ms van wambeke is in charge of the decorating and interior design mr blacks customers are mostly americans the majority from new york looking for vacation homes or retirement residences one of his properties a waterfront home with a foot private beach is on the market for &# million "people are ready to spend &# million to &# million on the right house " he says mr black says he is always on the lookout for properties and has real estate agents alert him when a house that fits his needs hits the market he works with architects and builders in planning each redesign and has developed relationships with u s based suppliers of furniture appliances and building materials importing every last tile window and dishwasher each renovation takes about six months to a year though one particularly run down house took months "its very time consuming but i love learning a new set of skills " says mr black who had never dabbled in speculative real estate before "after years of doing basically the same thing the challenge of learning about a whole new market is fun for me " not that he doesnt have any free time when not overseeing work on his houses mr black spends afternoons on his boat and travels often to the u s and paris where he owns an apartment he is also involved in charitable organizations on the island and frequently hosts friends and family "when you live in the caribbean " he says "you have a constant flow of guests " stress rehearsal while working for exxon corp in the s before it became exxon mobil corp charlie johnson a chemical engineer and manager found himself grappling with an unusual amount of stress "my life became dominated by anxiety and other worries so i started looking around for something that would help me and i hit upon yoga and meditation " says mr johnson who lives in vacaville calif he had dabbled in these areas at various times since college and now they offered something of a lifeline "at that point in my career i was very stressed out and i thought i would absolutely go nuts if i didnt do something " mr johnson recalls "so i made a commitment to do meditation for minutes a day " that course taken in the mid s helped relieve much of the tension that mr johnson was feeling and became the impetus for what is now a thriving second career after taking early retirement at age mr johnson began to practice yoga more fervently sometimes three hours a day in he started teaching yoga out of his home but his wife balked at the number of people traipsing in and out of their living room at about the same time mr johnson discovered a technique called "mindfulness based stress reduction " or mbsr developed at the university of massachusetts medical school the practice which fuses western stress reduction techniques with yoga and meditation is used in hospitals and outpatient clinics to help people with significant medical or psychological issues relieve stress tension and pain since the mbsr technique turned out to be similar to the blend of yoga and meditation that mr johnson had developed over the years he decided to begin training to become a certified practitioner in mr johnson started a small business called stress reduction training online at stressreductiontraining com that offers courses based on his mbsr training and his own experiences with yoga his private practice takes him to hospitals and clinics where he teaches patients to use yoga and meditation to relieve a wide range of conditions including heart disease chronic pain headaches high blood pressure sleep disorders anxiety and depression normally taught over a period of nine weeks mr johnsons course is adapted to each participants circumstances one of his students is a woman who is paralyzed from the neck down others are in college with high stress classes and coursework he also teaches in the workplace companies schools and public offices throughout the san francisco bay area hire mr johnson to help employees on site his busy schedule means he often works hours a day he says he doesnt make a lot of money from the practice but for the moment he hasnt needed to tap his retirement savings "sure im busy but the big difference between my new career and working at exxon is i get to help people overcome their problems " says mr johnson age some of the most gratifying moments he says occur when a person no longer needs blood pressure medication or is able to surmount depression "people come to me and their lives are falling apart " he says "if i can help them get just a little better i feel like i have done something great " it takes more than a village a year career in corporate marketing turned out to be the perfect platform for katie doyles second act importing handicrafts from africa to sell in the u s market but unlike her career at clorox co and mckesson corp where she was vice president of marketing before taking early retirement in ms doyles new career isnt about maximizing profits for corporate gain instead her company virunga artisan products www virungaart com directs all its earnings toward helping two charitable causes protecting the central african habitat of endangered mountain gorillas and improving the lives of villagers in remote locations in rwanda congo and uganda virunga artisan products imports products to sell in u s boutiques like hand carved wooden bowls candlesticks and gorilla statues as well as hand woven baskets from a womens cooperative in uganda all the proceeds are split between the villagers who make the products and the international gorilla conservation program which is working to protect the remaining or so mountain gorillas in the region the year old ms doyle believes that by boosting the economic standing of the villagers her business will make them less inclined to harm the gorillas or encroach on their habitat "we are not a nonprofit because we felt that nonprofit agencies have taken over that part of africa " says ms doyle who first became interested in the plight of mountain gorillas in the s on a trip to rwanda with her husband "so i started a for profit company to prove to the villagers and to the world that their products are viable sellable goods " when ms doyle stopped working she didnt immediately start virunga artisan products first she volunteered for the africa wildlife foundation where she offered her expertise in strategic marketing "but i soon realized i was working at the same breakneck pace i had been for the last years so i decided to pull back from that and just take a break " says ms doyle who lives in orinda calif on a small horse ranch during that downtime her interest in mountain gorillas never waned a few years ago ms doyle started volunteering for the international gorilla conservation program an organization she had supported for many years after being asked by the group to give a workshop on "new product development " she struck upon the idea of opening a company to help the local villagers build a better economic future for themselves "running my new company is basically a full time job but the rewards are incredible " says ms doyle after virunga artisan products succeeded in selling ugandan baskets women walked miles with no shoes to dance for her as a thank you gesture "i felt like the queen " says ms doyle who goes to central africa three or four times a year ms doyle says the most difficult part of her job isnt finding u s buyers for the goods but getting the products out of africa unscathed one shipment recently arrived with almost all the wood carvings broken to help iron out the snags in the export process she plans to offer workshops to the villagers about bookkeeping export documentation and shipping "i feel like i can help transform this region but i am realistic that it will take time " ms doyle says "but at least i can go to sleep at night knowing im making a huge difference in a very small part of the world " a potters progress sometimes a firm push can mark the beginning of a new life in retirement for tasha high now age such a push has helped turn a lifelong passion into a burgeoning career ms high was born in england in at age she boarded the queen elizabeth and set sail for the u s with her three children and husband who had been hired as an engineer at westinghouse in the years that followed she would move from pennsylvania to north carolina to california the one constant amid these changes was her love of pottery she first studied pottery as a teenager at the farnham school of art in surrey england later "when i was a busy mother and working i used to do it on weekends or whenever i could find a minute " ms high says as time allowed she also took art courses at colleges near her homes ms high retired from a career in administration at at&amp t in four years after the death of her first husband for almost a decade after her retirement she looked after her ailing second husband who died in not long after she traveled to new zealand to attend an international pottery conference there she met the successful british potter mary windrausch now in her s "i told her how my husband had just died " ms high recalls "and she very politely told me to get on with it and start taking my work seriously that was a turning point for me and for four years ive been putting my all into making a living from my pottery " ms high has a pottery studio next to her house in soquel calif where she does her own work and teaches classes she sells her pots through an "open studios" program in nearby santa cruz and via her web site highstudios com in some cases clients commission work though she doesnt make a lot of money its enough to sustain her passion "i make enough to survive go on trips to meet other potters visit museums and go to pottery conferences and thats enough for me " ms high says she specializes in pots with smooth lines and organic textures and shes an admitted perfectionist commissioned to make a dinner service ms high spent two years crafting the plates and bowls by hand until they were just right this year she plans to enter a few competitions to get her name more widely known in the art pottery world her plan is to build a substantial body of work before submitting it to a few galleries "sometimes i cant believe im doing this " she adds "because im living a dream " she notes that she spends hours in her studio almost every day "when you get older there are so many things you have to stop doing but in my art things are opening up for me rather than closing down " a man of taste after retiring two years ago from a stressful year career spent mostly in high tech sales in the silicon valley terrence reilly never wanted to think about quotas again but its hard to stop a salesman from selling mr reilly is now a part time "wine pourer" at conn creek winery in the napa valley three days a week he heads out to the st helena calif winery where he pours hundreds of tiny glasses of wine for day trippers and tourists and hopefully persuades them to purchase a bottle or two "what i love most about this job are the people i meet from all over the world who are all enthralled with wine " says mr reilly "i get to spend my days meeting interesting people and talking to them about what i love most " mr reilly has actually retired twice he left his post as regional vice president of sales at striva software corp now a part of informatica corp at the age of but went back to work a year later as director of strategic partner sales at cast software when his wife was diagnosed with cancer the couple had planned to travel to france to tour the wine growing regions but had to put those plans on hold while mrs reilly underwent treatment mr reilly took the job at cast to provide medical coverage for her care but after only a year at cast he retired again "i had spent enough time on planes and enough time living with quotas from quarter to quarter " says mr reilly who now lives on a golf course in vallejo calif "i felt like an old dog in a fast paced industry and i knew it was time to call it quits for good " his wife is doing much better these days he adds and is no longer in treatment thats when mr reilly started thinking seriously about working in the wine industry a lifelong passion for wine had once led him to buy a plot of land in californias amador county in hopes of opening his own zinfandel vineyard but he sold that after much of his "mad money" disappeared in the dot com crash "when i sold that property i kind of gave up on my dream of having a winery " mr reilly says but his new job he explains "has rekindled my passion for wine and i am thinking again about buying a property " for now hes content to work at conn creek with other wine lovers in addition to his duties as a pourer he helps with special events such as hosting wine clubs one of his favorite jobs is to lead barrel tasting tours "we let people taste different varieties of cabernet and then blend their own bottle of wine " mr reilly says his career in electronics started with a stint in the navy after leaving the military he started a company that exported naval electronic systems to allied foreign governments but he gave up that life in when computers hit the scene during the next years he worked in sales at honeywell international inc oracle corp and informix software in that time mr reilly nurtured his passion for wine traveling to the major wine growing regions in the world and building up a substantial collection one day when he was at conn creek purchasing a few bottles he learned that the winery was looking for pourers the job doesnt pay much but then money was never the goal "im working with all types of people other retired folks and young people " mr reilly says "but we all have something in common we love wine "
