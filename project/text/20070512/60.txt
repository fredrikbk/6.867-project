pursuits books dear diary after the lsat i ivy briefs by martha kimes atria pages &# recently in a speech delivered at new york law school "paper chase" author john j osborn urged law students to take back their own "narratives " although law school has become a kinder gentler place since mr osborn published his novel in students are still treated like children and assigned seats from which they are interrogated by professors wielding the "socratic method " but a lot of todays law students are already ahead of mr osborn the past decade has seen a flurry of law school memoirs such as "brush with the law " "barman ping pong pathos and passing the bar" and "letters from law school the life of a second year law student " into this crowded field steps martha kimes with "ivy briefs " her account of her own three years at columbia law school curiously ms kimess book begins in when she enters columbia and ends in in other words the world she describes is already at least years old the internet is just firing up ms kimes tries to download her grades through a dial up connection and racks up an enormous phone bill students dont have myspace pages and cannot text message each other during class big law firm salaries have been stuck around &# for several years they have since flown to &# and columbia is still the undisputed king of new york law schools the rise of new york university is yet to register in this world a reader might wonder what ms kimes brings to the table that justifies blowing the dust off a book that feels dated before the first page rather than telling a new story she pushes her tale along a well worn path the hypercompetitive grade grubbing first year the extracurricular laden second year the cushy summer associate job the unnecessary third year and the perils of the bar exam she meets the usual assortment of law school cliches the gunner the show off the sadistic professor along the way we are told ms kimes becomes transformed from a midwestern rube to an upper west side snob and eventually lands a job at a place she calls the lavish law firm this transformation is never really dramatized however and the cliches never really achieve the pleasure of farce ms kimes tries hard to breathe life into this account inventing details and dialogue although this practice raises questions about whether the more improbable events in "ivy briefs" really occurred like a last minute trip to slovenia at her law firms request most of the details sound true enough but the dialogue fails to catch the readers attention and too often consists of exchanges like this "hey rachel howve you been " "good good i mean busy but good you know law review and all " "yeah law review " in part such flatness is the peril of truth bound memoirs mr osborn chose to write "the paper chase" as a novel and not a memoir he has said because in a strictly truthful mode he could have never created such a wonderfully evil character as professor kingsfield unfortunately there is no one so interesting in "ivy briefs " for all its earnest effort mr stracher is the author of "double billing a young lawyers tale of greed sex lies and the pursuit of a swivel chair "
