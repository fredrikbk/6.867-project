dabble in currency markets in the past year at least currency oriented investments have been launched some are variations on mutual funds while others are completely new configurations such as exchange traded "notes" that can be bought and sold like stocks others are structured as trusts that basically invest in a foreign currency bank account abroad the latest move on wednesday banking

in the market manage nearly &# billion in assets up from &# billion a year ago according to data from lipper inc and the companies playing with currencies is a game for people with a big appetite for risk currency movements are notoriously hard to predict former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan once famously compared forecasting currency movements to a coin toss many of the new products are designed to profit if the dollar continues to weaken and offer little compensation if the dollar rallies instead still they have their uses for some sophisticated investors robert levitt who manages &# million for levitt capital management in boca raton fla says he owns some currency investments as "a way to diversify my portfolio " he has only about of his firms portfolio in investments like these he says the investment strategies can get complex some use derivative investments in their portfolios and may engage in short selling an investment strategy that is essentially a bet that prices will fall others try to magnify bets by investing borrowed money ross levin a fee only adviser in edina minn says individual investors are better off getting indirect currency exposure through funds that invest in foreign bonds or stocks "if youre buying currencies youre speculating " mr levin says the new investments also have some unique tax implications some use complex strategies involving buying and selling futures which can be subject to different tax rates than stocks until just a few years ago individual investors had only a few ways to play currencies in fidelity investments closed its currency mutual funds leaving franklin templeton investments as the only major company with such a fund the templeton hard currency fund which has been around since manages about &# million and invests primarily in money market type instruments of foreign countries but the dollars bear market has sparked the recent wave of currency oriented products since the u s dollar index which tracks the dollar versus a trade weighted basket of six currencies has fallen the euro over that same period has surged against the dollar in the past the preferred route for investors aiming to exploit the dollars weakness was to buy international bond funds that dont hedge against currency swings but these funds are influenced by any movement in local interest rates or bond credit ratings making them less pure plays moreover most dont reveal how much they hedge for investors interested in a pure currency bet the new products provide a more direct approach although they have only a brief history the results so far suggest that at least during periods of a weakening dollar they offer better returns than many foreign bond funds for the five with yearlong track records that gain when the dollar weakens the average return for the months ending april was according to lipper that compares to a average return for international bond funds over that same period but lipper analyst tom roseen warns that the period is too short to draw broad conclusions the dollar bear market has not only encouraged companies to create products but existing funds have also seen big new inflows merk hard currency

to the lower capital gains tax rate applicable when selling traditional mutual funds held for at least a year the interest distributed to shareholders is treated as ordinary income tax some other currency offerings aim to mimic a popular yet risky strategy called the carry trade which tries to profit from the difference between interest rates of different countries these strategies can quickly get complex but basically involve investing in various futures in countries with high interest rates while selling short futures in countries where rates are low carry trades can be particularly risky because they can unwind rapidly under certain circumstances two products that follow this approach are powershares db g currency harvest fund and global income &amp currency fund a closed end fund
