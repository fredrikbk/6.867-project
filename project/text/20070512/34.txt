encore a special report spending &amp spending some more expenses in later life are proving to be bigger and more unpredictable than many retirees anticipated how much money will you need or want to spend each year in retirement its among the most difficult questions to answer in planning for later life budgeting for today is hard enough budgeting for future needs often seems impossible which is why many people embrace a simple rule of thumb your spending needs in retirement will likely amount to to of your preretirement salary that assumes that about one quarter of your paycheck before retiring goes to taxes savings commuting costs and other bills that will shrink or disappear after you leave work we decided to survey retirees across the country to see what theyre actually spending in later life and whether the conventional wisdom has any value while we certainly found individuals who are living comfortably on about three quarters of their preretirement wages many retirees said their financial needs equal or exceed their spending during their working years among the primary reasons is discretionary spending for far flung travel and home renovations "the reality is that when people retire they want to do more than when they were working and had no time " says larry ginsburg a certified financial planner in oakland calif but retirees also are encountering some surprising expenses like higher than expected costs for homeowners insurance and health care what follows is a glimpse into several families retirement finances and a look at why expenses in later life can be bigger than many retirees anticipate phil karsh co founder of a denver advertising agency says the way internet marketing was reshaping the business prompted him to retire in at age about three years earlier than planned and with three fewer years to sock away retirement savings so far he says his nest egg is holding up well but he and his wife are spending just as much money today as when they were working though his financial planner denver based mark brown frequently urges him to cut back mr karsh and his wife have a monthly budget of just over &# the same as mr karshs take home pay while working one reason the figure hasnt changed much is the couples desire one shared by many retirees to help their community and family members early in retirement mr karsh and his wife found themselves supporting his mother whose own finances were exhausted in her late s she died in at age more recently he started making a new gift preschool tuition to his two grandsons additionally mr karsh continues to donate his time and money to several community organizations of course such spending even if unpredictable can be gratifying other bills are more painful after mr karsh and his partner sold the agency mr karsh and his wife were allowed to continue buying health insurance using the businesss group coverage but a year later the new owners sold the agency to omnicom group inc and the couple lost access to that benefit mr karsh now qualified for medicare soon after but finding coverage for his wife linda love has proved difficult "linda had a breast cancer scare six years ago its a big problem on her record " mr karsh says "shes fine it was a cancer cell the size of a pinhead but im now paying of my monthly draw in medical insurance its something i never thought about when i retired " he also has some regrets about buying a new house in when the couple moved from a two story home in an area where it was tough to get downtown to a one story spread with easier access to the city the couple mortgaged only one third of the house using an interest only loan to get tax relief but expenses tied to moving and decorating added up "if i had remembered what a money pit a house was i probably would not have done it " mr karsh says the couples desire to travel also keeps their budget near preretirement levels "we try to do one really nice trip a year spending &# to &# " mr karsh says last year they took a riverboat trip from prague to budapest here though some trade offs are evident business class seats for instance have given way to coach in retirement even small expenses can add up mr karsh had been looking forward to the day when he could ski at no cost that used to be the policy at many western resorts for people age and older but last year when he hit that milestone only two places near his home still offered the perk this year those resorts eliminated the benefit as well due to the increasing number of older skiers mr karsh ended up skiing six times this year but only after shopping around and finding a &# pass health insurance bills are also proving to be a bigger than expected expense for al and kay weaver retirees in brandon fla as is property insurance before retiring two years ago the weavers had done detailed planning for a decade using a spreadsheet with about categories they predicted that they would spend about &# a year in retirement not quite as much as their income just before mr weaver left his job in product distribution at a fertilizer operation that was owned by cargill inc until shortly before his retirement for peace of mind they planned to draw enough income each year to outpace their anticipated expenses by several thousand dollars using three sources mr weavers fixed pension of about &# a year &# from "inflating" sources of income as mr weaver calls them including social security payments and mrs weavers teachers pension all of which have cost of living increases and about &# from their &# million in mutual funds about half in individual retirement accounts their biggest cost in retirement medical insurance which consumes of their budget this year the weavers are paying &# for medicare part b which covers doctor visits and other outpatient care &# for dental coverage &# for a medigap policy through cargill to help pay medicare copayments and deductibles and &# for long term care insurance which the couple took out four years ago after their parents experienced lengthy nursing home stays they also set aside &# to pay uncovered costs mr weaver says it hurts to spend so much on health related premiums that said he and his wife see the payments as preventive care for their pocketbook "were paying more than we need to pay based on our current needs " mr weaver says "but maybe years from now we may thank god we have" the insurance the couples homeowners insurance premium is consuming more of their budget than before doubling to &# last july following floridas recent spate of hurricanes and they now set aside &# a year something they didnt do while working for a "rainy day fund other miscellaneous " this to make sure they can handle big one time expenses such as a new roof and theyve allotted &# a year for travel and fees for a time share condo they own in cashiers n c which is otherwise paid off they have extra money for travel stashed in certificates of deposit too on the plus side new expenses have been offset by a drop in commuting costs and other work related expenses mr weaver says additionally the couples daily activities cost very little he spends his time auditing geography and history courses at the university of south florida mrs weaver volunteers at a health clinic because of their modest daily expenses and conservative budgeting mr weaver says "we havent had to dip into the till yet " meaning withdrawals from their nest egg havent gone beyond what they planned "thats the only way i know how were doing its not like we go home every day and write down we spent &# on lunch " of course not every family is spending as much or more in retirement as when they were working frank sanyour age didnt get a pension from his job as a trouble shooter for mechanical problems in factories across the southeast today though he and his wife hilda are living quite comfortably in sun city center fla on about of their preretirement income their strategy an aggressive savings plan before retiring a move to a smaller home and a modest amount of travel and a health care perk that most people dont have is a big help in the s the sanyours doubled up on mortgage payments and paid off their house in richmond va in just years at that point they started pouring the same amount of money into their retirement savings the couple moved to jacksonville fla in and mr sanyour retired in two years later the sanyours sold their home in jacksonville for &# and bought a duplex in melbourne fla for &# the profit went directly to their nest egg in the couple moved one last time to an equivalently priced house in sun city center near tampa "i got bored" without any household maintenance to do at the duplex mr sanyour says today the couple live on social security and annuity payments their basic expenses including utilities maintenance and taxes total about &# a year but their spending averages &# to &# mr sanyour says because mr sanyour served in the military they have access to medical care and prescription drugs at nearby macdill air force base their only health care expense is &# a year each for medicare part b vacation expenses a large chunk of many retirees budgets are largely limited to day trips and short cruises that mrs sanyour takes with girlfriends their largest expenses for leisure &# a year for a golf club membership and &# a year for a social club both in their neighborhood are optional thus they can shift that money to health needs down the road if need be "we didnt want to take on any expense we didnt have to " mrs sanyour says "weve just been very careful to make sure our wants are never more than our needs " it isnt only the expense side of the ledger that may hold surprises in retirement the value of a nest egg can change more dramatically than many people realize in turn affecting how much you can spend thats one lesson david and patricia kicilinski in colorado springs colo have taken from their years in retirement in four years after mr kicilinski took an early retirement buyout from digital equipment corp he and his sister inherited and sold a farm in whalen mass mr kicilinski used his &# share to supplement his &# buyout package and to buy a &# cottage on cape cod mr kicilinski and his wife spent six months a year there for several years at little expense "it cost us maybe &# a year " he says the couple enjoyed visiting with nearby relatives and volunteering with a natural resource group doing water testing and raising shellfish "it probably extended my life by years " says mr kicilinski who beat prostate cancer early in retirement then came sept and the resulting stock market downturn which wiped out about &# of his portfolios value mr kicilinski says meanwhile the work involved in maintaining two homes was taking its toll with property values soaring the couple sold their cape cod home in for &# and paid off their colorado springs mortgage with part of the proceeds at about the same time mr kicilinski found himself worrying about losing any more of his savings he decided that he "needed to see the future visually what i was getting on a year to year basis from social security what i could draw from my ira and what i really needed " he started working with james campbell a financial planner in colorado springs to make sure he wasnt spending his nest egg too quickly eventually the kicilinskis left &# of their remaining &# in stocks and invested the rest in equity indexed fixed annuities now the couples &# annual income roughly the same as when mr kicilinski quit working comes from two reliable sources &# from the annuities and &# from social security where does the money go now versus years ago "inflation and vacations eat up the former mortgage and car payments " mr kicilinski says this year travel is the biggest chunk of the couples budget they are making several trips mostly in their lincoln to padre island texas branson mo cape cod and hawaii where they plan to cruise among the islands with their daughter and son in law ms greene is a staff reporter in the wall street journals atlanta bureau she can be reached at encore wsj
