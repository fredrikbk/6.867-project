pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies larger than life why caricatures can make some films soar and others flop the praise that i lavished on "waitress" last week included the observation that adrienne shellys film stylized to the point of resembling a cartoon "never lapses into caricature or condescension " thats certainly true and "waitress" is a film that deserves all the praise it has received still seeing the phrase in print got me to thinking about caricature a classic form of exaggeration that can be a powerful tool of social criticism and why it does or doesnt work in the movie medium what makes stanley kubricks "dr strangelove " for example the peerless comedy that it is and antonionis cheerless "zabriskie point" fall flat or to take a couple of films by the same couple of filmmakers why is joel and ethan coens "raising arizona" such an upper and the brothers remake of "the ladykillers" such a downer "strangelove " made in provides answers in abundance starting with the wild brilliance or more properly the brilliant wildness that terry southern brought to the screenplay southerns caricature like swifts satire was born of rage at the heedlessness of governments and armies at the perilous state of the world with the soviet union and the united states locked in a cold war that kept both sides perched precariously on the brink of nuclear annihilation yet kubrick and his cast transmuted that rage almost miraculously into uproarious black comedy that helped define the lunacy of the times theres no better one liner in all moviedom than the one uttered by peter sellerss president merkin muffley "gentlemen you cant fight in here this is the war room " and no more memorably preposterous characters than sterling haydens gen jack d ripper obsessed with communists sapping our bodily fluids sellerss strangelove a nightmare version of wernher von braun with an artificial arm that wont stop heiling or george c scotts nightmare version of curtis lemay the daft gen "buck" turgidson "mr president im not saying we wouldnt get our hair mussed but i do say no more than ten to twenty million killed tops depending on the breaks " by contrast the caricatures of american life in "zabriskie point " made six years later are distinguished by an absence of zest and the presence of malice or at least condescension its a dead movie about dead souls young hero meets young heroine in death valley the work of an otherwise distinguished artist who seemed to believe when turning his sights on vietnam era america in the animating power of lifelessness as for "raising arizona " the second feature from by joel and ethan coen the visual style is like that of "waitress " genially cartoony the cinematographer was barry sonnenfeld and the southwestern landscape is strewn with caricatures holly hunters edwina who thinks shell die if she doesnt find a baby to cuddle nicolas cages goofball husband ed john goodman and william forsythe as baby smitten escaped cons but the fun lies in the exuberant invention and the films generous spirit in the brothers most recent and ill advised feature "the ladykillers" the characters are coarse southern caricatures of the delicately comic roles originated by alec guinness peter sellers and katie johnson among others and theyre no fun at all generosity or the lack of it figures heavily in the mix jacques tatis monsieur hulot who first came to the screen in the "mr hulots holiday " is an indelible caricature from the period a petit bourgeois bumbler incurably insular and old fashioned hes also endearing and with his butterfly net and tiny jalopy wonderfully eccentric a one of a kind buffoon when mr hulot appeared in tatis "play time " however his charm was sacrificed to the filmmakers agenda in one of the epic follies of movie history tati poured his personal fortune into a film that sought to dramatize the emptiness of modern life by caricaturing every character in it extras included the result was dramatic entropy though the film shot in mm looks like no other in movie history see "play time " if only for its unique graphic qualities the next time a nearby revival house or museum series shows it in its original wide screen format i havent talked about the lowest form of caricature the ritual and often unwitting process that turns groups or individuals into laughable or contemptible but always recognizable stereotypes mainstays of the past included lazy negroes wily asians drunken irishmen dependent women and mercenary jews they were the products of lazy if not scornful thinking and they still turn up in the damnedest places i won seconds of fame for calling "the phantom menaces" jar jar binks a "rastafarian stepin fetchit on platform hoofs crossed annoyingly with butterfly mcqueen " in the hands of a comic virtuoso however caricature crossed with glee and audacity can yield sheer pleasure thats why we welcomed sasha baron cohens borat or will ferrells last two loonier than life creations the feckless nascar racer ricky bobby and the frowzy figure skater chazz michael michaels theyre creatures who never lapse into monotony morgensterns picks broad strokes caricature can be the first refuge of a tyro who errs out of insecurity on the side of emotional or visual magnification experienced artists however may also fall or eagerly jump into caricatures trap here are films involving some who did and one who didnt plus a caricaturist without peer petulia this comedy stars julie christie as a mercurial but melancholy kook richard lesters film took potshots at american culture in myriad directions and missed with remarkable frequency the director an american had done several innovative and hugely enjoyable films in england among them the beatles"a hard days night" and "help " returning to america to shoot "petulia" among the hippies in san franciscos haight ashbury district however he had either developed tone deafness to american idioms or was influenced by an agenda of alienation and soullessness that swept concerns about accuracy aside some though consider the film a classic lolita in her later years shelley winters fell or leaped into the trap of self caricature the whining world weary woman sorely put upon who still has a surfeit of love to give she could have done so when she played charlotte haze the mother of lolita in stanley kubricks screen version of the vladimir nabokov novel charlotte is woefully put upon since james masons humbert humbert marries her only to gain proximity to her nymphet daughter played by sue lyon yet winters is marvelous her charlotte is ludicrous vain and pretentious but also genuinely anguishingly passionate the line king the al hirschfeld story hirschfeld who died in a few months short of his th birthday was the pre eminent caricaturist of the th century and a singular figure in the history of art with an exemplary economy his drawings for the new york times sunday arts section capture the essence of their subjects in a few squiggles and fewer lines of black ink the great man seemed decades younger than his years when susan warms dryfoos interviewed him for her splendid documentary which features many of his subjects off as well as on the page
