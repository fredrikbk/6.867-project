pursuits travel the new way to do europe barcelonas charms without the crowds a mini prague in poland new discount air routes are easing the way to vibrant but little known cities wroclaw poland until a couple of months ago i didnt even know how to pronounce the name of this city in southwest poland nor did poland appear on the list of countries i intended someday to visit yet here i am very surprised wroclaw pronounced vroh slav turns out to be one of the jewels of europe with its medieval center highlighted by a vast town square a th century cathedral and odd cultural festivals each year wroclaw is a tourists delight particularly since there are practically no lines to get into anything even the food quite good belies the reputation of polish cuisine for being heavy and greasy im staying in a small old hotel tastefully restored its restaurant in a vaulted medieval cellar and it costs only &# to fly here from london a whole new europe is opening up to travelers thanks to the continuing expansion of the continents low cost airlines led by dublin based ryanair and london based easyjet a flock of new airlines are now flying to literally dozens of once hard to get to european cities ryanair alone says it has increased the number of smaller cities it serves by roughly in the past two years most recently adding zadar croatia and maribor slovenia in france theres the ancient walled town of carcassonne in the pyrenees striking beaches and craggy hills mark the town of olbia in northern sardinia split croatia sits on the dalmatian coast and dates back to ancient roman times girona spain offers gastronomic adventures rivaling those of barcelona these locations also offer better value certainly compared to european capitals this summer where the weak dollar makes visiting an expensive proposition near the ancient hill town of bergamo italy &# buys a room in a lakeside villa during the peak months of summer the same rate gets only a basic room in rome bergamo is an hours drive from milan but when i saw this town with its nearby lakes and mountains any temptation to go to milan quickly faded a dearth of tourists also adds to the charm right now americans are a scarce commodity on the planes of discounters particularly more obscure ones like wizz air hungarian tuifly german and cimber air danish at these small towns you can get in and out of the airport in minutes just the way travel used to be decades ago another upside is being able to take an easy side trip from a major hub visitors to london for example can see wroclaw too by taking a two hour flight on ryanair before the airline added the route the same trip would have taken at least five hours including a transfer in warsaw but be prepared for inconveniences that are so often part of these airlines keeping costs down discounters often use outlying airports instead of major hubs paris beauvais tille airport for example versus charles de gaulle some like ryanair have tighter restrictions on how much baggage you can check before paying an excess charge the infrastructure in some destinations has yet to catch up with the tourism influx arrivals at bergamo airport have more than quintupled since to million last year but new hotels there havent opened as quickly the boom in low cost carriers has already reshaped travel in europe though the market has so far been mostly europeans taking holidays and planning bachelor parties large carriers like british airways have been forced to drop prices on popular routes this week marks the start of a round of summer sales for many carriers with one way flights being offered for &# i took three recent side trips girona spain wroclaw poland and olbia in sardinia italy visiting these places is a very different experience than going to london or paris while you typically arrive in capitals armed with guidebooks recommendations from friends and stacks of information from the internet not much has yet been written about outlying destinations like these it can be more fun this way youre not weighed down by the obligation to cross famous buildings off a master list youve prepared heres how i did it girona spain what spanish city not far from the french border has cutting edge restaurants a wonderful old town of medieval stone buildings winding alleys and ramparts and a lively night life spurred by its universities barcelona population million isnt the only answer to this question theres also little girona population a stones throw from girona airport its also about miles from barcelona so discount airlines pitch girona as a low cost flight alternative on ryanair alone you can fly to girona from cities including london try doing this in barcelona or any other touristy medieval town in europe in girona i climbed the stone steps to the top of the ancient city wall and walked a good distance taking in the panoramic views i was the only person there without even having to buy a ticket for the privilege barcelonas famous walking street la rambla has a counterpart in girona but youre more likely to be sharing gironas la rambla paved with cobblestones and adjacent to a scenic river with university students not with tourists theres a th century cathedral on top of a steep hill that boasts of the widest nave in the world and theres an old jewish quarter steeped in history since jews were an important contributor to life in girona until they were expelled from the country by the catholic kings of spain during the th century spanish inquisition girona currently has about hotels with roughly beds total more hotels are on the way when i interviewed the director of promotion for the city she bragged that girona would be getting a new hotel this autumn a hilton a marriott no she sheepishly admitted it will have rooms theres a big bonus to girona and its a minute bus or train ride away the town is figueres and the bonus is one of the worlds best little known museums the dali museum figueres is dalis home town and this extensive museum captures all the wit and playfulness of the artist i laughed the entire way through beginning with the fuchsia colored building with its sculptures of huge eggs on the roof and loaves of bread and continuing with the s cadillac with a white convertible roof in the courtyard that rains on the inside when fed with coins although barcelona is known for its food no restaurant there gets more than one star from the michelin guide to spain but girona has a two star el celler de can roca when i ate lunch here i had a meal made up of many innovative courses with a complex mix of ingredients such as fresh sea urchin roe with seaweed and gelatin a restaurants wine list is usually a source of big profits but the list here offers something ive hardly ever seen the cheaper everyday wines sell at a normal markup maybe three times retail but the prized wines including older vintages are priced at about what youd find at a wine store why lose out on what could be hundreds of dollars of markup on just one bottle "thats our policy " says josep roca who runs the dining room "we want to turn our customers on to beautiful wines " wroclaw poland the tourist booklet at my hotel calls wroclaw a "mini prague only without the scamming taxis neon strip club signs and similar absurdities " for once it isnt hyperbole although its an insult to prague the czech capital both wroclaw and prague threw off the soviet yoke at about the same time both are lovely medieval cities with historic buildings an abundance of old churches cobblestone alleys and bridges spanning beautiful rivers the difference is that wroclaw is years behind it doesnt have fancy boutiques and a wide range of bars and restaurants yet "the brand name is still not created " mayor rafal dutkiewicz concedes "the pronunciation of wroclaw is difficult americans are not interested in poland in general " this lovely city is a walk through history czech tartar russian german and finally when the entire german population was forcibly expelled after world war ii polish some of the central square laid out in the th century was leveled by bombs in when the city was still known by the german version of its name breslau the buildings were so faithfully reconstructed its impossible to tell the old from the new my advice is to get there before the world learns how to say vroh slav instead of hordes of tourists i was able to meet people who actually live there one day at a food market for instance i saw local white asparagus a great delicacy in europe i quickly headed for a popular polish restaurant on the town square to see if i could order some the waiter said they werent part of polish cuisine but gave me directions to an italian restaurant for a few dollars i had a big plate of white asparagus that would have cost a small fortune in rome or paris where i could hardly imagine a waiter directing a potential customer to another restaurant wroclaw is so untrendy that it takes a while to adjust to the fact that buildings are renovated to keep them standing not to impress tourists with flashy new designs inside old shells when i walked into the art hotel where i stayed i was initially so put off by the small gloomy lobby that i almost walked out to find another but my room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom modern i realized the renovation had none of the glitz you see in restored boutique hotels in more fashionable cities perfectly capturing the spirit of wroclaw speaking from his elegant office in the gothic city hall the mayor and his project director igor chilimonczyk laid out ambitious plans to make wroclaw a center for upscale cultural tourism this despite the hordes of budget travelers flying in from britain some of them far more interested in polish beer than in museums "we dont want to be another barcelona " says mr chilimonczyk that might be wishful thinking late one night in wroclaw i saw several groups of british men staggering down the street still i found myself genuinely thrilled to be for once in a medieval city where theres no "must see" except for the cathedral that meant walking down narrow alleys and into courtyards because they looked intriguing not because my guidebook told me to olbia italy the elite who vacation in porto cervo on costa smeralda emerald coast are more apt to come in by yacht but on easyjet about &# can get you to the nearby town of olbia gateway to this stunning stretch of coast in the north of sardinia italy its a strange combination budget travelers mixing it up with the likes of european royalty and rock stars like peter gabriel who has a house in porto cervo at this glamorous coastal town your lunch bill can exceed your air fare a five minute drive from my hotel into town cost an outrageous &# each way by taxi on top of that the english speaking driver i hired at the airport charged almost &# an hour but if youre willing to forgo staying in the center of things life neednt be that expensive my hotel the grand hotel of porto cervo spread out on a slope above a rocky beach offered every amenity from tennis courts to three swimming pools even in summer excepting the peak month of august a double room can be had for &# a night and meals can be a good value if you know where to go my driver took me to a local restaurant called idea food piccola where in typical italian fashion our lunch took minutes as i sat on the veranda of an old house smiling waitresses brought out heaping platters of perfectly prepared straight from the mediterranean seafood the cost &# the emerald coast was developed into a yachting haven in the s by a consortium led by the aga khan and the stunning beauty of the area cant be ignored buildings had to be low density and adhere to strict architectural codes low rise with red tile roofs and buff colored walls they all blend in rather than compete with the dramatic scenery of craggy hills plunging down to dramatic inlets beaches and bright blue water just taking a walk looking at the lush green hills carpeted with wildflowers and the wild olive trees was a thrill the taxi driver who took me on a three hour tour of the countryside and villages between olbia and porto cervo kept criticizing the costa smeralda "this isnt the real sardinia " he said "this is disneyland to see the real sardinia you have to go into the hills " to make his point he drove me to the house he was building i could hardly believe my eyes it was set in a field blazing with wildflowers half a mile away was a village on the slopes of a hill topped with a small medieval castle this setting backed up his thesis that the focus of the wealthy foreign tourists on the sea was misplaced here just half an hour from an area where oceanfront land sells for a small fortune a taxi driver can afford to buy one of the most beautiful plots of land i had ever seen trip planner girona spain getting there gironas airport is
