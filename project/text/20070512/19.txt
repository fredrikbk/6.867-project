draconian tort reform would erase benefits of the plaintiffs bar michael krauss "tort eating contest " editorial page may attempts to advocate for changes to federal law that would peg product liability statutes to the state of original retail sale there are two fallacies to this premise first mr krauss acknowledges that "life in america is less risky than ever " this is the case because the plaintiffs bar in prosecuting defective product liability cases has created an incentive for manufacturers to design their products and warnings in a manner that results in safer consumer goods second a federal law that would artificially force the choice of law on product liability litigation to the state in which goods are originally purchased does nothing to incentivize safer products logically a defective product in state a is just as dangerous in state b since weeks months or even years might elapse before a defective product causes injury or death and the product may have passed to subsequent buyers it would be anomalous that the location of the injury or death would become irrelevant in the victims ability to recover compensation i certainly agree that reforms to minimize truly frivolous lawsuits are eminently reasonable however these should not be so draconian as to impair the consumers right to legitimate redress where a manufacturer floods the market with defective and dangerous products robert l stein pharm d j d irvine calif i suppose prof krauss would also require that any improvements made to products as a result of the lawsuits be incorporated into products only in the states where the lawsuits occur historically if this had been the case the pintos would still be exploding if the manufacturer were allowed to incorporate the improvements to the products sold in states that shield corporations from consumer claims the effect would be that citizens of the other states would be paying for product safety improvements in the lax states his approach is interesting for example i assume he is in favor of a local rule in his community that if one wanted the street repaired in front of his house or if he wanted police and fire protection on his street etc he would pay for it but he would not be required to pay for any of these services anywhere else in town i doubt a civilized community could exist in accord with his rules donald m feferman corpus christi texas i have a simple solution require all persons initiating a lawsuit to pay a filing fee of &# nonrecoverable in any award thus an attorney filing a class action lawsuit for people would be required to pay a &# million filing fee the small filing fee of &# would be similar to the fee in a small claims court bob ziller new richmond wis
