pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink dont do a danny devito a little limoncello is just enough a decade ago limoncello was virtually unknown in the u s outside of italian american families that made their own now the sweet lemon liqueur from southern italys sorrento peninsula is something of a fad one that had its pop culture moment back in november when danny devito stumbled onto a morning television talk show fresh from an all night limoncello bender with george clooney in todays bleary celebrity culture no sort of notoriety is allowed to escape commercial exploitation thus the announcement this month that mr devito is lending his name to a new brand of the lemon juice lets just hope that mr devito learns to drink his namesake the right way as mr devito discovered limoncello is deceptively potent at proof the liqueur has about three fourths as much alcohol as an average vodka but it is so candy sweet that the alcohol seems to disappear altogether yes that can be dangerous but i dont know how one could actually drink glass after glass of the syrupy stuff drinking well is a matter not only of what but when and how much the when used to matter a lot and seems to have become something of a forgotten particular for example you wouldnt want to drink a martini after dinner any more than you would have your coffee with the appetizer and how much matters for reasons beyond just sobriety a small cocktail or two before dinner has traditionally been thought of as a proper stimulant to appetite and conviviality more than that is likely to render one sluggish in both respects the when and the how much are crucial with limoncello in italy the liqueur is served as a digestivo a stomach settler at the end of a meal in that context one small glass is just the right amount a bright and refreshing swig of dessert but i find that even a single glass more is a hopeless surfeit limoncello is far too sweet to drink in any quantity thats why for me mr devitos limoncello endorsement is of limited value though i might well trust a whisky recommended by a man not known for moderation i have to wonder at the taste buds of someone who can take more than a couple of limoncellos in a sitting the importer that mr devito has hooked up with harbrew has made a sub specialty of branding drinks with celebrity names large and small for example they offer "bench " a five year old blended scotch branded by johnny bench five years isnt anything to brag about when it comes to the age of scotch whisky and its not clear to me how associating a whisky with a hall of fame catcher will sell the stuff more sensible is the iced tea concentrate the company brands with the likeness and signature of celebrity bass fisherman jimmy houston thats not to say that harbrew is only in down market products it has just introduced a duke ellington branded x o cognac priced at &# a bottle thats a tie in that actually makes some semblance of sense as ellington was not averse to a good brandy on its own or mixed in a cocktail in his autobiography "music is my mistress " duke describes a choppy atlantic crossing in the band was aboard a luxurious french ship called the s s champlain a passenger liner that would be sunk a little over a year later when pressed into service evacuating refugees with his signature style of embellishment ellington described the rough seas "you could hear the propeller spin and scream and then the boat would slap back on the sea with a bump and a crash " most of the band had crawled off queasy to their berths but ellington held on at the bar with trumpeter rex stewart "our drink was champagne and cognac half and half " ellington wrote "when the bar was ready to close we would order enough to last all night if necessary " which was no small amount of champagne and cognac given that they drank a toast every time "the boat tossed with an extra flip " harbrew is trying to entice cognac drinkers to try the ellington brand by offering free mp downloads of duke ellington and his orchestra the company is also relying on music to help sell mr devitos limoncello it is well worth visiting the harbrew web site www harbrew com limoncello htm to hear a lounge singer with a voice reminiscent of broadway danny roses lou canova croon "danny devitos limoncello its a taste of life from this famous fellow " ellington its not but it is delightfully over the top when it hits stores in august danny devitos brand will have to find room on shelves crowded with newly arrived limoncellos in trolling a few local shops i was able to find half a dozen different brands of these i thought the ones that came closest to the fresh taste of a homemade limoncello were the gioia luisa villa massa and toschi brands if youd like to try your hand at the homemade sort its easy enough to do peel fine shavings from the skins of a dozen lemons avoid cutting into the bitter white pith so that the peelings are pure yellow pile the peel into a glass container and pour in a bottle of vodka let it steep for about a week or until the peels have lost all their color before straining out the lemon peels dissolve two cups of sugar in three cups of water on a medium stove and let it cool add the sugar syrup to the lemon infused vodka to taste bottle your limoncello and keep it chilled you can make a similar liqueur using oranges instead of lemons or just about any citrus at all but whether youre pouring your own house limoncello or one of the burgeoning number of commercial brands just remember that it is best after a meal and that one small glass is plenty email me at eric felten wsj com limoncello  dozen large lemons bottle vodka cups sugar cups water peel thin strips of lemon avoiding the subdermous white pith steep the peels in vodka for a week or so strain make simple syrup by dissolving sugar in water over a medium flame once the syrup is cooled add it to the lemon infused vodka bottle and chill
