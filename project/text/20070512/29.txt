this " asks erics attorney rhoda ricciardi "i think everybody could have " educating eric involved a nightmarish tangle of issues he was disruptive in class was bullied by his schoolmates and faced serious problems at home his father initially opposed special education services for him years ago children like eric were routinely institutionalized in residential facilities and many received no education at all the milestone law now known as the individuals with disabilities education act brought more of them into public schools and wherever possible regular classrooms by mixing with nondisabled children the theory went special needs students would learn more behave better and gain social acceptance by about of special education students were educated in "fully inclusive" settings spending or more of the school day in a mainstream classroom up from in a special education student costs nearly twice as much to educate as a regular student according to the center for special education finance a palo alto calif research firm but like the s push to deinstitutionalize mentally ill adults educational mainstreaming has produced troubling side effects while many benefit some special needs students flounder in regular programs lacking adequate federal funding public schools often are reluctant to pay for the services such students need in many districts mainstreaming has contributed to high teacher turnover and classroom commotion perhaps most alarming evidence is mounting that special education students account for a disproportionate share of school violence and disciplinary problems in january john odgren a sophomore with asperger syndrome a form of autism was charged with stabbing a freshman to death at lincoln sudbury high outside boston where he had been

students students suffering from learning disabilities or emotional mental and physical disorders make up of the public school population specialists say most students with learning or physical disabilities make progress and pose little threat but difficulties can arise when students with severe emotional or behavioral problems are mainstreamed without specially trained teachers and aides or precautions to avoid overstimulation they say "there is nobody more pro inclusion than myself " says gary mayerson a new york attorney whose firm has litigated cases on behalf of special education students in states "but many school districts are using it as a pretext to avoid having to pay for appropriate special education " mainstreaming eric hainstock posed a major challenge to weston public located in rural southern wisconsin and to two public schools he attended previously according to school records reviewed by the wall street journal and interviews with teachers friends and family members tests showed his iq was average he showed talent for art and auto mechanics and had some academic success when he received individual attention but when he didnt get that attention school

held pending trial eric now feet inches tall and about pounds with brown hair that hangs over his glasses said teachers punished him frequently with an "in school suspension" in a band practice room

special education program where he might have gotten extra help either in his regular classroom or in a separate group to qualify for services for an emotional or behavioral disability in wisconsin a student must display related problems in school and "at least one other setting " at a meeting with school officials erics father and his second wife priscilla said eric was fine both at home and in the community mr borchardt says some school officials suggested that eric needed ritalin commonly used to treat attention deficit disorders according to school records his father disagreed asserting that eric didnt have an attention problem and behaved himself at home mr hainstock says in an interview that he initially resisted school efforts to designate eric as a special needs student because he was convinced special programs had done little for him "they just like to push kids through " he says "they want to get them out of their hair " in february first grade teacher rebecca colwell told school district evaluators that eric "gets frustrated and he wants one on one attention but in a classroom of or more students that is not very possible " in second grade he was temporarily barred from riding the bus for name calling hair pulling spitting and kicking by march hed been the subject of discipline reports that academic year primarily for hitting other students or being disrespectful to teachers that spring mr hainstock agreed to let his son take part in the districts special education program although eric continued spending most of his time in regular classes several times a week he got extra help with behavioral and educational issues in other settings he also began taking ritalin for a time teachers reported eric to be more attentive but his school work lagged when he transferred to the nearby wonewoc center school district in he was assigned to regular fourth grade classes despite writing at a second grade level school records show in a jan report the school noted that he had recently stopped taking his medication adding "that he is more likely to be off task talking and in some cases getting into trouble " he never resumed ritalin treatment mr hainstock says he decided his son was better off without the drug which he says made eric "like a zombie " eric told investigators that students had been harassing him and that the principal and teachers wouldnt do anything about it he said he pried open a locked gun cabinet at home to get the shotgun took the pistol from his parents bedroom and drove his fathers truck to school investigators told the court that eric "decided to confront the students and teachers and principal with guns to make them listen to him " eric has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge and his lawyers say he didnt intend to kill anyone they didnt allow eric to discuss the incident in his interview in the wake of the killing teachers began taking workshops on dealing with difficult children superintendent andres says his staff is still wrestling with stresses related to the murder and some teachers "feel guilty that they didnt do enough" to prevent the shooting under wisconsin law anyone charged with first degree murder who is at least years old is automatically tried as an adult portraying eric as a victim of his fathers abuse and schoolmates bullying his lawyers sought a waiver to have him tried as a juvenile but a judge rejected their motion last month eric recently celebrated his th birthday in jail where a teacher visits him twice a week for one on one instruction in a feb report his teacher patricia kelly wrote that he "has made progress in all areas of his school studies " he had mastered multiplication and division and earned an a in one health class and a b in another "eric
