pursuits books book review golfs toughest test the former vice president a handicap player on a book about scrambling to make the pga tour tales from q school by john feinstein little brown pages &# at whisper rock one of the golf clubs where i play in scottsdale ariz the members include about two dozen professionals well known veterans of the pga tour competitors on the nationwide tour and players on other smaller pro tours while i was reading john feinsteins "tales from q school inside golfs fifth major " i asked some of these pros whether they had any of their own stories about the pgas qualifying tournament the annual competition more commonly known as q school for places on the pga tour all these golfers had a q school tale to tell about their own experience or a moment they had witnessed in which a miracle shot secured one of the coveted "tour cards" or a disastrous miscue consigned the player to a year with no shot at the big time the worst episode i heard about was the one involving a guy who drove over his own ball with a golf cart incurring a two stroke penalty that ruined his chances listening to my fellow golfers accounts of q school was a little like reading mr feinsteins book either youre the sort of person whose eyes glaze over when a golfer launches into an elaborate description of a long ago birdie chipped in from a sand trap yards out or youre the sort who is glad that hes not skimping on the details the first group consists of nongolfers and probably a lot of casual players the second of hard core golfers who if theyre not swinging a club at the moment like nothing better than talking about it i fall somewhere in the middle i enjoyed mr feinsteins account of the q school competition but i suspect that many fans of his best seller "a good walk spoiled days and nights on the pga tour " will find themselves longing for that books adept storytelling as mr feinstein relates q school by had grown from a modest event that drew entrants paying &# apiece in to a sprawling competition that drew entrants paying up to &# apiece what is more q school now unfolds after a prequalifying round for walter mitty types dreaming of augusta in three stages with the first stage rounds played at sites around the country today the players range from hot shot kids fresh off their college golf teams to former pga tour players like masters champion larry mize in mr feinsteins book who failed to finish in the top money winners the previous year and were tossed back into the q school pool mr mizes year tour exemption for winning the masters had long since expired in between are hundreds of players all of them by the way terrific golfers by any normal standard who are not so green anymore yet still scramble to make a living at the game they love and who dream of finally breaking through to the potential fame and riches of the pga tour the difference between playing on the one step down nationwide tour and playing on the pga tour mr feinstein writes is like "being shocked at how much it costs to refuel your car versus how much it costs to refuel your plane " the q school is played with an undercurrent of desperation whether to gain glory or reclaim it in the knowledge that everything could hinge on one bad shot perhaps thats why tom watson never forgot his final stage round in when he landed his first tour card "my memories of that week are as vivid as anything ive ever done in golf " mr watson tells the author "including the majors ive won i remember every round and i remember going back to the hotel every night eating dinner by myself and thinking about what i had to do the next day " mr watson describes his horror after a double bogey on the final day when he thought he might have blown it many of the stories in "tales from q school" involve players who did blow it some of them through pure bad luck on the final round in peter tomasulo looked as if he was going to make "the number " as the players refer to the qualifying score but then walking up to a fairway shot on the th hole mr feinstein writes mr tomasulo "saw something he had never seen before in all his years of playing golf his ball was lying squarely on a loose piece of sod that someone had not replaced after taking a divot " mr tomasulo bogeyed the hole seemed "shaken " then double bogeyed and missed the cut heartbreak hotel stories like mr tomasulos are a q school staple but they start to blur together with mr feinsteins retelling of classic catastrophes like joe daleys two foot putt in which somehow went to the bottom of the cup and then popped out like a jack in the box he missed getting a card by one stroke "tales from q school" would have benefited if mr feinstein had told a few tales out of school what is life like for the families of golfers who keep trying year after year to make the big time what were the wife and kids doing while daddy gave it another shot in and what happened when he came home again without a tour card mr feinstein focuses so tightly on individual players that we dont get much sense of whats at stake beyond the implication that for many q school is almost a life and death competition the tense atmosphere that mr feinstein tries to create makes for more drama and his account of bill haass final round is the sweeter for it mr haas the year old son of longtime pga tour player jay haas seems certain to fall short of "the number" after a bogey on the th hole he birdies the last two holes though and wins his tour card weeping with happiness and relief but in truth q school is not quite the all or nothing contest of legend no doubt many very good golfers should have given up long ago the dream of playing on the pga tour and found another career but for the near elite missing the q school cut is hardly a disaster the top q school finishers qualify for the nationwide tour which gives them another chance at making the pga tour the top nationwide money winners automatically get tour cards just as if they had made the q school cut golfers ive talked to usually just shrug off a q school loss and simply vow to play their way onto the pga tour through the nationwide a great proving ground for golfers when zach johnson won the masters a few weeks ago it meant that now all four of golfs grand slam events have been won by players who emerged from the nationwide tour and just winning a tour card doesnt mean youll be able to play in all the big pga events many of them are invitational now which means that a player who got his tour card through q school but hasnt caused much of a stir on the pga tour is less likely to be invited than a q school failure whos burning up the nationwide my only other quibble with mr feinstein who refers to himself in the acknowledgments as a "token liberal" is that he spends an inordinate amount of time on casey martin the golfer who sued the pga tour in the late s for the right to use a cart in competition mr martin who has a degenerative disease that makes walking difficult won his case but by his golf game is struggling and he washes out of q school in the first stage mr feinstein seizes the opportunity to rehash the old cart controversy allowing mr martin to bash supreme court dissenting justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas as "heartless" and fox news host bill oreilly as "a complete schmuck " as you might imagine i found this tangent dismaying but as a golf playing conservative im prepared to say in the spirit of bipartisanship that "tales from q school" is full of heart it is also entertaining at least for the devoted golfer mr quayle vice president of the united states from to is the chairman of cerberus global investments he is a seven handicap golfer
