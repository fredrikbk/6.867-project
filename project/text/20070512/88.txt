the king of vodka anheuser continues to edge into spirits as beer loses market share anheuser busch cos took another baby step into the liquor business earlier this year applying for a federal trademark for the word "pomacai " which it described as a vodka a vodka rollout by the king of beers is far from a sure thing though a new entrant in the high margin category with anheusers marketing muscle behind it could become a significant industry player an anheuser spokeswoman said it doesnt comment "on products that may or may not be in development " chief executive officer august busch iv has said the st louis brewing company would look into all areas of the alcohol industry for ways to drive growth news of anheusers trademark application appeared last month in the brew blog published by rival miller brewing co the u s arm of london based sabmiller plc a miller brewing spokesman declined to comment anheuser wouldnt likely jump into vodka too quickly industry observers say it might first test a product in limited markets to evaluate its prospects "theyd have to be convinced they could compete effectively " and "they have not determined that " said benj steinman publisher of beer marketers insights an industry publication in anheuser formed a separate division long tail libations inc to develop test and market distilled spirits the unit has test marketed its first product a liqueur called jekyll &amp hyde in more than markets anheuser also began distributing ku soju a vodka like product distilled from sweet potatoes and made by a south korean company in seven test markets last year the moves come as anheuser and other beer giants grapple with increasing competition from makers of wine and spirits anheusers domestic beer shipments to wholesalers rose less than in the first quarter since the beer industry has lost about five points of u s market share to wine and spirits and one of the hottest beverages lately has been upscale vodka "with the acceleration of the high end vodkas youd think that would be an area anheuser would want to get into " said beer industry consultant joe thompson president of independent beverage group "weve heard rumblings about this for the last year and a half " one route anheuser could take in entering the vodka business would be to acquire a major distiller or brand or form an alliance there has been speculation at times for example that the company might buy absolut vodka from swedens v&amp s group a foray into the spirits business by anheuser would make more sense than a move into wine mr thompson said because selling spirits would better match the skill sets of anheusers independent wholesalers in spirits "there are fewer brands and fewer individual products and higher margins " mr thompson said and the beer distributors would be very skilled at marketing these brands he said the application for a trademark for "pomacai" might mean anheuser is exploring a fruit flavored vodka involving pomegranate and acai a fruit native to south america said mark swartzberg an analyst with stifel nicolaus when "you look at what vodkas are growing not only are they the grey goose and ketel ones but the ones that have flavor " he said with its branding and distribution skills anheuser has the potential to one day become a juggernaut in the spirits business mr swartzberg added anheuser has shown interest in appealing to consumers rising appetite for fruit flavored drinks having recently rolled out fruit infused versions of its low carbohydrate michelob ultra beer including pomegranate raspberry in some states local laws prohibit distributors from selling both beer and spirits but mr thompson the consultant said anheuser already is accustomed to selling its products in only certain regions it sells jekyll &amp hyde in states including new york california and illinois
