the new diamond hunters as debeers loses its near monopoly upstarts move in gaborone botswana like a lot of people in the diamond business tim wilkes used to work for de beers group which long dominated the worlds diamond trade now mr wilkes works for firestone diamonds plc one of a host of smaller upstarts remaking the diamond trade some days he treks out to the harsh kalahari desert where firestone is drilling deep to find new gems other days he works with a high tech zeppelin that floats above the botswana plains looking for gravitational anomalies that hint at diamonds below "i wanted to be closer to the action " mr wilkes says theres plenty of action to go around in de beers loosened its near monopoly at a time when the industry was facing myriad new pressures u s regulators objected to de beerss efforts to control prices just as consumers were raising concerns about "blood diamonds" gems being sold to fund violence in places like angola for consumers all this activity could ultimately lead to new diamond discoveries and lower prices so far however the opposite is true there has been no major new discovery since the s and meantime consumer demand has soared particularly in places like china and india at the same time de beers says its legendary london stockpiles that it once maintained to help control prices at a time they equaled more than a years supply of gems are now gone analysts believe sales will outpace supply by next year with the gap widening unless new mines are discovered determining what it means for prices is surprisingly tough unlike most minerals such as copper or zinc diamonds generally arent traded as commodities prices vary widely depending on the quality and size of the gems but analysts who follow diamonds say they believe prices have risen on average about to over the past year or so james picton a diamond expert at wh ireland ltd a united kingdom financial services firm says he believes it will continue "theres just so little supply " he says for investors willing to dabble in a notoriously risky field the impact is more immediate there is an emerging class of new companies that range in quality from "totally safe to extremely suspect " according to a january report by hoodless brennan a london brokerage firm many are flush with cash from doing stock offerings around the world among them are petra diamonds ltd african diamonds plc and gem diamonds ltd a london firm that raised &# million on the london stock exchange this year petra based on the english channel island of jersey has diamond mines in south africa and an exploration joint venture in angola with bhp billiton the worlds largest mining company by market capitalization african diamonds based in dublin is working on what some analysts say is one of the most promising undeveloped diamond projects in the world in northeastern botswana petra and firestone already have some producing mines offsetting some of the costs and risk of exploration companies working in stable countries like botswana are considered a better bet as well still the diamond business is among the most speculative of investments many firms are young or have scant track records and they could spend big on exploration without finding anything by some accounts fewer than of promising sites turn out to contain diamonds worth digging up so called synthetic diamonds man made gems once suitable only for industrial uses may also start to pose a bigger threat they are improving in quality and could give more consumers a less expensive alternative to real gems one of the toughest to measure risks is that consumers might start to recoil from diamond buying if they think their money is funding violent conflict over the past few years de beers and others have launched aggressive marketing to highlight changes in the industry designed to prevent money from being channeled to conflict zones last years movie "blood diamond " was a big test the film starring leonardo dicaprio focused on the trade in diamonds in africa and many people in the industry feared it could severely stunt demand but now it appears that didnt happen the industrys efforts include a program known as the "kimberley process" whereby countries certify that their gems dont fund wars earlier this month liberia was admitted to the program the process is widely credited with helping reduce the number of blood diamonds on the market though even some supporters say many loopholes still exist unfortunately it is still difficult for consumers to determine a diamonds origin and sometimes they must simply trust the word of a retailer that it doesnt deal in conflict diamonds in any case the diamond business is in the midst of a full bore boom particularly in southern africa the search for diamonds is getting more high tech clues can be found from observing slight variations in earths magnetic or gravitational fields in the old days diamond hunters strapped magnetometers to their chests crisscrossing deserts and other remote areas on foot in africa armed guards protected them from lions these days they prefer to do their searching from the air firestone is working on a joint venture with de beers that uses a zeppelin in conjunction with bell geospace ltd a scottish surveying company the zeppelin takes off in the evenings and floats over zebras and other wild animals with equipment that measures the gravitational field because a zeppelin can glide more slowly and smoothly than an airplane it is able to take more precise measurements the companies drill holes at promising sites to gather more information about what is underfoot however today with so many mining companies exploring in botswana drilling rigs are in short supply firestone reported a small profit in the six months ending dec primarily on revenue from diamond operations in south africa but it is hoping to find more exciting deposits in botswana including at a remote spot called tsabong "theres a chance we can drill" and find nothing says mr wilkes "but at least we have a few bites at the cherry "
