medicare offers overhaul of hospital reimbursing medicare proposed sweeping changes to the way it reimburses hospitals outlining a plan that would essentially redistribute cash by reducing payments across the board and then giving providers a chance to "earn back" money by meeting quality of care thresholds the proposal outlined yesterday in a page report to congress expands on existing medicare efforts to align federal payments to hospitals and doctors more closely with the quality of care they offer but such a change has the potential to squeeze hospitals already facing financial difficulties even as it offers monetary incentives to improve medical care "we think this is another step down the pay for performance road " said tom valuck who led the project for the federal center for medicare and medicaid services or cms "thats the heart of pay for performance if youre not performing youre not paid as much " as laid out in the report medicare would cut payments to all facilities by a flat to that money would then form an incentive pool for distribution to hospitals that show the most improvement or that meet or surpass certain thresholds on a variety of quality measures the plan dubbed "value based pricing " would require congressional action to implement the agency said the program is designed to be cost neutral to the government and could even save money if congress decides not to require redistribution of all the withheld cash lawmakers ordered up the report in as part of a deficit reduction act one hospital group that has previously championed medicare pay for performance programs sounded a cautionary note "we want to make sure what were doing here is rewarding hospitals for quality gains and not developing a cost cutting program " said stacey brown a spokeswoman for premier inc a hospital consortium that worked with cms on an earlier pay for performance pilot project she added that an incentive program "should not be used for any punitive measures " some health policy experts warn that incentive programs can backfire if structured poorly medicare makes up nearly half of some hospitals revenues and many operate on razor thin margins half of all hospitals netted less than in according to a study by cleverley + associates a consulting firm in worthington ohio reducing payments overall in order to fund the bonuses "is going to be a challenge for a hospital thats got a very tight margin and many hospitals do " said arnold epstein chairman of harvard universitys department of health policy and management medicare officials said they would monitor the program closely and adjust it as necessary and at the same time expand the quality criteria used to determine whether hospitals earn back the lost revenue "we want to make sure were not causing some unintended or perverse consequences " said kerry weems acting administrator of cms
