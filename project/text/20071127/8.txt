adding to woes of u s stocks pension funds are pulling back as the u s stock market struggles it is facing another head wind some of the nations most powerful investors are unloading shares in a big way several of the largest public pension funds have been selling billions of dollars held in u s stocks and others are expected to join in in most cases these actions are unrelated to the recent market jitters though worries about the economy the weakening dollar and the credit crisis could be accelerating these moves more broadly they are part of a long term plan to reduce stock holdings in u s companies to help fund other investments among the funds that are part of this trend the new york state teachers retirement system the new york state common retirement fund the teacher retirement system of texas and the florida retirement system pension plan collectively these plans control more than &# billion in assets recently the nations largest public pension fund indicated that it may soon join them russell read chief investment officer for the california public employees retirement system or calpers said at a board meeting last week that the &# billion fund could enhance returns by moving assets to foreign from u s stocks one plan calls for calpers to reduce its u s stock position to from of its portfolio which would represent the funds lowest allocation to u s stocks in more than years calpers board will consider the measure next month while some public pension funds are bucking the trend by keeping their u s stock holdings steady industry consultants said the clear majority many still wary of the stock market selloff at the start of this decade are cutting back "this is a long term systemic trend " said cynthia steer chief research strategist at rogerscasey a darien conn consulting firm "it isnt going to turn around soon " in some cases pension funds are increasing their holdings in overseas stocks to take advantage of opportunities abroad in others money is going to hedge funds private equity or real estate to help diversify a portfolio with investments that dont usually move in lock step with stocks or bonds corporate and some public pension funds also are selling stocks to add long maturity bonds to move their holdings more in line with long term payout liabilities these moves can take months or years to complete and are only beginning to show up in figures but such a trend is a potentially significant blow to the stock market which in past decades could count on large public funds as reliable buyers through good and bad times that support from pension funds is waning ms steer said the more sophisticated money managers at endowments devote only about to of their assets to domestic stocks compared with to at large public pension funds ms steer said but over the next few years she expects the figure for pension funds to drift lower with the more aggressive ones placing only of their investments in u s stocks even the conservative funds she said eventually will have less than half of total assets in u s stocks for most public funds foreign stocks were considered exotic until a decade or so ago although the more progressive funds dabbled in private equity or real estate the majority of public funds hewed to the traditional u s stock and bond investments the stock market rally in the late s attracted more pension fund money with many raising their holdings in u s shares but the collapse in technology stocks that spilled over to the broader market caused many pension funds to reconsider their positions in the market "the volatility of domestic equities is something weve been trying to mitigate " said jim fuchs spokesman for the new york state common retirement fund which has &# billion in assets the fund had of its portfolio in u s stocks at the end of its fiscal year in march but two years later after laws governing the fund were changed to give it more flexibility to invest that stock position was down to and could fall further other pension funds are only now starting to cut back on the u s market the teacher retirement system of texas holds a &# billion position in u s stocks it plans to halve that position over the next two to four years so u s stocks will fall to just of the portfolio the change is part of a broader strategy to move money into private equity hedge funds and other investments "it is a much better balanced strategy " said britt harris the new chief investment officer behind the decision the new mix he said "will achieve greater diversification as well as improve long term potential to earn high long term returns " the new york state teachers retirement system with &# billion in assets also disclosed plans to cut its target rate for u s stocks to from the move will enable the fund to increase its investments in foreign stocks to of assets from in florida the retirement system pension plan examined the potential returns relative to perceived risk for u s stocks versus other investments the &# billion pension fund decided to cut its target for domestic stocks to from in during the previous investment revision at the same time the fund raised its targets for foreign stocks bonds and private equity "our risk return expectations have shifted " a spokesman said
