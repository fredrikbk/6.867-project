predatory politics the housing recession still hasnt hit bottom and a new goldman sachs report suggests falling home values could cause a broader economic slump so right on cue by a veto proof vote of the u s house earlier this month passed a bill that would reduce homeownership thats not the stated intention of the "mortgage reform and anti predatory lending act of " but it is the probable result chief sponsor barney frank boasts that his bill will avoid a recurrence of the subprime lending meltdown that it might do but only by exposing mortgage banks to so many new financial penalties and lawsuits that they will refuse to lend to many low and moderate income homebuyers the companies that securitize mortgages by packaging and reselling them to investors will also have an incentive to abandon the subprime market because the bill makes them liable for any improper actions by the loan originators the bill bars banks and securitizers from "steering any consumer to a loan that the consumer lacks a reasonable ability to repay does not provide a net tangible benefit or has predatory characteristics " got that no one has ever defined what a "predatory" loan is but rest assured the trial lawyers will try to define it as any loan that a marginal borrower accepts but later cant afford to repay a legal analysis done for the consumer mortgage coalition concludes that the house bill "will likely generate significant litigation" and that lenders will "rarely if ever be able to dispose of even frivolous lawsuits" thanks to the bills subjective standards thats probably an understatement this legislation comes at the worst possible moment for the ailing u s housing market banks hardly need new incentives to stop lending a few months ago wells fargo home mortgage halted all subprime lending because of high default rates countrywide financial the nations largest mortgage lender announced this month that the number of new mortgages it issued this past quarter plummeted by from a year ago the share of its new loans that are subprime fell to two years ago subprime loans constituted between and of the new mortgage market now the credit screws are so tight that low income homebuyers without stellar credit ratings are finding it nearly impossible to get any home loan which will further drag down home values the broader danger is that this lending aversion will limit credit even for higher income home buyers who have less than pristine credit histories that has been precisely the effect of similar "anti predatory lending" laws at the state level a recent study by marcus cole of stanford law school investigated these "consumer protection" laws in georgia illinois and north carolina and found a sharp decline in new loans to moderate income borrowers consider the illinois "fairness in lending act " that law required credit counseling and byzantine regulatory requirements on loans made in the chicago area to "at risk" communities the result was a fall in home sales in these neighborhoods "instead of protecting hardworking would be homeowners from predatory lending the new law protected them from credit " mr cole says "within just a few months more than mortgage lenders refused to lend on homes purchased in the targeted zip codes " he adds that "home prices plummeted draining relatively poor people of what little equity they had in their homes " thats fairness for you mr frank a partisan democrat brought most of his party along on this vote but the real surprise is that he also managed to persuade alabamas spencer bachus the ranking republican on the house financial services committee mr bachus supported the bill in return for some modestly beneficial changes that would create a federal pre emption of state law claims against lenders but mr bachuss support made this bill "bipartisan" and induced some republicans to vote in favor these republicans may think theyre protecting themselves politically by voting against "predatory" mortgage bankers but they are now on record for supporting a measure that will make it more difficult for the working poor to buy and sell their homes while enriching the trial bar that feeds its windfall to democrats a gop political strategy of making awful bills merely terrible is a good way to stay in the minority for years ironically these house republicans are now to the left of senate banking chairman chris dodd of connecticut mr dodd said last week that he may leave it to the federal reserve to issue new regulations to curb abusive lending that makes far more sense than the houses rush to bludgeon a wobbling industry with new rules and litigation distressed homeowners are in enough trouble without the punitive mercy of messrs frank and bachus correction wells fargo home mortgage closed its wholesale subprime lending business earlier this year it continues to offer subprime loans through its retail business channel a nov editorial "predatory politics " said wells fargo had halted all subprime lending wsj nov
