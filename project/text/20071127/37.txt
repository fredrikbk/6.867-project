fcc cable regulation plan is at risk amid outside pressure internal squabbling washington a vote today on a proposal that could lead to stricter regulation of the cable industry was in jeopardy yesterday as internal squabbling at the federal communications commission and outside pressure from congress and the white house threatened to delay if not completely derail the plan the fccs five commissioners are scheduled to vote today on a handful of cable related proposals including a report that finds the cable industry is now large enough that the agency can set stricter rules over cable companies concern about the reports underlying data has made at least three commissioners reluctant to approve the report and has drawn unusual attention from the white house which generally maintains a hands off approach on telecom issues last minute negotiations over contentious issues are common at the fcc in addition to the debate over the cable industry report the framing of several other issues on the fccs agenda including a proposal on minority media ownership and a cable arbitration issue remains incomplete unless they are removed from the agenda the meeting could be delayed as of last night the commissioners were still haggling over details drafts of several proposals remained incomplete and one fcc official described negotiations as "a total mess " yesterday fcc chairman kevin martins four fellow commissioners were even "seriously talking about how to not have the meeting at all " another fcc official said a rejection or voting delay on the cable report would be a blow for mr martin who has come under pressure from fellow republicans and free market advocates to back off his cable regulation plan yesterday four republican senators sent a letter to mr martin expressing "deep concern" about his plan and noted that "it is up to congress not the commission" to impose new regulations a similar letter was sent last week by house republicans even house republican leader john boehner has sought to intervene sending a letter last week cautioning mr martin about the plan and noting he has asked rep joe barton of texas the ranking republican on the house committee that oversees the fcc to "keep me apprised of your agenda and the manner in which you treat all industries before the commission " a white house spokesman said the administration would have no comment on the lawmakers letter the fccs meeting agenda includes three major cable related issues the commission will decide whether it should cut rates charged by cable operators to lease channel access to programmers by as much as in order to encourage more diverse programming cable operators are required to offer leased space but it isnt used widely mostly carrying infomercials and programming from religious groups fcc commissioners are also set to vote on a proposal that would require cable operators to settle disputes with programmers through a new fcc governed arbitration process some cable programmers notably the nfl network have complained that cable operators including comcast corp and time warner cable inc are placing their channels on specialized or sports related tiers instead of expanded basic tiers which have more subscribers but the issue that is prompting the most controversy involves a usually routine report the fcc produces annually on the state of video competition for the past two years the fcc has used a variety of data sources including its own internal numbers to estimate that about of people with access to cable actually subscribe this year however the report produced by mr martins staff relied on one outside data source and it found that the number had increased to just over the threshold that triggers a year old rule giving the fcc authority to impose new regulation on the cable industry cable companies worry that mr martins report lays the groundwork for a future proposal that would force cable operators to sell channels individually instead of in bundles mr martin said recently he has no plans to do so although he has championed the idea of such so called a la carte pricing for more than two years arguing that consumers would benefit from lower prices and better service consumer groups including consumers union free press and the media access project are backing mr martin and arguing that cable companies need more regulation however the issue has drawn together an unlikely coalition of groups hoping to convince the fcc commissioners to drop the plan several conservative free market groups including americans for tax reform the u s chamber of commerce the heads of the four national television networks and minority and rural groups including the national association for the advancement of colored people and the league of rural voters have sent letters urging commissioners to reject the plan
