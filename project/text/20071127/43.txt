helping mental patients gain some control over treatment after multiple psychiatric hospitalizations mary blake decided she needed to set some treatment terms for times when she is unable to make decisions herself so she created a document detailing the signs of deterioration that others should watch for and noting her medication preferences the drug haldol ms blake knew from experience made her hyper and belligerent and induced painful muscle cramps whereas thorazine worked much better in the document known as a psychiatric advance directive or pad she authorized her doctors to hold her at the hospital rather than allow her to sign out against medical advice she even chose someone to feed her cat ms blake feels the pad has helped her recognize when she needs help and has cut down her time in the hospital the pad has also helped friends and family be better advocates for her with doctors "it was part of the bigger process for me to take control over my life " says ms blake of washington d c a public health official who is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder people have long used advance medical directives or living wills to specify what sort of end of life care they want but increasingly psychiatric patients are using similar documents to prepare for times when they are unable to make competent decisions with pads patients with mental illness can state preferences for or dislikes of specific treatments designate a proxy decision maker or make other advance decisions about care says jeffrey swanson associate professor at duke university who has researched pads twenty five states currently have laws authorizing such directives and more are considering them according to the national resource center on psychiatric advance directives "the underlying goal is to try to respect patients choices their preferences and their autonomy even in circumstances where theyre unable to exercise that autonomy themselves " says paul appelbaum professor of psychiatry medicine and law at columbia university there are a number of legal and practical limitations to pads say clinicians and researchers in practice doctors use their judgment to overrule a pad if a patient asks for treatment that is considered inappropriate or is unavailable says ira burnim legal director at the bazelon center for mental health law most state laws contain such an "override" clause according to dr swanson but to actually force a treatment or hospitalize patients involuntarily for being a danger to themselves or others requires following state law regarding involuntarily treatment which often involves a court hearing many clinicians worry that pads allow patients to refuse all treatment or make unreasonable or unsound demands there are also questions about how to judge if patients are well enough to create pads and what to do if they change their minds later if they appear to be getting more symptomatic debra srebnik associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the university of washington followed patients with pads over two years and found that doctors rated the majority of pads as reasonable and followed them two thirds of the time she and other experts say that pads are useful for facilitating communication between patient and providers and for keeping care consistent across facilities the bigger problem may be that pads arent yet widely used or arent physically available when they are needed doctors say delaney ruston a physician at the city run pike market medical clinic in seattle often tells her patients with serious mental illness about pads but she first assesses whether their symptoms are in control enough so they will be likely to listen to the information she says she helped her father who had schizophrenia create a pad she kept a copy for herself which she found initially useful when he went missing in she started calling the hospitals he listed on the pad as preferred but the hospitals which didnt have a copy of the pad were concerned about his privacy and wouldnt tell her if he was a patient there ultimately her father committed suicide before she could locate him clinicians encourage patients to have several copies of their pad and to give them to a trusted source email healthjournal wsj com getting it in writing for more information see national resource center on psychiatric advance directives www nrc pad org bazelon center for mental health law www bazelon org issues advancedirectives index htm national mental health association www nmha org position advancedirectives
