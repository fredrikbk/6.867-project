southwests new flight plan win more business travelers low cost airline will charge more for tickets with perks will bargain flier stay loyal hoping to wean itself from its reliance on budget travelers southwest airlines is dispatching a beefed up sales force across the country to woo corporate road warriors its a radical and risky change of course for dallas based southwest the airline built its empire on a foundation of low operating costs and cheap no frills flights and the new strategy could alienate regular customers but southwests discount dominance has diminished in recent years as new bargain airlines have cropped up and older carriers have cut costs and lowered prices meanwhile other airlines have gained ground by catering to business travelers who often pay higher prices for last minute tickets and they are providing such amenities as assigned seating first class cabins and private airport lounges southwest has drawn its share of bargain hunting business travelers over the years it estimates such customers account for to of its passengers but it would like to have more customers who are willing to pay higher fares winning such high end business travelers would give southwest the leeway to raise ticket prices at a time when its profits are being pinched by rising costs but winning the hearts of these notoriously finicky fliers will force southwest to offer more perks "that is admittedly the customer that is harder to win " says southwest chief executive gary kelly southwests new business friendly policies could also drive away the leisure travelers who have been loyal to the airline because of its low fare egalitarian reputation "it is integrity really thats at stake " says jim kane a partner in brookeside group of acton mass which advises companies on customer loyalty in the past southwests low fare brand has been so powerful that many travelers booked on the airline without even checking competitors fares mr kane notes by changing its democratic system "opinions and perceptions will change " he says but mr kelly says the recent changes are about passenger choice and "trying to take care of each individual customers needs " the airline isnt abandoning its model but updating it he adds understanding that southwest will never be all things to all people already southwest has announced a new category of "business select" fares that cost &# &# more one way and provide preferential boarding bonus frequent flier credits and a free cocktail in a tour of a dozen major cities southwests member sales team is meeting with companies to promote the new fare category along with new nonstop routes and more frequent flights that work better with business travelers schedules for travelers comfort the team is touting renovated boarding areas featuring sections with roomier seats and power outlets workstation counters with stools and flat screen tv sets showing cnn most companies wont be quick to transfer their loyalty from discounted contracts with global airlines to a domestic airline that still doesnt have assigned seating industry experts say corporate travel managers are evaluated based on the savings they generate from an airlines publicly available pricing notes kevin mitchell chairman of the business travel coalition southwest has historically refused to offer corporate discounts though mr kelly is mulling a change in that policy too in exchange for certain amounts of corporate business fourteen companies attended a white tablecloth lunch earlier this month at houstons swanky hotel derek where southwest salesman tony roach tried to persuade travel managers to make southwest their preferred carrier but phyllis morrow who is in charge of travel for centerpoint energy inc told mr roach she doesnt see how the recent changes will benefit her employer which would be footing the bill for the pricier tickets whats more she complained that preferential boarding for the higher fares means "my low fare travelers will be penalized " southwests response any fliers can get preferential boarding after accumulating round trips in a year southwest began lower profile efforts to appease business travelers in when it launched a special online tool that enabled companies to track their southwest travel in it appointed its first five member corporate sales team and it recently tripled the teams size to in response to criticism of its "cattle call" open boarding system southwest last month modified the process to issue passengers numbers dictating their boarding order cutting time in line to five minutes from up to an hour southwest also maintains one of the best customer service and on time performance records in the industry a crucial consideration for business travelers and customers appreciate that the airline doesnt charge a change fee to adjust flight times or rebook unused tickets the carrier has to steal only a sliver of market share from other airlines to reach mr kellys goal of boosting revenue by &# million a year with the recent changes but thats still a fraction of the &# billion in revenue from a variety of sources that southwest wants to add by its revenue last year was &# billion squeezing more money out of existing passengers will also help to do that southwest will need more people thinking like toni henderson corporate travel manager for houston based rimkus consulting group inc ms henderson notes that rimkus employees usually book last minute fares anyway and "business select is only &# to &# more one way " meanwhile though southwests longstanding low fare brand is already slipping in a study released by an economist at the university of california at irvine earlier this year southwests fares were lower only half the time when compared with fares of competitors selling tickets through the online travel site orbitz com the study of routes found that southwest charged an average more than competitors for last minute tickets though its advance purchase fares were an average less now southwest is changing its fare structure fares used to be listed on its web site in five columns with headings like "refundable anytime" and "discount fare " now there are only three columns "business select " "business" and "wanna get away " the new categories could alienate leisure travelers when they find that out of the three new categories "two of them arent them " says travel agent steve danishek of seattle based tma travel and if the leisure category sells out travelers may resent having to pay more for a "business" fare he notes that happened this month to some of his clients trying to book a leisure ticket home to seattle from florida in the spring though they jumped online an hour after their appointed travel day opened for bookings they found the "wanna get away" fares were already sold out on the flights they wanted "i felt cheated " says michele copeland who will be flying back after a cruise "there was nothing available for a good price only business fares " she says mr danishek wound up booking the copelands on united for &# each compared with the &# they would have paid for a southwest "business" fare
