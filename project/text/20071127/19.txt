condis road to damascus remember nancy pelosis spring break in damascus condoleezza rice apparently does not when the house speaker paid syrian strongman bashar assad a call back in april president bush denounced her for sending "mixed signals" that "lead the assad government to believe they are part of the mainstream of the international community when in fact they are a state sponsor of terror " today said sponsor of terror will take its place at the table ms rice has set for the middle eastern conference at the naval academy in annapolis md only at foggy bottom would syrias last minute decision to go to annapolis be considered a diplomatic triumph the meeting is supposed to inaugurate the resumption of high level negotiations between israelis and palestinians with a view toward finalizing a deal on palestinian statehood before the administration leaves office on a deeper plane of geopolitical subtlety it is supposed to bring israel and the arab world together in tacit alliance against iran this raises three significant questions first how does syrias presence at annapolis affect those goals next how does syrias presence affect u s policy toward syria and what effect if any will all this have on syrias behavior in the region much is being made of the fact that in accepting the administrations invitation syria apparently reversed a previous decision coordinated with iran to boycott the conference this plays into the view that syria can be persuaded to abandon its year old ties to iran and return to the arab fold thereby severing the encircling chain that links tehran to damascus to southern lebanon to the gaza strip high profile ridicule of the conference by irans mahmoud ahmadinejad who called it "useless" and spokesmen for hezbollah and hamas add to the impression that mr assad may be prepared to chart an independent course all for the modest price of the u s agreeing with israels consent to put the issue of the golan heights on the conferences agenda it really would be something if the syrian delegation could find their own road to damascus on the shores of the chesapeake bay but that would require something approximating good faith the syrians decision to be represented at annapolis by their deputy foreign minister his bosses evidently having more important things to do is one indication of the lack of it so is the assad regimes declaration via an editorial in state newspaper teshreen that their goal at annapolis is "to foil israeli prime minister ehud olmerts plan to force arab countries to recognize israel as a jewish state " and lest the point hadnt been driven home forcefully enough the syrian information minister told al jazeera that syrias attendance would have no effect on its relations with iran or its role as host to the leadership of hamas and other palestinian terrorist groups at best then syria will attend annapolis as a kind of non malignant observer lending a gloss of pan arab seriousness to the proceedings at worst it will be there as a spoiler and unofficial spokesman of hamas hezbollah and iran if its clever it will adopt a policy of studied ambivalence with just enough positive chemistry to induce the administration into believing it might yet be prepared for a real volte face provided the u s is also prepared to rewrite its syria policy recent attestations by gen david petraeus that damascus is finally policing its border with iraq to slow the infiltration of jihadis suggest thats just the game they mean to play what price will the u s be asked to pay contrary to popular belief recovering the golan is neither syrias single nor primary goal if anything the regime derives much of its domestic legitimacy by keeping this grievance alive whats urgently important to damascus is that the u n tribunal investigating the murder of lebanese prime minister rafik hariri be derailed before the extensive evidence implicating mr assad and his cronies becomes a binding legal verdict no less important to mr assad is that his grip on lebanese politics be maintained by the selection of a pliant president to replace his former puppet emile lahoud syria would also like to resume normal diplomatic relations with the u s which withdrew its ambassador from damascus after hariris killing not least by the lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the syria accountability act no doubt the syrians believe the u s can deliver on these items dictators rarely appreciate the constraints under which democratic governments operate yet there is no credible way the u s can deliver on the first demand and only discreditable ways in which it could deliver on the second the administration may be tempted to re establish normal diplomatic relations and ease sanctions which is about as much as it can do yet damascus would view these concessions either as signs of niggardliness or desperation and hold out for more put simply there is nothing the u s can offer mr assad that would seriously tempt him to alter his behavior in ways that could meaningfully advance u s interests or the cause of mideast peace yet the fact that ms rices syria policy is now a facsimile of speaker pelosis confirms mr assads long held view that he has nothing serious to fear from this administration so look out for more aggressive syrian misbehavior in lebanon including the continued arming of hezbollah the paralysis of its political process the assassination of anti syrian parliamentarians and journalists the insertion of sunni terrorist cells in palestinian refugee camps and the outright seizure of lebanons eastern hinterlands look out too for continued cooperation with north korea on wmd projects despite israels september attack on an apparent nuclear facility the ap reports that north korean technicians are back in syria teaching their arab pupils how to load chemical warheads on ballistic missiles and dont hold your breath expecting syrias good behavior on its iraqi frontier to last much longer in the meantime we have the annapolis conference and the one day photo op it provides ms rice in the spirit of giving credit where its due the least the secretary can do is invite the speaker to the party
