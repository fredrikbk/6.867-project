the doctors office when patient calls at years end so do the ills of the health system online edition the end of the year brings a flurry of activity to the doctors office retailers have the friday after thanksgiving sales rush my office has a rush of patients struggling with the dysfunctional health care system were trying to help everyone before the new year rolls around when deductibles are reset new plans are chosen and the prices go up we didnt design this patchwork system with perverse incentives and disincentives to care but were dealing with it my year old patient is having pelvic pain from endometriosis and will probably need pelvic surgery she would like to have her surgery before her &# deductible resets but she cant get into the endometriosis specialist until mid january my nurse called and tried to get her worked in but no luck well try to call next week to see if theres been a cancellation i had better luck recently removing a fatty lump from a year old mans arm he was changing insurance at the end of the year and the lump was a small pre existing condition on his "pre existing" arm it wasnt bothering him at the time but we figured his new insurance wouldnt cover its removal in the future if the lump became a problem we took it off on short notice before his coverage switched some patients cant beat the end of the year clock my elderly patient with congestive heart failure is in the so called donut hole part of her medicare prescription plan when her coverage lapses and she wont be able to afford her medication again until the new year begins recently unable to afford her medication refills she was hospitalized for fluid retention and severe shortness of breath after stopping her diuretics so medicare traded a convoluted end of the year cost sharing provision for a &# hospitalization the prescription drug program makes a profit but medicare takes the fall because of the gaps in coverage caused by an end of the year cost shift to the patient as the year closes out im also seeing more self insured patients with chronic diseases avoiding care a patient in his s has asthma and allergies that have been acting up he could really use a flu shot a pneumonia vaccine and a breathing test called spirometry to help us better manage his asthma i havent seen him since last fall but he wants medications refilled for a year without a check up and without being seen hes been healthy enough to avoid the doctor or the hospital this year and is trying to make it to the end of the year he tried the same thing last year hes avoiding the preventive care and advice that would lower his risk of hospitalization because of the deductible costs and lost income from work to come to the office my patient with chronic kidney disease has put off seeing his nephrologist for five years because he has a &# deductible and hes self employed his personal health insurance premiums are more than &# a year despite his high deductible i want him to come in for control of his blood pressure every six months he usually stretches it to months hes debated dropping the insurance and just paying for the kidney transplant that hell probably need in the next five to years but the company already has years of his premium dollars and he would be uninsurable by anyone else so far hes made it eight years and counting with the blood pressure and cholesterol medication i refill for him once a year wed have better chances delaying the transplant even further if his insurance helped him out more on preventive coverage another patient will start the new year uninsured she transitioned from the workplace to being a stay at home mom during her third pregnancy she missed the deadline to apply for cobra coverage but she couldnt afford the cobra coverage anyway the private plans she contacted wouldnt accept her because she was pregnant although her husband is self employed and could afford private insurance she is uninsurable because of a normal pregnancy her most viable option at this point is to apply for medicaid she might have to declare that shes separated from her husband to get it but ive seen people do that before experiences like this will drive soccer moms to vote for nationalized health care people who dont favor an expansion of socialized medicine should convince the insurance industry to figure out how to meet peoples needs without driving people to avoid preventive care and play beat the clock to improve medical care in this country we need to close the gaps in coverage so that private insurance and the public dont have to play shell games to cover the basics liking having a baby and treating chronic diseases like asthma and kidney failure due to his schedule and the volume of email he receives dr brewer may not be able to respond to all reader email he does participate in his forum where readers are urged to post his email address is thedoctorsoffice wsj com
