indias defense ministry which controls the frequencies available for cellphone service isnt willing to release as many as the ministry of communication and it wants defense officials want to shift their communications largely to a secure fiber optic network before giving up more frequencies to telecom outfits they also want telecom companies and the communications ministry or both to help bear the cost of the shift wrangling over the issue has gone on for more than two years some telecom companies are trying to compensate for the lack of bandwidth by building more towers to enhance the utility of their available spectrum but this raises capital expenditure analysts said "these are trying times for indias telecom companies " said brijesh rajvanshi an analyst at networth stock broking
