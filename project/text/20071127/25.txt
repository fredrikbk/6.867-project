drawing a bead on the founders intentions the opening sentence of your article "court sets its scope on handgun ban " weekend journal nov suggests a misunderstanding of the constitution and the bill of rights the second amendment does not "grant" any right to own firearms it affirms and guarantees the pre existing right to keep and bear arms and yes as your editorial board opines on another page in the same issue it is an individual not a collective right colin g haza austin texas ive always thought that the argument over the right of the individual to possess a handgun for self defense is misplaced in the second amendment the primary purpose of the bill of rights is to protect the individual from a tyrannical central government what more positive defense from such an outcome is there than an armed populace the right to personal self defense resides at a higher level according to the declaration of independence all men are "endowed by their creator" with certain "inalienable rights " including "life " if one has a right to life one obviously has a right to reasonably defend that life if that right is "inalienable" and endowed by ones creator then no mere government can abridge that right the argument then devolves to whether a hand gun is a reasonable means of self defense for the average citizen i would say yes its obvious i realize the above argument doesnt apply to atheists and is problematical for agnostics and fetuses but then thats why we have a supreme court tim ohare bel air md mike cox "second amendment showdown" op ed nov mounts a strong defense of the position that the second amendment protects the rights of individuals to keep and bear arms many of these arguments have been stated before however i have never seen any argument which explains why the introductory phrase "a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state " can be disregarded or ignored in proposing his position it seems odd to me that the drafters of this amendment would take the time to insert this preamble without some reason if mr cox has as strong an explanation of its presence and how it aligns with his position i might reconsider my opposition to his proposition jeffrey kroll fair lawn n j lets use english sentence structure the second part of the sentence suggests everyone who is part of a regulated state militia is free to bear arms whether this means the israeli model of every citizen over being a member of the military subject to instant draft or a bunch of individual arms owners who show up when called is up to the individual state i dont think it has much to do with full gun racks in a pickup truck lets remember the document doesnt begin "me the people " stephen boyle jersey city n j i think that both sides of the argument over the meaning of the second amendment have missed a very important point with respect to "the militia " the quote below is from title united states code and appears to me to defeat the argument of the "collective right" side which claims that the militia consists only of the national guard title u s code chapter section "the militia of the united states consists of all able bodied males at least years of age the classes of the militia are the organized militia which consists of the national guard and naval militia and the unorganized militia which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the national guard or naval militia " charles cutshaw florence ala why was the second amendment placed second not third sixth or tenth the founders had a reason for this placement that "bears" on the importance and meaning of this amendment and this speaks to individual rights not collective rights the reason for its placement as the second amendment was to remind governments of actions taken when governments forget the first amendment one would hope the court will keep it dale bartley ph d san rafael calif
