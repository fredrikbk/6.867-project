the missing ambassadors secretary of state condoleezza rice must take some satisfaction in having corralled so many arab potentates to sit down with archenemy israel at todays conference in annapolis maryland maybe she can follow up by having these same potentates come to terms with their other apparent archenemy to wit iraq "not a single arab ambassador" is represented in baghdad today a senior u s diplomat in iraq noted in a telephone interview last week ostensibly the arab complaint is that the iraqi government is led by sectarian shiites who have failed to look after the interests of iraqs sunnis that would be more credible if prime minister nouri al maliki werent meeting regularly with the sunni sheiks from the anbar awakening council and if billions in oil revenue werent flowing from the central government to the provinces the arabs do have a legitimate fear of putting their diplomatic staff at risk particularly after terrorist attacks on the egyptian jordanian and omani embassies but they are no more at risk than the rest of the diplomatic corps serving in baghdad and with the "surge" of the last few months even antiwar journalists are acknowledging the major security improvements which brings us to what is perhaps the real motive underlying the arab worlds rejection of its "brother" state iraq a functional muslim democracy federalized pluralist majority led and imposed by american arms is a worrying precedent for the autocratic houses of assad saud and mubarak if these arab leaders dont want the world to conclude they want a failed iraq its time they sent envoys to work with that countrys duly elected government
