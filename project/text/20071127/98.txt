tax cuts gain relevance as outlook dims so far tax cuts have seemed largely a pro forma campaign plank for republican presidential candidates call for extending president bushs tax cuts establish your reaganite credentials and move on until now that is with the economy heading toward an election year slump or worse tax cuts to stimulate the economy are starting to look better and better as an item on the campaign menu this change is being driven by the ugly realities of the real world the subprime lending mess is getting worse not better housing prices are falling oil prices are rising lenders are tightening the credit spigot the federal reserves ability to keep cutting interest rates may be constrained by a plunging dollar and the stock market took another big hit yesterday the full impact of all this on the economy is only beginning to be felt a slowdown is inevitable and a growing number of analysts are beginning to utter the dreaded "r" word a recession in the middle of the presidential campaign would be a game changer for both parties for republicans the bad news is that they inevitably would shoulder much of the blame because they control the white house the good news for them is that they can start pushing tax cuts as a way to spur a slumping economy thats a better argument than pushing tax cuts for their own sake which is pretty much where republicans have been the moment may be meeting the message for democrats the tax cut question will be the opposite if the economy is perilously close to recession do you really want to propose tax increases and a tax increase is precisely how republicans portray any move to undo the bush tax cuts "if youre heading toward a slowdown and a credit market problem you certainly dont want to be doing what some guys on the other team are doing which is proposing a tax increase " says lawrence lindsey an economic adviser to the presidential effort of former sen fred thompson and an architect of the bush tax cuts of course democrats arent simply going to concede that argument look for democratic candidates to begin portraying their own proposals for more modest middle class tax relief as a stimulant for a sagging economy not just as good medicine for middle america all told the ground is shifting and fast just this week former treasury secretary lawrence summers in a column in the financial times declared a recession now more likely than not "even if necessary changes in policy are implemented " he wrote "the odds now favor a u s recession that slows growth significantly on a global basis " and mr summers a democrat in good standing who led the treasury department for president clinton suggests that this at least puts tax cuts on the table "as important as long run deficit reduction is fiscal policy needs to be on standby to provide immediate temporary stimulus through spending or tax benefits for low and middle income families if the situation worsens " the costly war in iraq makes it harder to push tax cuts without addressing that nagging problem of the federal budget deficit but as third party presidential candidate ross perot discovered in the s the deficit has a limited impact on voters a recession on the other hand is the sort of event that hits voters between the eyes and leaves them looking for immediate answers for much of this year republicans have been pushing their ideas for tax reform as much as their proposals for tax cuts mr thompson for instance has just unveiled his full tax plan which calls for extending president bushs cuts reducing the corporate tax rate and permanently repealing the estate and alternative minimum taxes all of that would cost the government revenue in the short run and add to deficit worries but the new wrinkle mr thompson has just added is a proposal for a voluntary flat tax taxpayers would have the option of paying a flat income tax with two rates for joint filers that would be for incomes up to &# and above that as that suggests the republican tax message has to some extent been bifurcated to the republican base candidates offer tax cuts to the center of the electorate the message has been as much about simplifying the tax code on the grounds that it is inefficient and widely hated the changing economic picture is likely to alter those calculations prompting candidates to increasingly frame their tax proposals as a way to stem the economic slide brought about by the housing mess it is unlikely democrats can avoid the temptation to join in their argument probably will be that republicans with their plans to extend tax cuts for upper income americans and keep down tax rates on dividends and capital gains are stimulating the wrong end of the economy the upper income end already sen barack obama has proposed tax cuts aimed at the middle class including a &# per family tax cut to offset rising payroll taxes sen hillary clinton is pushing for tax cuts to help families save for retirement and tax
