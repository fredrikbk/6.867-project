the evening wrap fcc stiff armed online edition when it comes to broadcast television the fcc is the law and challenging its authority is usually a losing proposition but for cable operators the long arm of the regulator was stopped short today in its bid to gain more control over their industry fcc chairman kevin martin acknowledged that he was unable to get the backing from a majority of commissioners for a report on cables market share that would have given the fcc more control over the industry at issue is data from publishing group warren communications that fcc officials said proved that the so called threshold had been met if of u s households have access to a cable provider offering or more channels and of that population in turn subscribes to cable then the threshold is met and the fcc can boost its authority cable companies say the report is wrong and that the level hasnt yet been reached both republicans on the fcc board and at least one democrat agreed with the skepticism scuttling the chairmans plans if the threshold had been reached mr martin could have pushed through other proposals disliked by the cable industry including a so called a la carte service model that would allow subscribers to pick and choose channels they want rather than accepting bundled packages from cable companies analysts said it was an embarrassing climb down for mr martin who appeared before reporters to explain the delay in the commissions meeting today some industry observers are even questioning whether he is now a lame duck chairman the development was indeed a rare one the chairman controls the agenda of fcc public meetings and generally wont include rule changes on the agenda unless he is confident he has the support of a majority of commissioners mr martin has had to pull items before but he has never personally come down to reporters and admitted that he couldnt find the support for a rule change citigroup oil push stocks higher stocks gained ground as a
