profession changes take time but may be worth wait recruitment pay and getting ahead frank harrington spent years climbing the ranks at a semiconductor maker in california but he gradually realized he hated his job so he changed careers it took years but today hes a nurse and much happier people often dream of changing careers but substantial change takes a lot of work and it may require additional schooling or intensive networking many people lack the stamina career counselors and career switchers say that laying the step by step groundwork for a change isnt easy but is often necessary nella barkley president of the coaching firm crystal barkley corp helps clients make career transitions "they invariably think it will take much less time than it really does " she says a profound career change she notes usually takes years but even small first steps often make people happier ms barkley says simply having a plan for long term change brightens peoples attitudes she has noticed she tells clients to first "stabilize" their current job situations with relatively short term straightforward changes if they dislike their co workers or boss they can try switching departments if the travel is too much they should talk with the boss about curtailing it or switching to another role then employees can focus on achieving a longer term change they need to plan not only the work required to make the change but also how to accommodate family and financial obligations still ms barkley says clients overwhelmingly find the changes rewarding despite the obstacles whats more they become better equipped to fine tune their careers and lifestyles in the future mr harringtons transition for instance took several years he started at the semiconductor firm as a production control planner as he worked his way up the management ladder during the s he became increasingly unhappy he disliked the internal political sparring required of management roles in he was promoted into a job that required him to be particularly confrontational and he hated it that situation led him to think back to a conversation he had had about six years earlier with a family acquaintance he had mentioned his then early stage malaise out of the blue she had suggested he might like nursing "it resonated immediately " he says but he was making good money and winning promotions so he kept the fantasy in the back of his mind then with his job nearly unbearable he decided to take the first steps toward a career in nursing he researched the entry requirements for the nursing program at a local college he lacked some prerequisites for admission so in september he enrolled in night classes he felt an immediate affinity for both the course work and his classmates "i felt really convinced that i was doing exactly the right thing " he says at the same time the technology bubble was bursting and in february he was laid off from his tech job he had been planning to start nursing school full time in september and have his family he and his wife have three children live off savings and stock sales but the value of his former employers stock was dropping precipitously so he and his wife decided she would go back to work as a manager in local government in he graduated with nurses in hot demand around the country he got four job offers in three days he now works in the trauma intensive care unit at a public hospital in silicon valley his base salary is roughly the same as it was in his old job but his total income is lower because he doesnt get stock options nursing of course is no less stressful than his previous job but now the stress seems worth it rather than pulling his hair out over widgets he says "at least now there are actual lives at stake " he used to hate talking about his job because he found it so boring but he loves talking about nursing "im fiercely proud of doing it " says mr harrington now years old other times people take small steps without realizing they will lead to major change antreas ghazarossian spent two decades running a commercial real estate firm in new york by the late s though he was burned out he tried modifying the business he shifted toward serving clients with many facilities so that he could do more work for fewer clients and not constantly churn through transactions but he realized he wanted a more profound change in he sold the business stayed on for a few months and then consulted for another company for about a year ultimately he founded a new firm this one helps companies reduce their facilities related expenses now he deals mainly with corporate financial managers and tax professionals rather than brokers and landlords his work is broader and more analytical the transition took a long time but it was worth it he says "you just cannot get up one day at least i cant and say this is not working forget it " he says "its not an overnight kind of thing "
