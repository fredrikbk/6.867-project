the rise of family friendly cities for much of the past decade business recruiters cities and urban developers have focused on the "young and restless " the "creative class " and the so called "yuspie" the young urban single professional cities theyve said should capture this so called "dream demographic" if they wish to inhabit the top tiers of the economic food chain and enjoy the fastest and most sustained growth this focus epitomized by michigan gov jennifer granholms risible "cool cities" initiative is less successful than advertised cincinnati baltimore cleveland newark detroit and memphis have danced to the tune of the hip and the cool yet largely remain wallflowers in terms of economic and demographic growth instead an analysis of migration data by my colleagues at the praxis strategy group shows that the strongest job growth has consistently taken place in those regions such as houston dallas charlotte and raleigh durham with the largest net in migration of young educated families ranging from their mid s to mid s urban centers that have been traditional favorites for young singles such as chicago boston new york los angeles and san francisco have experienced below average job and population growth since san francisco and chicago lost population during that period even immigrant rich new york city and los angeles county have shown barely negligible population growth in the last two years largely due to a major out migration of middle class families married people with children tend to be both successful and motivated precisely the people who make economies go they are twice as likely to be in the top of income earners according to the census and their incomes have been rising considerably faster than the national average indeed if you talk with recruiters and developers in the nations fastest growing regions you find that the critical ability to lure skilled workers long term lies not with bright lights and nightclubs but with ample economic opportunities affordable housing and family friendly communities not too distant from work "people who come here tend to be people who have long commutes elsewhere and who have young children " notes pat riley president of alan tate company a large residential brokerage in charlotte n c "they want to be somewhere where they dont miss their kids growing up because theres no time " there is a basic truth about the geography of young educated people they may first migrate to cities like new york los angeles boston or san francisco but they tend to flee when they enter their child rearing years family friendly metropolitan regions have seen the biggest net gains of professionals largely because they not only attract workers but they also retain them through their s and s advocates of the brew latte and they will come approach often point to greater portland ore which has experienced consistent net gains of educated workers including families yet most of that migration as well as at least three quarters of the regions population and job growth has been not to the increasingly childless city but to the suburban periphery this pattern holds true in virtually every major urban region contrary to popular belief moreover the family is far from the brink of extinction most americans notes the pew research center still regard marriage as the ideal state upwards of still marry and the vast majority end up having children brookings demographer bill frey notes that the number of married couples with children has actually been on the rise after decades of decline mr frey traces this to changing attitudes among the native born as well as the growth of a largely family oriented immigrant population the rapidly increasing percentage of college educated women a group that places a high value on marriage and children are emerging as critical shapers of the future skilled workforce two decades ago these women were less likely than other women to marry today a single year old woman with a graduate degree has about a chance of getting married compared with a single year old woman with less education who has about a chance overall reports the center for economic and policy research women in their late s and early s who are in the top earning bracket are just as likely to be married as other women who work full time true todays american family does not mirror the narrowly defined unit of the s but it does reflect ironically perhaps aspects of our earlier social structures as stephanie coontz at the council on contemporary families has pointed out the s were an anomaly a period of high birthrates low divorce rates and remarkable social stability with a preponderance of nuclear families earlier generations of american families tended to be more ad hoc or as we would say today "blended " with uncles aunts grandparents stepparents and domestic employees often playing major roles in child rearing these patterns were reinforced by the dislocations of immigration and westward migration todays families are similarly expansive with a majority of wives now working and more having their children at a later age child raising roles have tended to extend beyond the biological parents it may not take a "village " as hillary clinton has asserted to raise a child but families are becoming more complex for example many ostensibly single and childless households include "empty nesters " grandparents or divorced fathers who although not living with their progeny are still deeply involved family members this web of relationships affects where people live and work the presence of a familial network has long been known as one reason for immigrants to cluster similarly grandparents tend to follow grandchildren and sometimes vice versa since they offer the prospect for low cost help with childcare the familys enduring supremacy is also apparent in the attitudes of young people the so called millennials as morley winograd and michael hais suggest in their upcoming book "millennial mainstream " this new generation is twice as numerous as generation x and far more family oriented they display markedly less proclivity for teen pregnancy abortion and juvenile crime they also tend to have more favorable relations with their parents with half staying in daily touch and almost all in weekly contact the evidence thus suggests that the obsession with luring singles to cities is misplaced instead suggests paul levy president of philadelphias center city district association the emphasis should be on retaining young people as they grow up marry start families and continue to raise them mr levy notes that the remarkable transformation of once sedate center city the areas population has grown to over has indeed been due primarily to young singles childless couples and a few "empty nesters " the proliferation of clubs restaurants and bars has created an almost manhattan ambiance but he suggests that the district is reaching the limits of its success the flourishing singles bar scene has not compensated for the continued movement of middle and working class families as well as jobs to the regions burgeoning suburbs amid a much hyped boom philadelphia has lost population and its share of the regions wealth has dropped to from since only of center city residents have children mr levy says and roughly half its young people depart once they enter their mid s "if you want to sustain the revival you have to deal with the fact that people with six year olds keep moving to the suburbs " mr levy suggests "empty nesters and singles are not enough " boosters such as mr levy look increasing towards reviving the traditional family neighborhoods which surround center city his organization has worked closely with local public and private schools church and civic organizations to build up the support structures that might convince todays youthful inner city urbanites to remain as they start families "our agenda " mr levy says "has to change we have to look at the parks the playgrounds and the schools " such a shift in emphasis could mark a new beginning for many long neglected urban neighborhoods across the country its time to recognize that today as has been the case for millennia families provide the most reliable foundation for successful economies mr kotkin presidential fellow at chapman university is the author of "the city a global history" modern library
