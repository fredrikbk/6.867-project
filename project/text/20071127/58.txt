its official wall street correction fed acts to calm jitters ease pressure on banks as credit crisis deepens the federal reserve took steps to stabilize a jittery financial system though the moves did little to ease the fears of many investors who flooded into the safety of treasurys amid mounting economic worries the fed said it would extend loans for longer than usual terms to its network of wall street bond dealers to ease funding pressure on banks through year end the extended loans or "repos " will be made via open market operations by the federal reserve bank of new york and could help financial institutions meet funding needs at a time of year when cash commonly tends to be in high demand the european central bank took a similar step in recent days yet in the starkest sign of the growing unease in the credit markets the yield on year treasury notes dropped sharply to the lowest level since march from friday investors are worried that financial institutions could be on the hook for growing losses because of exposure to soured mortgage investments more fundamentally they fear a recession treasurys are seen as a "haven" investment in times of turmoil investors pile into them when worried driving down their yields the yields also tend to fall when investors are betting the fed will have to push interest rates lower as a counterweight to slowing economic growth even in the relatively safe investment grade corporate bond market investors are proving reluctant to step out on a limb new issuance has sputtered to &# billion this month far off the &# billion issued in november a year ago according to data from dealogic "its a deepening of the crisis it really is " said mary beth fisher interest rate strategist at ubs referring to tighter lending conditions since august banks have been reluctant to lend even to each other for more than a few days it has been for a variety of reasons a need to have cash on hand to fund unanticipated commitments possible mistrust of each others creditworthiness and a greater than usual aversion to showing a shortage of cash at year end since then central banks have taken a variety of moves to stem the crisis with limited effect the short term lending markets started to settle down in september and october but went into renewed spasms this month pushing up short term interbank lending rates yesterday the three month libor or the london interbank offered rate quoted on dollar loans between european banks was unusually high relative to the feds current target interest rate for overnight loans between banks known as the federal funds rate it is even more unusually high when compared with the that investors expect to prevail in january tension also prevailed in euro money markets despite the european central banks promise to allocate more cash to banks overnight euro rates traded above the central banks target of yesterday in the u s the libor is an especially important interest rate because it is a benchmark for many other kinds of lending such as floating rate mortgages and commercial corporate paper its rise may be symptomatic of a more generalized reluctance by banks to lend which could impair consumer and business spending "given the high level of attention focused on the coming year end we hope to reassure market participants of our commitment to providing sufficient balances at that time by starting to provide those balances now " a fed official said the feds first extended repo operation will be tomorrow for &# billion the loans will mature jan the new york fed said at a little more than six weeks such a loan is considerably longer than the usual maximum of two weeks for ordinary repos "the timing and amounts of subsequent term operations spanning the year end will be influenced by market and reserve developments " the new york fed said the feds "open market" operations are the standard tool by which it implements monetary policy each day through a series of auctions it advances money for terms of one day or more to a group of wall street dealers accepting as collateral debt issued or guaranteed by the u s or federally chartered mortgage agencies the fed adjusts the size of such operations in order to guide the federal funds rate such operations arent unusual near the end of the year when banks need additional cash to meet customer demand for holiday spending and to avoid a shortfall the fed conducted similar operations in and this weeks will be larger than any single operation from those years the operations dont mean the fed is lowering interest rates its bluntest policy instrument however with plunging stocks signaling deeper concern about the economic outlook investors expect the fed to do that next month both fed chairman ben bernanke and vice chairman donald kohn will discuss the economic outlook in speeches this week which could shed more light on their plans for now the commitment to act "was important because people are anticipating a liquidity squeeze at the end of the year that could put heavy upward pressure on overnight rates " said lou crandall chief economist at wrightson associates a wall street research firm mr crandall said the commitment was reminiscent of some made around the end of when there were widespread fears of computer problems related to the change from calendar to year such "yk" disruptions generally failed to materialize the new york feds announcement follows a similar announcement friday by the european central bank that it stood ready to provide funding over the year end to counter strains in the euro zone money markets the bank of canada has also joined in injecting &# billion in short term funds into the system last week the new york fed yesterday took several steps to make it easier for dealers to borrow from the feds portfolio of treasury securities such securities are heavily sought as collateral for short term loans especially when other alternatives such as mortgage backed securities without some kind of federal imprimatur are being shunned the new york fed said it was expanding the range of securities in its portfolio available to be borrowed to anything with a maturity of more than six days from the previous days expanding the amount available to borrow to of an individual issue from and expanding how much any single dealer may borrow to of the amount available in a particular issue from the asset backed commercial paper market the fulcrum of the august financial market turmoil remains in the doldrums with the overnight rate on the highest rated paper rising to yesterday compared with where it was for nearly all last week according to ms fisher rates on paper longer than overnight are several basis points higher ms fisher said with many banks bringing assets back onto their balance sheet "thats going to increase the need for cash again " ms fisher added and "we do not expect that to resolve quickly " auction results here are the results of
