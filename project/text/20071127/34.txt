flights of fancy centuries apart new york we all loved piranesi he was the th centurys hot history a baroque master accepted even by those committed modernists who had conscientiously discarded the past we revered his vedute the dramatic views of rome with their brilliant manipulations of space and scale we adored his carceri the imaginary prisons where swinging ropes and bridges to nowhere crisscrossed soaring stone chambers in ominous pre "caligari" gloom this was to our minds the kind of out of the box thinking we could all admire the fact that the venetian born italian architect giovanni battista piranesi was not only a gifted artist but also a designer of awesomely elaborate furniture and interiors and over the top bric a brac for an elite th century clientele for whom no gilded excess was ever too much never entered our minds who knew every generation edits history for its own tastes and purposes times change and to reinforce a more inclusive perspective of piranesis genius new yorks cooper hewitt national design museum of the smithsonian institution has mounted a scholarly display of the full range of his accomplishments with emphasis on his rarely seen decorative work much of this material is from its own ever surprising collections whether by accident or plan one assumes the latter as the museum claims although its fine either way the piranesi show has been paired with a retrospective of the work of ingo maurer the contemporary german lighting artist who the museum informs us provides an intriguing st century parallel to his th century predecessor they are both fantasists we are told offering similar radical departures from practice across the centuries offbeat artists who transcend convention in imaginative and even transgressive ways no matter these are two wonderful shows however you choose to rationalize them you may find the museums thesis acceptable or a bit of a stretch these artists seem less joined at the hip than anchored in the art and ideas of their own time and place piranesis departures from the norm are based on his study of ancient ruins and in particular on his championship of the superiority of the monuments of the roman empire over the more "pure" greek examples favored by a rising tide of th century neoclassical taste his embrace of egyptian etruscan greek and roman motifs led to an against the grain eclecticism and the idiosyncratically hybrid style that he defended with polemical passion it is difficult to square this aesthetic overload no matter how brilliantly assimilated with a reformist sensibility it would be a long time before the idea of eclectic excess would fuel the spirit of radical change the objects on view are as terminally elaborate as they are splendidly executed tables are supported by winged garlanded and gilded griffins if four are good five are better monumental candelabra are topped with allegorical figures resting on the heads of obliging cranes above goats and gods and tiers of flora and fauna piranesis style is drop dead gorgeous and drop dead serious if there is anything lighthearted lurking in arcane mythological references the symbolism challenged viewer is hard pressed to find it what we learn is that piranesi was a prolific designer of clocks mirrors sconces vases pedestals chimney pieces candlesticks chairs and all manner of domestic and ecclesiastical paraphernalia and that his influence extended abroad to the work of younger more a la mode architects like the scottish robert adam his one executed building commission santa maria del priorato a th century church that he remodeled in the s is documented in detail the grandly reimagined scenes of the "vedute di roma " with their combination of keen observation and romantic fantasy are as powerful as ever these unforgettable drawings and etchings of the ruins and realities of th century rome have been piranesis enduring point of contact with succeeding generations the cooper hewitt shows us that there was much much more if piranesis art is burdened with a pile it on aesthetic ingo maurers art soars evanescent and immaterial eluding definition it is the product of a free floating irreverent endlessly creative mind for mr maurer light is so much more than the provision of illumination or the design of some useful appliances it needs no reason for being except its own miraculous existence seen as a tool for making art it offers the infinite possibilities of a rapidly developing technology that has revolutionized the nature and use of light and color this may not be deathless art but it is a lot more than design the work on view gives such instant delight that it is easy to underrate its intentions light in the hands of a gifted designer can be as seriously drop dead beautiful as any of piranesis dazzling de trop and a lot more fun wit ambiguity and surprise go with the medium flick a switch and its gone how many overwrought funerary urns can one admire without ormolu fatigue the transformation of the landmark carnegie mansion that the cooper hewitt calls home begins on the trip up to the second floor are those pictures of mr and mrs carnegie that mr maurer has hung over the stairs really talking to each other "time for something new " andrew keeps murmuring to louise his comment audible as you go through the show a group of mr maurers "lucellinos " bare bulbs with goose feather wings threaten to fly off with a heavy red fabric bedecked chandelier overhead upstairs there are lighting fixtures light sculptures light fantasies and light environments full of subversive messages benign putdowns in jokes flights of fancy and sheer sensuous pleasure colorful bulbs in wall brackets disappear when you turn to one side leaving empty sockets and pull chains they reappear in place when you face them head on again an illusion a technological trick a lovely amuse loeil moment or all of the above a chandelier of broken crockery is a glamorous explosion of scintillating shards this beautiful parody of pricey ostentation can be yours just as expensively in a limited edition a site specific installation "rose rose on the wall" is a combination of magic show and pop imagery two chairs and a table face a wall of roses so charmingly innocent it would be unkind to call them kitsch programmed to change color number and arrangement constantly while a faux fire burns cozily on a tv screen flush with the rose "wallpaper " all this glittering gemutlichkeit is created by circuit boards leds and an integrated plasma television you can parse its meanings forever or you can just enjoy the seductive trompe loeil innuendos of an updated american dream "homage to mr edison" takes over a small room suffused in blue light a white chair is tipped against a white table on which a shattered bulb rests one bare lit bulb hangs above a clear bulb encased in a larger glass bulb echoing its shape the functioning light inside its aesthetic doppelganger there is no end to mr maurers visual double takes completes an evocative tribute to mr edisons invention one of todays most admired status designs the philippe starck lemon squeezer is given a maurer makeover the squeezers totally unfunctional squeezer head held high on its attenuated spider legs has been topped with a perfectly squeezed lemon half that serves nonchalantly as the support for the wiring of a lamp and a very nice lampshade a lemon lamp for a lemon squeezer that is a celebrated lemon an "improvement" that makes the useless useful if somewhat less terminally chic no pretensions are safe the cooper hewitts beaux arts building has its own endearing pretensions and while this grandeur manque may frustrate installation it makes a particularly fine foil for piranesis eclectic splendors and ingo maurers enchanting inventions upstairs and downstairs in worlds far apart what the two shows share is magic ms huxtable is the journals architecture
