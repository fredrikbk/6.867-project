funds add fuel to airline deal talk pardus seeks like minded investors in call for consolidation u s airlines are once again flirting with potential mergers but this time hedge funds are providing some of the push pardus capital management lp an investor in both delta air lines inc and united airlines parent ual corp this month took public its proposal that the two airlines merge now the hedge fund is trying to rally like minded funds and other investors to its call for airline consolidation pardus took its message to about airline investors two weeks ago at a meeting in new york then last week the hedge fund made individual pitches to investors in boston with more than &# billion in assets pardus hardly has the financial muscle to bully united the no airline in the u s by traffic and no delta pardus based in new york doesnt plan to try to assemble an investor bloc or mount a proxy fight said people familiar with its thinking outside investors arent likely to get carriers to negotiate unless the airlines executives are inclined on their own to talk and as previous failed consolidation efforts show major regulatory and operations barriers stand in the way of airline mergers still parduss prodding could galvanize support among hedge funds and other active investors who agree that it is time for the fragmented u s industry to pursue combinations as a buffer against high fuel prices and the threat of an economic slowdown hedge funds many of which became investors through the bankruptcy reorganizations of several airlines are more likely to seek immediate returns rather than hold on for the long haul behind the scenes some airline shareholders are applauding pardus for its "willingness to spend their money on the consolidation cause " said one investor some people familiar with the matter said pardus and its advisers received questions at the new york meeting about why pardus favors a delta united combination when parduss research indicates a delta merger with northwest airlines corp would produce greater synergies pardus said it believes a delta united marriage could have greater benefits because it would produce a superior network and because no hubs would have to close or jobs be cut to create synergies there were also questions about whether any big pairing would pass muster with federal antitrust regulators ual which has been singing the praises of consolidation for several years but has been unable to find a willing partner said it "will participate in business opportunities on our own terms " ed bastian deltas president and chief financial officer said in a recent interview "we receive proposals from investors all the time " he added that delta wont be rushed into a deal that doesnt fulfill managements strategic goals gordon bethune the former continental airlines inc chief executive hired to advise pardus said in an interview that the hedge funds "logic is pretty damn impeccable " arguing that the lack of consolidation has created a boom and bust cycle that has cost airline jobs and destroyed shareholder value mr bethune said pardus is simply saying "stop talking get off your butts do something " pardus was founded in by karim samii a credit suisse first boston alumnus who went on to become a restructuring specialist for wr huff asset management co pardus is part of an investor group that is trying to bring delphi corp out of bankruptcy court protection it played a big role in the bankruptcy of bally total fitness holding corp before cashing out used its stakes to pressure some european travel companies to consolidate and has been an activist investor in french auto parts maker valeo sa pardus valeos largest shareholder failed to get its eight nominees on valeos board last spring in the airline sphere pardus owns seven million delta shares or about based on shares outstanding pardus owns million ual shares which represent a stake in that airline as well as a similar amount of ual holdings in a swap instrument in recent months the fund has hired mr bethune and simat helliesen &amp eichner inc an airline consulting firm in new york to help it analyze strategic combinations because of the industrys cyclical nature the biggest airline investors have typically been large mutual funds that could afford to invest a small portion of their capital and weather the ups and downs but as wealthy private investors have poured money into hedge funds in recent years those funds have come to represent a larger chunk of airline shares and some arent shy about expressing their views at least privately to executives of companies in which they have holdings like pardus many hedge funds have positioned themselves to benefit from consolidation by building up stakes in more than one airline some are betting on mergers between the airlines they own others believe all airline stocks will benefit from mergers that would reduce seat capacity and free up pricing "everybody has two or three chess game moves in mind " said one manager of a fund with airline holdings wayzata investment partners llc a hedge fund based near minneapolis is the largest hedge fund investor in northwest with about of the shares outstanding according to factset research systems inc wayzata which also owns a small stake in delta declined to comment impala asset management llc owns nearly of ual and has stakes in delta and american airlines parent amr corp par capital management inc a boston hedge fund owns shares in amr delta northwest continental us airways group inc jetblue airways corp and airtran holdings inc impala declined to comment and par didnt return calls some activist investors have been disappointed by carriers slowness to heed their advice fl group an icelandic investment fund with a stake in amr put american on the spot in september when fl made public a demanding letter it wrote to amrs board last month amr said it would weigh fls suggestions including selling assets such as its commuter unit and its frequent flier program fl group chief executive hannes smarason said at the time that he was frustrated by americans vague timeline although fl didnt press for consolidation then mr smarason now says "were all for consolidation " a combination of ual of chicago and atlanta based delta would stitch together route networks with little overlap pardus said sh&amp e "conservatively" estimated that the combination would produce &# million in cost and revenue synergies by and thinks a merger could win labors favor by giving workers a slice of the equity
