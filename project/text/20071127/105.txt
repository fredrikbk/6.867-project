the lowdown on doomsday break through by ted nordhaus and michael shellenberger houghton mifflin pages &# the secretary general of the united nations upon issuing yet another global warming report a couple of weeks ago announced that "we are on the verge of a catastrophe " kevin rudd australias just elected prime minister has said that fighting global warming will be his "number one" priority and al gore propelled by his nobel prize still travels the world to warn of doom his latest stop was the caribbean where earlier this month he told a gathering of the regions environmental officials that rising seas the result of melting polar icecaps would threaten their island paradise and yet the public does not seem to feel all that heatedly about the warming of the planet in survey after survey american voters say that they care about global warming but the subject ranks quite low when compared with other concerns e g the economy health care the war on terror even when mr gores oscar winning film "an inconvenient truth " was at the height of its popularity it did not increase the importance of global warming in the public mind or mobilize greater support for mr gores favored remedies e g reducing greenhouse gas emissions by government fiat mr gore may seek to make environmental protection civilizations "central organizing principle " as he puts it but there is no constituency for such a regime hence even the democratic partys presidential candidates in their debates give global warming only cursory treatment with lofty rhetoric and vague policy proposals there is a reason for this political freeze up in "break through " ted nordhaus and michael shellenberger argue that mr gore and the broader environmental movement in which mr gore plays an almost messianic part remain wedded to an outmoded vision seeing global warming as "a problem of pollution to be fixed by a politics of limits " such a vision may have worked in the early days of environmentalism when the first clear air and clean water regulations were pushed through congress but today it cannot mobilize enough public support for dramatic political change what is to be done messrs nordhaus and shellenberger want to replace the pollution paradigm with a progressive one they broached this idea in "the death of environmentalism " a controversial monograph that ricocheted around the internet "break through" gives the idea a fuller exposition and even greater urgency the authors contend that the environmental movement must throw out its "unexamined assumptions outdated concepts and exhausted strategies" in favor of something "imaginative aspirational and future oriented " let it be said that messrs nordhaus and shellenberger are anything but nature scoffing know nothings they have worked for environmental organizations for years thus there is a certain poignancy to their view that "doomsday discourse" has made the green movement just another liberal interest group they want environmentalism to have a broader appeal enough to address major ecological concerns including global warming but no one they contend is going to demand draconian emission limits the kind that would actually slow the warming trend if they bring down the standard of living and interrupt the progress of the economy a progressive approach the authors say would acknowledge that economic growth and prosperity do not in themselves pose an environmental threat to the contrary they inspire ecological concern the environment messrs nordhaus and shellenberger say is a "post material" need that people demand only after their material needs are met to make normal productive human activity the enemy of nature as environmentalists implicitly do is to adopt policies that "constrain human ambition aspiration and power" instead of finding ways to "unleash and direct them " messrs nordhaus and shellenberger want "an explicitly pro growth agenda " on the theory that investment innovation and imagination may ultimately do more to improve the environment than punitive regulation and finger wagging rhetoric to stabilize atmospheric carbon levels will take more much more than regulation it will require "unleashing human power creating a new economy " it is not that the authors are opposed to the government playing a role in this "new economy " they would like to see federal programs offset the harm of regulation for instance acknowledging the trade offs of environmentalist policies if auto workers lose their livelihood because of a new fuel economy rule they may need to be compensated perhaps by a health care subsidy the authors most detailed proposal is for a government funded "apollo project" to spur the development of low carbon energy technologies regulatory centered approaches to climate change they say are "economically insufficient to accelerate the transition to clean energy " an "investment centered" approach is better such a shift in focus would be welcome of course but it is hard to see why their centralized subsidy plan would produce commercially profitable that is "pro growth" technologies better than the multiple efforts of private investors in short why would an "apollo" plan succeed where the synthetic fuels corp failed having accepted the platitude that "human governance is what makes markets possible " the authors embrace the fatal conceit that markets can somehow be planned or manipulated to achieve a grand and worthy purpose still "break through" does bust up big parts of the old paradigm not least by challenging environmentalists to rethink their "politics of limits " in an odd way the doomsaying of the global warmists has had a tonic effect revealing nearly years since the first earth day that environmentalism is stuck in a midlife crisis messrs nordhaus and shellenberger want desperately to get it unstuck if heeded their call for an optimistic outlook embracing economic dynamism and creative potential will surely do more for the environment than any u n report or nobel prize mr adler is director of the center for business law and regulation at the case western reserve university
