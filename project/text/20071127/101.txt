the afternoon report opening network online edition verizon wireless touts its service with the tagline "its all about the network " and that statement has never been truer than it is today in a major reversal the cellphone giant announced that it will allow any compatible device or software to run on its wireless network verizon wireless will publish early next year technical standards for designers to use in creating software applications and devices that can run on its network the carrier which is jointly owned by verizon communications and vodafone said that any device that meets the minimum technical standards will be activated on the network of course for now at least the iphone is out of contention because of apples exclusive deal with at&amp t verizon hopes to have new devices and applications available to customers by the end of the change of heart from the company known for being protective of its network comes amid increasing pressure for openness in the wireless industry fcc chairman kevin martin has pushed for open access saying it will spur technological advances and google has been pushing an open standards software platform dubbed android and already counts sprint nextel and t mobile usa as allies however verizon wirelesss main motive could be a coming radio spectrum auction the fcc had set aside a portion of those airwaves for wireless networks that allow customers to use any mobile device not just those approved by the network owner the move puts verizon in a better position to win a chunk of spectrum in the auction not only is the company now closer to reconciling its strategy to the demands of the fcc but it potentially makes participation in the auction less desirable for google "we see googles wide partnerships and now the ability to put a future google powered device on the verizon network as diluting any economic incentive for google to be a substantial spectrum auction competitor " bank of america said in a research note opening its network also puts verizon wireless in a better position should it lose out in the auction the winners now wouldnt be offering a special service that isnt available from verizon wireless
