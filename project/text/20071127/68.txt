learning curve parents of disabled students push for separate classes mainstreaming trend doesnt work for all backlash in new jersey new brunswick n j last fall groups who favor placing disabled students in regular classrooms faced opposition from an unlikely quarter parents like norette travis whose daughter valerie has autism valerie had already tried the mainstreaming approach that the disability advocacy groups were supporting after attending a preschool program for special needs students she was assigned to a regular kindergarten class but there her mother says she disrupted class ran through the hallways and lashed out at others at one point giving a teacher a black eye "she did not learn anything that year " ms travis recalls "she regressed " as policy makers push to include more special education students into general classrooms factions are increasingly divided advocates for the disabled say special education students benefit both academically and socially by being taught alongside typical students legislators often side with them arguing that mainstreaming is productive for students and cost effective for taxpayers some teachers and administrators have been less supportive of the practice saying that they lack the training and resources to handle significantly disabled children and more parents are joining the dissenters people like ms travis believe that mainstreaming can actually hinder the students it is intended to help waging a battle to preserve older policies these parents are demanding segregated teaching environments including separate schools in more than half of all special education students were considered mainstreamed or "fully included " nationally these students spent or more of the school day in regular classrooms up from about a third in according to the u s department of education "the burden is on school districts and states to give strong justification for why a child or group of children cannot be integrated " says thomas hehir an education professor at harvard and former director of special education at the u s department of education that point of view frustrates many parents some have struggled to get services from their local school districts others have seen their disabled children falter in integrated settings mary kaplowitz a special education teacher in kingston pa was a bigger supporter of mainstreaming before she had her son zachary who has autism and is mildly retarded she says his preschool classmates rarely played with him and he came home from summer camp asking why the nondisabled children laughed at him on a visit she saw them drawing away from her son "they shunned him and it broke my heart " says ms kaplowitz earlier this year she and other parents fought successfully to preserve separate special education classes in kingston like the one zachary now years old attends at a local elementary school such parental pushback has prompted local school districts across the country to delay or downsize mainstreaming initiatives last year parents of disabled kids in walworth county wis clashed with an advocacy group over the creation of a new special education school as part of the battle disability rights wisconsin sued the county in milwaukee federal court to try to block the school the new school is currently under construction and the lawsuit is under appeal and earlier this year parents in marylands montgomery county asked the state to continue a special education program their school district was scheduled to discontinue after initial protests the district agreed to phase out the program letting enrolled kids continue rather than close it outright the debate has grown contentious in new jersey a state with a strong tradition of separate education for the disabled only about of the states special education students are deemed fully included compared with nationwide about of the states disabled students triple the national average attend separate schools new jersey passed some of the nations first special education laws in the s it began requiring public schools to pay for special ed services that they didnt offer state law also gave counties and groups of school districts broad powers to build stand alone schools for the disabled today there are publicly funded separate schools for the disabled in new jersey and about private ones they receive tuition from public districts for handling special ed students but in the state which had faced federal pressure to mainstream placed a year long moratorium on the opening of new special education schools since then it has stiffened the approval process for private facilities and bolstered funding for local districts to broaden in house programs in a budget strapped state where voters have been demanding tax relief cost has been a factor on average new jersey spends about &# a year on each special education student including those who are mainstreamed the average annual tuition at the various separate public schools for the disabled range from &# to &# at private schools its &# overall tuition and transportation costs for out of district placements accounted for of the &# billion a year that the state spends on special education "thats a huge cost driver for our education budget " says state sen john adler who last year co chaired hearings on school funding reform many parents including state sen stephen sweeney bristle at moves that could foreclose their options his daughter lauren who has down syndrome attends a regular middle school but mr sweeney says her nondisabled classmates never visit or ask her to hang out next year hes moving lauren to a separate high school operated by the publicly funded gloucester county special services school district the systems special education facilities also include a new &# million school for children with autism and multiple disabilities "just to put my child in a building to make people feel better because its inclusion is outrageous " says mr sweeney "as long as i am in the legislature they are not going to take away the choice of parents with children with disabilities " the school funding hearings held in various towns and cities last fall were emotional ruth lowenkron a special education attorney testified that beyond being the right thing to do mainstreaming would save money "repeat after me " she told the legislators "inclusion is cheaper than segregation " but the panel also heard often from parents who argued for continued access to separate schools they included adela maria bolet of teaneck n j whose suit clad son michael sat beside his mother while she testified the year old who has down syndrome now attends a private high school on the states tab in earlier years ms bolet fought to get michael into regular public schools only to find that he sometimes became depressed and had little positive interaction with nondisabled peers until high school he had few friends says ms bolet her voice still quivers when she talks about what happened when the family rented a pool in town and invited classmates from michaels neighborhood elementary school to a swimming party for his th birthday "nobody came " she says concurrent with the funding hearings another debate was boiling at new jerseys publicly funded middlesex regional education services commission it had already supported and built a network of six special education schools and planned to open two more including a classroom facility the commission controlled by a consortium of school districts had built its other schools using bonds guaranteed by middlesex countys governing board its school projects had never faced significant opposition this time was different as the proposed schools became a target for mainstreaming advocates critics like william england a school board member in south river n j wrote to local papers to endorse the sort of segregated special education schools that most of the country is busy abandoning would be "a waste of county resources " he said in a letter to the home news tribune east brunswick n j mark finkelstein the middlesex commissions superintendent scoffs at such criticism he estimates his schools save local districts &# million a year over the cost of placement in privately owned facilities "its easy to say that all kids should be in mainstream schools but lets talk reality " he says on a recent morning at the bright beginnings learning center one of the middlesex schools a hallway painted mint green was lined with childrens wheelchairs and walkers in one classroom a teacher and four aides were working with seven disabled students most strapped into devices designed to help them stand or sit mary lou walker an aide crouched beside the desk of teresa condora a petite year old who suffers from cerebral palsy and is largely nonverbal "all right t come on " ms walker said gently urging the girl to press a big red plastic button attached to a buzzer responding with a soft moan teresa pushed against the button as though it were impossibly heavy last september pro and anti mainstreaming factions faced off at a meeting where the fate of the proposed new middlesex schools was to be decided at the microphone that evening paula lieb president of the new jersey coalition for inclusive education cited multiple examples of severely disabled children who had been successfully mainstreamed she said that "the vast majority of children can be included in the public schools " but the parents of children already attending the commissions schools had also been organizing urging each other to come to the hearing and bring their disabled children sandy epsteins family had moved to new jersey from oregon a decade earlier to take advantage of specialized schools for students like her son brandon who has autism for the hearing the year old homemaker dressed her teenager in a bright red polo shirt and sat near the front "i wanted him to stand out " she says "i wanted these politicians to see what we are talking about " ms travis a year old bookkeeper from milltown n j says that while waiting to speak that night she grew angry with the criticisms of the inclusion advocates she thought they had no idea what her daughter valerie now needed the travises had spent eight months on a waiting list to get valerie into the academy learning center one of the middlesex schools located in monroe township n j during that time she says the progress valerie had made learning to speak all but disappeared along with reports of her outbursts at school ms travis says the family had to cope with frequent meltdowns at home valerie slept fitfully ripped up her homework and beat up her little brother to the point that he once needed stitches "it was the worst eight months of our lives " ms travis told the county officials adding that families like hers needed schools like the academy where valerie is now learning geography and double digit subtraction mr finkelstein believes parents testimony helped convince county officials to unanimously back the bonds needed for the new construction which is under way "if inclusion worked for all of our residents " the superintendent says "they wouldnt be fighting so hard for these new schools " their efforts are far from over in june a coalition of disability rights groups sued the new jersey education department in u s district court in newark taking a page from the racial desegregation battles of the s it alleges the department isnt moving fast enough to integrate disabled students and asks the federal court to take over the process
