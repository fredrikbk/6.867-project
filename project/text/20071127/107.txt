the middle seat are you an authentic traveler web site uses test to find your type then provides tips cant decide where to go on your next vacation stanley plog may have the answer dr plog has spent years researching travel preferences and decisions from which coach seats are most comfortable on airplanes to how resorts and european capitals can best pitch to tourists hes developed a questionnaire that pegs people into six different profiles identifying their "travel personality " now dr plog and bahir browsh a former trans world airlines executive and travel channel president have turned dr plogs research into a web site www besttripchoices com where users can get travel suggestions free when we vacation we all have different desires some people like to relax on the beach others climb mountains some people love crowds many are most comfortable driving to someplace close to home and often the same place as last year and the year before others jump on airplanes to see new unfamiliar places far from the masses i tried the besttripchoices site out on my family and found that it zeroed in on personalities quite well figuring out that most of us wanted history and culture in our trips we like to sample new places and we use mixed modes of transportation for our travel and somehow it also knew that i like to buy native specialties when i travel knowing exactly what kind of vacation most fits your travel personality is the key to having a satisfying experience dr plog says and its not always obvious sometimes we feel that we need to seek out rough edge adventures when really wed be happier lying by a pool with a cocktail whats more some couples have different travel personalities so trips may not be compatible for both "people choose the wrong vacation all the time and they come back really disappointed " he says the besttripchoices sites questionnaire identifies you in one of six personality profiles from a "venturer " who likes to find undiscovered gems and explore unique cultures to an "authentic " who prefers everything familiar and predictable and likes going where there are lots of people it must be a good place after all if there are crowds each extreme represents only to of the population most of us are in between to varying degrees on the "venturer" side of the scale "mid venturers" like some physical activity on trips and travel with intellectual curiosity for history "centric venturers" like exotic places but they want good hotels and restaurants too on the authentics side "mid authentics" are particularly social people who love golf and mellow vacations in the sun "centric authentics" would rather drive to destinations than fly and are comfortable on cruises based on dr plogs database of travel surveys on what destinations were most satisfying to what type of people the site suggests places to go that fit your travel personality its a scientific version of the service of a very good travel agent someone who would get to know clients figure out what they like and suggest appropriate trips and many travel agents already use software that helps them target trips for clients but with so many people now booking their own trips some study of your inclinations and preferences can help avoid unsatisfactory vacations "the whole idea is to narrow down and select the place that is best for you " dr plog says dr plogs work has been used by the travel industry for decades and the science behind his study has been peer reviewed and published in academic journals "plog is a pioneer " says paul biederman an assistant professor at new york university and author of a travel industry textbook "hes now applying advanced technology to what he has been doing all along " dr biederman says the theory behind identifying travel personalities is solid "i think it works especially for people who are avid travelers looking for new places to visit " he said to develop a profile dr plogs quiz presents statements and asks people to agree or disagree with each on a seven point scale some seem obviously related to travel such as "i prefer to go to undiscovered places before big hotels and restaurants are built " others are more obscure such as "chance has little to do with success in my life " the trick is that only seven or eight of the questions drive the results the rest are thrown in for cover dr plog says he wont disclose which questions are the true revealers of personality except to say they are not the obvious travel questions how much you read for example and how much tv you watch are indicators of the trips youll prefer dr plog says the site pegged me as a centric venturer according to the profile i read newspapers a lot you think and am selective in my television viewing i could be happy on a greek cruise or a tour of california ghost towns or even a new york shopping trip im the one who likes new places but not too raw i want a good hotel too to my surprise my wife came out "mid venturer" more adventurous in her travel desires than i am that didnt seem quite right camping was never her thing when we were younger but then i remembered that shes always the one pushing adventures like kayaking trips and river rafting when we go places my daughters fell in my same "centric venturer" category and that fit too although my college student daughter thought that it underestimated her desire for adventure in the destinations suggested montreal and quebec were among her recommendations while she says argentina india turkey and spain are tops on her wish list right now indeed while the site seemed prescient at targeting our personalities it was less clear at suggesting destinations the recommendations overlap considerably across categories since many places fit multiple personalities hawaii for example can be great for adventurers who like surfing or hiking and just as much fun for authentics who want to souvenir shop with the hordes in waikiki likewise alaska can be a place of great adventure and yet authentics can enjoy gorgeous scenery from a train or relax on a cruise ship massachusetts ranked high as a destination for five of the six different personality groups dr plog has destinations ranked on the web site but ultimately wants to get to the rankings are based on surveys of travelers who have been to those places researchers identify a persons travel personality then ask where theyve been and what they liked right now its populated mostly with information on destinations in north america and europe and lacking in asia and other regions the real value is in pegging what you really want out of a vacation where you go is just the fun part
