business technology best of the business tech blog excerpts from recent entries at wsj coms tech blog too many workers fail to grasp the value of data risks of loss if someone asked you to deliver a briefcase with &# million in it would you box it up stick stamps on it and put it in the outgoing mail of course not yet thats the way many workers treat sensitive data in their organizations the enormous data blunder the british government announced last week is the latest example government workers lost two computer disks containing the names addresses dates of birth national insurance numbers and in some cases banking details of approximately million residents of the united kingdom every single one of these records could fetch around &# on the black market according to tech security firm symantec corp placing the value of the data on the disks somewhere in the neighborhood of &# billion yet the disks were sent through the governments interoffice mail system with no special tracking number the disks were password protected but the information itself wasnt encrypted thats very weak security easily cracked by a savvy hacker the disks were missing three weeks before anyone raised the alarm the perception problem when workers lose a computer disk or a portable storage device such as a usb memory stick they seem to look at the &# it will cost to replace the device not the value of the data inside it its like valuing that theoretical &# million shipment by the cost of the briefcase and not by the cash inside "theres a real disconnect between the perceived value and the real value of information " says larry ponemon chairman of the ponemon institute a privacy think tank "the rank and file employee still doesnt seem to get it " mr ponemon suggests that one way companies could alert employees to the value of the data they are working with is through an internal color coding system red for sensitive information which employees would need to treat securely yellow for somewhat valuable information green for information that could be passed back and forth without any security somehow businesses need to find a way to communicate to employees that the data are themselves valuable sometimes extremely so "people need to understand that this information is the holy grail " mr ponemon says at&amp t dont phone it in ma bell is ordering workers back to the office the telecommunications giant once known as a telework pioneer has put the kibosh on working at home network world reports at one point of its management employees telecommuted including who did so full time but several employees tell network world that theyve been asked to return to an office as soon as possible one said "its crazy i dont understand it were a networking and communications company " at&amp t inc spokesman walt sharp said that theres "no wholesale program" to end telecommuting at at&amp t he said that at&amp t is currently merging the policies of the different companies sbc communications inc which bought at&amp t but chose to keep the iconic name acquired over the past couple of years sbc also bought bellsouth corp and cingular wireless corp telecommuting was one of the policies affected mr sharp said he didnt know about letters asking employees to return to the office but did say that "its possible thats happening on a one on one basis " keeping it simple michael dell says he hears one thing over and over again from the businesses he talks to managing information technology is getting increasingly complex part of the problem is the way companies buy and deploy technology often a business leader finds some great software that he just has to buy the ceo of computer maker dell inc says very little of this software works with the other software that the business uses meaning that it departments have to pay for separate equipment and staff for each one whats left of the it budget goes to consultants "who just stay there until you run out of money " mr dell says one of mr dells goals for his company is to develop tech that simplifies the day to day challenges of running an it department one example servers the back office computers it uses to process data that come configured with software that makes them more efficient currently most it departments have to install this software mr dell also says that data centers where companies keep their servers mainframes and other back office computers take up much more energy than necessary and that most companies arent using the equipment they have to its fullest potential if a company has three data centers he says it could most likely squeeze as much performance out of the equipment it already owns as it could from building an additional data center choices are still crucial he says dell recently began selling pcs with the free linux operating system although the machines arent expected to become a big part of the companys business anytime soon and the vista question "we know a lot of people are going to migrate to vista " he tells us "we just dont know when "
