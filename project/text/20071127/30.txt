up version of group pages with interactive and other features but while a presence on facebook can be a valuable marketing and communication tool experts say businesses should keep their expectations in check "understand this new medium and be part of it as it evolves " says ray valdes research director for web services at research firm gartner inc in stamford conn "its worth engaging now just

has brought tangible results she recently drew more than people to an opening party for a clothing store that she expected only or would attend and the people who learned of the party through facebook bought several thousand dollars in merchandise she estimates ms gruber posts information and reminders about her events regularly and uploads plenty of party pictures afterward each day she gets to messages on her wall and keeps that going with quick replies the effort means she shows up often in her facebook friends news feeds where people are notified of their friends activities on facebook

calendar of events the company stokes its group membership currently about by sending out invitations to join the group every few months to new facebook friends collected by co founder sunmit singh

helped the year old companys sales when rootsgear has news he says "the easiest way to get the word out is facebook it spreads from one person to another real fast " while the group pages give small companies a presence they dont allow for much interaction with users thats why facebook recently started designing pages with small local businesses in mind it has started with restaurants bars and clubs and will soon expand to retailers and other types of businesses facebook expects many companies with group pages to move to company pages because of their advantages including bigger profile pictures and more flexible layouts opportunities for interaction with customers and access to members news feeds "we really want to create a product where our users can establish relationships with
