emails friendly fire re brownies in the kitchen colleague spam overloads inspiring new sorting tools until recently mukesh lulla president of a networking and security software company called teamf inc spent so much time sorting through emails he received each day that he barely had time to run his business "i probably had the highest email load in the company " says mr lulla who was getting to messages daily not counting annoying spam so a few months ago he downloaded a new software product from a company called clearcontext corp that automatically sends some noncritical messages into folders so he doesnt have to see them right away he can forward other messages to subordinates and receive notifications later if they dont respond now "entire conversations automatically go somewhere where i dont see them until i want to see them " says mr lulla who says he mentioned the program to others email overload is now considered a much bigger workplace problem than traditional email spam inboxes are bulging today partly because of what some are calling "colleague spam" that is too many people are indiscriminately hitting the "reply to all" button or copying too many people on trivial messages like inviting colleagues to partake of brownies in the kitchen a good chunk of todays emails are also coming from brand new sources like social and business networking sites like facebook inc and linkedin corp or text messages forwarded from cellphones unlike previous email technology companies that only addressed problems like external email spam or offered narrow products that screened messages for certain content new companies are now springing up to deal with the email overload problem and help sort the deluge silicon valley start ups including clearcontext of san francisco and seriosity inc of palo alto calif are specifically tackling the problem of internal email overload meanwhile other start ups like san franciscos xobni corp are trying to help people better organize and search the email and personal contact load they already have last year the average corporate email user received messages a day up from according to the radicati group a palo alto market research firm by workers are expecting to spend of their time just managing emails corporate email accounts usually managed by microsoft corp s popular outlook software have become a "central repository" for all this new information says william kennedy a microsoft general manager "these people are in pain " says matt brezina the year old co founder of xobni which has received &# million in funding from venture capitalists xobnis product places a set of features on top of a customers email inbox such as "profiles" of online contacts complete with photos and quick links to set up appointments the nine person company says it has about people globally testing the product including salespeople recruiters and marketing managers who use email frequently and expects to release it broadly early next year clearcontext founded in regularly charges &# for its main software product which uses algorithms to quickly analyze a users email to determine which contacts and messages are the most important a message from someone who is already listed in a users outlook contact list and to whom a user usually responds very quickly think spouse or boss is deemed critical and might be marked red but messages from others say those who usually include the user in a big group of recipients and to whom the user doesnt respond often might be marked blue or black the color coding helps people quickly see which messages they should respond to first users can also have certain emails automatically redirected away from the inbox "if there were an email from the ceo of my division or the ceo of honeywell believe me thats coming through in purple " says eric c liebeler a clearcontext user and a lawyer with industrial conglomerate honeywell international inc in st louis park minn users can pick their own colors for incoming messages and customize the software in other ways some of the new email management companies have run into snags when corporate information technology departments forbid individual workers from downloading their software usually because of security concerns but many companies dont restrict such downloads says deva hazarika clearcontexts chief executive mr liebeler uses other clearcontext functions such as one to quickly archive important messages and create audit trails the software lets him hit one button on a message to move it to a folder holding documents related to a specific case rather than having to manually drag and drop the message with a computer mouse of course tools like clearcontexts assume that people using them are already fairly organized and prone to filing their messages away instead of just letting them pile up says microsofts mr kennedy outlook tries to "appeal to a broad range of work styles " he says it recognizes the people microsoft calls email "filers" as well as the "pilers " filers strive to have an empty inbox by the end of the day while pilers "are the super messy desk people theyve got items in their inbox most of them unread " says mr kennedy for disorganized pilers microsoft recently added a better search feature to outlook so people can search through bulky folders or inboxes to find a particular message or document mr kennedy says microsoft also encourages other companies to build more targeted email products on top of outlook since it "makes our solutions even more sticky and valuable in the workplace " but integrating new email software with outlook isnt easy thats what seriosity discovered earlier this year when a group of eight workers in ebay inc s information technology department started testing seriositys product thad lyon ebays manager for enterprise infrastructure says he and his team liked the software which tries to get people to send fewer messages or just more relevant ones by allocating them a "virtual currency" and asking users to assign a value to each message sent a message asking someone if he or she wants to go out for lunch might carry a value of three "serios" of virtual currency a message about an important customer with an urgent problem might get serios users get serios at the start of week but they also receive serios when others send them messages but mr lyon says seriositys software slowed down some users email so much that ebay had to stop using it seriositys president and ceo simon roy says ebays problems with the product were unique but that seriositys software plug in for outlook "wasnt as fast as we would have liked and we are improving that" based on customer feedback a basic version of seriosity expected to be available early next year will be free the company says but premium data and other services will cost money the company hasnt yet announced fees mr lyon says hes looking forward to it since the email glut "is not going to go away "
