where e commerce meets chat social retailing gains traction users focused on shopping could be marketers dream but transparency pitfalls loom as more consumers turn to "social shopping" sites advertisers from nike to american express are targeting them with new holiday ad campaigns sites such as kaboodle shopstyle com and thisnext are a blend of social networking and e commerce they offer product recommendations some from the staff of the sites some from random users and let shoppers create wish lists comment on items and prices post photos and make purchases marketing executives say the sites are attractive because visitors tend to be focused on shopping rather than just browsing there are potential risks for both the advertisers and the sites which are still new and have yet to be fully tested transparency is one potential stumbling block on kaboodle for example in house editors assemble a list of items that they say are big sellers on the web they dub the list "hot picks " but advertisers can pay to have their products prominently displayed on it a note above those items discloses that they are sponsored by a company digital marketers say that if shoppers believe the sites are blurring the line between content and advertising there could be a backlash kaboodle says its site is completely transparent "we absolutely always have to keep a big clean clarity between advertising and editorial " says chief executive manish chandra the advertising on social shopping sites takes a number of forms to promote its nike+ sport kit a chip that goes into a running shoe and syncs with apples ipod nike bought all the advertising space on kaboodle from this past friday until yesterday the online shopfest dubbed "cyber monday " some of the ads include a button that users can click to add the item to their wish lists "we want to make sure that nike+ shows up as a very popular gift to give " says stefan olander global director of brand connections for nike other marketers are sponsoring gift guides and giveaways american express is sponsoring a couple of social shopping sites this holiday season including in style shopping which was created by time inc s in style magazine and shopstyle com visitors can shop for "editors picks" drawn from nearly brands and stores included on the site if customers pay with an american express card they get free shipping for companies the holidays are traditionally a time both to spend heavily on advertising and to experiment with new types of ads this year for instance a number of retailers including nordstrom and wal mart stores are sending text messages to shoppers who sign up to receive news about special sales with the social shopping sites advertisers are hoping to reach people like flora hall a high school senior from ellerslie ga ms hall joined kaboodle last week to make a digital christmas list to share with her friends and family members some of whom also have created profiles and wish lists on the site her list has about items ranging from sweaters to a digital camera under the description for each item is a link to a web site where it can be purchased "instead of them guessing or me having to tell them what i want they have all the options to choose from " she says ms hall has also commented on items on the wish lists of people shes never met one member of the site was trying to decide whether to buy a "cute" or a "sexy" cocktail dress and ms hall suggested the "cute" dress another kaboodle user was trying to decide between a zune and a creative zen mp player and ms hall recommended the creative zen player because she thinks it offers more customization "i dont know them personally but its cool because i can tell them my opinion " she says a year ago most of the social shopping sites either didnt exist or didnt register with marketers because their audiences were too small but in recent months they have gained traction for instance kaboodle which was acquired by hearst in august drew million unique u s visitors last month up from april according to nielsen online thisnext which launched this year is waiting until next year to offer advertising to take time to figure out how to create a clear separation between the advertising and the content on the site says gordon gould chief executive "if i came to you and said hey here is some great stuff to buy but it is restricted to only what this vendor sells and by the way i make money off of it what is the credibility factor at that point "
