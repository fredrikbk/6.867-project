invasion of jellyfish envelops japan in ocean of slime pink pound blobs clog nets but spawn recipes pointing fingers at china oki japan fisherman ryoichi yoshida pulled in his nets before dawn one morning hoping for lots of yellowtail and mackerel but the fish were overwhelmed by a heaving mass of living pink slime the creatures called nomura jellyfish can measure six feet across and weigh up to about pounds they have been drifting en masse to places like oki a small island miles off the coast bobbing beneath the surface of the water like pink mines they rip holes in fishermens nets and they poison fish "normally we just bring up the nets and it takes about an hour " said the weather beaten mr yoshida years old after his crew had cleared the jellyfish out of the nets using long poles and hooks "now it takes two or three hours and some of the fish escape " until these giant creatures were seen only occasionally in japanese waters but for the past five years they have been swarming every year into the sea of japan the water that separates japan from mainland asia during the biggest invasion so far in an estimated million jellyfish not yet mature drifted in each day its hard to calculate financial damage to fishermen but the japanese government last year counted about incidents of jellyfish trouble fish poisoned by jellyfish tentacles die with their mouths agape that mars their appearance and reduces their value by as much as "when their mouths are wide open it means theyve died going im in pain im in pain " explains mr yoshida scientists have various ideas about what causes the outbreak one has devised a computer model of ocean currents that suggests the jellyfish are breeding off the chinese coast near the mouth of the yangtze river one theory is that pollution perhaps linked to industrialization in china is helping create more algae in the sea the algae are food for plankton which is food for jellyfish then too there is speculation about a link to the three gorges dam the worlds largest hydroelectric power project under construction in the yangtze which could be changing water flows to the sea a dam in a section of the danube that runs between serbia and romania completed in changed the river flow after which the jellyfish population of the black sea exploded chinese officials and scientists deny that chinese pollution has caused the outbreaks "no research evidence in china supports a connection between pollution and jellyfish " says li qi a dean of the ocean university of china "floating jellyfish are mostly in the sea of japan thats japan and koreas problem " eager for a solution slasher squads of fishermen went out last year armed with barbed poles to attack jellyfish that were jamming up nets if the jellyfish are cut into three or more bits they usually die and get eaten by other sea creatures fishermen have also taken a trawl net and added a wire grill like a large potato masher at the trailing end when the net is pulled through a swarm of jellyfish they float through and are sliced up the japanese government is doing what it can it tracks the progress of jellyfish as they swarm through the sea of japan urging trawlers to steer clear of them the japanese harvest some jellyfish to eat jellyfish can be boiled and added to salads though smaller varieties are said to be more tender and tasty trying to win converts the fisheries ministry has drawn up a manual with tips on cooking with giant jellyfish menus include jellyfish flavored biscuits jellyfish soaked in rum and a dessert of jellyfish chunks in coconut milk one coastal firm tango jersey dairy has for the past three years produced or cartons of vanilla and jellyfish ice cream the jellyfish is soaked overnight in milk to reduce its smell and is then diced fumiko hirabayashi a director of the dairy says the jelly cubes are slightly chewy jellyfish is also getting publicity in womens magazines because it contains collagen a protein used in cosmetics "we think its important to use local ingredients " says mrs hirabayashi "and this has now become a local ingredient " despite the damage they cause jellyfish are actually delicate creatures the marine world aquarium in fukuoka west japan displayed two giant nomuras in despite the care taken with the cranes used to put them into tanks the jellyfish quickly took sick and they died in just a couple of weeks echizen matsushima aquarium in fukui one of the costal areas most affected by the influx has been displaying the jellyfish since but they soon die too and must be replenished one fear among scientists is that the creatures are multiplying in a "jellyfish spiral " shinichi uye a leading jellyfish researcher at hiroshima university in western japan thinks overfishing off china has led to fewer plankton eating fish leaving more plankton for the jellyfish to suck up this growing army of jellyfish then also eats fish eggs resulting in even fewer fish whatever the details says prof uye the problem seems to be industrial development "its like a harmless living thing has been angered " he says "the reason for its anger might lie with human activity " trying to understand why the jellyfish have started appearing in such numbers marine biologist kohzoh ohtsu studies their reproductive cycle on another part of oki one afternoon he and a colleague dressed in rubber clothing to protect against the poison cut lumps of tentacle from a pound jellyfish with a knife to make it light enough to bring aboard one cause of the mass invasions he says "could be rising sea temperatures" making it easier for the jellyfish to breed and feed near china though he doesnt know details of the sea temperatures there the peak water temperature in the sea of japan has been four or five degrees fahrenheit higher than normal in a couple of recent years indicating warmer seas in the region one fear is that higher temperatures or other environmental changes might one day even allow the giant jellyfish to breed around japan adding further to their numbers prof ohtsu has dedicated his research to jellyfish since after they became a national problem and his quest to unravel the mystery continues year round he lives at his marine research center in an isolated part of this small island and is alone there most of the year except for a laboratory full of jellyfish at different stages of development he travels to the japanese mainland about twice a month but the trips have to be kept short "i have living things here so i have to keep an eye on them " he says "if you leave them for three or four days they dont look too good they are very delicate " bai lin in shanghai contributed to this article
