danger at sea ships draw fire for rising role in air pollution as global trade grows so does the spewing of noxious emissions as air pollution rises on the global political agenda pressure is mounting on a largely hidden and proliferating source of dangerous emissions the shipping industry the corpuscles of the global economy ships carry more than of the worlds merchandise by volume and the tonnage of cargo sent by ships has tripled since yet the fuel propelling them is cheap and dirty and produces an especially noxious exhaust ships release more sulfur dioxide a sooty pollutant associated with acid rain than all of the worlds cars trucks and buses combined according to a march study by the international council on clean transportation that study also found that ships produced an estimated of the worlds smog causing nitrogen oxide emissions in only six countries in the world emitted more greenhouse gases which trap heat in the atmosphere warming the globe than was produced collectively in by all ships larger than tons according to the study and united nations statistics the global shipping industry is mired in an internal struggle over how to cope with its emissions problem and no simple strategies have emerged for regulating the open seas but demands for solutions are intensifying assertive governments and a few ports that wield substantial commercial power are proving that local action can reverberate internationally since jan the state of california has required ships sailing within miles of its shores to use cleaner burning fuels in their auxiliary engines similar to a measure governing europes baltic sea region the california law restricts access to americas two largest ports los angeles and long beach ships that dont comply can be fined or impounded the prospect of authorities around the world adopting different standards for fuel and emissions worries many in the shipping industry for commercial reasons most ship owners and operators prefer burning less expensive if dirtier fuel when sailing outside a protected zone yet the procedures for switching back and forth between different types of fuel are complicated and potentially hazardous so a few of shippings largest players are making an unprecedented proposal for a single strict limit on sulfur emissions in all oceans "the general population of the world would have to pay an extra one or two cents for their beer but youd solve the sulfur emissions problem " says pradeep chawla an executive of hong kong based anglo eastern ship management ltd yet the ravenous appetite of consumers for imported goods is growing so fast that marginal cuts in emissions would likely make no difference even a decrease in carbon emissions from ships could be offset by the expanding size of the worlds fleet says russell long vice president of environmental group friends of the earth a respected authority on the subject a u n study concluded that a reduction in sailing speeds could cut ships carbon dioxide output by but slower speeds would likely prompt shipping lines to deploy more ships to satisfy their customers "by adding vessels youd burn more fuel and generate more pollution and the benefit of going slower might be canceled out " says stanley shen a spokesman for orient overseas international ltd a shipping concern based in hong kong one big culprit is the industrys favorite fuel most ships rely on residual fuel oil also known as bunker fuel to power their huge engines bunker fuel is a tar like sludge left over from the refining of petroleum it often contains toxic heavy metals such as lead and vanadium and is collected from the bottoms of the distillation towers in which refineries process crude raw unheated bunker fuel has the composition and consistency of asphalt "you can walk on it " says claus jensen the fleet manager at torm a shipping company based in copenhagen it also is cheap a recent spot price for intermediate grade bunker fuel traded in singapore averaged &# a metric ton less than two thirds the rate of marine gas oil a distillate similar to what diesel trucks use "ship owners have had a very cheap fuel thats packed with energy and the refiners have had an outlet for their waste product " says ian adams secretary general of the international bunker industry association a group of firms that supply and trade bunker fuel "ship owners and refiners have had a perfect relationship " that synergy has come at a cost this month a peer reviewed study in the american chemical societys journal environmental science &amp technology estimated that underregulated air pollution from ships is causing cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deaths annually mostly along trade routes in asia and europe at current rates of growth oceangoing ships will generate of the particulates of the nitrogen oxides and more than of the sulfur oxides emitted by all forms of transportation in the u s by the environmental protection agency estimates that compares with levels for the same pollutants in of and respectively according to the epa a yard ship named the evelyn maersk represents one effort to address the problem owned by danish shipping giant a p moeller maersk as the vessel guzzles less fuel than it otherwise would thanks to an innovative boiler system that converts heat from its main engine into power that helps turn its propeller shaft like many ships the evelyn maersk purifies its bunker fuel in a superheated labyrinth of filters tanks and centrifuges packed into a sweltering room next to the main engine even so every full day that it cruises at sea this sky blue leviathan spews roughly tons of nitrogen oxides plus other airborne contaminants by comparison all the road vehicles in london churn out tons of nitrogen oxides every three hours according to an estimate by conservation group greenpeace international the u n agency that regulates shipping the international maritime organization has a membership of fractious national governments and its marine environment protection committee has been slow to make policy part of the problem is that shipping representatives oil companies and environmental groups alike lobby to influence committee decisions in addition splits within the shipping industry itself can slow progress ship owners for example have different priorities than firms that charter vessels for short periods when the committee gathered in london in july its working group on air pollution spent much of a three day session discussing procedural details including the punctuation in its final report according to one of the groups participants the imos strongest move against air pollution was the adoption in of a limit on the amount of sulfur allowable in marine fuel that measure took years for imo members to debate and ratify and by then the average sulfur content in marine oil had already decreased to half the level imo spokesman lee adamson concedes that the agency has accomplished little so far to curb air pollution but predicts it will agree as early as next april to toughen standards the imo "is working to a timetable thats been developed and agreed by its member governments " he says adding that they have "looked at the emissions issue in all its complexities and understood its multifaceted nature " in december fuel emissions from the shipping and aviation industries will be on the agenda when world leaders meet in bali indonesia to begin haggling over a climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol the international treaty aimed at curbing global greenhouse gas emissions in the u s the epa says it is developing new rules on ship emissions including one that would apply some of the same standards to marine engines that it enforces already for train locomotives the agency says it also has urged the imo to tighten international controls believing that a global consensus is the best way forward others say the epa is moving too slowly california sen barbara boxer has proposed a bill along with fellow california democrat dianne feinstein that would require ships within miles of u s shores to slash the sulfur content of their fuel to a scant by in october friends of the earth weighed in with a lawsuit against the epa seeking a similar low sulfur coastal zone epa officials say they are considering such a zone in conjunction with canadian authorities as it tends to be on environmental issues california is out front in early the commissions of both the long beach and los angeles ports held a series of public meetings to address ship related pollution area residents who blamed their cancers and their childrens asthma on smog from the ports showed up in force "in the first meetings they would come out and say you guys are murderers " recalls s david freeman president of the los angeles board of harbor commissioners martha cota a parenting instructor in long beach lived for years with her family just blocks from the city port she and two of her four children are asthmatics exhaust from ships and container trucks afflicts them and ms cota says her own breathing problems vary according to the level of port related activity "it gets worse when the traffic is bad the wheezing the pain in my chest " she says in spanish through an interpreter a california air resources board study found that the los angeles and long beach ports generated more than one fifth of all the diesel particulate matter in southern california in the smog from ships trucks and cranes at the ports caused an estimated premature deaths asthma attacks and lost work days that year the report said in june the two ports jointly announced a &# billion plan to slash harbor emissions by over five years by targeting ships and the trucks that shunt freight to and from them on jan the air resources board barred the use of dirty fuels within miles of state shores in about random inspections of ships this year officials have found only four violations elsewhere the cities of seattle and tacoma wash and vancouver british columbia have agreed to ambitious targets to reduce air pollution from ships entering their ports by sweden germany and several other countries along europes baltic sea turned it into a special zone where ships must cap the sulfur content of their fuel at in august the european commission expanded the umbrella to include the north sea and english channel the imposition of local restrictions creates a dilemma for ship owners and managers many ships now carry different grades of fuel switching between them as required at various points in a single journey this practice however can be dangerous if a ship tries to switch between fuels that are incompatible a common risk waxes in bunker fuel can separate out like "curdles in milk" and clog fuel filters says martin cresswell director and fleet general manager at china navigation co a shipping line headquartered in london lighter components in incompatible fuels can turn into gas and cause a "vapor lock" that stalls the engine mr cresswells nightmare is a big ship adrift without power amid the towering swells of a force storm at the crowded entrance to the english channel the risks and impracticality of switching fuels have persuaded two big shipping groups to seek a radical solution both the international association of independent tanker owners or intertanko which represents of the worlds independent tanker fleet and the hong kong shipowners association want the imo to require ships to give up bunker fuel and use only distillates containing no more than sulfur far below the current imo standard the international bunker industry association calls any proposal to replace bunker with distillates impractical oil companies say that if ships burned only distilled fuel refineries would need to process roughly million additional barrels of crude oil daily more than the entire output of saudi arabia but intertanko argues that if the imo set a deadline for ships to adopt distillates then refiners would have an incentive to invest in new capacity other ideas meanwhile draw on ancient seamanship wallenius wilhelmsen logistics of oslo has designed a concept ship that would produce zero emissions by harnessing power from the sun waves and wind skysails of hamburg germany is already marketing "towing kite propulsion systems" large parasails that it claims can reduce a ships fuel costs by as much as the first commercial cargo ship to be equipped with skysails parasails will enter service in december
