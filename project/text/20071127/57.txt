the building pressure united kingdom banking giant hsbc holdings plc yesterday became the first bank to bail out specialized funds known as structured investment vehicles hsbc plans to gradually shut down two bank sponsored sivs and take &# billion in mortgage backed securities and other assets owned by the funds onto its own balance sheet hsbc with &# trillion in assets said the move would have little impact on its ability to lend or on its capital adequacy ratio a gauge of a banks ability to absorb losses hsbc already had sustained significant losses on subprime mortgage investments in the u s the companys decision highlights a growing concern among investors that banks will increasingly be forced to take responsibility for losses at funds that had once been viewed as safe in recent weeks managers of money market funds including atlantas suntrust banks inc have moved to insure investors against losses on the funds investments in sivs which hold a total of &# billion in securities meanwhile a group of the worlds largest banks led by citigroup inc bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co are seeking to raise a "super fund" of as much as &# billion that would buy assets from the sivs to prevent a mass fire sale of assets sivs have been in trouble since the summer when the markets for short term debt on which sivs had depended all but dried up after a brief revival those markets have deteriorated further in recent weeks throughout november the bank "reached a fairly firm conclusion that the funding problems in the broad siv sector were not going to go away in the near term " said pierre goad an hsbc spokesman hsbc shares fell pence or to pence &# in london its american depositary shares slid &# or to &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading efforts by hsbc to protect its sivs are being watched closely by analysts and managers of money market mutual funds some of which have invested in debt issued by the two sivs called cullinan finance

reduced federated investors inc holds about &# million in asscher in its five largest money funds hsbcs move was viewed as a plus for firms such as these because it would help prevent a fire sale "while this does not eliminate default risk to federated and janus it does reduce or eliminate" the risk that the assets would be dumped into a market with few if any buyers said j p morgan analyst kenneth worthington in a research note yesterday hsbcs move particularly if followed by other banks also may help relieve stress among sivs by taking responsibility for a big chunk of the sectors assets it reduces the risk "of the kind of distressed siv asset sale which is kind of the nightmare scenario right now " says antony broadbent a bank analyst at sanford c bernstein in london "it will be interesting to see if others do follow suit " germanys dresdner bank a unit of allianz se and the u k s standard chartered plc both operate large sivs now being closely watched banks technically arent required to rescue their sivs but they may risk harm to their reputation if they dont a standard chartered spokesman said yesterday that the managers of the whistlejacket capital ltd siv are looking at alternative funding strategies a dresdner spokeswoman referred to nov comments by allianz which said at the time there was no plan to bring assets held by dresdners siv k corp onto its balance sheet bmo financial group whose bank of montreal unit is a sponsor of a sivs called links finance corp and parkland finance corp is likely to provide an update today during its fourth quarter report a spokesman declined to comment sivs were until recently a booming business issuing short term commercial paper or medium term notes and using the cash to buy higher yielding assets ranging from bank debt to securities backed by u s mortgages but investors have shied from sivs amid concerns about their holdings of subprime mortgage securities that has left them facing the prospect of selling assets to pay off maturing debt according to an oct lehman brothers report &# billion of medium term notes will mature in the first quarter at the same time many of the sivs holdings have fallen sharply in value a decline that in some cases can trigger requirements that force the funds to sell their assets in a statement hsbc said its move to rescue the two funds will "prevent funding constraints in the structured investment vehicle sector from forcing a liquidation of high quality assets " cullinan finance ltd which has &# billion in assets is the second largest siv after sigma finance corp an siv operated by a nonbank firm in london called gordian knot ltd asscher has &# billion in assets ratings firm standard &amp poors said yesterday that its long term aa minus rating on hsbc is unaffected hsbcs tier capital ratio a measure of a banks regulatory capital strength ranked high among its peers at as of june in a worst case scenario the company essentially would have to fund the entire new structure that ratio would fall to about hsbcs plan to rescue the two sivs is complex the company plans to set up at least one structure that much like the planned super fund will issue commercial paper or use hsbcs own funding to buy assets from the sivs the sivs will use the money to pay down maturing commercial paper and medium term notes hsbcs mr goad said the firm had considered participating in the super fund known as the master liquidity enhancement conduit "m lec certainly has the potential to benefit the entire siv sector " mr goad said "our plan is not in any way meant as a criticism of the m lec proposal " diya gullapalli contributed to this article
