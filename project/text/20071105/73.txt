shake up at citigroup credit crunch commercial paper market hit by new investor anxiety debt investors concerns about the health of financial firms are causing renewed troubles in an area that was at the center of this summers credit crisis the market for short term debt known as asset backed commercial paper the market plays a key role in the operation of bank backed investment funds known as "conduits" and structured investment vehicles which issue the paper to finance hundreds of billions of dollars in holdings from corporate receivables to subprime mortgage bonds in recent days though the market has entered a decline similar to that seen this summer when investors pension funds and insurers for example stopped buying the funds paper amid worries about the extent of their subprime exposure the summer crisis led to the emergency bailout of one german bank ikb deutsche industriebank ag and prompted others such as big british bank hbos plc to step in and provide funding for their conduits it also set the stage for troubles among structured investment vehicles or sivs which are now the target of an effort by citigroup inc and other major u s banks to raise a rescue fund that could total as much as &# billion this time around investors appear to be backing away from commercial paper in part because of anxiety about banks which typically guarantee the conduits debts but could now be facing a new wave of write downs on their own holdings of subprime backed securities if the situation worsens it could compound the banks problems by forcing them to cover the conduits maturing debt it could also trigger a wave of selling as the conduits and sivs or the banks that back them dump holdings they can no longer afford to keep "people are more worried about bank counterparty risk right now " said sherif hamid a fixed income strategist at lehman brothers holdings inc referring to the risk that banks wont be able to support the funds he noted though that the current pullback in the commercial paper market hasnt reached the intensity of august for example an hbos run conduit called grampian one of the largest conduits with about &# billion in paper outstanding as of august has recently tapped the market a further pullback among commercial paper investors would come at a particularly difficult time for sivs some of which have already been selling assets as investors refuse to lend them money the rescue fund which is still weeks away from coming into operation would seek to prevent a fire sale by buying highly rated securities from the sivs the funds success depends in part on the idea that the good names of the banks sponsoring it which include citigroup bank of america and j p morgan chase &amp co will lure investors back into the commercial paper market on which the fund will depend for financing the european part of the commercial paper market has fared less well than its larger u s counterpart traders say according to the latest data from the u s federal reserve u s asset backed commercial paper outstanding stood at &# billion at the end of october down from &# billion a month earlier similar data on the euro asset backed commercial paper market arent published but according to one trader the market has shrunk to about &# billion down from more than &# billion in the spring conduits and sivs largely based in europe borrow in both the u s and european markets
