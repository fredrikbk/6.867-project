pakistan emergency in the war on terror few problems are more difficult for u s foreign policy than our alliance with the nuclear armed muslim state of pakistan president pervez musharrafs imposition of emergency rule this weekend is the latest setback it runs the risk of making pakistan even less stable than it already is and makes it harder for mr musharraf to restore democratic legitimacy as he says he still wants to do secretary of state condoleezza rice was quick to criticize mr musharrafs move and said yesterday that the u s would review its financial aid to pakistan which has amounted to more than &# billion over the past five years most of it for the military senator joseph biden chairman of the foreign relations committee issued a statement urging the administration to "move from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy " that oversimplifies both current u s policy and the options going forward but it should indicate to general musharraf how his "second coup " as some are calling it will be received in washington mr musharraf defends his emergency decree as a response to rising islamic militancy and political instability caused by an interfering judiciary but the timing and his sacking of the chief justice of the supreme court suggest that the general was mainly interested in pre empting a ruling on his recent re election which the opposition boycotted the high court was expected to make a decision soon on that october referendum and the general couldnt be sure of the outcome no one can dispute that islamic violence is on the rise in pakistan three weeks ago people died in a bomb attack on a homecoming parade for former prime minister benazir bhutto more than pakistanis have perished in suicide bombings and militant attacks since july when mr musharraf ordered troops to storm the red mosque in islamabad to destroy a taliban style movement headquartered there but the violence is not the product of democratic opponents of mr musharrafs rule it is the work of the same islamist extremists who have also tried to kill the general more than once thanks to some of mr musharrafs own mistakes such as a truce those forces have been able to build safe havens in the tribal areas along the afghanistan pakistan border far from targeting those forces however the weekend action has included rounding up democratic politicians lawyers and human rights activists the general also suspended the constitution and closed down the free media by attacking these sources of moderate civil society mr musharraf makes it easier for the islamists to pose as the main opposition a more effective way to defeat the extremists is by respecting the rule of law and introducing a democratic government that reflects the wishes of pakistans mostly moderate population this is the course pakistan had been on in recent weeks with encouragement from washington mr musharraf who seized power in a coup was working toward a political compromise with democratic opponents he had pledged to give up his military role by mid november and become a civilian president he brokered a tentative power sharing deal with ms bhutto that would have curtailed religious parties power in parliament elections which may now be delayed were scheduled for january it will now be more difficult though not impossible to get back on this track ms bhutto who condemned the state of emergency as the "blackest day" in pakistans history pointedly did not rule out continuing power sharing talks with mr musharraf prime minister shaukat aziz told a news conference yesterday that "we are committed to making sure that elections are held and that the democratic process flourishes in pakistan " but the decree will make it harder for ms bhutto to agree to any deal with the general the main u s interest here is a stable pakistan that can help defeat the jihadists that interest wont be served by precipitously moving to sever ties with mr musharraf or with the pakistan military the way the u s did in the s that would only reduce whatever leverage the u s continues to have with islamabad as well as reduce the prospects for cooperation in pursuing al qaeda safe havens the bush administration will have to speak clearly to pakistanis that its support for its government is not limited to mr musharraf and to loudly and publicly urge the general to honor his pledge to relinquish his military commission and hold elections as soon as possible after this weekend it is clearer than ever that u s policy has to prepare for the post musharraf era
