americas a cuban hero cuban physician oscar elias biscet and seven others will be awarded the presidential medal of freedom by george w bush in a white house ceremony today but dr biscet will not be there to accept his honor in person today like most days for the better part of the past eight years he is locked away in a dungeon on fidel castros island paradise tales of totalitarian gulags may strike some readers as ancient history something that happened during europes th century experiments in fascism communism and nazism yet in cuba the gulag and its suffering have not ended dr biscets medal serves to remind us of this fact by raising the profile of his struggle for a free cuba the award also highlights what castros regime fears most it is not the guns and tanks of some imperial invader but rather the faith courage and nonconformity of the countrys own people dr biscet is a renowned pacifist and devout christian he has said that he is inspired by the examples of martin luther king gandhi and the dalai lama we know this and much more about his life thanks to the coalition of cuban american women which says it documents all the facts it publishes about political prisoners through live testimonies from cuba while practicing medicine in cuban hospitals for more than a decade dr biscet became increasingly concerned about the governments abortion practices in at a havana hospital he took the risk of engaging in a clandestine study on the administration of a drug called rivanol to abort advanced pregnancies the drug was being widely used particularly on girls as young as who having been forced to leave their parents and work in rural areas as part of their schooling found themselves "in trouble " the study concluded that rivanol resulted in viable fetuses being born alive what often happened next horrified dr biscet who later wrote that "the umbilical cord was cut and they were allowed to bleed to death or they were wrapped in paper and asphyxiated " as a result of his vocal opposition to these abortion practices he lost his job his family lost their home and castros goons were sent to beat him up but the bullying didnt work by now he was actively engaged in resistance against the regime and as he has written his conscience would not allow him to back down those familiar with dr biscets work say that he was instrumental in building at the grassroots level on the impact of pope john paul iis visit to cuba in january the regime took notice dr biscet became one of the few dissidents that castro has ever attacked by name in a speech to the nation as a proponent of cuban democracy told me "it proves that biscet really got under castros skin " from july until november dr biscet was jailed times during those detentions he was held for days in windowless cells or thrown in with populations of violent criminals and the mentally ill in february he was tried and sentenced to three years in prison for holding a press conference to announce a peaceful march during the ibero american summit in havana the backdrop at the press conference was two cuban flags hung upside down to protest the states violations of human rights he was convicted for "dishonoring national symbols public disorder and inciting delinquent behavior" and sent to a maximum security prison miles east of havana making family visits difficult cubas political prison system is structured not only to punish dissent but also to force the "rehabilitation" of the prisoner captives who give in admit the error of their political ways and beg forgiveness sometimes can get out of jail but dr biscet is no such prisoner while serving his three year sentence he increased his resistance carrying out fasts and pushing for the release of political prisoners the regime responded by putting him again in a squalid solitary confinement cell or among dangerous inmates he was denied visitors and medical treatment and his bible was confiscated in late october dr biscet was released from prison only to be arrested days later as he was preparing to meet with fellow cuban human rights advocates in april he was convicted as were others who had been rounded up in the now infamous march crackdown on dissent he received a year sentence for "serving as a mercenary to a foreign state " the coalition of cuban american women reports that from november january he was held in "an underground dungeon with a common criminal and lost pounds " his time in solitary has been no less inhumane dr biscet has described his foot by foot cell as having no windows or running water it has a hole in the floor for a toilet and is infested with vermin one of his confinement periods there lasted days dr biscet says that "the cuban government has tortured me during eight years trying to drive me insane " perhaps most painfully for the prisoner his wife has been fired from her job as a nurse and is harassed by the state dr biscet says that the regime has offered to let him go if he agrees to leave cuba he will not in an april letter to his wife elsa he explained why "my suffering is much much less since i began to seek after my dream of being free but not only for me personally if i thought only of myself you know that i would have been free a long time ago and i would have been rid of these unsettling anxieties but i want to see my friends son my adversarys son or any citizen laughing happily from the satisfaction in their lives and enjoying a wealth of freedom because it is the only way human talent reaches its maximum splendor " reading those words it is difficult to think of anyone more deserving of a medal honoring those who serve the cause of freedom
