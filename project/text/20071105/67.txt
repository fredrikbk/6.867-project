politics &amp economics how japans exports put it at risk economy would take hit if global slowdown comes dependency on u s ebbs tokyo japans growth is increasingly dependent on exports and the corporate investment needed to manufacture those exports that could be a problem now as the possibility looms of an economic slowdown in the u s for decades japans biggest export market japan could be partially insulated by a long term shift in its trade relations though still export dependent japans economy is less u s dependent than before in of japans exports went to the u s this year only will probably less than its exports to china including hong kong for the first time this trade shift means that if the u s economy alone goes bad growth for japan "will become more difficult but not catastrophic " says macquarie securities economist richard jerram the effects are likely to be seen nov when the government announces gross domestic product the widest measure of economic activity for the july september quarter flat consumer spending plus a sharp fall in housing investment probably caused domestic demand to shrink economists say but exports led by those to the rest of asia likely more than made up for this to produce some to of annualized growth how japan makes it through a possible u s downturn and its global knock on effects is crucial for the long term economic health of the worlds second largest economy a fallback into the recessions that dogged japan until would mean it imported less diminishing an important contribution to global growth longer term with japans population falling its corporations need to get a bigger slice of their earnings from overseas in order to continue growing already japans major auto makers lose money in their domestic market even as they devour market share in the u s a big reason japans exports have shifted away from the u s is that japans industrial strengths fit neatly with the demand from fast growing economies such as machine tools to kit out factories and equipment to construct roads and buildings komatsu ltd the worlds second biggest maker of construction machines after the u s s caterpillar inc is one of the japanese companies most dependent on overseas markets because cuts in public spending have led its domestic sales to fall during the past years such sales are dependent on building activity overseas which is already being hit in the u s by the problems in the subprime mortgage market komatsu expects the north american market for construction and mining machines to decline to this year caterpillar last month reduced its profit forecast for the year because of such market conditions komatsus president says falling u s demand will be more than offset by increased demand in china and southeast asia and the company expects record sales this year following a increase in revenue to trillion yen &# billion in the fiscal year ended march its exports to asia are now valued at more than twice those to the u s "even if the american market falls it wont affect our profits so much " says president kunio noji komatsu like many other japanese manufacturers is planning for the future based on the premise that these conditions will continue research and development will stay in japan because that is where komatsus keiretsu is located making it easier to coordinate the design of new machines and their manufacture in addition main parts the engine the transmission and the hydraulic gears will be made in japan and sent to overseas assembly lines some to of the value of a komatsu shovel made in china is exported from japan says mr noji this kind of export makes japan the only member of the group of eight leading nations to run a trade surplus with china including hong kong the concern for the japanese economy is that this as well as japanese exports to other countries might be based on "triangular" trade if u s consumers stop buying goods made for example in china then chinese industry wont need japanese machines to build and equip its factories the stakes are heightened for japan because exports are increasing as a percentage of japanese gdp to this year from from in that means that if the u s drags the rest of the world into a recession japan will be more vulnerable than ever
