northern new jersey chapter of the international association for financial planning and is on the investment policy committee for the financial planning association a leading association for financial advisers mr bugen and the firms investment committee chairman brian kazanchy detailed their moderate allocation portfolio for the wall street journal over a period of five years it aims to beat a mix of the standard &amp poors stock index and lehman brothers u s aggregate index of bonds with less risk about a third of the firms &# billion under management is invested in this portfolio the firms typical client has investments totaling &# million to &# million and a time horizon of five to years the advisers usually begin by asking clients their goals addressing issues like retirement needs and taxes they then determine a rate of return required to achieve those goals tweaks are made depending on how the client feels about risk the moderate portfolio has just less than half its assets in u s and foreign stocks including a relatively large percentage in small companies in both developed and emerging markets just less than one third of the portfolio is in bonds the remaining is in nontraditional investments besides the commodities exposure the portfolio features a real estate fund and three funds that employ investing techniques used by hedge funds the advisers expect these investments to slightly reduce the portfolios risk the advisers typically modify these allocations once or twice a year usually when the returns from an asset class deviate significantly from historical norms here is the breakdown stocks the advisers choose about midsize and large stocks from across major developed countries for their internally managed rac global disciplined equity portfolio the advisers dont differentiate between large company stocks in the u s and foreign developed markets because they consider them to be highly correlated about of the portfolio is allocated to rac global disciplined equity portfolio and buying and selling is managed with clients tax considerations in mind the fund has a heavy concentration of "value" stocks those considered cheap on the basis of price earnings ratios and other financial metrics the remaining shares are pricier "growth" stocks those that investors are willing to pay premiums for because their earnings per share expansion is more rapid than that of the broader market mr bugen believes that "over meaningful periods of time value has been better than growth " that is a matter of debate in the investment community with critics saying any advantages are temporary ones that an efficient market ultimately arbitrages away the regentatlantic advisers like small and microcap stocks and invest of the portfolio in dfa u s small cap value portfolio j p morgan micro cap fund and ishares russell microcap exchange traded fund they allocate an additional to foreign small stocks primarily through two funds from dimensional fund advisors of santa monica calif dfa is known for using computer models to identify value shares while seeking to hold investment costs as low as possible since the financial advisers also have used forward international small company stock fund rounding out the stock holdings is a allocation to developing country shares of which about is in small stocks the advisers say they have increased their allocation to emerging countries in the past two years because they think these economies have potential for high growth and will fuel the global economy they use lazard emerging markets fund dfa emerging markets small cap portfolio and vanguard emerging markets vipers etf bonds in general the advisers use bonds to provide stability to the portfolio "risk is better spent in the equity side " says mr kazanchy thus they mostly stick to very high quality short term bonds which are the least vulnerable to interest rate changes they have bought low quality or "junk " bonds in the past when those were paying yields of a few percentage points more than treasurys "if theres enough compensation for the risk wed consider it " says mr bugen currently the portfolio has in short term municipal bonds the advisers create a municipal bond portfolio for each client by buying about bond issues depending on the state in which the client lives with maturities ranging up to five years in the smallest portfolios they manage they find it more cost effective to put this portion of their clients portfolio in vanguard short term tax exempt fund and t rowe price tax free short intermediate fund the advisers also invest about in j p morgan tax aware real return fund the fund holds the bulk of its investments in municipal bonds but invests a small portion in financial derivatives aimed at providing protection against inflation before this funds launch last year the advisers invested in treasury inflation protected securities alternative investments to diversify the portfolio the advisers invest in real estate commodities and some mutual funds that use tactics often associated with hedge funds those largely unregulated investment pools for wealthy individuals and institutional accounts like endowments that often use leverage and derivatives to maximize their bets the allocation to real estate was until fall when the advisers began scaling it back concerned that many areas had peaked the allocation is down to about in morgan stanley institutional international real estate mutual fund "this is probably the lowest allocation weve ever had " says mr kazanchy in the team started investing in commodities they werent satisfied with existing investment options so they created customized ones and now they invest of the portfolio in so called

index declines in addition they put of the portfolio in an exchange traded note of barclays plcs barclays bank this tracks the dj aig commodity index total return etns are debt securities that are variants of exchange traded funds about in the portfolio is invested in hedge fund like mutual funds because the advisers believe these "help lower volatility and provide positive exposure regardless of market conditions " says mr kazanchy their picks j p morgan multi cap market neutral which uses quantitative screening to buy some stocks and make bearish bets on others with the aim of generating returns independent of the stock markets direction schwab hedged equity select fund which uses charles schwab corp s stock ratings to decide which stocks to own and which to short and absolute strategies fund which uses a wide variety of strategies via subadvisory pacts with other money managers in the market downturn this summer some of these funds including the schwab hedged equity and j p morgan multi cap market neutral funds struggled to meet their goals "its caused a bit of concern " says mr kazanchy but added that theyre sticking with them for now the funds managers say their holdings were hurt partly because some large investors were dumping stocks in the summer for now the managers arent making any changes "were staying with our strategic model " says kwang lee a client
