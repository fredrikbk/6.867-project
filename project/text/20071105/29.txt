general orders emergency rule in pakistan puts military under the gun strains seen as army its popularity waning steps up its civil role lahore pakistan gen pervez musharraf imposed emergency rule in pakistan boosting the authority of the military but also testing the willingness of the population to defer to an institution whose popularity has been on the wane the declaration saturday by gen musharraf who is both head of the army and president was followed by the blackening of private domestic and international television channels the replacement of several supreme court justices and detention for about political opponents and human rights activists those opponents not silenced registered their protest and the u s which counts pakistan as a key ally expressed its concern at these "extreme and unreasonable measures " pakistans military already faces unprecedented scrutiny both for its inability to contain islamist violence and for its presence in almost every crevice of pakistans civil administration a fresh period of military enforced rule risks exacerbating those tensions in a way that reverberates far beyond this nation of million pakistans lawless tribal belt bordering afghanistan is the suspected home of senior al qaeda leaders including osama bin laden many in pakistan have bristled at the armys failures to stem a wave of suicide attacks which in recent months have erupted in the countrys biggest cities those failures contrast with the success of retired and active soldiers in scoring plum government positions highlighting for some a military that appears more interested in the benefits of running the country than in defending it taken together those trends have led to a change in the perception of the army long one of the most respected institutions in pakistan from a source of stability to a potential liability gen musharraf had embarked on a program to start reducing the role of the army in public life but the state of emergency which gen musharraf proclaimed in his role as army chief may now make the military a larger target for extremist attacks and for public criticism already army officers have been instructed to avoid public places in uniform "its become an army thats not well liked " said retired brig gen shaukat qadir founder and former official of the islamabad policy research institute an islamabad think tank he added "this government has been unprecedented in its invasion of the civilian sector by retired officers you open any door and you see a soldier sitting there " gen musharraf a former commando who seized power in a military coup said in an address on state run television just before midnight saturday that he imposed emergency rule because "pakistan has reached a dangerous point and is undergoing an internal crisis " he added "i fear that if timely action is not taken then god forbid there is a threat to pakistans sovereignty " the emergency rule order doesnt dissolve parliament and gen musharraf years old said he was still committed to holding parliamentary elections that had been part of a transition in the nation from military rule to civilian government the elections which would install a new prime minister were originally slated for january under emergency rule however the life of the current parliament stacked with supporters of gen musharraf can be extended for one year from nov the government appears almost certain to curtail sharply any campaigning and will likely postpone elections yesterday pakistans prime minister shaukat aziz provided no clear timetable for emergency rule saying it would be in place for as long as needed gen musharrafs emergency order was a major setback for u s foreign policy and prompted unusually strong criticism from the bush administration gen musharraf is a key u s ally in fighting islamic extremism and pakistan has received almost &# billion in u s assistance since the sept terrorist attacks but senior u s officials had been encouraging him to smooth the path for a transition to democracy and as recently as late last week had publicly discouraged him from taking any emergency measures yesterday the u s embassy in islamabad said "the government of the united states is gravely concerned about orders by the government of pakistan to suppress the news media and to detain lawyers politicians human rights activists and others during the proclamation of emergency such extreme and unreasonable measures are clearly not in pakistans best interest and contradict the progress pakistan has made toward becoming a fully democratic society " former prime minister benazir bhutto has been expected to play an integral role in the transition she and gen musharraf recently brokered an agreement that paved her return from self imposed exile and dropped corruption charges against her in return she agreed to work with him toward the january elections and was seen as a front runner for prime minister in a new civilian government with gen musharraf as president those ties are now being tested on saturday upon returning from a short trip to dubai ms bhutto said she planned to discuss with other political leaders a plan to reverse gen musharrafs suspension of the constitution "i agree with him that we are facing a political crisis but i believe the problem is dictatorship i dont believe the solution is dictatorship" she told the british television broadcaster sky news ms bhutto remains free from house arrest another former prime minister now in exile nawaz sharif has vowed to return as well in his first attempt in september he was swiftly deported back to exile in saudi arabia mr sharif who was overthrown by gen musharrafs military has called for the political opposition to rise up and challenge his foe so far though there have been few signs of civilian unrest or mass protests against gen musharrafs action with thousands of police and paramilitary troops on the streets the major cities such as islamabad and karachi saw few disturbances yesterday the state of emergency was declared just days before pakistans supreme court was expected to rule on the validity of an election by national and state legislators early last month that granted gen musharraf another five year term as president on the understanding he would step down as army chief this month the supreme court hadnt validated the result because of challenges to his re election to a civilian post while in a military uniform with the state of emergency gen musharraf has improved his chances of a favorable decision a new panel of supreme court judges excluding seven who resigned or were dismissed is expected to reconvene for hearings today according to muhammad ali saif a member of gen musharrafs legal team mr saif said some of the dismissed judges were involved in ordering the release of persons held in secret detention who are now suspected of carrying out recent terrorist attacks "one cant put all the blame on the president " he said "one has to understand the situation thats been created in pakistan " authorities have rounded up several prominent human rights activists who had been sharply critical of gen musharraf and had pushed the supreme court to take cases involving people secretly detained without trial a person identifying herself as a member of the lahore police answered the mobile phone of asma jahangir chairwoman of the human rights commission of pakistan and said the veteran activist had been placed under house arrest yesterday police broke up a meeting of activists and arrested several of them including i a rehman the commissions director according to his son ashaar rehman in an email sent to journalists and others yesterday ms jahangir wrote "we believe that musharraf has to be taken out of the equation and a government of national reconciliation put in place it must be backed by the military short of this there are no realistic solutions although there are no guarantees that this may work " security forces have been struggling to suppress an islamic militancy that has killed hundreds of civilians and soldiers in recent months the battle appears to have generated fissures within the military last week paramilitary troops in northwest pakistan surrendered saying friday they didnt want to fight their muslim brothers a few months ago more than soldiers were taken hostage without firing a shot an official in the army spokesmans office said yesterday that have been freed following the earlier release of about two dozen troops a series of suicide bombings targeting army bases and convoys have underscored the ability of militants to penetrate even the most heavily guarded positions the threat has stretched beyond the tribal regions into areas that had been relatively stable gen musharrafs order imposing emergency rule cited a "visible ascendancy in the activities of extremists and incidents of terrorist attacks " the current woes and waning popularity of pakistans army mark a sharp reversal for an institution that has run the country for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in and when it hasnt civilian leaders have sought to stay in its good graces in clashes for power the military almost always has won helping solidify its position as the nations center of political gravity in ms bhuttos father zulfiqar ali bhutto went from being a martial law administrator under a military ruler to prime minister of a civilian government four years later he turned to the military to quell civil unrest his army chief gen zia ul haq overthrew mr bhutto amid allegations of vote rigging in mr bhutto was convicted of conspiring to murder a political opponent and hanged as the countrys president and army chief gen zia introduced a quota of for military in civilian jobs and pressured the head of the civil service to absorb more of his men after gen zia died in a plane crash pakistans subsequent civilian leaders did little to roll back the militarys involvement in government under gen musharraf former officers now run universities state owned ports telecommunication and fertilizer companies as well as key parts of the government what is more retired generals head training institutes and the commission that screens bureaucrats for new job assignments giving them great sway over the nations civil administration estimates from pakistani newspapers citing government lists range into the high hundreds of active and retired soldiers serving in the civil administration the government through the ministry of information didnt respond to questions seeking comment on these figures the numbers represent a tiny fraction of the total of more than civil service staff but most of the appointments have come at the top ranks of the central government in an interview last month before emergency rule was imposed army spokesman maj gen waheed arshad said the military fully supports strong civil institutions and has stepped in only in times of government paralysis reached yesterday evening gen arshad said the military hadnt assumed extra administrative duties under emergency rule "the government is still functioning the military is doing its own job battling extremists " he said but critics say the armys pervasive presence in the administration has undermined pakistans democratic prospects and heightened political volatility "if we dont have autonomous civil institutions we will never have stable democracy in this country " said hasan askari rizvi the author of the book "military state and society in pakistan " before the state of emergency was declared the government was adopting steps to reduce the armys role in civilian life to help counter the mounting public criticism for key government institutions it approved search committees to draw upon a deeper pool of talent to find chief executives the government also established criteria for university heads such as doctorate degrees that should disqualify many military men including those currently holding the jobs as contracts expire it planned to ease out those who dont meet the criteria according to ishrat hussain chairman of pakistans national commission for government reforms retired officers in civil posts say they are well aware of the public resentment against the military under gen musharraf resentment that may now grow if reform efforts are put on the back burner with the imposition of emergency rule but some also say the military has injected professionalism and vitality into key government institutions such as the civil service lt gen javed hassan for instance was serving as commandant of pakistans national defense college when he was tapped in by gen musharraf to run the newly created national school of public policy an umbrella group of schools for civil servants he was a commander of pakistani forces during an ill fated incursion into indian territory in known as the kargil conflict at his new post the recently retired general quickly brought in a passel of other former generals on two year contracts to run the different training institutes for his own staff mr hassan recruited a retired brigadier general and a seconded army captain some veteran civil servants likened his arrival to an incursion behind enemy lines but dressed in a grey suit red tie and brightly polished black shoes at a recent interview he said the civil servants sent to his institutes had lax ideas about training they thought they could come to class late or run businesses on the side not anymore "the question became how to enforce discipline " said mr hassan mr hassan said he has been trying to reduce the militarys presence at his school by not renewing the contracts of some of the generals who came with him in but he hasnt found his own successor yet and to advance their careers students must continue to make a good impression on the former soldiers when mr hassan and his staff critique students the evaluations are forwarded to the federal public service commission to match up civil servants with new job assignments like mr hassan the commissions chairman is a retired lieutenant general zahid hussain in islamabad contributed to this article
