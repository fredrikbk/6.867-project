wrangling over taxes with charlie rangel if charles b rangels tax plan really shifted taxes from blue state citizens to red state citizens through alternative minimum tax relief it would be welcome "stop the middle class tax raid " oct editorial page many red states receive more from the federal government than they pay in taxes if blue states quit subsidizing them red states would raise their own taxes and blue states could lower theirs mike galvin chicago ill mr rangels op ed pushes his proposed tax reduction and reform act of as middle class tax relief because it would permanently repeal the amt for individuals however his bill contains provisions to expand the earned income credit i cant see how that ties into amt relief for the middle class henry h philips durango colo mr rangels tax plan is misguided the purpose of taxation is to provide revenue for government operations unfortunately tax policy is a tool for social engineering in this country and not only at the federal level i say drop the regular tax plan and keep the amt it has a relatively high exemption so the lower wage earners dont pay it it has three rates if you include the zero bracket so its progressive there are no deductions or favorable treatment of one class of income over another reducing the social engineering of the current system to the extent that we should have one the amt is an ideal tax code christopher elhardt houston mr rangel hit a new low for governmental gobbledygook in order to pay for repealing the alternative minimum tax he says he will "restructure benefits provided at the upper income levels " the translation of this orwellian masterpiece of double talk is that he wants to increase taxes on any family making over &# a year which is hardly the "upper income level " these are the people who are already paying the vast majority of all income taxes mr rangel later talks about the need for "courage" in talking about tax reform he could start by telling the truth about this monster tax increase he is proposing joseph a shaginaw duluth ga mr rangels "stop the middle class tax raid" article provides no meaningful solutions for fixing our broken tax code it merely promotes further liberal attempts at income redistribution mr rangel proposes restoring "a sense of equity and fairness" to the tax code by "reducing windfalls" to equity and hedge fund managers as well as by "adjusting " the top tax rates two classic liberal euphemisms for raising taxes on the rich mr rangel proceeds to criticize republican members of congress for proposing "a round of tax cuts that are not paid for " he ignores the fact that the and tax cuts pushed by president george bush have paid for themselves many times over by increasing capital to wealthier americans which in turn has provided greater incentive for investment and risk taking as has been well documented this has resulted in record tax windfalls for treasury enormously reducing the national debt despite the recent runaway spending by mr rangels colleagues in congress however for mr rangel and his fellow congressional democrats the issue has never really been about the tax cut being "paid for " it is merely about taxing the rich punitively as a matter of ideology while ignoring the effect on the economy finally mr rangel uses the well worn liberal rallying cry of putting money "back in the pockets of americas working families " apparently he doesnt consider equity and hedge fund managers or the many other wealthy americans in the top tax brackets to be "working " perhaps he believes these corporate pigs simply spend all day devising plans to steal from the poor heres hoping that the members of congress and the next president whichever party he she may be from fix the tax code based on policies that are beneficial for the economy and not based on any class ideology reuvain borchardt new york
