the easier rider baby boom bikers defect to the trike three wheel motorcycles gain a bigger following despite ridicule factor one day last march robert lee hit a patch of gravel while piloting his pound motorcycle he survived the wipeout unscathed but the retired linotype operator threw in the towel he switched to a three wheel motorcycle known as a "trike " "at my age i cant afford to be stranded on the road " says mr lee a year old massachusetts resident who has been riding motorcycles for four decades mr lee admits hes gotten a "few strange looks" while cruising around in his new method of transport which has one wheel in front for steering and two in back for power but so far hes gotten no insults after decades of being dismissed as fringe vehicles trikes are gaining favor with baby boomers confronting the realities of old age from knee injuries and arthritis to a diminished sense of balance motorcycles may forever symbolize youthful rebellion but trikes which sacrifice heart pounding acceleration and the thrill of leaning into turns for greater stability are a lot easier to maneuver in stop and go traffic another factor is the passenger sitting in back the heavier the passenger the harder it is for the rider to balance a traditional two wheel bike and "many of these riders are guys with wives who have we like to say blossomed over the years " says jeffrey vey president of texas based trike maker thoroughbred motorsports inc though small the trike industry a cottage business of closely held shops is growing fast turning out machines last year in the u s up from a year earlier according to cnw marketing research u s motorcycle sales by contrast are declining so far this year after more than a decade of steady growth in the past year major motorcycle makers including harley davidson inc and polaris industries inc s victory motorcycles unit have gotten into the trike business announcing plans to introduce new models in dealerships harley spokesman bob klein says trikes represent an untapped market one largely made up of folks who are either physically unable to ride two wheel machines or are scared of falling off of them "we see trikes as a way of putting more people on harley davidsons " he says some trikes especially those meant to entice novice riders bear little resemblance to traditional choppers at this years motorcycle rally in sturgis s d one of the countrys biggest thoroughbred motorsports unveiled the stallion a three wheeler sheathed in so much fiberglass paneling it looks like a tiny open air car the stallion also boasts such car like creature comforts as cupholders a cd player and even air conditioning mr vey the companys president says he plans to build between and stallions in the model year and expects that many of its buyers will have never ridden a motorcycle base price &# as it made its way through downtown sturgiss streets which were packed with dyed in leather bikers the stallion attracted attention not all of it positive "we call that a car buddy " one smirking pedestrian said "why bother " yelled another trikes have yet to overcome what many enthusiasts see as their biggest downside what karl blaeser who rides a harley davidson fat boy calls "the ridicule factor " "its hard for me to ever picture myself on three wheels until i retire to a trailer park in vero beach " says the year old information technology consultant in pasadena calif al courier who suffers from stiff knees says hed consider riding a trike but his wife patricia cuts him off "his vanity would never allow him to ride one of these " she says "his legs would have to be chopped off first " even physical infirmities arent enough to make some purists switch steve phillipss leg pain and heart ailments would seem to make him an ideal candidate for trike ownership but the year old phoenix resident says hed have to be in desperate shape before hed ride one "theyll never handle like a motorcycle or give you the same feeling so whats the point " he says another downside of a trike is its cost turning a motorcycle into a trike requires a lot of hand labor and additional parts prices typically start at around &# and many models cost between &# and &# about as much as a small luxury car like an audi a or bmw series by contrast a new harley davidson motorcycle can cost as little as &# although a heavily optioned top of the line ultra classic touring bike can cost over &# plus most trikes are manufactured by small companies that dont offer warranty and repair service comparable to what large manufacturers provide some states license trikes separately from cars or motorcycles meaning more time at the motor vehicles office that didnt stop dennis henneberg last spring the year old auto dealership owner traded his harley davidson lowrider for a tricked out trike converted from a larger harley touring model mr henneberg likes the trikes smooth ride and that its windshield and fiberglass bodywork shield him and his wife marlene from the wind but the trikes main advantage is that it doesnt tip over easily wearing a stars and stripes bandana around his head mr henneberg says discomfort from a vietnam war leg wound and the general effects of getting older made it increasingly hard to hold up his heavy bike at traffic lights the trikes stability allows the couple to relax during long rides like the mile trip to sturgis from their home in loveland colo "its a lot more comfortable for both of us " says mrs henneberg who sat in the back togetherness is a common theme among trikers david and linda barthel motorcycle riders from sterling colo are too young in their mid s to fit the standard description of trike buyers yet they say they want a quieter more comfortable ride that allows them to enjoy each others company more than they could in their years of riding separate motorcycles "we like to cruise around town looking at other peoples homes chatting about what they are doing with their landscaping basically spying on the smiths " mr barthel says while browsing the trikes on sale at the sturgis rally but will other riders still give them the traditional motorcyclists "wave" casually sticking a hand out to the side as they pass on the road "who cares " mr barthel responds
