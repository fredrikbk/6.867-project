inflation holds potential for profits in certain sectors investors have lots of things to worry about these days so it is understandable that they arent focusing on the prospect of higher inflation it is one scenario that could turn out to be painful or profitable of sectors in the standard &amp poors stock index two are in the red for the year both with lots to lose if inflation creeps up the so called consumer discretionary sector is off amid fears consumers will cut back nonessential purchases if there is a general rise in prices throughout the economy the financial sector has fared even worse off this year analysts say most of the financial sectors losses are directly related to bad mortgage bets at wall street firms it doesnt help that faster inflation would likely bring higher interest rates from the federal reserve raising the cost of deal making on the other hand the s&amp ps biggest winners all up more than are the energy basic materials and information technology sectors all stand to benefit from red hot economies overseas and if necessary inflation in the u s a surge in inflation isnt happening now still there are signs much higher consumer prices could be on their way soon perhaps early next year oil prices have soared to records above &# a barrel the dollar has continued to weaken and the fed has effectively increased the supply of money sloshing through the economy by cutting interest rates twice in six weeks gold is trading at more than &# a troy ounce the highest level since january "we dont think inflation is imminent but there is certainly some risk in the financial system caused by the strength of raw materials prices " said strategist jack caffrey of j p morgan chase combined with concerns about the subprime lending crisis and the availability of credit such worries are taking a toll on the stock market despite government reports showing surprisingly strong economic growth in the third quarter and strong payroll growth in october the dow jones industrial average finished the week down points or to after a point decline thursday the dow is still up this year although it is more than points from its record close less than a month ago oct "we have a mixed economic picture right now " says economist leo kamp of asset management firm tiaa cref "things have held up pretty well but the fed has been clear that its worried about inflation especially in light of the energy rally which probably will filter into inflation at some point " when it announced a quarter point cut in its target short term interest rate at the end of last month the fed indicated that it would be watching for signs of inflation before policy makers meet again in december it cut rates by a half point in september the consumer price index for september showed an annual inflation rate of excluding volatile food and energy prices known as the core inflation rate that is just within reach of the feds comfort zone for the economy of about but the so called headline number which includes everything was up annually although the fed usually tracks core inflation to set its rate policy many experts believe the impact of food and energy prices on other goods is so pervasive that it will eventually translate into core inflation the broad based dow jones aig commodity index has risen outpacing the dow industrials and the standard &amp poors stock index after slipping last week the s&amp p is up this year the dollar has hit a series of lows against the euro and is off this year this raises the cost of imports for u s consumers although it helps earnings of big u s companies whose overseas profits are translated into dollars friday the euro fetched &# most wall street pros believe economic growth has slowed in the fourth quarter and are pinning their hopes on fast growing overseas economies like chinas to bolster the profits of large u s companies with significant foreign operations that has helped sectors such as technology and energy which get more than half their sales from outside the u s says mr caffrey of j p morgan "you have this weird combination of gunk and junk leading the way right now " he said referring to oil and tech tech stocks continued to be a bright spot last week as the nasdaq composite index finished with a slight gain up for the week and on the year financial stocks took a big hit as more banks reported big losses on assets linked to risky subprime mortgages and merrill lynch &amp co chief executive stan oneal was forced out the financial sector of the s&amp p slid for the week energy stocks also were lower hurt by disappointing earnings from exxon mobil which had a difficult time matching its heady year ago results amid the long running oil boom the s&amp p s energy components were off for the week but they have posted a solid gain on the year if inflation does return in full force in the months ahead mr caffrey says basic materials stocks and energy companies could continue to do well the tech rally could come to an end though because many investors buy such stocks looking for big profits far into the future because inflation effectively eats into the value of dollars that an investor expects to receive in the future it would be bad for speculative investments like tech stocks if the fed and other central banks raise interest rates to fight inflation it would hurt the ability of fledgling tech companies to raise financing for new projects don rissmiller chief economist at strategas research partners says inflation is a risk to the market but he noted that the fed has a while to consider its next rate move policy makers dont meet again until mid december if more data surface like fridays strong jobs report many wall street pros believe the fed could hold its rate target steady to avoid adding too much cheap money to fuel the economy on the heels of the latest two rate cuts "the fed gives money to the private sector " with rate cuts mr rissmiller said "if were productive with it well get goods if were unproductive well get inflation "
