uaw seeks to build support for ford deal detroit united auto workers president ron gettelfinger and his lieutenants will meet this afternoon with local union leaders in hopes of building support for a tentative contract reached with ford motor co over the weekend the agreement which is regarded as a landmark concessionary deal that will help the company better compete against asia based rivals must now be ratified by a majority of the uaw represented employees at ford fords agreement gives the auto maker greater concessions in terms of wages and retiree health care funding than the union granted to general motors corp and chrysler llc said people familiar with the matter ford is seen as the weakest of detroits big three and reported a loss of &# billion last year over the past few weeks the uaw has reached agreements with detroits auto makers that allow them to unload massive retirement obligations pay lower wages to new workers and have more flexibility to cut jobs and production but the new labor agreement with chrysler was nearly rejected last month after majorities at several large plants voted against it it is unclear how much rank and file opposition the ford deal will face a ford spokeswoman declined to comment a uaw spokesman didnt return calls one factor that could provide momentum in favor of ratification ford promised to keep open two assembly plants it had intended to close people familiar with the matter said ford also has agreed to avoid closing any other assembly plants in the u s for the life of the four year contract but the plants could be closed thereafter these people said the two plants which ford hasnt identified are part of a handful of factories ford had planned to shutter by as part of its restructuring plan plants generally thought to be in jeopardy were a stamping and assembly plant in wayne mich and an assembly plant in louisville ky where mr gettelfinger once worked a person familiar with the matter said fords workers have already agreed to plant by plant cost cutting measures known as competitive operating agreements and local union officials have expressed sympathy for fords dire financial plight and the desire to get a deal done "bottom line is we want our jobs we want tomorrow " said jim stoufer president of uaw local which represents workers building fords f series pickup trucks and escape sport utility vehicles in kansas city mo "weve done what we were asked we gave and we gave " the pledge to keep plants open is likely to draw the scrutiny of wall street which is paying close attention to fords progress in its turnaround plan including a goal to return to profitability by gm and chrysler cut production recently in reaction to the downturn in auto sales this year "i think investors will be very skeptical about keeping plants open because fords got a poor track record of driving revenue growth " said john casesa a former merrill lynch &amp co auto analyst who now runs his own advisory firm "if anything in the past several years the companys capacity reductions havent been enough so ford will have a lot to prove to the market " in exchange for keeping the two plants open ford received a major concession on wages that in some ways goes beyond the deals reached at gm and chrysler people involved in the talks said ford now will be able to pay all new hires including assembly line workers a lower second tier starting wage about &# to &# an hour or half of current wages these people said that differs from arrangements made at gm and chrysler which assigned lower wages primarily to just those jobs they defined as noncore another concession involves what is known as the jobs bank a system under which laid off uaw workers still get paid ford will have greater ability to take laid off workers out of the jobs bank if they turn down an open job elsewhere these people said with the proposed contracts flexibility ford will seek to buy out an additional to people in the next three years said the people familiar with the matter that is on top of a previous effort to reduce hourly workers by to through buyouts and attrition the tentative pact allows ford to unload billions in retiree health care obligations from its books to a union run trust fund known as a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba fords current retiree health care obligation stands at about &# billion like gm and chrysler ford would continue to pay its retiree health care liabilities over the next two years and then contribute to the union run trust which would become operational in according to a person involved with the negotiations by that time fords retiree health care obligation will be about &# billion this person said one difference in the agreement struck with ford is that the auto maker will contribute less cash to the union run health care trust about of the overall contribution as opposed to at gm and at chrysler this person said the remainder of the contribution will be made up of equity and convertible debt another person said the structure of the veba will make the uaw a major investor in ford with about a to stake initially making the union one of its largest shareholders ford chief executive alan mulally was at the negotiating table with the uaws mr gettelfinger ensuring completion of the deal for the last nine hours of talks which ended with an agreement at a m saturday a person involved in the talks said that capped more than hours of marathon negotiations the tentative deal was presented to fords board over the weekend to unanimous approval this person said
