silicon valley should withstand next bust the good times are back in silicon valley and with them have come many of the same excesses that marked the s dot com boom yet when this start up boom sours as all cycles eventually do it is unlikely to repeat the same devastating pattern of the last technology bust the first boom began in when pioneering web browser company netscape communications went public a gold rush ensued investors poured billions into internet start ups funding businesses in fields ranging from online commerce to optical networking between and more than technology companies staged initial public offerings of stock then the music stopped faddish internet companies such as online grocer webvan group and pet supplies retailer pets com which were long on marketing and short on profits flopped many investors lost their shirts as the tech heavy nasdaq composite index plunged silicon valley lost jobs or one in five between and there were ripple effects the regions average office rents dropped by more than half and office buildings stood empty for years economic damage was severe partly because companies that fueled the boom sucked up cash and got so big back then web businesses had to invest millions in computer servers and services like web connectivity just to get up and running they hired hundreds of employees and rented huge offices they needed millions of dollars from venture capitalists who back start ups venture investors hope to profit when their companies go public or get acquired by bigger firms in at the dot com booms peak venture investors poured nearly &# billion into start ups this time around the scale of growth is more modest investments in start ups particularly alternative energy firms and those that specialize in businesses like social networking and online video are up dramatically in the past two years so are the prices that venture investors are paying for stakes in these companies but overall these investors are on track to put less than &# billion in companies this year according to ventureone corp ventureone is owned by dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal todays web start ups typically need less money to operate given the proliferation of cheap technology including "open source" software and an ability to tap low cost offshore labor among other factors many companies and their investors are now eschewing conspicuous spending so if a bust comes and many of these firms fold fewer people will lose jobs and fewer related sectors of the local economy such as law firms and commercial landlords will feel the pinch of course a blowup involving some of silicon valleys highly valued public tech names such as google and apple could have far more dire consequences another big difference is the state of the public stock markets in the late s investment bankers gladly took profitless internet companies public and eager mutual fund managers and day traders snapped up shares but few of todays hot internet names like social networking site facebook recently accorded a &# billion value by investor microsoft have publicly traded shares and instead remain privately held the upshot mom and pop investors likely wont lose money if the new internet firms collapse instead sophisticated venture capitalists and hedge funds will be left holding the bag still the dearth of ipos today could contain the seeds of the next bust because relatively few venture backed companies are going public many start ups are relying on mergers and acquisitions for cash a handful of big corporate acquirers notably google yahoo and microsoft are doing most of the buying of internet names big acquisitions by these companies such as googles &# billion purchase of online video site youtube last year work in a circular way fueling the creation of similar companies that hope for a comparable payday but not all new web companies can be bought by google yahoo and microsoft josh lerner a harvard business school professor who studies venture capital says the number of "me too" tech companies is even greater than it was in the late s "there are tons and tons of companies but just a half dozen buyers " says peter falvey co founder of tech investment bank revolution partners "if youre counting on google to buy you and google is building something internally youre out of luck " the biggest fear on the deals front that a wider economic slowdown perhaps from the credit crunch or deteriorating housing market will damp enthusiasm for tech acquisitions companies like google whose stock recently topped &# a share also could see reversals in fortune and cut back on deal making that would hurt start ups some of which might collapse because theyd have no hope of being acquired investors also would be hesitant to fund new start ups in the same fields another catalyst for a tech slump would be a slowdown in the online ad market many of todays internet start ups make money solely by selling online ads says david liu a tech banker at jefferies broadview in california the demise of such start ups wont be pretty for silicon valley but the shock waves sent out by any new bust likely wont travel as far as they did last time
