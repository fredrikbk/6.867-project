pakistan crackdown slows bushs freedom march fears of instability increasingly trump hopes for democracy washington president bushs vaunted "freedom agenda " using u s aid influence and example to advance political liberty around the globe suffered one of its worst setbacks this weekend when gen pervez musharraf declared a state of emergency in pakistan as recently as june mr bush sought to reinvigorate the initiative in an emotional speech in prague to a gathering of renowned dissidents and freedom fighters from around the world "expanding freedom is more than a moral imperative it is the only realistic way to protect our people in the long run " mr bush said then "governments accountable to their people do not attack each other young people who can disagree openly with their leaders are less likely to adopt violent ideologies " mr bush praised pakistan in those remarks along with egypt and saudi arabia for taking "some steps to expand liberty and transparency " but he added they "have a great distance still to travel " now mr musharrafs crackdown which appeared to catch administration officials by surprise has dramatically underscored how much mr bushs freedom march has slowed and in a few cases gone into retreat administration officials downplayed the setback for their democracy movement which the president announced in his second term inaugural address in "this is a long term commitment like bringing freedom to eastern europe" during the cold war said white house spokesman gordon johndroe "its going to take a while and cant be measured by daily events " still with little more than a year to go in his term the presidents once lofty hopes for expanding world freedom increasingly are being replaced by fears over security and stability this is true not only in pakistan but also in other trouble spots where the u s has been deeply involved such as afghanistan iraq and the palestinian territories the white house condemned mr musharrafs move but made it clear it is taking a wait and see attitude at least for now and it isnt planning retaliation speaking to reporters in israel secretary of state condoleezza rice urged "a prompt return to the constitutional course " but officials suggested that they wouldnt take immediate action to reduce the flow of u s aid to islamabad which has totaled more than &# billion since the sept terror attacks mr bush is aware of the importance of avoiding action that destabilizes a country that possesses both a nuclear weapons arsenal and a virulent islamist extremist movement the administrations mild reaction also is being influenced by worries about the future of neighboring afghanistan where political and security gains are under increasing threat from the taliban extremists operating from pakistans northwestern tribal regions "the reality is that we cant operate in afghanistan without pakistans military cooperation " said george perkovich an expert on the region at the washington based carnegie endowment for international peace the white house fears that afghanistans future could be less secure than iraqs when mr bush leaves office in part because of the situation in pakistan unlike iraq afghanistan also lacks the natural resources that might encourage developed countries to commit to a long term involvement the emergency declaration in pakistan could make cooperation with the u s more difficult by distracting the army from its antiterrorism work said teresita schaffer a south asia expert and former ambassador to sri lanka she termed mr musharrafs move "embarrassing" for the administration "soon after we start sounding as if the democracy message affects pakistan this happens " she said u s rhetoric focused more and more on democracy in pakistan over the past year as mr musharraf became less popular according to rick barton an international development expert at the center for strategic and international studies but most u s aid to pakistan over the last five years has gone to the military with only token support for other purposes that has fueled an impression among many pakistanis that the u s has long been conflicted about how hard to push back against the military that remains the center of political power there in other regions too the limits of americas ability to sell democracy are evident in russia for instance president vladimir putin is prohibited from seeking another term in office but now he is considering taking over the prime ministers post next year a position from which he would likely continue to exert control in cuba too the administration has watched unhappily as a transfer of power has occurred between ailing dictator fidel castro and his brother raul with little indication that political liberalization is likely but administration aides said it is too early to write off mr bushs freedom initiative mr musharrafs move was "disappointing and discouraging but lets see where this goes before making judgments as to the freedom agenda " said mr johndroe he pointed to other places where freedom is gaining ground such as congo where democratic elections recently were held the administration also is making a strong push for action to weaken the military dictatorship of myanmar yochi j dreazen contributed to this article
