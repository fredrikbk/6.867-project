investing in funds a monthly analysis fundamentals of investing etfs + munis as municipal bond exchange traded funds proliferate heres what you need to know about them think of the world of exchange traded funds as a vast ice cream store with hundreds of flavors on the board already plain vanilla just got added in a reversal of the usual order of things one of the blandest and most conservative of investments now has an etf to call its own the municipal bond and muni bond etfs are coming fast and furious in september barclays global investors a unit of barclays plc introduced the first muni bond etf ishares s&amp p national municipal bond fund on the same day state street corp s state street global advisors announced its plan to roll out the second one spdr lehman municipal bond etf which started trading on the american stock exchange three days later barclays has started two more since one focused on california bonds and the other on new york issues and state street launched another three last month california and new york specialty etfs as well as spdr lehman short term municipal bond powershares capital management llc a unit of invesco plc listed three on the amex last month powershares insured california municipal bond portfolio powershares insured new york municipal bond portfolio and powershares insured national municipal bond portfolio meantime van eck global a new york based investment firm filed an application for six such products in late july including one that will hold high yield or junk municipal bonds in the etf world the first mover usually has an advantage in gathering assets once barclays etf opened for business rivals couldnt "wait for it to establish itself" too firmly says matt fabian a senior analyst with municipal market advisors an independent research firm in concord mass as plain vanilla as muni bonds may be muni bond etfs are anything but straightforward they are one of the more complicated etfs to arrive so far and thats one reason they have been late arriving on the scene here then is everything you need to know about muni bond etfs in the simplest terms q what is a muni bond etf and how is it different from a muni bond mutual fund a municipal bonds are debt issued by state or local governments to finance public projects for now lets leave out the nuances in fund structures and focus on what matters most to individual investors both muni bond mutual funds and etfs allow investors to pool their money and hire professionals to choose their bonds investors are entitled to a monthly distribution of the interest income carried by the bonds in the fund this income is exempt from federal income tax and in many cases its exempt from state and local taxes as well capital gains distributions arent tax exempt but such distributions tend to be relatively small at most muni bond funds to start with etfs in general have fewer capital gains distributions than mutual funds more on etfs structure later all bond funds pose some risk yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices so if yields rise a bond drops in value that isnt a problem if you hold an issue until it matures provided the issuer hasnt had severe financial problems youll get your principal back but the net asset value of a bond fund is based on daily values so shareholders selling as interest rates are surging will be hit by falling bond prices now for the differences the etfs announced so far track muni bond indexes that is they seek to replicate the price and yield performance of a designated benchmark some mutual funds also track indexes but most are run by managers who pick and choose securities individually investors can buy and sell etf shares throughout the day on a stock exchange paying the going price mutual funds are priced once daily q why were bond etfs slower in general than stock etfs to appear and why did it take five years from the start of the first bond etf for a muni bond etf to be created a by and large etfs track market indexes and this has proved nettlesome on the bond side thats because bonds are traded through securities firms not on exchanges like common stocks so it can be tough to physically locate some of the bonds that constitute an index the trading issue happens to be particularly acute with municipal bonds because many of their buyers are buy and hold types "municipal bonds are not ideally suited for the etf structure " says mark mccray a managing director for pacific investment management company llcs municipal bond portfolios q which indexes do muni bond etfs follow a state streets first muni bond etf is benchmarked against the lehman brothers municipal managed money index the index started in is made up of more than muni bonds with ratings of aa aa or higher state streets other etfs also will track lehman muni bond indexes as will van ecks barclays is using a new index from standard &amp poors the s&amp p national municipal bond index of issues with a rating of triple b minus or better from at least one of the three major rating agencies meantime powershares is using an index customized for it by merrill lynch &amp co q will muni bond etfs hold all of the securities in these indexes thousands and thousands of bonds a "its virtually impossible " says jim ross senior managing director of state street global advisors instead these etfs are using a representative sampling to track their indexes state streets etf has about out of the more than constituents in its index the barclays etf holds about of the index constituents the firms say small numbers arent a problem given their expertise in sampling at state street portfolio managers look at muni bonds durations yields credit quality and place of issuance to decide on the ones with characteristics representative of the index managers seek the most heavily traded among them "the only way to test liquidity is to call traders and get multiple bids " says mr ross "we have spent a significant amount of time back testing the sample " barclays tweaked its etf model and devised a "liquidity scoring" system to identify the most frequently traded issues according to matt tucker barclays head of fixed income investment solutions some analysts say that the firms approach may give the etfs a different flavor than the muni bond indexes they track because an indexs return partly is affected by the thin trading of some components "the illiquid bonds are part of the index and they behave in many environments differently than the other bonds " says milton ezrati senior economic and market strategist with lord abbett &amp co llc a jersey city n j money manager "if they only buy the liquid bonds their samples will stray in terms of performance from the index that people think they are buying " q does this mean that the etfs could have a big tracking error a when a funds return doesnt match that of the index tracking error emerges mr ross at state street says "tracking errors can happen in a positive way or a negative way " state street expects to track the index within a range of to percentage point in contrast u s stock etfs tracking broad market indexes have very little tracking error barclays prospectus for its muni bond etf cautions that the use of representative sampling can result in greater tracking error it says that "imperfect correlation" between the funds securities and those in the underlying index "rounding of prices" and fees and expenses may cause the error mr fabian of municipal market advisors calls the sampling techniques "an evolution " still the firms say they are confident "you can actually track a very large index with a few issues " says barclays mr tucker "because most fixed income securities have the common factors of risk q so what does all this mean in terms of the yield that an investor will receive a thanks to their low expenses muni bond etfs offer attractive yields the first two etfs from barclays and state street are yielding and after expenses that compares with a yield of on the average long term national muni bond fund according to morningstar inc vanguard long term tax exempt fund investor shares with expenses of is yielding as with other debt investments in general the longer the duration or the remaining term to maturity the underlying bonds the higher the yield return investors get compensated for taking on more risks state streets portfolio duration is years longer than barclays years q there has been talk about how these etfs could bring transparency to the muni bond world what is that about a because municipal bonds change hands through securities firms prices havent been as readily available to small investors as prices of common stocks traded on exchanges are this started to change in when the municipal securities rulemaking board began publishing real time trading prices because etfs are traded on exchanges themselves and their indexes are published more pricing information is expected to become available q all this sounds expensive arent etfs supposed to be cheap a in tracking indexes muni bond etfs can be expected to carry lower expense ratios than actively managed bond funds they dont have to support the cost of a manager and a team of analysts barclays started its first muni bond etf with an annual expense ratio of of assets &# a year on a &# investment state street is charging that is notably higher than the charged by the cheapest of the stock etfs but it is cheaper than the average of charged by municipal bond mutual funds according to morningstar q how are etfs and mutual funds different structurally a first recall that a mutual fund creates new fund shares as cash arrives the fund manager can hold the new cash or immediately buy stocks or bonds with it etfs are created when a trading firm assembles baskets of securities matching the index specified by the etf provider the trading firm exchanges its baskets of securities for etf shares which can be resold to small investors on an exchange this is generally done in lots of about etf shares similarly when a trading firm opts to take etf shares off the market it hands over etf shares and gets the underlying securities in return the process generally holds down transaction costs and tax bills for etf shareholders ms cui is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in new york she
