schumers epiphany michael mukaseys prospects for confirmation as attorney general seem to be resuscitated thanks to the endorsements of two democrats on the senate judiciary committee we suppose this counts as progress of a sort judge mukasey set off a cascade of democratic opposition because he declined to make a pre emptive legal ruling on "waterboarding" before he had the security clearances to review the classified evidence our sources confirm press reports that the cia has only used this interrogation method against three terrorist detainees and not since congress could have outlawed the practice at any time but democrats conspicuously did not take it up before it became a pretext for capsizing the mukasey nomination the inquisition attracted the usual antiwar elements but also democratic leaders like hillary clinton barack obama and judiciary chairman pat leahy and while the political campaign intensified chuck schumer who suggested mr mukaseys name for the ag post in the first place played hamlet refusing for days to say whether the judge still had his support on friday the new york senator ended his indecision noting that while mr mukasey was "not my ideal choice " he was "the best we can hope for" from president bush californias dianne feinstein also came out in favor she reportedly made up her mind earlier in the week but waited to announce her intentions to give some cover to mr schumer thats another indication of the leftward pressure on democrats the two senators deserve credit for giving mr mukasey the support he needs when the committee votes as early as tomorrow still its incredible that everyone is breathing a sigh of relief because mr schumer decided to support his own candidate especially one who was universally saluted as an independent consensus choice the political threshold that senate democrats established in this fracas is a measure of how distorted their antiterror priorities have become
