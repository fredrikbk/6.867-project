the morning brief tying pakistans fate to that of musharraf online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here the bush administration looks increasingly unlikely to cut its ties and financial backing for pakistan despite president pervez musharrafs suspension of constitutional governance in the name of fighting terrorism and in response to what he assailed as judicial activism the crisis threatens pakistans role as an ally against islamist militancy amid a literal assault on the rule of law that has set lawyers against security forces in the streets with a majority of justices on pakistans highest court now detained or under house arrest some lawyers gathered to protest at the high court in lahore but they were met by baton wielding police and at least were arrested the associated press reports that brings the total number of people arrested since the state of emergency began saturday to the ap says that includes opposition party leaders and activists rounded up yesterday at the lahore offices of the countrys human rights commission where police also confiscated the equipment of journalists covering the raid as the washington post reports similar clashes have been reported in other cities as well in protest the u s embassy in islamabad today said an annual bilateral defense cooperation meeting planned for this week had been postponed and secretary of state condoleezza rice yesterday said the administration was reviewing u s aid to pakistan which has received about &# billion from washington since mr musharraf chose to side with the u s in its fight against the taliban and al qaeda following but as the new york times reports administration officials argue it would "be counterproductive to let pakistans political turmoil interfere with their best hope of ousting al qaedas central leadership and the taliban from the countrys mountainous tribal areas " and during her talk with reporters yesterday ms rice repeatedly emphasized that president bushs first concern was "to protect america and protect american citizens by continuing to fight against terrorists " the proclamation of emergency signed by chief of the army staff general pervez musharraf on saturday and identifying him with that title rather than his civilian post as president did indeed cite a "visible ascendancy in the activities of extremists and incidents of terrorist attacks including suicide bombings ied explosions rocket firing and bomb explosions and the banding together of some militant groups " the periodic refocus of islamist militants attacks on gen musharraf and government troops and targets apparently from some of the same groups fighting the u s and afghan government across the northwestern border has also played havoc with pakistans rule of law but the proclamation cited another threat as well the efforts by "some members of the judiciary" to work "at cross purposes with the executive and legislature in the fight against terrorism " and "increasing interference by some members of the judiciary in government policy " the most conspicuous clash between the president and judiciary has been over challenges to his retention of both civilian and military authority and gen musharraf in the past has argued the country needs him in charge to keep it safe where the proclamation clashes with past positions is its sharp break with his pledge to reduce the militarys role in civilian life the wall street journal notes he boosted the militarys authority "at a time when the institution is facing unprecedented scrutiny both for its inability to contain islamist violence and for its presence in almost every crevice of pakistans civil administration " the journal says the widespread opposition to the presidents concentration of power has been joined by the lawyers and many other pakistanis who might have otherwise sympathized with the fight against islamist violence though it has surely been fueled by his alliance with washington at a time when the war in iraq has substantially increased anti u s sentiment that doesnt make it easier for the general to help go after al qaeda as it is despite the u s financial help pakistans "paramilitary force leading the pursuit of al qaeda militants remains underfunded poorly trained and overwhelmingly outgunned " u s military and intelligence officials tell the los angeles times much of the money hasnt gone to counterterrorism the paper reports and the imposition of emergency powers is "a risky choice that even gen musharrafs close advisers say could ultimately prove ruinous " the post adds while such a forcefull seizure of power has worked for him before the intense domestic opposition could build and undermine support in his most important political base the army "its a very serious self inflicted wound " mushahid hussain a top leader of the ruling party and one of gen musharrafs closest advisers tells the post "and i feel it will be difficult to really recover from this wound " the changes at citi chuck is out bob is in sort of but citigroup is still judged to be somewhat of a mess after failing to unite the sprawling empire that remains the largest u s bank and amid the billions of losses and potential losses tied to the subprime mortgage meltdown charles prince yesterday went ahead and resigned as citis chairman and chief executive as the wall street journal reports he was replaced by sir win bischoff head of citis european operations as interim ceo and as chairman he was succeeded by robert rubin the highly praised treasury secretary during much of the clinton administration and a senior adviser at citi since then whose reputation could be tarnished by citis situation today the new york times says the fact "that mr rubin was named chairman and not interim chairman suggested a degree of urgency to attract a strong candidate turning over both titles is probably necessary " and a person briefed on the situation tells the times mr rubin "wants to find somebody as chairman and c e o so he can step down " mr rubin himself declined to say how long hed stay in the job and suggested to the times that a new ceo could change the banks strategy a trillion dollar market cap for petrochina petrochinas top
