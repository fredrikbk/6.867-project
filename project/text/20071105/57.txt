lillys new drug tests well with a hitch bleeding risk concerns could delay delivery of prasugrel to market eli lilly &amp co s experimental new anticlotting drug outperformed a best selling rival in a study presented yesterday but the results also cast doubts over lillys ability to quickly get the drug approved at a time when the company is eager to bring new products to market the mixed results which caused one analyst to lower sales forecasts for the new drug reflect the drug industrys struggle to develop medicines that prevent heart attack inducing clots without increasing the risk of life threatening bleeding the new drug known as prasugrel is intended to treat patients on the verge of a heart attack and it marks the indianapolis companys bid to break into the blockbuster heart drug arena the drug is intended to rival plavix which is co marketed by bristol myers squibb co and sanofi aventis sa and posted sales last year of about &# billion results from a patient head to head comparison between the two drugs presented yesterday at the annual scientific meeting of the american heart association in orlando fla showed prasugrel achieved an impressive reduction in heart attacks and other serious events but the benefit came at a price more episodes of major bleeding several leading cardiologists said they believe the results are strong enough for lilly to gain food and drug administration approval to market the drug in part because the overall benefit in the study favored prasugrel over plavix the current standard of care for lilly the question is whether it can gain that approval quickly and whether the bleeding issues will limit the number of potential users lilly needs the drug to offset patent expirations that would cut the companys revenue by more than half by some analysts think a rapid course through the fda perhaps leading to approval sometime next year is important to enable prasugrel to establish itself before plavix goes off patent in opening the door to cheaper generics that might tempt payers concern about the drug last month led a morgan stanley analyst to lower forecast sales for prasugrel yesterday following the presentation analysts from sanford c bernstein &amp co followed suit lilly said that it is working on a plan for a lower dose to make the drug safer for high risk patients but that the company believes the benefits outweigh the bleeding risk "we think the net benefit to the patient balances out very well " said j anthony ware vice president and head of lillys cardiovascular program he also said the company hopes to file its application with the fda by the end of the year but that there are "a lot of moving parts" to put together to reassure the agency on the bleeding issue bristol myers said that the excess bleeding "raises a lot of questions" and that plavix has a "wealth of safety and efficacy data" that is well understood by physicians overall the effectiveness study is a win for lilly the study was sponsored by lilly and development partner daiichi sankyo co of japan which provided research grants to the researchers who led the study some of the researchers involved in the study also have ties to bristol and sanofi steven nissen chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the cleveland clinic said the reduction in heart attacks is an important finding despite the bleeding risk "if im careful not to give this drug to people who are going to be hurt by it then those added benefits are valuable " he said patients at risk including those with a prior history of stroke those years and older and those weighing about pounds or less "are easily identifiable " said stephen d wiviott a cardiologist at brigham and womens hospital in boston and lead author of the study he added " of the patients in the trial had a very positive benefit" with prasugrel some doctors said determining which patients might suffer bleeding problems isnt as easy to use the drug in practice said steven steinhubl a cardiologist at the university of kentucky "we have to feel comfortable that were going to identify those patients who are at highest risk of bleeding " in addition the design of the study didnt reflect the way patients on the verge of a heart attack are treated in u s emergency rooms said eric topol cardiologist at scripps clinic in la jolla calif all of the patients in the study had an angiogram to check whether they were candidates for an angioplasty and stent procedure before they were given either drug in practice patients are usually given plavix before they undergo an angiogram among other things doctors said that meant the trial put the slower acting plavix at a disadvantage dr wiviott and elliott m antman a cardiologist at brigham and principal investigator for the study said several analyses showed that prasugrel outperformed plavix regardless of the timing of when treatment began some analysts speculate that the excess bleeding raises enough concern that the fda could require additional research before granting market approval "its nonapprovable without another clinical trial " said mike krensavage an analyst at raymond james financial inc worried that the finding of a significant increase in fatal bleeding of prasugrel patients compared with of those on plavix will require more studies last month doubts about prasugrels prospects spread after lilly suspended two smaller studies designed to look at more technical issues yesterday the company explained that the analysis of the main studys data indicated the elevated bleeding risk in elderly patients and those with low body weight or a history of stroke it suspended enrollment in the studies in order to work out a strategy to adjust dosing to avoid problems for such people both plavix known generically as clopidogrel and prasugrel work by attaching to receptors on blood fragments called platelets and inhibiting their ability to clump together to form clots plavix is currently used in combination with aspirin in treating patients with what cardiologists call acute coronary syndromes uncontrolled chest pain that is a precursor to a heart attack and for many heart attacks as well the two drug regimen is also given to patients who have stents aggressive use of plavix in these patients has made it the worlds second biggest seller after pfizer inc s cholesterol drug lipitor but plavix is slow to work and its effect varies widely earlier studies have indicated that prasugrel is more potent than plavix and can block platelets within minutes in the head to head study of patients on prasugrel suffered either a heart attack stroke or death from a cardiovascular cause compared with of those given plavix that is a reduction in risk favoring prasugrel heart attacks were reduced by and the rate of clots forming in stents was cut by favoring prasugrel on the other hand major bleeding events occurred in of patients on prasugrel compared with on plavix a increased risk
