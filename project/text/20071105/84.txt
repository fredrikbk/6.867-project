the founders wanted a living constitution as a proud nonlawyer i have followed the debate between those such as robert bork "the war for the constitution " gary l mcdowell editorial page oct who believe in original intent and others who believe in a "living" constitution without taking sides however a trip with my college age daughter to washington on a recent weekend was quite instructive in this debate in the morning i saw the original constitution at the national archives and read over the ninth amendment "the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people " can this be any clearer a refutation of what mr mcdowell disparages as "vague notions of unenumerated rights " the founders clearly say that just because a right isnt explicitly in the constitution such as privacy it may still be one of the rights "retained by the people " then in the evening i visited the jefferson memorial he was one of those founders whose intent were supposed to follow right heres what he had to say on the issue words now engraved in stone at his memorial not far from the capitol "i am certainly not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors " so im siding with tom and the other founders we have a living constitution that needs to keep changing with the times don gooding southwest harbor maine mr mcdowells article is overblown hyperbole presidents have often appointed partisans to the supreme court starting with john marshall who was appointed by president john adams as he was preparing to leave office in marshall ended up surprising thomas jefferson who succeeded adams in the white house with a preference for a strong national government president franklin delano roosevelt appointed partisans who would not declare his new deal programs unconstitutional however it is the right of the senate to draw a line in the sand if it chooses that is to say the presidents nomination of a person for a position on the supreme court has always been political further despite mr mcdowells disparagement of "vague notions of unenumerated rights " how does he interpret the ninth amendment to the constitution and how does he propose the "original intent of the constitutions framers" is to be discerned and why doesnt he admit that according to his interpretation of the constitution the social security act of is unconstitutional the payroll tax funding social security was approved by the supreme court under the taxing power and the distribution of benefits which was delayed four years was not subject to challenge under then current rules of standing to the original intent crowd i give you lochner v new york in which the supreme court found that "the right to free contract" was implicit in the th amendments due process clause the world constantly changes the constitution of the united states must do the same peter l wanger farmington hills mich see related letters "letters to the editor a living constitution and original intent" wsj november
