in citi shake up broader troubles perform or die culture leaves thin talent pool for top wall street jobs credit turmoil has claimed two scalps on wall street in a week and exposed the shortage of talent for the biggest jobs in finance both citigroup inc and merrill lynch &amp co saw troubled chief executives hastily depart as write downs fueled by losses on mortgage related securities spiraled near &# billion neither had a ready replacement forcing them to get by with interim arrangements as the search for successors is conducted the dearth of ceo material owes much to the wall street culture in which executives are pushed to maximize profits and quickly get axed if they fail to deliver that sullies the resumes of many would be chiefs whats more most wall street firms are now global publicly held companies not the private partnerships of yore meaning a ceo must be skilled both in presenting the public face of a company and understanding the nitty gritty of finance "its a weird state of affairs that these phenomenal global companies cant self reproduce executives " says glenn schorr a financial services analyst at ubs ag "it is a function of the culture and the leadership or lack of leadership" at each firm he says boards at citigroup and merrill are likely to look outside their firms for successors the pool of candidates includes robert willumstad the former chief operating officer of citigroup and now nonexecutive chairman of american international group inc laurence fink the ceo of blackrock an asset manager owned by merrill lynch &amp co and nyse euronext ceo john thain who previously served as president of goldman sachs group inc mr fink has been approached by merrill about becoming ceo there the merrill board is moving quickly says a person familiar with the matter and the leading choice appears to be mr fink he has run a highly successful fund management company specializing in bonds but doesnt have lengthy experience running a large banking or retail brokerage operation the heart of merrills business one scenario is for mr fink to become ceo and gregory fleming merrills co president to become his no mr willumstad is considered a strong candidate for the citigroup job while mr thains name comes up for both posts sir win bischoff the chairman of citi europe will be citigroups interim chief executive but he isnt considered a candidate for the permanent post "one of the biggest failings of the citigroup board and of chuck was there was no succession plan which is astonishing for a company this size and this important " said a person familiar with the boards deliberations the ideal candidate says a person close to citi would be someone who has a track record as a top financial ceo such as lehman brothers holdings inc ceo richard fuld one of wall streets longest serving chiefs or james dimon of j p morgan chase &amp co but those executives would be difficult to pry away unless it was in the context of a merger with citi and merrill struggling thats an unlikely scenario say people close to the boards of both firms amassing billions of dollars in losses wall street firms have seen their stock prices hit hard with the dow jones u s financials index down this year compared with a rise in the dow jones industrial average mergers and expansion have made the job of leading a wall street giant tougher it may no longer be enough for the leader of merrill lynch to be a longtime brokerage executive like david komansky who headed the firm from to or for the head of citigroup to be a top investment or commercial banker roy smith a professor of finance at new york university and former partner at goldman sachs group inc said wall street chiefs obsessed by their stock price are quick to let go anyone whose unit has a bad quarter that may show their boards that they are aggressively managing their subordinates but it means talented executives who make mistakes can be quickly shown the door during mr princes tenure at citigroup more than a dozen top bankers have departed been forced out or been given different responsibilities they include marjorie magner who ran global consumer banking and michael dunn a year citi veteran who served as finance and operating chief for citigroups global consumer unit similarly merrills mr oneal acquired a reputation for purging top executives prompting some of those executives to agitate behind the scenes for his departure wall street has become a more "volatile place to grow managers " mr smith says joseph a grundfest a former commissioner at the securities and exchange commission and now professor at stanford university says the best internal candidates often arent "broadly known outside the company " but that doesnt mean they should be discarded such a candidate is often "greeted with a yawn and perhaps even disappointment from outside the company but goes on to great success " he says a number of current and former citigroup managers favor mr willumstad citigroups onetime president to be its next ceo he is close to sanford weill mr princes predecessor who helped create the financial giant now called citigroup through a series of acquisitions messrs weill and willumstad were recently spotted having lunch at the four seasons one of manhattans premier power lunch spots the year old mr willumstad lost the horse race to succeed mr weill and left citigroup two years ago partly because he was frustrated with mr princes leadership mr willumstad was citigroups most seasoned retail banking executive and he still has relationships with the executives who have remained from the weill era the nyses mr thain is an oft mentioned candidate for top jobs on wall street the year old has run the big board for more than three years following a year career at goldman sachs citis global reach and the complexity of its business lines may intrigue mr thain who majored in engineering during college at the nyse mr thain has been lauded for transforming the year old market into a publicly traded company focused on profits his dealmaking pushed nyse further into electronic trading and made it a bigger player in fast growing futures and options trading mr thain is close to robert rubin the chairman of citigroups executive committee who was named chairman yesterday mr thain also has a reputation as a cost cutter that could do some good at citigroup which has had trouble keeping expenses in check however he lacks experience in retail banking an important part of citigroups empire mr thain declined to comment through an nyse spokesman he has said he is happy at the nyse but sees the job as a three to five year commitment another possible contender with more banking experience is richard m kovacevich the outspoken chairman of wells fargo &amp co mr kovacevich stepped down in june after years as chief executive of san francisco based wells fargo the countrys fourth largest bank by stock market value and its predecessor norwest corp he worked at what was then known as citicorp from to through a spokeswoman he declined to comment while its large mortgage operations have slowed in the current housing downturn wells has fared better than some of its competitors managing to post a profit gain in the third quarter a longshot for citigroup would be john reed who famously lost in a showdown with mr weill after the two men merged citicorp and travelers to create citigroup "it would be the ultimate irony not to mention good theater " says one person close to citigroup "john would be vindicated and sandy would be humiliated " but even veteran executives such as messrs reed and kovacevich may be short of technical expertise to figure out the mess involving mortgage backed securities whose value is uncertain thats what tripped up messrs prince and oneal "the number of candidates for these positions is somewhat limited " says dennis weatherstone former chairman of j p morgan while experience is "always valuable " he says its perhaps more important for the ceo to "anticipate change " ann carrns carrick mollenkamp and robin sidel contributed to this article see
