the attention of mainstream firms changes in investing are bringing the methods of so called socially responsible investors and those of more mainstream investors closer together its a trend driven by increasing sophistication among the former group and concerns about global warming and other social issues among the latter traditionally socially responsible investing boiled down to avoiding "sin" stocks purveyors of tobacco and alcohol and weapons makers but in the past few years that philosophy has changed significantly now while socially responsible funds still shun certain industries completely some are putting new emphasis on researching and spotting companies that have well thought out strategies for dealing with environmental social and governance or esg issues investment managers and analysts are developing formulas that take into account such issues as executive pay carbon emissions and workplace gender diversity along with traditional financial fundamentals the logic companies that think creatively about how these issues affect the bottom line are likely to have an edge over rivals that dont pax world management corp founded in as a way to invest without

investments based on a mix of financial and esg metrics including corporate governance community relations product integrity human rights and climate change pax chief executive joe keefe is a proponent of looking at esg issues "ignoring these factors is failing to take into account a companys entire profile " he says "we believe that over time the second layer of research can add significant value to a portfolio " the trend is starting to have an impact on pension plans mutual funds exchange traded funds and other products for individual investors as well this month northern trust corp expects to introduce a mutual fund based on the new global sustainability index developed by kld research &amp analytics a boston based company that creates indexes based on esg

by matthew j kiernan a former partner with accounting firm kpmg llp mr kiernan says traditional financial analysis captures only a quarter of a companys risk and competitive profile for now much of the interest in the esg approach to investing seems driven by environmental concerns a slew of so called green funds that invest in alternative energy clean technology or water resources have sprung up in the past few years powershares capital management llc for example started wilderhill clean energy etf in march and the fund has since ballooned to &# billion through last week the wilderhill etf

you look at the carbon emissions its an environmental issue but we argue its also a business issue because there is a price attached to it and it can be potentially very expensive " says mary jane mcquillen director of socially aware investment for clearbridge advisors the largest stock fund manager of legg mason inc clearbridge which manages &# billion in client assets has two analysts dedicated to esg research for its stock selection process oil giants power plants mining companies and steelmakers get blamed for contributing to global warming the business risk is that they will face taxes or penalties as legislators around the world increase their efforts to reduce pollution for instance as of january new york and nine other northeastern states will start a program to cap and trade carbon dioxide emissions last year california passed an act aiming to reduce the states greenhouse gas emissions and earlier this year the u s supreme court ruled that the environmental protection agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as pollutants investment funds holding stocks of electric utilities coal producers oil companies and other carbon intensive sectors are starting to measure their exposure to risks like these partly under pressure from investors in september the carbon disclosure project a nonprofit coalition of institutional investors with &# trillion of assets under management released its annual report based on a survey of more than companies around the world soon u s mutual funds themselves will get measured based on their carbon "footprints " or the collective carbon emissions of the companies they invest in by trucost plc a london research company that focuses on the environmental impact of business activities the firm released a report in july that surveyed u k investment funds and found of the funds were exposed to greater potential carbon liabilities than the u k s broad stock market index apart from tracking carbon footprints however skeptics remain as to whether a broad esg approach to investing actually works some say the new approach still shares too much ground with the traditional world of socially responsible investments the blanket ban on sin stocks and these funds historically have tended to trail the broader market as the additional screening process narrows down the selection pool and increases research costs some giant mutual fund firms like fidelity investments and vanguard group have yet to warmly embrace the trend a spokeswoman for vanguard which manages &# trillion in more than u s funds says that its main consideration in investment and product development decisions is "to generate wealth" for its clients at fidelity investment managers look at a variety of factors taking into account whether the factor "has or could have a real and measurable impact" on a companys earnings says a spokesman critics of the esg approach cite a scarcity of corporate information on nonfinancial issues such as human rights and a lack of methods for quantifying such matters skeptics think some such indicators are too subject to personal choices still a mercer investment consulting survey last year found that investment managers around the world expect esgs influence to rise those surveyed cited corporate governance globalization climate change sustainability and access to clean water as top issues "there are some encouraging steps" at mutual fund firms incorporating esg issues in investment decision making says craig metrick a mercer consultant on socially responsible investment mercer "but these are investment folks " mr metrick adds "and they need to be convinced that these issues are material and will impact financial performance " a common method employed by esg specialists is the "best of class" approach in which researchers identify the most material esg indicators and there are usually hundreds for a particular sector give different weights according to significance and rank companies based on their esg performance one criterion that is closely studied is supply chain management particularly where international outsourcing is involved while some wall street analysts will smile upon the use of outsourced suppliers as a cost saving strategy esg encourages researchers to look deeper checking to see whether such companies have inspections and testing procedures in place to make sure the suppliers are maintaining high standards says win j neuger chairman and chief executive of american international group inc s aig investments the recent troubles at toy maker mattel inc are a textbook example after its recall of millions of chinese made toys in august mattels stock slid markedly not having controls in place "has created significant risks" for a number of u s companies mr neuger says aig investments with &# billion under management both for clients and its parent company says it expects all of aigs portfolio managers and analysts to incorporate esg issues into their research of companies "it has become a more important and a more regular part of the process " he says ms cui is a reporter in new york for the wall street journal
