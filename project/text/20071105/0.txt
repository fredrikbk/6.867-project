futurama writer battles for writers futures hollywood braces for strike as studios scriptwriters differ on digital residuals los angeles when patric verrone went to work as a nonunion writer on the animated television series "futurama" in he helped lead a drive to win guild representation for writers from all four of twentieth century foxs prime time animated shows "the simpsons " "futurama " "family guy" and "king of the hill " nearly a decade later the year old mr verrone is the head of the guild and on the brink of leading his unions film and tv writers into their first strike since mr verrone is president of the writers guild of america west which along with the wga east was set to walk off the job this morning barring a last minute settlement or delay in a strike that could momentarily halt the hollywood entertainment machine as negotiations fell apart between the wga and the alliance of motion picture and television producers last week mr verrone and his lieutenants spent the weekend readying their members for a strike that could alter the script writing landscape the two sides met sunday in hopes of brokering a last minute agreement keeping the sides far apart when the writers contract expired wednesday were issues concerning dvd sales and how writers should be compensated for use of their work on the internet and other digital media the studios are reluctant to make a binding deal on digital distribution issues because they say its too soon to determine what format will end up being the most successful many studio officials and moderates within the wga feel that mr verrone and other guild leaders have been spoiling for a strike as a way for the union to flex its muscles a strike "is what we anticipated all along based upon what they wga have not been saying across the table " says nick counter president of the amptp "after a strike starts we think cooler heads will prevail at some point " a wga spokesman has long maintained that the writers want to reach an agreement not strike as the wga wests leader representing of the total members in the guilds two branches mr verrone is personally experiencing some of the guilds biggest issues he has held a series of writing jobs in hollywood many of them in the world of animation but doesnt have many credits in the past four years writers in that situation are often dependent on so called "residuals" paid when their works are rerun on television or sold on dvd which tide them over until the next substantial payday writers have long resented what they consider a disadvantageous deal they made in with the major studios when the home entertainment market was just emerging no one knew then that videocassettes and later dvds would be so lucrative now writers fear they will not get their fair share in the internet age mr verrone has agitated for such changes since he became active in the union in the late s though he joined the wga shortly after arriving in hollywood in the mid s he lost his union health insurance and came close to losing his pension when he went into animations while his efforts initially focused on winning representation for other animation writers mr verrone said in an interview that he began to focus on bringing in "all of the writers who arent covered" when he ran for the wgas top post in that has been an especially big issue recently as the proliferation of reality shows and other unscripted programming has enabled producers to employ cheaper non union writers three years ago while serving as secretary treasurer mr verrone was one of members of the wgas then negotiating committee who formed a coalition to oppose what they thought was a too passive approach by the wga at the bargaining table the dissidents were upset that the studios made an early deal with the directors guild of america even though that unions contract was months away from expiring and then convinced the wga to take the same deal "we were ignored put off and sometimes flat out overruled in favor of a strategy of patience and discipline " the group said in an email sent to members in a year later mr verrone was elected president by a landslide for a two year term he was re elected this september born and raised in new york city mr verrone attended harvard as an undergraduate and worked as an editor on the harvard lampoon there he met al jean and mike reiss who went on to work on "the simpsons" and develop the animated series "the critic " but mr verrone didnt head to tinseltown following college instead he enrolled in law school at boston college and afterwards settled in fort myers fla as a junior associate at a firm specializing in real estate and estate planning law friends including his future wife maiya williams encouraged him to drop his legal career in favor of screenwriting so in he asked for a three month sabbatical and moved to los angeles he never went back to the law firm his early writing assignments included writing one line jokes for the short lived "the late show with joan rivers" and the iconic "the tonight show starring johnny carson " out of work during the last writers strike in mr verrone took the california bar exam and later became involved with the los angeles county bar association mr verrone has managed to rally tv and screenwriters to support a work action and many credit him for uniting them in their frustration with as he calls it the "hated dvd formula " mr verrone was most prolific as a writer in the s when he had steady work on a succession of animated series his last major writing position was for "futurama" on news corp s twentieth century fox network which ended in in he worked as co executive producer of a series called "class of " on viacom inc s cartoon network he is now at work on a direct to dvd series based on "futurama " all those projects are likely netting mr verrone residual payments under past contract provisions what he is negotiating for in part are payments for current or future content that is distributed on the internet or other digital media for example how much writers should be remunerated for epidodes of "the office" that are being streamed free to users on nbcs web site each week and who are asked to create new online material mr verrone argues that residuals "allow for the r&amp d in this industry " he points to marc cherry the creator of "desperate housewives " who came up with that idea while living off residuals from his work on "golden girls " the s sitcom david chase who created the mob drama "the sopranos " needed the residuals from the s series "the rockford files" to help him through fallow times says mr verrone "the industry is thriving " he says "they need us and we want to share in it "
