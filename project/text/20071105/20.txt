for rubin pressures on in then treasury secretary robert rubin was pictured alongside alan greenspan and larry summers on the cover of time magazine with the headline the committee to save the world it was a high point for mr rubin the former goldman sachs group co chairman who as treasury secretary orchestrated the clinton administrations response to the mexican peso devaluation and the asian financial crisis of now mr rubin is under pressure to save citigroup inc citigroups board yesterday accepted the resignation of charles prince as chairman and chief executive officer and named mr rubin years old chairman mr rubin said he was reluctant to take the chairmans post but ultimately agreed to out of "concern for the company and concern for the people of the company and the importance of the company in the global economy " he added that it wasnt the way either he or sir win bischoff who was named interim ceo "would have chosen to spend our lives at this point " it is a pivotal moment for a new york financial colossus facing a slew of problems sluggish revenue and profit growth billions of dollars in losses on mortgage related securities a depleted capital base that could crimp its ability to expand and now a leadership crisis wall street is looking to mr rubin who has been at citigroup for the past eight years in the largely undefined role of chairman of the executive committee to put citi on the right course mr rubin said yesterday he planned on sticking with the basic strategy mr prince employed "the direction that chuck set is exactly where the institution needs to go " he said he doesnt expect there will be any spinoffs of major business units until now mr rubins job at citigroup largely entailed attending and offering advice at weekly meetings of business heads helping to orchestrate acquisitions and tapping his contacts to win business for the new york bank "if you need somebody to call somebody and get the phone answered bob can do it " says a senior citigroup executive noting that mr rubin enjoys "unencumbered access" to leaders and executives around the world now he must directly oversee a company on its heels while confronting mounting frustration among employees and shareholders that he and his colleagues on the board didnt do enough to monitor the companys strategic direction and specifically its exposure to the subprime mortgage mess the lack of a clear successor to mr prince who has been seen as vulnerable for months has added to the criticism to critics the composition of the person board is part of the problem corporate governance experts frown upon boards stocked with ceos arguing that such executives tend to defer to their fellow ceos judgment and are less likely to exercise aggressive oversight citis board is stacked with current and former chiefs from time warner inc ceo richard parsons to alcoa inc s alain belda only mr parsons who ran a small new york bank until has a background in the financial services industry such expertise would have been useful in monitoring citigroups exposure to the subprime mortgage implosion this year the boards audit committee which met yesterday to review additional write downs in the value of mortgage related securities is headed by c michael armstrong the former at&amp t chief who now is chairman of the board of trustees at johns hopkins medicine health systems &amp hospital "the board has been part of the problem not part of the solution " says robert lamb a professor at new york universitys business school and a former adviser to sanford weill who built citigroup into a financial titan "they were willing to give more and more rope to chuck prince " mr rubin yesterday said "the board is a very strong board and a very good board " mr rubin also will serve on the four member panel searching for a permanent ceo the other members are mr belda mr parsons and franklin a thomas a consultant who also sits on citigroups board it is mr rubin the highest profile member of the star studded board who has been a particular lightning rod for criticism his murky responsibilities and lucrative pay package have fostered resentment last year he collected a total of about &# million in salary bonus and stock awards making him citigroups second highest paid executive after mr prince according to the companys proxy statement to some past and current citigroup executives and to investors the pay seems excessive "i and others should hold rubin partially responsible" for citigroups struggles says douglas kass who runs seabreeze partners management inc a hedge fund that doesnt have a position in citigroup stock similar sentiments have been festering within citigroups investment bank a former trading executive at goldman mr rubin regularly visits citigroups investment banking headquarters and every few weeks eats dinner with a group of traders say people familiar with the matter but his role in luring vikram pandit a high profile morgan stanley alumnus to citigroup this year irked employees who felt mr pandits skill set overlapped with that of thomas maheras a well regarded trader and co head of the investment bank last month mr pandit was promoted to oversee the investment bank and mr maheras resigned other senior traders are expected to follow mr maheras to the exits still no one is discounting mr rubins abilities given his track record at goldman and later in washington he came to washington at the start of the clinton presidency serving initially as the chairman of the new national economic council and guiding the new president to a major deficit reduction effort he became treasury secretary in early moving quickly to arrange massive loans to mexico by tapping an obscure treasury kitty called the exchange stabilization fund the move helped stabilize mexican finances roiled by a rapidly devaluing peso at goldman mr rubin quickly rose through the ranks after joining in by he was vice chairman and co chief operating officer and was promoted to co chairman in carrick mollenkamp and gregory zuckerman contributed to this article
