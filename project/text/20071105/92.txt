why citi struggles to tally losses swelling write downs show just how fallible pricing models can be when the market for mortgage securities entered a meltdown over the summer financial firms holding billions of dollars of hard to trade assets used mathematical pricing models that were heavily dependent on credit ratings when the credit rating firms began a massive downgrade campaign last month firms such as citigroup inc and merrill lynch &amp co saw the value of their holdings plummet citigroups struggles to put an exact number on its losses demonstrate just how fallible the models can be and how serious the consequences last night citigroup said that the downgrades will result in a reduction of fourth quarter net income of &# billion to &# billion that follows a third quarter when citigroup recorded mortgage related write downs of &# billion including losses on subprime securities and fixed income trading the latest update much of it involving securities linked to subprime mortgages follows a revision made late last month by merrill lynch that increased third quarter write downs to &# billion from an earlier estimate of about &# billion for exposure to debt pools and subprime loans as a result analysts are beginning to see merrills big hit as less of an anomaly than originally thought "we estimate that theres over &# billion of write downs in the fourth quarter for the industry for banks and brokers " said analyst mike mayo who covers financial firms for deutsche bank mr mayo said his estimate is based on exposure to debt pools and mortgage securities and includes citigroup bear stearns cos morgan stanley and bank of america corp citis updated write downs could be included in its coming quarterly filing with u s securities regulators the source of citigroups write down is at least as significant as its size the banks estimate of its losses has changed so rapidly in large part because the models it used to value hard to trade securities relied heavily on credit ratings according to people familiar with the models that made the bank highly vulnerable when in october ratings firms moodys investors service and standard &amp poors slashed or put on watch for downgrade the ratings on tens of billions of dollars in securities it is unlikely that citigroup is alone ratings play a big role in valuation models used by many banks investment funds and insurance companies meanwhile the market for securities linked to subprime loans has deteriorated in recent weeks as defaults have confirmed some of analysts most dire forecasts increasing the likelihood of further ratings downgrades citigroups subprime exposure and source of its problems is found in two big buckets that together total &# billion in its securities and banking unit the bank said the first bucket totals &# billion including securities tied to subprime loans that were being held or warehoused until they could be added to debt pools for investors the second totaling &# billion covers so called super senior securities these highly rated super senior securities are portions of collateralized debt obligations or cdos cdos are repackaged pools of lower rated securities backed by subprime loans into pieces with different levels of risk and return analysts estimate that &# billion in such super senior tranches are sitting on the books of banks insurers and investment funds the troubles stem back to the heyday of the u s housing boom when citi became one of the biggest players in the lucrative world of cdos backed by subprime linked bonds overall citi was the second largest underwriter of cdos in doing &# billion in deals according to data provider dealogic as a result citis holdings of subprime exposures varies from the actual loans to the most highly rated slices of cdos the bank said they include securities the bank had warehoused to later package into cdos extended to the super senior tranches of cdos that citi helped create banks often kept the super senior pieces of cdos because their low returns made them unattractive to investors despite their extremely high ratings in a statement citigroup said the declines in the value of the banks subprime exposure "followed a series of rating agency downgrades of subprime u s mortgage related assets and other market developments which occurred after the end of the third quarter " when trading in the subprime linked securities all but dried up amid this summers credit market turmoil citigroup and other banks suddenly faced the difficult task of putting a value on securities that investors no longer wanted to trade for lack of any market pricing citigroup used credit ratings as a key input in figuring out the value of the future payments it expected to receive on the securities according to a person familiar with the banks valuation models for example in valuing the payments on pieces of subprime backed cdos with the highest triple a rating the bank would look to how the market was valuing payments on corporate bonds with the same rating "in general the industry standard model for pricing cdos is not adequate in my view which means that theres a lot of uncertainty about what they are worth " says darrell duffie a finance professor at stanford universitys business school "they can get better models but thats not something they can do overnight " the problem with the ratings based approach was that it ignored a key difference between corporate bonds and subprime backed bonds defaults on the latter were growing at a fast rate which would likely lead to ratings downgrades the downgrades began in earnest oct when in a little noticed announcement moodys investors service said it had slashed credit ratings on about bonds backed by subprime home loans that originally carried a total value of &# billion it also flagged bigger problems ahead saying that cdos had direct exposure to the mortgage securities that had been downgraded
