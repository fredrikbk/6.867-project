ahead of the tape so you want more rate cuts well maybe not investors have come to see federal reserve interest rate cuts as the balm that cures all wounds the truth is more complicated last week was a case in point the fed lowered its target interest rate to the dow jones industrial average duly rallied only to be handed a point drubbing the next day what investors seem to want and what the economy needs might be diverging housing related problems have been ailing the stock market recently particularly financial stocks still it isnt clear it is ailing the economy enough to justify more rate cuts last week the commerce department said gross domestic product rose an annualized in the third quarter and the labor department said nonfarm payrolls increased by a greater than expected in october in the weeks ahead housings bad situation could put even more real estate based securities at risk citigroup is expected to announce billions of dollars of write downs dont be surprised if other banks and brokerages follow with their own a big deal for the broader stock market even in a bad year like this financial firms account for more than a quarter of the profit by companies in the standard &amp poors stock index financials also account for nearly a third of s&amp p dividends and many nonfinancial firms like general motors have significant financial arms of course the gdp and jobs reports might well be high water marks for the economy but if the housing downturn really does start to stifle economic growth it isnt clear more fed rate cuts would do much to fix the problems the problems in housing are less related to high interest rates now than to the hangover after a period of feverish speculation spurred by low rates before no matter how low rates go many of the people who would have qualified for mortgages when banks were lending recklessly arent going to qualify anymore with home prices in many areas declining no matter how low rates go many people will be reluctant to buy using borrowed money to purchase a depreciating asset isnt an obvious step to take what housing really needs is time to heal its wounds the fed cant drop that from helicopters to be sure every economic slowdown brings a chorus of naysayers who say rate cuts are little more than "pushing on a string " and that always turns out to be wrong the feds rate cuts after the dot com bubble burst for example didnt do much to help tech firms out but the fed did spur other areas of the economy notably consumer spending and housing helping to make the recession strikingly mild but there are unintended consequences too when the fed fought the tech stock bust with lower rates it got a housing bubble in its place this time with other major economies around the world feeling little pain from the u s housing slowdown one consequence of more rate cuts could be further weakening in the dollar and increases in commodity prices both could lead to the sorts of inflationary pressures u s investors havent had to worry about in a very long time message to wall street be careful what you wish for send comments to justin lahart wsj com
