health care building booms in persian gulf dubai united arab emirates oil rich states in the persian gulf are in the midst of a health care building boom using their wealth to coax world class medical facilities to the desert health care has long been an afterthought in the region life expectancy trails developed countries and residents suffer from high rates of diabetes and obesity when the rich need sophisticated treatment they travel abroad "if you ask executives today what is the best health care facility theyll tell you the airport " says robert crone president and chief executive of harvard medical schools international arm but with oil prices skyrocketing and visas to the u s harder to obtain countries from united arab emirates to qatar and saudi arabia are pushing to dramatically expand and improve their health care systems the regions ruling families are recruiting brand name u s medical institutions and private investors with plans over the next years to more than quadruple the estimated &# billion spent annually on health care the aggressive moves have drawn the attention of big medical equipment makers with general electric co philips electronics nv and siemens ag beefing up operations in the region in the u a e a business entity of dubais ruling family recruited harvard medical schools international arm to consult on the planning and running of a new bed teaching hospital that will train about medical residents a year about a fifth the size of harvards program at massachusetts general hospital the new hospital will be part of dubai healthcare city a acre planned community that could grow larger than harvards affiliated medical complex in boston in nearby abu dhabi the government contracted with cleveland clinic to develop and operate a new hospital with to beds that is scheduled to open in march four cleveland clinic physicians and administrators moved to abu dhabi this summer to run the governments bed sheikh khalifa medical city and adjoining clinics johns hopkins medicine international a unit of the baltimore university was hired last year to manage another bed hospital about miles east of the u a e s capital of abu dhabi saudi arabia meanwhile has plans for up to new clinics and about hospitals industry officials say "money is not the issue but you need the quality medical care " says viktor hediger a dubai based partner with consultants mckinsey &amp co "this is what those brand names can bring " the building surge will bring the u a e near parity with more developed western countries in health care facilities by dubai officials estimate the country will have hospital beds for every people up from today by comparison saudi arabia has beds per people the u s has and the european union according to the world health organization soaring health care spending reflects the changing priorities of the gulf countries during the s oil boom the governments primarily built public works such as power plants refineries and roads now concerned about maintaining political stability the governments are trying to improve quality of life dr hediger says life expectancy in the region has improved to years from years as recently as but that still trails the average life expectancy of years in eight leading developed countries heart disease obesity and diabetes are also expected to grow dramatically as the population grows and ages building hospitals alone wont necessarily improve those statistics however one big challenge is an acute shortage of doctors and nurses in the region particularly arabic speakers for locals both jobs offer relatively modest status and pay mckinsey says and its hard to attract physicians from outside in part because the region has little advanced research and education the gulf states hope to attract private investors but those plans may hinge on devising ways to provide health care to millions of foreign workers who generally arent covered by government medical plans roughly of the u a e s million residents are not citizens to of saudi arabias million residents are foreigners some countries are now moving toward requiring employers to provide health insurance well known u s hospitals moving into the region say they dont plan to stay forever and hope to train locals to take over "our job will be done when were able to elevate medical care there

sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum officials believe the planned health care community with the harvard led teaching hospital cardiac center cosmetic and dental clinics spas and high end hotels will reach beyond local residents to become a magnet for foreigners dubai and abu dhabi hope to bring in some &# billion in "medical tourism" a year according to a report by the local chamber of commerce the development has moved slower than planned mayo clinic opened a satellite office in healthcare city two years ago but the office has only one doctor a cardiologist who examines and refers patients for treatment primarily in the u s mayo officials are mulling expansion but mayo clinic rochester chief executive glenn forbes says "we need a critical mass" of patients to make the project financially viable mayo has invested limited money in the dubai development while the government is paying harvard cleveland clinic and johns hopkins as outside contractors all four institutions have long treated gulf region leaders at their u s facilities muhadditha al hashimi chief executive of healthcare city acknowledges that mayo is still weighing the situation she notes that other clinics are doing well she says investors were reluctant to invest in the development initially "now we get a flood of investors that we have to turn our back on sometimes " she says the rise in health care spending means new opportunities for medical equipment suppliers and investors ge helped to arrange financing for a bed hospital that will open in healthcare city early next year it also invested &# million in the company that built the hospital emirates healthcare holdings ltd ge also opened a center in riyadh this summer to train doctors and nurses on its latest diagnostic equipment previously
