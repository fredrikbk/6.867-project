investing in funds a monthly analysis as firms boost analyst ranks heres how to sort out funds with much of the fund industry focused on computer driven trading models and sophisticated new ways to track market indexes investors might be forgiven for thinking that human stock pickers are going the way of the slide rule index tracking exchange traded funds and numbers centric quantitative portfolios leave little role for the peter lynch style manager who spends his days meeting with corporate management and touring factory floors but kick the tires stock pickers remain alive and well as many fund companies pour more resources into research efforts trying to improve performance in the face of the proliferation of etfs and other low cost competitors fidelity investments has added more than stock analysts since bringing the total number to more than rather than hiring exclusively from college and business school campuses its recruiting more experienced people the firm also has

actively managed funds strategic insight a fund research and consulting firm predicts that net flows this year into actively managed stock and bond funds will be close to &# billion the highest level in a decade fund companies renewed focus on research may mean better returns for investors yet those considering actively managed mutual funds should step carefully index funds low fees and tax efficiency make them tough competition for active managers and improvement doesnt come overnight while oak value capital management inc which runs the oak value fund started reorganizing its research effort several years ago "only now is it obvious that we did the things we should have done " says larry coats the firms president and chief executive the fund falls near the bottom of morningstar inc s "large blend" category on a three year basis while it has climbed into the top half of the category this year through the end of october to help investors sort through the more than actively managed mutual funds and take advantage of the heightened focus on research we pulled together recent fund performance studies from investment research firms and academia heres what we found  if a manager doesnt own shares of his own fund you may not want to invest either managers who hold shares of their funds tend to post better results and thats especially true for active managers according to a study published this year in the journal of financial economics the study by researchers at the georgia institute of technology london business school and university of south florida looked at more than funds that had reported manager ownership data as of the end of it found that those with managers who held shares delivered an average return of in compared with an average return for funds with managers who held no shares the managers may have good information about how their funds will perform in the future or their ownership of fund shares may simply give them more incentive to outperform according to the study only of the funds had managers who held any shares according to the study u s stock funds had the highest manager ownership on average while international bond funds had the lowest a number of fund companies have begun requiring managers to put their own money in their funds janus has started directing a portion of managers compensation into shares of their funds legg mason inc s royce &amp associates which manages funds like royce opportunity and royce special equity requires senior portfolio managers to accumulate an investment of at least &# million in each fund they manage assistant managers must invest at least &# the securities and exchange commission in started requiring funds to disclose managers investments in the funds they run the data are found in the funds statement of additional information which is often available on the fund companys web site or at sec gov edgar shtml the figures dont tell all however managers investments are reported in broad dollar ranges such as &# to &# or &# to &# and they arent disclosed as a percentage of a managers net worth and while an investment of say &# may seem hefty investors should consider the figure in light of the managers compensation the median compensation for equity portfolio managers in the u s is &# according to a new survey by the cfa institute an association of investment professionals  beware of "closet indexers " if youre paying up for active management you should get active management not an index fund in disguise fund expenses cut into investors returns the average annual expense ratio of a stock etf is of assets while the average actively managed stock fund charges about according to morningstar but true active management is getting harder to find according to a study by antti petajisto and martijn cremers professors at yale school of management the study looked at funds"active share " which basically measures what percentage of a funds holdings actually differ from the index that serves as its benchmark actively managed funds with a low active share those that have holdings quite similar to their benchmark held about of fund assets in up from next to nothing in the s the study found the average active share of so called actively managed large cap funds dropped to roughly from about over the same period the study found that funds whose holdings differ the most from their benchmarks tended to substantially outperform their indexes and actively managed funds with low active shares generally charged fees almost as high as those with high active shares essentially charging active management fees for index fund performance while there is good reason for index funds growing popularity in recent years the increasing prominence of low active share funds is "a much less desirable development " mr petajisto says there are some high profile exceptions to this trend at fidelity magellan for example manager harry lange is taking more risk versus the standard &amp poors stock index one of the most commonly used benchmarks in the industry than did his predecessor robert stansky says greg carlson a morningstar analyst magellan charges an annual expense ratio of investors can get a sense of how much a fund differs from an index by looking at its holdings and how the allocations stack up against the benchmark the "portfolio" tab on morningstar com shows how a funds sector weightings compare with a broad market index and its category average fund research site mutualdecision com plans in the coming weeks to offer a tool that lets users screen for funds with high "active share " the site plans to offer the data for free for or days after which users will need to pay a quarterly fee which hasnt yet been determined  dont get too caught up in a funds performance against its benchmark its important to size up a funds long term track record against an appropriate market index but investors shouldnt make snap judgments instead focus on the funds strategy and risk level to find out why it might be diverging from the index a fund that lags behind its benchmark may be taking on less risk or staying away from inflated segments of the market the fact that vanguard selected value fund has trailed its benchmark over the past few years doesnt concern daniel p wiener publisher of independent adviser for vanguard investors newsletter and chairman of adviser investment management in newton mass a big reason for the underperformance the fund didnt load up on real estate investment trusts he says the fund ranks in the top half of morningstars midsize stock "value" category over the past five years and he says its managers have "a long term track record im happy to stick with " another reason not to make snap judgments the index cited by the fund may be inappropriate research by berk sensoy assistant finance professor at the university of southern californias marshall school of business found that roughly one third of actively managed u s diversified stock funds name a benchmark in their prospectus that doesnt match the funds actual investment style to get a sense of whether a fund is citing an appropriate benchmark check out its "style box" on the "snapshot" page at morningstar com if the funds style is midcap value but it gauges itself against say a large cap growth index then you may not be getting an apples to apples comparison  dont wait around for a "stock pickers market " conventional wisdom holds that active managers often lag behind indexes during big rallies but can beat the market during more turbulent times by moving to defensive positions like cash but investors shouldnt try to jump between indexing and active management based on market conditions advisers and analysts say and research by russel kinnel director of fund research at morningstar challenges the basic notion of a stock pickers market to better judge active managers skill he constructed custom benchmarks to accurately reflect the holdings of various types of funds the average large company growth fund for example devotes the biggest chunk of its assets to this type of stock but it also holds large value stocks and even small caps so instead of simply comparing large company growth funds with a large growth benchmark mr kinnel built an index including large growth large value small caps and other holdings found in large growth managers portfolios when he compared funds against these more accurate benchmarks he found that there isnt a lot of variation year to year in the percentage of active managers who beat the benchmark "for a good active manager all markets are stock pickers markets " says mr wiener who publishes the independent adviser ms laise is a staff reporter in the wall street
