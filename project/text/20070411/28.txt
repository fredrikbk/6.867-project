business world lucky me the following is an unsent email from found on the laptop of the late sam zell beloved real estate mogul who decades ago flirted with a career in media by proposing a leveraged buyout of the tribune co financed by an employee stock option plan dear fellow investors please join me in disregarding the guff youve been reading about your new esop some of which i admit to uttering myself the government wouldnt have to dangle giant tax inducements to encourage companies to adopt this ownership structure if employee ownership produced the benefits that its fans claim for it yes ive seen the studies claiming employee owned companies are happy and have higher growth is that because employee ownership creates happiness and growth or because employee ownership only thrives under circumstances where the underlying business can produce happiness and growth you dont work in a business thats happy and lets not imagine that happiness and growth will be conjured out of shifting ownership to an esop our business is not growing and we had better get unhappy about it we need to get rid of people we cant afford we need to stop paying people to do what theyve always done just because they like doing it you seem to believe you have a sacred right to carry on despite the customers lack of interest in what you do by "you " i mean the los angeles times dude to quote my acquaintance donald youre fired im joking youre not fired youre laid off perhaps youre offered a generous exit package ill get back to you actually my secret hope is to get somebody to take the l a times off our hands between you me and the lamppost were structuring this deal as an esop for the tax benefit as employees your role in the esop is to serve as whats the word a patsy no a cut out your participation is what makes us eligible for the giant tax handout so dont worry were going to cut you in you betcha believe me im not saying the esop cant pay off for you it could but im honor bound to point out that its not good financial sense to double down on your own employer by recycling your income back into your companys stock sure the stock could take off so could any stock if you want to swing for the fences at least give yourself some stocks to choose from and dont forget esops typically deny their employee "owners" the basic prerogatives of ownership in our case i will have control you wont you arent dumb im told you understand the newspaper industry faces a problematic future our tribune predecessors did a great job of preserving our fat profit margins by cutting cutting cutting well be cutting too to pay down the &# billion loan to put the company nominally in your hands but dont worry there will still be plenty of work around here you can do valve checks on my ducatis they need one every miles talk about high maintenance im joking dont touch my bikes on a serious note the worlds appetite for news and information is hardly shrinking theres a future for us distributing local news and information that readers cant get elsewhere and wouldnt exist if we didnt produce it we got sidetracked by the times mirror merger that brought the l a times aboard we will concentrate again on becoming a local chicago e commerce giant between there and here well be struggling to pay down our huge debt being realistic you wonder why i have put up a tiny sum of my own money to become the engineer of this train wreck and mix metaphors which is a bosss prerogative at some point we might hit on a new business model that really pays off in which case your stock would actually be worth something for me i only have to wait for the transaction to close a few months from now then ive got a year option to buy of the company current market value &# billion for the bargain price of &# million talk about backdating i know i can hardly believe it myself im a great guy and my lack of media experience is probably a plus at this point and the value of my stake would have to be discounted for my share of the massive debt taken on partly to buy it and hand it to me but it still adds up to a giant signing bonus for agreeing to serve as chairman whats more the agreement basically gives me control whether or not i spend the money to exercise the option boy oh boy this is a deal for the m&amp a record books ive heard of acquirers paying a "control premium " but a "control discount" i just hope burkle geffen and broad the west coast billionaires whom i outfoxed in bidding for tribune dont steal my esop idea and offer to pay a more realistic price for my controlling stake with the extra cash reducing the esops debt whats the estimated value of my option good question its not in the documents and tribs chief spokesman claims not to have seen a figure even i dont really understand what the esop is getting in return for basically letting me buy control of the company for years with &# million im also lending the firm &# million but that will be paid back lordy i just thought of something what if the esop trustee asks for a "fairness opinion" can you imagine the lawsuits you media types will say the flaw in the negotiation was the absence of anybody with a motive to protect the esops interests the chandler trusts might be sued too youll say we got together and concocted the esop to buy out chandler at top dollar turn around and sell me a controlling stake at a knockdown price geez what was tribune ceo dennis fitzsimons thinking when he let me brainstorm up this convoluted deal and i have such a good reputation too id better rethink pronto what a drag because i really might have been the guy to save the newspaper business from itself your pal sam see related letter "letters to the editor notice to tribune employees read this first" wsj april
