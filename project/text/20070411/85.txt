political candidates have invaded the web and tamed the blogs it already has launched one candidacy helped to raise record amounts of money and prompted fears about a new breed of anonymous political attack ads but as a force in the presidential race the internet is just getting started a good thing too with more than a year and a half to go before the actual election the country is going to need all the help it can get to escape burnout when hillary clinton wanted to announce her candidacy back in january she simply posted a video on her web site the regular media noticed right away the point of using the web after all was as much to reach political reporters as it was to reach regular voters and it became big news it has been an internet assisted election ever since the biggest role for the web has involved raising money barack obama got of his &# million in contributions from online donors sen clinton the only other candidate to announce the percent raised online got about but all the candidates have learned that putting a "give money" button on the home page of their web sites usually is both cheaper and more effective than mass mailings or numbers the two standards for populist fund raising in the days before the web big web operations such as yahoo and google have learned that the interest in a presidential election just like the interest in "american idol " can with the right sort of marketing be translated into more "page views" and thus more advertising the sites have begun actively recruiting presidential candidates to avail themselves of politically oriented special features such as a presidential election "channel" on googles youtube the effort isnt just in the u s in france yahoos french home page links to "presidentielle " about that countrys current election campaign for their part the candidates seem to see yahoo and google as competitors of sorts and are trying as they say in marketing to "own the customer relationship " as much as possible the campaigns are attempting to keep voters from ever leaving their web sites todays campaign web sites are evolving into complete portals about the candidates in addition to the appeal for money and candidate bio youll find pictures videos and social networks more often than not a candidates site will even include links to outside news articles about the campaign or at least those that dont put it in a bad light there are also blogs though of a singular sort when blogging began it had a rebel vibe to it bloggers were supposed to be free thinkers deep in an organization who would tell the straight story about things the story the public relations department didnt want you to know but it didnt take long for blogs to be co opted these days much of the discussion about blogging at least in the tech blogosphere involves how companies can best use them for public relations naturally its this new sanitized blogging that has been adopted by the presidential campaigns typical blog posts involve the enthusiasm of the crowds at the latest rally or the need for supporters to get out and volunteer as candidates deal with the web they will start to learn that many web users have an extremely high opinion of themselves and the online lifestyle they are now leading last week joe biden responded via a webcam to a question posed to him via youtube the response was called "a milestone in presidential politics" by one blogger as though it marked the first time a candidate had ever been asked a question by a citizen then again sen bidens answer was one minute and seconds long which is the length of the average long report on a nightly newscast the question involved the sorts of sacrifices americans should be called on to make the answer from the senator mentioned energy conservation and the war in iraq being able to watch a candidate talk about an issue for a whole two minutes unfortunately has been a luxury in the u s though the internet is in the process of changing that the election is remembered as the "macaca election " for the youtube video of a now former senator making a racially insensitive remark as a result campaign managers all across the country advised their candidates to never do or say anything in public that they wouldnt want to see one day on youtube the season of user generated political videos has begun anew last month a reworking of apples famous "" macintosh tv commercial with hillary clinton subbing for big brother appeared online it had been made on a sunday afternoon on a mac of course by a now former employee of one of the obama campaigns contractors the ad came to the attention of political reporters them again as well as the drudge report and as a result millions saw it so now there is a new concern that the web will be home to similar kinds of video hit pieces for which no one will claim sponsorship but i think well be ok someone somewhere always manages to smoke these things out email me at lee gomes wsj com
