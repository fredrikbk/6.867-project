every business day sign up for the e mail here a potentially breakthrough finding on the treatment of juvenile diabetes with stem cell transplantation is being reported today just as a fight over u s government funding of stem cell research has resumed in the senate yesterday senators began a two day debate over taxpayer support for embryonic stem cell research "an emotional and ethical drama that is widely expected to climax with the second veto" of president bushs time in office as the washington post reports but the new study in todays journal of the american medical association though it involves bone marrow stem cells rather than those harvested from embryos may jolt the legislative process in washington the study was carried out at the bone marrow transplantation unit of the school of medicine of ribeirao preto in brazil because as co author dr richard k burt of northwestern universitys medical school tells the associated press u s doctors werent interested in the approach the team worked with patients aged years to years who had recently been diagnosed with type diabetes previous studies had shown that suppression of the autoimmune system through chemotherapy in such patients could prevent further loss of insulin production in the pancreas the body needs insulin to process sugar and prevent blood sugar levels from rising so high they can cause heart disease blindness and the other known dangers of untreated diabetes once these patients immune systems had been suppressed the doctors intravenously gave them stem cells from the patients own bone marrow which helped establish new immune systems that in theory wouldnt attack the pancreas as a result all but two were able to stop taking the insulin shots that were keeping them healthy including one who had been insulin free for nearly three years at the time the study was written up none of the patients suffered lasting side effects but the authors say they dont know how long the positive effects will last and that more study is needed its not the only potentially groundbreaking work being done on stem cells in brazil where as the wall street journal notes such work can cost "just a fraction of the price of carrying out a similar procedure in more heavily regulated laboratories in the u s or elsewhere " a local scientist has been injecting patients own stem cell rich bone marrow into the arteries of people who suffer from chagas disease an infection that inflicts people in poor regions of latin america and can cause dangerous heart enlargement dr ricardo ribeiro dos santos and fellow doctors "surmise that cells from the injected marrow somehow reduced swelling and stopped more scar tissue from forming helping a patients heart pump better " the journal reports "encouraged by this and other cases brazils government is undertaking an ambitious study of how a persons own cells can be used to repair a damaged heart " which no drug can do today and a patient trial the worlds largest on the potential use of stem cells is now taking place there in the u s where type diabetes affects one million to two million people far less than the prevalent type diabetes the brazilian study in jama is being welcomed as a strategy akin to an approach to treating other immune system disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis that have shown some success the los angeles times reports "we all realize that without addressing the problem at the level of the immune system well never really beat type diabetes " dr francisco prieto who treats diabetics in elk grove calif and wasnt involved in the study tells the times "this is very encouraging work " daimlerchrysler snubs kerkorian kirk kerkorian may be the best known bidder for chrysler but that apparently
