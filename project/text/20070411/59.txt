emerging market investors seek more influence overseas investors in emerging markets are becoming increasingly influential shareholders bringing not only money but also expectations about how companies should operate and what they should reveal to investors according to a new report investors from the u s europe and elsewhere quadrupled their ownership stake across a broad swath of companies in emerging markets over a five year period the report from citigroup inc shows citigroup examined the shareholding patterns of publicly traded companies with a market value of more than &# million in emerging markets it found that in foreign investors held a median of of the publicly available shares in these companies up from in along with capital foreign investors including u s and european mutual pension and hedge funds are exporting certain expectations regarding transparency disclosure and shareholder rights to emerging markets a small number are adopting more assertive tactics familiar to u s and european companies making public demands for management to pay higher dividends seek out acquisitions or abandon plans to change the shareholder structure "in a relatively short period of time we have seen foreign investors become an important force" in emerging markets says carsten stendevad a citigroup managing director who wrote the report companies in emerging markets want to attract foreign investors he says but are grappling with how to deal with their growing influence one company in asia mr stendevad says had a foreign investor who owned less than a stake but nevertheless wanted weekly meetings with senior managers and hired its own consultant to evaluate the business the investors attitude was "if youre not going to think about it well think about it " mr stendevad says some investors are going further and focusing on these tactics as a profit generating strategy the california public employees retirement system or calpers the nations largest pension fund said in february that it will allocate as much as &# million to investment funds that specifically target corporate governance in emerging markets such "corporate governance" funds look for companies whose share price lags behind their peers because of perceived management problems or board issues they take a stake in the company and agitate for change either publicly or privately often in concert with other shareholders the ultimate goal is improved earnings and a higher share price the strategy has been one of calperss most profitable in the u s there is an added challenge to this approach in emerging markets control often rests with a family or government among companies with a market value of more than &# billion nearly half are majority owned by such "insiders " the citigroup report says these include indias wipro ltd and china mobile ltd even if they dont control the company foreign investors are finding ways to flex their muscles on issues related to corporate governance sometimes rallying local minority shareholders in the process mostly discussions take place behind closed doors but it can burst into the open a case in point last year

requirements for the novo mercado a portion of the sao paolo stock exchange featuring companies that meet rigorous corporate governance standards in the process it proposed a formula for converting the shares that would dilute the overall stake of investors holding "nonvoting" shares in june brandes investment partners lp a san diego money manager that then owned of the companys nonvoting shares through its american depositary receipts objected to the plan in a securities and exchange commission filing saying the restructuring proposal wasnt fair to all shareholders in a december vote shareholders rejected the move brandes declined to comment last year investors from abroad targeted companies in korea carl icahn american hedge fund steel partners and other foreign investors pressured kt&amp g corp a tobacco and ginseng producer to name a new director sell its stake in an unrelated business and return cash to shareholders in december two new york hedge funds pushed for a shareholder vote to remove the chief executive of gravity co a korean online game company although the vote failed the ceo controls of the stock nearly of the minority investors supported the initiative the ceo remains at the firm but the company recently appointed two new independent directors the citigroup report suggests there may be more such clashes to come it identified "activist" investors and tallied their holdings in emerging markets as of late last year such investors owned stakes in nearly companies in emerging markets in cases these investors held stakes of more than
