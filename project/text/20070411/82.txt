phd aims to build expertise in ways of communicating questions for matt seiler company phd a media buying firm owned by omnicom group title chief executive of phds north american operations more than many other media buyers omnicom groups phd has tried to focus on the strategy behind its business understanding how to target consumers in an increasingly fragmented media environment now the firm whose clients include safeway hbo and unisys is seeking even deeper insights it is segmenting marketers by the approach they need to take whether it be "one to one" marketing "one to some" marketing or "one to many " and creating new divisions to deal with each this realignment was the brainchild of matt seiler who earlier this month succeeded steve grubbs as chief executive of phds north american operations a former account executive who once oversaw omnicoms pepsico business mr seiler has elevated several other account executives hoping to put more emphasis on client needs mr seiler talks below about the forces that threaten to derail the growth of media buying firms in ad land and what role media buying firms should play with marketers wsj what do you have planned now that you are taking the reins mr seiler we have brought in agency account people one of the things that happened when media agencies were divested from creative agencies was account people stayed at the creative agencies media people havent been trained in client services there is a huge opportunity to change the game in having people that understand strategy and client services we will be developing in the near future an expertise in three ways of communicating "one to one" "one to some" and "one to most" offerings this is pretty exciting when communicating we can talk to an individual say your best friend thats one to one or we can talk to pregnant women in the detroit metro area thats one to some or we can talk to women thats one to most wsj account executives at the ad agencies are the individuals that controlled the marketers ad account today it seems everyone is gunning for that job ad agencies the media buying firms and even the consulting firms such as mckinsey &amp co who should ultimately have control of the ad account mr seiler well as an account person from an ad agency world i saw that media buying and planning was at the wrong end of the conversation it was boring and what they had to share was a flow chart and nobody could stand it so they relegated the media people to the last five minutes of the presentation to clients but media is the point when you say who is the customer what do we know about her where is she living her life where is she receptive to a message from us its all the stuff you have to know before you can begin to think about what conversation you want to have with her because the media people were so not sexy they didnt get to tell that story so if you could take the media information about who consumer x is and quantify it and recognize that is where all the money is going to be spent then that means media are the first people who should talk so you have to put the media people at the beginning that is the right relationship does that mean the creative agency just becomes the creative boutique that puts up the ad once weve done all the other stuff maybe wsj what about the consulting firms like mckinsey where do they fit in mr seiler the mckinseys do a great job of the media end of it they do a much sexier version of what media firms did they have got all the quantified data and they go off and do all their studies and such but they cant actually do anything they can tell you what is but they cant implement anything if mckinsey type firms were a less expensive and b less egoistical then they could be the one that does what we do minus the implementation part wsj just last week the cable trade group nixed the ebay online media exchange does the idea of online ad selling threaten your business model how do you protect your turf mr seiler its absolutely threatening just like mckinseys are from time to time just like the media owners feeling they can go directly to clients and dont need us then there are the creative agencies saying "oops we made a mistake and want to bring back media again" that is also a threat so there are probably four different attacks on our flanks you can look at it as threatening or you can look it as how does this force us to sharpen our game a lot of what happens in this business and in the upfront is old habit and sure if you were to start fresh you wouldnt do it the way we do it but on the other hand this business is built on many relationships that is not going to go away anytime soon these things do force us to base our business on ideas and less on the broker number crunching part of the business wsj which threat are you most worried about mr seiler media owners selling direct to clients i think if we are not doing a good enough job bringing ideas to media owners and in turn together bringing them to clients then why wouldnt the media owner start saying "why do i need them " wsj some marketers have allowed their media buying firms to select the ad agency they should hire how much is this happening mr seiler it is happening and it obviously portends good things for the media agency the media people should be helping to determine the right ways on how to get to consumer x we own all the data and we own all the research all the stuff that used to sit at the full service ad agency when the media agency was spun off from the creative agencies they said fine those are the people that sat on the fourth floor and we dont care about them its just overhead but when we left they said "oh they had all the data " which means now when they ad firms are presenting stuff its kind of subjective so if you buy that the media agencies have a lot of the knowledge that marketers clients need to have then its right to have clients say "given that we are going to spend a lot of time focusing on consumer x sure when we get to the creative we would like you to have a role in selecting which of the agencies seems to do the best job in getting to consumer x " in a recent case our client discovery was looking for a creative agency and they asked jen neil who runs their business here and me to sit on the decision panel with about six others wsj how much is this really happening mr seiler its rare but its increasing wsj phd has long played second fiddle to your sister media firm omd why and how can that change mr seiler phd has only existed in name in the u s for five years they omnicom took a few agencies such as creative media advancers and pentamark and tried to make them fit under phd which is a big job for any brand to do five years isnt a lot of time three of the five years were about getting our ducks in a row we have been functioning fully as phd for i would say three years which is a short time to establish a brand name second fiddle doesnt bother me omd is way bigger and was created differently omd was the media departments of ddb tbwa and bbdo omnicom ad firms i dont spend a lot of time thinking about what other media firms are doing not even omd
