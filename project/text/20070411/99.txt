politics &amp economics senate champion of both sides finance chairman baucus up for re election walks fine line washington as democrats wrestle over how far to go in raising taxes boosting spending and curbing free trade one of their most influential players is a hard to label deal maker who regularly breaks with his party the new senate finance chairman montana sen max baucus is also up for re election in further complicating his calculations to satisfy montanas unpredictable mix of conservatism and populism mr baucus must consider when to stick to the democratic line and when to side with republicans he is already doing a bit of both taking a high profile role in pushing a democratic priority the expansion of federal funding for the state childrens health insurance program while at the same time leading a republican backed effort to attach tax breaks for businesses to a bill increasing the federal minimum wage mr baucus occupies a crucial and often decisive middle ground in the senate the chamber that in this congress is the dividing line between proposing laws and enacting them house democratic leaders have a relatively easy time pushing bills through their chamber because of their large majority but the senate is more closely divided and parliamentary rules often require a supermajority of votes to get things done fiscal policy is going to be particularly difficult for lawmakers this year because of the new "pay as you go" budget rule which requires any new spending or tax breaks to be offset with program cutbacks or revenue increases the senate can bypass pay go but only by getting votes mr baucus is sanguine about his ability to find the funds needed to offset perhaps billions of dollars in democratic agenda items and to do so without a move to raise tax rates that would incite a republican backlash the tax code "is so complex its so large too large too complex that well find a lot of ways to close loopholes and go forward in a way that does not raise rates " mr baucus says an early test of how mr baucus will deal with pay go will be a proposal to spend &# billion in new funding over five years for schip a federal grant program to help states provide health insurance to low income children he has made it one of his top priorities holding a field hearing in billings mont on april to highlight the issue but many republicans including mr baucuss frequent ally and predecessor as finance chairman sen charles grassley of iowa are balking at big growth in a program that some states have used to cover uninsured adults as well as children another priority for mr baucus is eliminating the alternative minimum tax which is set to engulf millions of middle income people in coming years even though he says "i know its expensive to abolish it " he suggests that a two year fix to prevent more people from having to pay the tax is the most realistic move this year rather than the idea floated by house democrats to protect some amt payers at the lower end of the income scale by boosting taxes on wealthier people because of the new pay go rule mr baucus "has it more difficult than what i had " mr grassley says "sometimes its going to put him in the position of either compromising a lot on what his party expects of the finance committee or getting votes " with the possible exception of the schip expansion mr grassley says that much of what mr baucus wants to do "i want to help him do like he helped me " when mr grassley was the finance committee chairman under the republican congress mr baucus infuriated other democrats by supporting president bushs tax cuts and helping republicans pass a medicare prescription drug benefit in he was one of only two democrats to participate in closed door medicare talks with republicans that year the others were excluded and many democrats still chafe at the memory republicans and mr baucus himself say he had a major influence on the final product including by pushing for generous subsidies to help low income beneficiaries afford medications "i would have written it differently " he says now "but i wasnt in charge " mr baucus the year old son of a prominent ranching family has served in congress for more than years he has survived that long by catering to both parties in his independent minded state which mr bush carried with of the vote in mr baucus won re election to the senate in with of the vote tax increases there are bound to be unpopular as is anything that could be seen as hitting small businesses but so is the free trade that mr baucus often has been associated with in the next few weeks he will oversee the senate debate on key trade pacts in february the montana state senate passed a resolution calling for a harder line on u s trade policy "they work for us " a progressive political organization connected to labor groups ran radio ads criticizing mr baucus for his past support for free trade the senator says he is talking with key players about the issue and plans this week to meet with freshman senators who campaigned on trade including fellow montanan jon tester to discuss the issue "the objective clearly is more jobs more income for more american people and often when you listen closely and ask questions one will find the premises are not that different " mr baucus says he says he wants "sufficient job protections job provisions for people who do lose their jobs on account of not only trade but just globalization " often cautious and reserved mr baucus also is in what could be an awkward position of raising campaign funds from some of the very industries that he will consider targeting for tax increases to pay for democratic priorities at a recent fund raiser attended by health care business people mr baucus told the group made up mostly of people involved with the medical imaging industry about his effort to expand schip and noted the rapid growth in medicare spending on medical imaging according to a lobbyist who attended "you should worry about me coming after you " mr baucus said a comment confirmed by his office
