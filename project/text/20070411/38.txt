daimler to see bidders minus kerkorian a top daimlerchrysler ag executive is scheduled to meet in new york this week with bidders for the german auto makers chrysler unit but it appears that billionaire kirk kerkorians tracinda corp isnt among those invited tracinda which announced a surprise &# billion bid for chrysler late last week was working up to the last minute in hopes of being included in the scheduled round of meetings with daimlerchrysler executive rudiger grube a management board member and head of strategy among the issues daimlerchrysler and its bankers are questioning whether tracindas bid which came with several significant conditions is competitive given proposals from three rival groups mr grube is scheduled today to kick off meetings with representatives from the tandem of blackstone group and centerbridge capital partners lp cerberus capital management lp and a partnership between canadian auto parts supplier magna international inc and private equity firm ripplewood holdings inc as of yesterday evening it appeared unlikely that tracinda will meet with mr grube this week and a meeting isnt scheduled people familiar with the matter said tracinda however does expect to meet with daimlerchrysler officials at some point in the future because it is an interested bidder and hopes its offer is taken seriously last week tracinda publicly said it was offering &# billion for chrysler and was willing to post a deposit of &# million as it moves forward with its due diligence jerome york mr kerkorians longtime lieutenant and former chrysler chief financial officer is advising tracinda on the chrysler bid messrs kerkorian and york have a record of vigorously and publicly challenging companies that try to brush them off in the mid s they battled chryslers then chief executive robert eaton to return more of the auto makers cash to shareholders more recently they pressured general motors corp chairman and chief executive officer rick wagoner to consider a three way alliance with renault sa and nissan motor co mr wagoner mustered board support to rebuff the tracinda plan and mr kerkorian sold his stake in gm first acquired in for a modest

other bidders havent requested tracinda for example asked daimlerchrysler to shoulder a share of the u s units roughly &# billion in unfunded pension liabilities and retiree heath care costs the other bidders havent asked for that people familiar with the matter said all of the proposals including tracindas suggest that the united auto workers union has a stake in chrysler to help lower health care costs tracinda sought exclusive rights to conduct due diligence for days but daimlerchrysler sees that as too long people familiar with the process said the other bids are seen as more advanced and
