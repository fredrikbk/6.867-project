business bookshelf the inside story of wall street wars the last tycoons by william d cohan doubleday pages &# investment bank lazard ltd today is a &# billion public company with more than &# billion in annual revenue the firm consistently ranks among the top mergers and acquisitions advisory franchises and its asset management business administers holdings of more than &# billion until last year when it finally entered the public market lazard had been since its founding in one of the most self consciously mysterious of the old private banking houses when i was a graduate business student in the mid s a friend with a summer job at lazard freres as it was then known invited me to visit him he spoke to me in nervous whispered tones as his unofficial tour of their shockingly run down offices began we walked through what appeared to be a trading floor in the middle of the day and i asked why almost all the desks were empty "we only work in selective securities " he responded enigmatically with a look that suggested that he had already said too much with the publication of "the last tycoons " a new mystery can be added to the list of those that have shrouded the firm why would lazards legendary former senior management agree to be interviewed in many cases on the record regarding everything from extramarital affairs to internal political catfights even if the interviewer william d cohan was a former junior colleague of six years given that the diaspora of ex lazard bankers has made its way to every significant investment bank on wall street including the boutique investment bank where i work the book or its index anyway will be the source of intense interest throughout the industry for the next few weeks and what will readers discover mostly a hodgepodge of ancient lazard history previously chronicled elsewhere long biographical profiles of some of the key personalities and most notably a well documented if somewhat tawdry description of the investment house in its tumultuous past several decades it was during this more recent time frame that a battle over prestige and power broke out among lazards top executives including felix rohatyn and steve rattner when their famously machiavellian ultimate boss french billionaire michel david weill was unable to keep his biggest producers in place or groom a credible successor he turned to bruce wasserstein as the struggling lazards savior all of this is recounted in great detail by mr cohan a former newspaper reporter as well as a former wall street banker but if you havent worked at lazard or feel a less than fanatically intense interest in wall streets version of hand to hand combat "the last tycoons" is heavy going and at more than pages overlong mr cohan presents extended excerpts from magazine profiles and court testimony he offers "lifestyle" filigree like steve rattners property disputes in marthas vineyard he also pads his paragraphs with gratuitous and slightly goofy observations like "talk about unprecedented " more disconcerting is mr cohans willingness to repeat scandalous rumor where there is no apparent underlying evidence or where the accuser has an ax to grind or both the bitter grandson of andre meyer the man who ran the investment banks u s operations from the s to the s is twice allowed to suggest that the mother of a well known rival partner had an affair with mr meyer a chapter dedicated to the authors supposed concern for "the plight of women" in a workplace that mr cohan describes as rife with sexual harassment appears to be a thinly veiled excuse to include the most prurient of subject matter from groping in the elevator to sex behind a locked office door the author even mentions a few rumored dalliances noting that "some clearly were not true " without specifying which ones ultimately the great weakness of "the last tycoons" is its insularity the book is so lazard centric that it rarely veers into a broader discussion of contemporary currents in the financial industry or the culture generally we have little sense of how goldman sachs and other wall street giants succeeded in putting so much distance between themselves and lazard during the late s when mr cohan does stray from discussing lazard minutiae he can seem far off base even a casual reader of the business press over the past few years is likely to question the statement that morgan stanley "today still is considered the bluest of the blue blood investment banking firms with the best and most loyal clients " morgan stanleys current ceo is the son of lebanese immigrants and it has not consistently held the top spot in banking league rankings for decades even on the subject of lazard "the last tycoons" does not really deliver to be sure on the matter of who did what to whom and when the book is likely to be the definitive source but when it comes to saying what really distinguished the lazard franchise from its competitors "the last tycoons" is reduced to platitudes "its strategy simply put was to offer clients the wisdom of its great men the finest and most experienced collection of investment bankers the world had ever known " whats more the thesis behind the platitude that lazard unlike other banking houses "risked no capital offering only the raw darwinian power of their ideas" is wholly inconsistent with the facts as laid out in the book lazard famously bought avis for itself after its client passed it even launched a successful hostile bid for a public company for its own account and at various times the firm has been in and out of municipal finance risk arbitrage private equity venture capital distressed debt and any number of other businesses many requiring capital as the situation dictated if there is a single theme that unintentionally emerges in "the last tycoons " it is that through its history lazard has been one of the most relentlessly opportunistic financial organizations of all "the last tycoons" ends with a play by play of the titanic battle of wills between mr david weill the last member of the lazard dynasty and mr wasserstein the book presents the wasserstein regime as a dramatic break with lazard traditions "needless to say bruces approach to deal making could not have been more antithetical to that espoused and practiced by lazard " if however the unifying element in lazards history has been financial opportunism practiced at the highest level by some of the industrys most talented minds this last episode reads more like a continuation of these traditions rather than an abandonment of them mr knee is the author of "the accidental investment banker inside the decade that transformed wall street" oxford and director of the media program at columbia business school
