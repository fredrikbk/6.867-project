tax report marriage penalty is expected to ensnare more couples with the growth of amt the marriage penalty is far from disappearing despite efforts in congress to ease the problem many two income married couples still are paying more in taxes together than they would if each had remained single according to accountants and congressional staffers the so called marriage penalty will ensnare many more couples this year unless congress slows the rapid growth of the alternative minimum tax "the marriage penalty is alive and well and thriving in the amt " says john buckley chief tax counsel for the democrats on the house ways and means committee that may surprise some people who thought the marriage penalty was a thing of the past after all congress did make the standard deduction for joint filers twice the amount of the standard deduction for singles it also made the income ranges subject to the and tax rates for joint filers twice those for singles but while those moves certainly helped they didnt eradicate the problem lawmakers have "eliminated the marriage penalty for many married couples and mitigated it for others but have not done away with it entirely " says roberton williams principal research associate at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution the marriage penalty is threatening to stage a major comeback because of the amt which is a separate system for calculating your taxes the amts origins date back to the late s when congress learned that a small number of upper income people had managed to avoid paying any federal income tax through deductions credits and other items but congress hasnt indexed the amt for inflation and it has been hitting growing numbers of people over the past few years last year congress approved a stopgap measure which expired at the end of if congress does nothing about million people will fall into the amts web for up sharply from about four million for according to the treasury departments latest estimates among those stung by the marriage penalty are couples in which each spouse earns roughly the same and who itemize their deductions in certain cases the penalty can be so large that accountants urge some clients planning to get married to consider delaying the ceremony until the following year that allows each taxpayer to file as single for another year and use the tax savings to pay for an expensive honeymoon a married couple can choose to file separately in most cases youll save taxes by filing jointly but there are some cases in which it may be advantageous to file separately for example suppose youre a two income couple one spouse has a large amount of adjusted gross income and the other has large amounts of medical expenses casualty losses or miscellaneous itemized deductions filing separately might be better because it could enable preserving more deductions it isnt just affluent taxpayers who may be affected by the marriage penalty for example accountants say two single people each receiving social security benefits could wind up paying higher taxes on those benefits by getting married there are many other tax provisions that may be affected often overlooked in concern about the marriage penalty is the flip side to the issue the marriage "bonus " that refers to the fact that many other couples such as those with only one income may wind up paying significantly less on a combined basis than they would if they were still single mr williams who wrote a paper on the marriage penalty in when he was at the congressional budget office estimates that "many more couples benefit from the marriage bonus than are hurt by the marriage penalty " all this can make it exceptionally difficult to figure out the best timing for a marriage or divorce from a pure tax perspective however there are so many potential factors to consider that you may need to consult a pro such as a certified public accountant or enrolled agent cant
