the evening wrap getting the message online edition short of making traders write "i will not take my eyes off inflation" a thousand times on a blackboard its hard to imagine how the federal reserve could make its message much more clear to the markets the federal open market committee the central banks policy setting panel was looking to keep its options open when it wrapped up its march meeting according to the minutes released today on the one hand policy makers noted that the economy had seemed to slip into a lower gear during the early part of this year capital spending data out at the end of february looked terrible and economists worried that the problems in the housing market most recently the subprime mortgage mess would put the brakes on consumer spending but the fed as has been the case throughout the recent economic cycle remained concerned that inflation might rear its ugly head so while electing to drop past references to policy "firming" from the march statement in order to say that future rate "adjustments" would hinge on the outlook policy makers still believed that "further policy firming might prove necessary to foster lower inflation " the minutes showed the fed funds rate has been held at since last summer a span of six meetings much of this was foreshadowed when fed chairman ben bernanke testified to congress on the economy last month at a hearing before the joint economic committee he pointed to risks to the economy from sleepy business spending and housing but said inflation remained stubbornly high and that the fed was just fine with keeping rates where they are for now in that context the minutes were more of the same "the minutes underscore the fact that inflation risks remain the primary concern in spite of recent slower economic growth and consequent heightened uncertainty about the strength of the economy " said joshua shapiro chief u s economist at mfr inc in a note fired off to clients just after the minutes came out though there was little new to see stocks took the news hard all the same following a days long rally the dow jones industrial average tumbled by triple digits just after the minutes were released although investors managed to compose themselves and pared back the losses treasury yields rose before the meeting minutes emerged mr bernanke delivered a speech at new york university law school in which he said the rapid growth of hedge funds was "one of the most important developments in u s financial markets in the last decade or so" and urged regulators to treat them with kid gloves he was mum on monetary policy drawing on adam smiths familiar concept of the "invisible hand" of the market the fed chairman argued that because "hedge funds deal with highly sophisticated counterparties and investors and because they have no claims on the federal safety net the light regulatory touch seems largely justified " citing the unraveling of long term capital management the fund where genius famously failed in mr bernanke said that in response congress could have imposed "a much more intrusive regulatory regime on private pools of capital " but he said that doing so would have been a technical challenge would have increased moral hazard "and likely would have reduced the social benefits of hedge funds by hampering the ability of their managers to respond quickly and flexibly to changing market conditions " citi makes its cuts citigroup said that it will slash jobs and take other cost saving measures including shutting dozens of its smith barney retail brokerage offices the cuts are the first big overhaul of citigroup since it began ballooning nearly a decade ago with the withering of the depression era glass steagall act which walled off commercial banks from securities firms but investors have grown unhappy with the banks bloated expenses which have expanded faster than revenue in recent years and chief operating officer robert druskin has been working for months on a plan to curb spending like a couch potato starting on a workout program citigroup has set a goal to drop pounds that have piled up around its middle the company said that it will dump certain layers of management and consolidate a range of back office and other functions nearly jobs will be shipped off to lower cost locations foreign and domestic citigroup projects it will save &# billion this year &# billion in and &# billion in analysts were divided in their opinions on the news some analysts believe it could satisfy stockholders hunger for blood others were relieved citi hadnt swung its axe about more wildly "none of the goals appear to be particularly earth shaking " wrote richard bove of punk ziegel who feared more drastic cuts could harm citigroups growth "from my perspective this is very good " but others felt the company probably delivered too few scalps "the actions described this morning are just the beginning of a long process of rehabilitating citigroups growth " said
