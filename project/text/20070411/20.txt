biofuel firms take interest in tropical shrub jatropha kuala lumpur malaysia edible oils such as palm oil may continue to be provisional feedstock for biodiesel but biofuel producers say inedible oils such as jatropha oil make more economic and ethical sense in the long run jatropha is a tropical shrub that locals use as medicine but that has yet to be commercially exploited for its oil nathan mahalingam managing director of australias mission biofuels ltd said his company cultivates jatropha in india where it has a acre plantation it plans to increase to acres by year end for the first year of production jatropha oil will make up of its biodiesel feedstock the rest being palm oil mr mahalingam said but it sees that ratio shifting heavily toward jatropha many alternative fuel experts like the idea of jatropha as a biofuel in part because jatropha can grow on wasteland but that doesnt necessarily mean it will become a dominant feedstock for biofuels many other companies are placing bets on other agricultural commodities such as palm oil which is already widely produced in asia indeed palm oil producers in malaysia and indonesia are already making big investments to expand their production which should ensure that palm oil also continues to play a major role but mr mahalingam said jatropha oil is not only more affordable than palm oil but also better for biodiesel production since it doesnt harden as easily as palm oil does in the cold the use of jatropha oil would also ease fears that biodiesel production will make it difficult to get edible oils for cooking mr mahalingam said he added that the jatropha crop is also free of the stigma of deforestation that is attached to palm oil mr mahalingam said the biodiesel industry could start consolidating in three to five years as rising raw materials costs and shrinking margins put small independent producers under pressure or even out of business "feedstock is crucial to the success of the business because it represents of the cost of production " mr mahalingam said "thats why we see palm oil as just a stepping stone due to its abundant supply but ultimately we will replace it with jatropha " in malaysia perth based mission biofuels has a ton capacity biodiesel plant expected to start production in august and is building a ton capacity plant expected to be done in april the companys interest in jatropha is part of an emerging trend among global biodiesel manufacturers to look for cheaper alternatives to palm oil south koreas eco solutions which also has a biodiesel plant in malaysia is growing jatropha in the philippines to reduce its dependence on palm oil mission biofuels has a five year contract to buy crude palm oil from agribusiness giant cargill and a corresponding five year contract to sell up to tons a year of biodiesel to european buyers for the longer term though mission biofuels plans to switch entirely to jatropha oil which is some cheaper than palm oil used mostly for frying and food manufacturing "if palm oil prices continue rising it will cause a squeeze on margins " mr mahalingam said "we have to move to another source of feedstock that has no food use by we hope to operate fully on jatropha "
