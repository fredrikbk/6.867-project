dubai puts a new spin on skyscrapers planned story rotating tower part of massive construction spree in skyscraper crazy dubai tall isnt enough in a design to be unveiled today in the oil rich emirate david fisher an italian israeli architect has dreamed up a story combination hotel apartment and office tower where the floors would rotate degrees each floor would rotate independently creating a constantly changing architectural form each story of the tower would be shaped like a doughnut and be attached to a center core housing elevators emergency stairs and other utilities wind turbines placed in gaps between the doughnuts would generate electricity the doughnuts wont rotate fast enough to give guests upset stomachs a single rotation would take around minutes "its quite slow " says mr fisher mr fishers isnt the first plan for a rotating tower in dubai last year a local developer showed off plans for a story unit condominium tower that would rotate one revolution per day solar panels would drive the rotation mechanism it is hard to say whether the plans are simply rotating pies in the sky or projects that will actually be erected but given what has been built in dubai already anything seems possible so long as oil prices remain high dubai has become a playpen for architects where the deep pockets of oil rich developers drive some of the most eccentric building projects in the world there is an artificial archipelago shaped like a map of the world and an underwater luxury hotel there is also an indoor ski slope a sail shaped hotel and a fake chain of islands in the form of a palm frond dotted with homes some see outlandish designs like these as a sign of an architectural apocalypse "it makes me ill " says eugene kohn principal at new york based kohn pedersen fox a firm recognized for handsome modernist albeit stationary designs "some of these buildings are going to the absurd " dubais building spree is powered by massive government investment and money pouring in from individual investors from around the middle east especially people looking to park their oil wealth in real estate the countrys ruling family led by sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum realizes its oil will someday run out and wants to create a viable financial foundation for future generations by creating a commercial and recreational capital for the middle east "the ruler of dubai he encourages us to grab the things that are super and unique in the world " says mohammed jardali general director of mejren cos the lead developer "thats why we are going after the thing that will be a landmark and unique in the world " the developer is a group including sheikh mejren bin sultans mejren group kriston co a developer based in athens and gowealthy a dubai real estate marketing company "we call it dynamic architecture " says mr fisher who says it will rise for a mere &# million and will make an outsized profit to boot "it can be sold for at least premium because it will be an iconic building a landmark " he says mr fisher predicts construction will start in six months and be complete months after that mejren cos s mr jardali says terrorism isnt an issue for the developers "dubai is the safest place in the world it is very peaceful so we are not thinking about such a thing " he says mr fisher dismisses the earlier unveiled effort at rotational architecture "the other tower is just a cylinder that turns around itself very slowly over a week but nothing happens to the shape " the architect of the other tower james abbott of hong kong based p&amp t group confirms that his tower will rotate just once a week "we are doing it for just purely functional reasons not gimmicky " he says "the idea is for people to have degree views " he says he and the developer dubai property ring will submit final applications to local authorities in the next two weeks the proposed spinning towers follow a quiet campaign to build the tallest building in the world again in dubai code named "the burj " or simply the tower the story one kilometer tall feet spire would beat out the currently under construction burj dubai which is slated to hit around feet when complete in the taller burj would be built by nakheel properties in dubai a spokesman declined to comment other than saying it is planning a "large tower " the burj dubai designed by chicago architects skidmore owings &amp merrill for emaar properties will be a hotel and condominium and is expected to reach more than feet taller than new yorks empire state building the current tallest building in the world is taipei in taiwan it reaches feet carol willis founder of the skyscraper museum in new york which is about to mount a show on dubai is optimistic "the future plans seem to be grounded on a substantial and intelligent plan on inventing a new city " she said she cites the massive government investment in infrastructure and the rock bottom labor costs as making these projects possible mr fisher years old was born in tel aviv he moved to florence for graduate school and became an italian citizen his early projects include the never built design for a plaza near jerusalems wailing wall his claim to fame is the development of the "leonardo da vinci smart bathrooms " a prefabricated bathroom system that hotels and resorts use to quickly build new facilities mr fisher says he got the tower idea while looking at condominiums for sale in miami several years ago he noticed the much lower price tags for units without water views ten days later in new york a friend boasted that hers was the only unit in her high rise with views of both the hudson river and the east river "this is when i got my click " he says he jotted down his idea and applied for a patent in the u s in he has never designed a high rise building but he has assembled a formidable design team however including high rise engineer leslie robertson who is best known for designing the innovative structure of the world trade centers twin towers that were destroyed by terrorists on sept "its not rocket science " says mr robertson of the buildings structure "its a basic structural core a concrete silo and the doughnuts that wander around to me its largely an amount of craftsmanship a matter of putting it together in thoughtful way so its constructed quickly reliably and with low ongoing maintenance costs " he says supplying electricity to the floors will be similar to how a moving train captures power by staying in constant contact with a power source in the case of a train an overhead wire or third rail occupants on the top five floors would control the direction and speed by voice activated remote control the other floors would be programmed by the architect or building manager the plumbing is more of a challenge "we have good people working on that " says mr robertson the architect and prefabricated bathroom expert mr fisher also demurs about how the toilets will flush "i cant disclose all the details " mr fisher says
