vertex backers await drug trial a decade after scientists at vertex pharmaceuticals inc mapped out a key structure of the hepatitis c virus the company is at a critical juncture in its effort to sell a new drug for the disease the biotechnology company saturday will report results from a midstage patient trial of its experimental drug telaprevir the presentation at a european medical conference will shed light on whether the drug is effective and safe enough to win regulatory approval to treat hepatitis c a liver ailment vertexs backers on wall street think telaprevir could be a blockbuster if it reaches the market giving the cambridge mass company its first home run since it was formed in assuming a launch of the drug cibc analyst brian abrahams predicts annual sales of more than &# billion by or nearly times vertexs current revenue sales and profits would be shared with johnson &amp johnson which last year agreed to help develop and market telaprevir positive study data for telaprevir on saturday and at another medical meeting in the fall could give vertex shares a life after a run up last year the stock price has sagged trading recently around &# off some from its week high of &# in late november as of p m composite trading on the nasdaq stock market the stock closed up cents at &# vertex shares have weakened amid worries that rival companies experimental hepatitis c drugs will pose a formidable challenge as well as recent data showing side effects associated with telaprevir the shares could fall further if telaprevirs study results are disappointing the company has no current product sales its revenue comes from research collaborations and royalties from glaxosmithkline plc for sales of an hiv drug that vertex helped develop the company isnt profitable while some analysts are wary bulls think the stocks long term prospects are good even if shares become volatile this year as new study data are released "if you come out with a really breakthrough drug in this market youre going to have a several billion dollar drug " said sven borho general partner at orbimed advisors llc in new york which owns about million vertex shares he predicts the stock could rebound to the s if new telaprevir data are positive about four million americans are infected with hepatitis c which is typically spread through contact with infected blood and can lead to cirrhosis and cancer of the liver standard treatment is a combination of the drugs pegylated interferon and ribavirin schering plough corp and roche holding ag sell competing versions of the drugs they can effectively wipe out the virus in about half the people taking them but the other half still have the virus after completing treatment vertex made a splash in when it published the structure of an enzyme known as protease which helps the hepatitis c virus replicate telaprevir an oral drug taken every eight hours is designed to inhibit the protease and stop the virus from replicating vertex is studying telaprevir in three phase trials in north america and europe an interim analysis of one trial showed of patients taking telaprevir together with standard therapy had undetectable levels of hepatitis c virus at weeks of treatment versus on standard therapy alone however a higher rate of telaprevir users discontinued treatment due to side effects such as rashes and anemia the real test for any effective treatment is whether it can eliminate detectable levels of the virus months after the therapy ends at saturdays conference in barcelona spain vertex will present data to liver specialists showing what percentage of a patient group had undetectable levels of the virus three months after completing week of therapy wall streets expectations for the results vary susquehanna international group llp analyst jason kolbert expects data to show of patients had no detectable traces of the virus weeks after therapy "we think percent or better would be positive for the stock " mr kolbert said "if its less than that its going to be negative for the stock " john alam vertexs chief medical officer cautioned against over analyzing the week follow up data he said its from a small group of patients and its just one piece of the puzzle another piece will come later from a study testing the effect of dropping ribavirin from the therapy mr alam said vertex will use these data to help design a phase trial that could begin later this year and to help decide the timing of its application with the u s food and drug administration later this year vertex may release data on sustained viral response at weeks the gold standard for effectiveness the rate for the current standard therapy at weeks is about vertex has indicated it would like to see a telaprevir based regimen with a rate of at least to if the drug reaches market cibc expects vertex to charge at least &# per treatment course vertex declined to comment on pricing the cost of current standard therapy ranges from &# to &# competition looms however schering plough is developing a hepatitis c protease inhibitor as is intermune inc in collaboration with roche some vertex watchers say intermunes candidate appears to be the stronger potential rival but its at an earlier stage of development "in theory theyre very promising but we have to understand the drugs were seeing now in clinical development are first generat ion drugs " said jean michel pawlotsky professor of medicine at the university of paris who is involved in studies of both telaprevir and schering ploughs drug "improvements will be necessary "
