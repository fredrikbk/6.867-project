best of the law blog excerpts from recent entries at wsj coms law blog claims of legal malpractice become new thorn for firms big law firms are mostly in the business of keeping others out of trouble not themselves but some practitioners who defend law firms are seeing an uptrend in legal malpractice claims "the profession has become more like a business " says philip touitou of hinshaw &amp culbertson llp in new york "now that firms have big revenues theyre now seen by the plaintiffs bar as viable targets " last week alone offered up two high profile examples each stemming from soured business deals consummated back around on april a minnesota federal judge ordered that dorsey &amp whitney llp disgorge about &# in fees and expenses arising out of problems related to an indian casino project in the late s according to the ruling an investment bank hired dorsey to document loans used to finance the construction of a casino the company that managed the casino defaulted on the loans and a dispute later ensued in bankruptcy court last week u s district court judge donovan frank partially upheld a bankruptcy court ruling related to claims against dorsey for malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty "we disagree with judge franks adverse rulings and will appeal " dorsey said in a statement adding that the firm rejects "the suggestion that dorsey failed a client " also on april charter communications inc filed a lawsuit against irell &amp manella llp accusing the los angeles based firm of committing "critical errors" in completing a cable tv acquisition the lawsuit alleges among other claims legal malpractice and requests damages of &# million charters suit filed in federal court in santa ana calif also claims that irell concealed its mistakes for as many as nine months in after learning about them irell has long represented charter a st louis based cable company controlled by billionaire paul allen "if charter suffered any loss at all our firm was not the cause " david gindler a partner at irell said in a statement "we are confident that we will prevail as the whole story emerges in court " incorrect pcs one of the discussions roiling the halls of law schools has more to do with technology than torts whether students should be allowed to use their laptop computers during class a recent naysayer georgetown law professor david cole the author of a washington post op ed on the topic that appeared last week among mr coles rationales for banning laptops in his classroom they encourage rote transcription which hurts classroom discussions and students too often email and web surf when they should be paying attention after much debate harvard law school agreed not to adopt a firm policy on laptops rather the professor of each class makes the call john palfrey a harvard law professor allows them "i dont say anything about it and on the first day every single student has a laptop open " he says mr palfrey teaches courses on technology and law and finds laptops and the ability to use the internet "hugely constructive " still the devices have downsides "there are times when youll be talking about something very serious like the importance of democracy and someone will break out in laughter " he says "thats a bit disconcerting " readers weighed in with their opinions on the topic wrote one "im writing this from class right now bored out of my mind if teachers would teach better and there were consequences to my not paying attention then i wouldnt be reading this right now " vonage er roger warin the chairman of steptoe &amp johnson llp in washington d c says that even after years of trying cases he gets a gnawing in his stomach whenever he presents an argument in court but last friday with the fate of his client vonage holdings corp in the hands of a virginia federal judge mr warin says his adrenaline was flowing a bit more than usual that morning the court had ruled against vonage ordering the internet phone company to cease signing up new customers unless it stopped infringing patents held by verizon communications inc though the ruling didnt shut down service to existing customers mr warin said it still amounted to a death blow "its the difference of cutting off oxygen as opposed to the bullet in the head " he told the judge to no avail instead of packing it in for the weekend mr warin and his team immediately appealed the ruling "if you looked at press reports around noon on friday they said vonage enjoined from taking new customers " said mr warin "having that headline up over the weekend wouldve been very corrosive to the company " late friday a federal appeals court granted vonage a temporary stay on the lower court ruling until it decides how to move forward mr warin years old called the day extraordinarily intense "it was a roller coaster ride " he says "i had both the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat in the same day " as an aside we asked what he thinks of his clients ubiquitous internet pop up ads that clutter our desktop "you mean those lovely wonderful entertaining engaging pop up ads " responded mr warin ever the advocate "those are the ones that youre talking about right " jerrys choice jerry crawford runs the crawford law firm a four lawyer boutique in des moines iowa but the trial lawyer is better known as something of a good luck charm for democratic presidential hopefuls in the hawkeye state having chaired or co chaired the last five iowa campaigns for the eventual nominee so the question the clinton edwards and obama campaigns are all asking whom will mr crawford support in mr crawford initially threw his weight behind old friend tom vilsack the former iowa governor shortly after he dropped out in february mr vilsack joined hillary clintons camp through a spokeswoman yesterday mr crawford said he still hasnt decided whom to support "its safe to say ive talked to most of the candidates " mr crawford said in february as he fielded inquiries he added "im not the story " but iowans say mr crawford is very much part of the story david yepsen longtime columnist at the des moines register said mr crawford is a powerful fund raiser and savvy strategist who knows how to run a successful iowa presidential campaign "he is a trial lawyer so he has an affinity for edwards " adds mr yepsen "but hes also a pragmatic politician and is impressed by obama and of course he has longtime ties to the clintons " nathan koppel and ashby jones contributed to this article
