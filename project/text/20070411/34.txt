corporate focus business starwoods early checkout mystery what makes a man walk away from &# million that is the question that still hangs over steven heyer who resigned last week as chief executive of starwood hotels &amp resorts and voluntarily abandoned that much in severance and stock based compensation the wall street journal reported saturday the resignation was precipitated by an anonymous letter accusing mr heyer of creating a hostile workplace a follow up investigation uncovered emails that included what a person familiar with the situation said were "provocative conversations inappropriate for a ceo " mr heyer denies the most serious accusations and says the letter may have been sent by someone passed over for promotion he says he abandoned his severance package without a fight because "life is too short " really forgive me for thinking there may be more to this story and if there is starwood shareholders have a right to know about it consider this mr heyers employment contract says he can be fired without severance for a limited number of reasons such as being convicted of a felony or a crime involving "moral turpitude fraud or embezzlement " or being guilty of "gross negligence or willful misconduct " boorish behavior isnt mentioned moreover legal precedent leans in his favor other departing ceos with similar contracts have successfully challenged boards that tried to deny them severance the most striking example is former massmutual life insurance co ceo robert oconnell a hundred page report prepared for the massmutual board in june and made public for the first time late last month provided an extraordinary portrait of mr oconnells time at the top the report focused on the most egregious examples of mr oconnells alleged self dealing his manipulation of a supplemental compensation account in which he earned about &# million making trades he couldnt have made in the open market and his purchase of a company condo at a noncompetitive price it also is filled with eyewitness accounts of inappropriate behavior with certain female employees including one whom he promoted to general counsel giving her responsibility for oversight of his questionable actions yet in spite of this cornucopia of evidence an arbitration panel concluded massmutual didnt have adequate cause to fire mr oconnell without severance subsequent court rulings have upheld the arbitrators decision mr oconnell always has argued his firing was unfairly handled by massmutuals board "as public policy the arbitrators decision is close to the worst possible outcome you could ask for " says stanford law professor joseph grundfest who testified for massmutual in the case "even if a board of directors finds the ceo has been playing fast and loose with his own financial accounts thats not sufficient grounds for termination for cause " of course even if mr heyer thought he could win a legal case he might face the risk of public humiliation that is what happened to julie roehm the advertising executive fired recently by wal mart stores when ms roehm decided to sue wal mart responded with a countersuit that included intimate detail of ms roehms alleged misdeeds among its revelations was an email from ms roehm to a married subordinate which read "i miss you ridiculously how about that i hate not being able to call you or write you i think about us together all the time little moments like watching your face when you kiss me " in a statement ms roehm said the emails were "taken way out of context " and charged that the folks at wal mart "did not like following the advice of a woman " by all accounts history is filled with examples of boards that have had good reason to fire a ceo without severance but have chosen to pay instead directors do it because it is the easy way out avoiding an uphill court fight and a nasty public brawl besides it isnt their money cases in which a departing ceo voluntarily leaves so much money on the table however are much rarer mr heyer says he wanted to "walk away from this job with my head held high " but you cant help but wonder is he hiding something perhaps the case against mr heyer is even stronger than the case against mr oconnell and therefore not worth fighting or perhaps mr heyer is willing to pay &# million to avoid the kind of public flogging that ms roehm experienced either way starwoods shareholders may wonder whether something has happened here that they as the companys owners deserve to know about and the folks at lazard the financial firm on whose board mr heyer sits might be curious too i asked spokeswoman judi frost mackey whether lazard was looking into the circumstances of mr heyers departure from starwood her response "no comment "
