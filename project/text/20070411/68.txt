most affordable housing in new orleans is in jeopardy builders with tax credits conclude many projects lack economic viability developers awarded federal tax credits to build affordable housing in post katrina new orleans are concluding that many of the projects arent financially feasible and are unlikely to get built before the governments deadline after hurricane katrina destroyed more than low and moderate income rental units in the federal government substantially increased louisianas tax credit allocation giving the state &# million in low income housing tax credits specifically for hurricane ravaged areas under the terms of the agreement the developers must be ready to rent the units by the end of or lose crucial financial benefits that could help push their projects along but according to the louisiana housing finance agency about of the projects that were awarded tax credits are in jeopardy because developers cant get them off the ground some private developers say the number of projects in jeopardy is much higher perhaps as much as "its a dire situation " says milton bailey president of the housing agency "it means a lot of teachers carpenters firemen and mailmen every day kind of people wont be able to come home its a tragedy on top of a tragedy " developers of affordable housing typically finance construction with a combination of conventional debt tax exempt mortgage revenue bonds and from cash from selling tax credits to investors but the cost of construction and insurance along the gulf coast has risen so high that the traditional forms of financing arent sufficient creating what developers call a "financing gap " for example developers estimate that the per unit cost to build a new two bedroom apartment averages about &# up since hurricane katrina hit meanwhile insurance costs have gone up as much as the problem is that developers dont believe they can charge enough rent to offset the gap and make a profit median incomes in louisiana are &# some below the national average "a very low income population is only going to be able to afford low rents so if you have high development costs youre going to have a disconnect " says nicolas retsinas director of harvard universitys joint center for housing studies "developers of affordable housing will lose money on nearly every single project in new orleans " says ghebre selassie mehreteab chief executive of nhp foundation in washington one of the nations largest nonprofit owners of low income housing nhp one of the few developers that has actually broken ground on developments in new orleans received &# million in annual tax credits for the units it is in the process of rehabbing and rebuilding it plans to build affordable housing units costing &# million in the gulf coast region but mr mehreteab says the groups developments are economically feasible only because the organization received &# million in philanthropic grants for post katrina construction including &# million from the state of qatar &# million from the ford foundation and &# million from freddie mac and the freddie mac foundation mr mehreteab has been outspoken about the need to fill the "financing gap" by adding soft loans and grants from philanthropic sources "low income tax credits are essential but fall short " he says the tax credit program was created in developers are awarded the tax credits and in turn sell them to investors often financial institutions which receive a dollar for dollar reduction in federal taxes over years although all of the &# million in tax credits plus an additional &# million for louisiana have been awarded only of the proposed units have started construction "there are many different levels of complications and risks in doing a tax credit deal in a disaster area " says andy kopplin executive director of the louisiana recovery authority which makes recommendations on expenditure allocations "that is making many investors nervous " some of the construction problems associated with disaster areas higher building costs shortages of supplies and materials difficulty in locating land owners and the reality of a crush of people applying for building permits harold foley a developer of affordable housing based in alpharetta ga was scheduled to begin construction on a unit multifamily development in new orleans last july but the project was stalled in part because mr foley had trouble selling the tax credits to investors some of whom wondered whether the development was viable some investors also questioned whether enough people will return to louisiana to fill up the new developments "were forging ahead without any real sort of reliable data so its been hard to convince investors to lend their dollars here " says mr foley who is finally set to begin construction on his &# million complex next month the louisiana housing finance agency has been trying to convince congress to extend the dec deadline requiring units built using tax credits to be ready for renters an extension has passed in the house but is being reviewed by the senate in addition the louisiana recovery authority has allocated nearly &# million of federal community development block grants which funds such activities as infrastructure development and housing to supplement the tax credit "i think between those two weve saved a number of affordable housing projects that would have collapsed because investors felt they were too risky " says mr kopplin
