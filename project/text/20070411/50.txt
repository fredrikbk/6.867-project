fdas position on new drugs may hurt mercks arcoxia bid washington the food and drug administration said proposed prescription painkillers should fill an unmet medical need for patients who have no other "relatively safer" alternatives suggesting merck &amp co s bid to have a vioxx like successor drug approved in the u s faces a tough road the fdas view was outlined in a march memo posted on the agencys web site ahead of a meeting tomorrow of outside medical experts who are being asked to weigh in on whether the agency should approve arcoxia the merck drug falls into the same class as vioxx which was widely used to treat arthritis and other painful conditions vioxx was pulled off the market in september after it was linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes and in the fda asked pfizer inc to pull bextra off the market pfizer was allowed to keep its other so called cox painkiller celebrex on the market with warnings arcoxia is on the market in countries and merck said the drug would provide another treatment option for arthritis patients in the u s who cant tolerate other pain medications the fdas arthritis advisory panel will vote tomorrow on whether it thinks the agency should approve arcoxia as a treatment for osteoarthritis the agency is expected to render a decision on arcoxia by the end of the month indeed the fda directly acknowledged in its memo that the vioxx withdrawal has increased scrutiny from "all quarters" on cardiovascular risks associated with cox s and other prescription pain drugs the agency said the approval of a new cox product "must be undertaken with due care and caution " the fda said it now assumes all prescription nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids which include ibuprofen and naproxen carry an increased risk of cardiovascular problems drugs such as celebrex and arcoxia which also fall into the broader nsaid class are designed to block the cox enzyme in order to relieve pain without causing as many stomach problems as other nsaids that also block the cox enzyme however the agency said the overall benefit of cox drugs in reducing serious gastrointestinal bleeding "remains uncertain " the fda said only celebrex has been shown to reduce serious gastrointestinal bleeds in regard to arcoxia the fda appeared to agree with mercks conclusion that the cardiovascular risks of arcoxia were similar when compared to an older nsaid diclofenac the two drugs were studied in three trials the studies found that patients on arcoxia suffered fewer upper gastrointestinal problems like ulcers however the fda said the rate wasnt statistically significant the fda said "a new product that appears to have an increased overall risk profile for cv disease particularly beyond that seen with other drugs would not be appropriate for marketing unless the product fills an unmet medical need for a particular patient population that has no relatively safer approved products available to them and provides a reasonable risk to benefit balance for that population "
