please give the government your wealth its for your own good andrea batista schlesingers april letter to the editor "success itself not money is a begetter of happiness " on wealth creation was a wonder of irrational thought she would "not want to begrudge any american the opportunity to create his or her own wealth " but she does begrudge their power to decide what to do with their hard earned estate in the manner of most liberals she wants to take their money for their own good being concerned the money would redound to unsuspecting heirs who would be deprived of earning wealth on their own consequently she supports a "healthy estate tax" because otherwise the money would not be spent where she and the government decide is best god forbid those obviously clueless creators of great wealth should be allowed to make their own decisions stuart j wagner centennial colo ms schlesinger endorses a "healthy estate tax" and coyly refers to how through it we "allow todays billionaires to do precisely what they have the willingness to do give it away " the word is not "allow " it is "compel " which we do through harnessing the police powers of government how is it that we not only robustly tax billionaires throughout their lives but impose a death tax on that from which the government has already received its "cut" what if an individual does not want to give away any more of his money why should those like ms schlesinger have the right to stick their long arms into the graves of decedents oren m spiegler upper saint clair pa ms schlesinger supports a high estate tax with the logic that billionaires usually are self made and give their money away anyway i wont debate whether that is true or not but it is theirs to give away not the governments does she really believe that the bloated self dealing pork stuffing politicians who make up our government would use this newfound money for anything else but serving their own self interests i would much rather read about warren buffett donating his billions to the gates foundation where there is accountability kenneth schnoll mahwah n j
