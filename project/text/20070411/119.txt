trade group saw possible conflicts in student loans board vetoed bid to curb lender gifts to colleges concern about overkill well before recent conflict of interest allegations cast a shadow on the student loan business the trade group for college aid officers considered setting clear rules to curb gifts from lenders and decided against it in a task force within the national association of student financial aid administrators sensed a need to keep tabs on ties between aid officers and the lenders in hot pursuit of student loan business yet these lenders are also an important source of revenue and manpower for the association itself underwriting its national conference and showering college aid officials who attend with perks that include broadway shows pricey restaurant meals and private access to tourist attractions with congress in the midst of revising higher education laws the task force in urged the groups board to propose a federal law making lenders publicly report gifts valued at more than &# "we were inclined to believe that a little bit of sunshine probably modifies behavior " says karen fooks director of student financial affairs at the university of florida and a task force member but in the associations board rejected recommending the restriction in a vote that many members of the association which encompasses some post secondary institutions never knew took place to some of its members and outside critics nasfaas failure to take a stand against gifts suggests the organization has become too cozy with banks and loan companies vying for business in the &# billion student loan market "i think they are too much in bed with the lenders " says eileen oleary the director of student aid and finance at stonehill college in easton mass and a member of the task force that recommended cutting back on gifts "the policies they put in place are influenced by the money they get " despite the rash of conflict allegations nasfaa officials are currently objecting to a u s department of education proposal that would require colleges to list at least three loan companies as preferred lenders in a bid to guard against inducements by a company seeking a schools exclusive designation as its lender of choice a counterproposal from a panel headed by larry zaglaniczny nasfaas director of congressional relations would let colleges list just one preferred lender as long as students are told they have other options nasfaas annual conference highlights the extent of its financial links to the industry the group lists sponsorship opportunities for its june meeting in washington from the rights to print company names on pens for &# to hosting daily "beverage breaks" at which lenders hand out drinks in cups emblazoned with their logos last year dozens of student lenders spent at least &# on sponsorship exhibitor and advertising fees charles bruce senior director of financial aid at oklahoma state university and a past chairman of the trade group said nasfaa needs to cut ties to the loan industry "we have to wean ourselves from that cash cow " he says the growing controversy stems from new york attorney general andrew cuomos allegations that lenders improperly offer inducements to schools and aid officers in return for steering them business if true colleges might be recommending lenders that dont offer students the most competitive interest rates or lowest fees eight schools including the university of pennsylvania new york university and syracuse university have settled with mr cuomo over payments he regards as kickbacks among the items he cites are trips to pebble beach calif and the caribbean and shares in a lending company at low insider prices yesterday widener university in chester pa announced it is putting its dean of financial aid walter c cathie on administrative leave mr cuomo has accused mr cathie of running a company that accepted &# from one lender cit group inc s student loan xpress unit that appeared on wideners list of recommended lenders mr cathie couldnt be reached for comment capella university a for profit school in minneapolis also said yesterday it is putting its financial aid director timothy c lehmann on leave mr lehmann received &# in consulting payments from student loan xpress the school said earlier it defended mr lehmann saying the companys preferred lender status wasnt influenced by the payments nasfaa president dallas martin last month accused mr cuomo of using "inflammatory rhetoric" and chided him for using the word "kickback" to describe arrangements in which some universities received "revenue sharing" payments from lenders based on a percentage of loan volumes referred by the schools but when asked whether some abuses singled out by mr cuomo might have been avoided if the nasfaa board had approved guidelines to police gifts from lenders he said "i think it would have " as for the opposition to making colleges list at least three preferred lenders mr martin said some schools have been able to strike very favorable terms for their students with one lender and dont see a need to add companies to their list last week mr zaglaniczny said on a network news report that mr cuomo "is part of the problem i think his inflammatory rhetoric in the media lumping all schools in america as rotten apples has not helped " the trade groups declared mission is to support financial aid professionals at colleges universities and career schools the association says it "represents the interests of students and financial aid administrators to the congress the department of education and other regulatory agencies " but the trade group also opens its ranks to banks and other lenders lending company officials serve as the president of three state associations of financial aid administrators mr martin says the relationship with lending companies doesnt influence the groups policy decisions he said industry members cant serve on the national board or vote on policy or membership issues he called their participation in the organization "healthy " and said "we learn from them " mr martin confirms the association board rejected the measure to require reporting of gifts exceeding &# as well as a subsequent effort to set guidelines for interactions between lenders and college administrators he said the guidelines included a warning against "quid pro quos" where college officials receive a personal financial benefit in exchange for putting a loan company on its preferred lender list according to an internal nasfaa document discussing the board reaction to the gift reporting proposal "much concern was expressed about this issue " some board members considered the measure "micromanagement and overkill " and argued that there should be a distinction between "gifts that provide an institutional benefit versus a personal benefit " one place where the relationship between the association and the lending industry is especially symbiotic

lenders took college officials to broadway shows another group of college officials was wined and dined at the rainbow room atop rockefeller center when the event was in new orleans lenders rented the local aquarium so college officers could visit free of charge mr martin says he would like to curb those practices and is considering proposals to restrict them at the event dr bruce of oklahoma state said several states own associations are even more dependent on lender contributions and allow loan company executives greater influence in their operations "we have to remove any doubt about who we
