kentridges visual technology makes mozarts fantasy a reality the magic flute brooklyn academy of music through friday brooklyn n y many visual artists including marc chagall david hockney and julie taymor have tackled mozarts "the magic flute " the most recent to do so is william kentridge the south african artist whose production is now on at the brooklyn academy of music he designed this "flute" with sabine theunissen using his distinctive style of video animated charcoal drawing and directed it as well the show which originated at de munt la monnaie the royal opera house of belgium is a fascinating look at what very sophisticated visual technology can bring to a stage performance "flute" is a fairy tale the prince tamino sets off to rescue the princess pamina and learns wisdom along the way and its fantastic places and creatures can be hard to create using conventional theatrical means a video artist like mr kentridge is less constrained by the limitations of physical scenery his basic stage canvas is made of drops and flats painted with black and white images that refer to early th century production designs for the opera soft focus images of egyptian temples and palm trees and rocky crags on those he projects his animated drawings some small scale some encompassing the entire stage a single curved line becomes a bird which suddenly turns its head and then flies away planets circle in their orbits the queen of the night is accompanied by reeling cascading stars also a reference to that th century "flute" as characters travel upstage the room seems to move toward the audience the vanishing point of its perspective drawing closer in color this might be a little much but all the "flute" images are black and white which gives them a rigorous intensity as well as making them lively and engaging one basis of the production is the idea of an early camera many of the images look like negatives and lines are drawn to show how images are constructed from light the three ladies have an old fashioned box camera and one of them creates the serpent that frightens tamino by waving a hand in front of it scenes like monastatoss assault on pamina are introduced with images that look like old movies performed with actors in silhouette accompanied by a tinny piano some of the action appears to be happening inside the camera in the final scene a huge eye also a masonic image regular "flute" iconography stares in from the rear as if through the view finder mr kentridge uses several recurring motifs the wisdom of sarastro and the priests of the temple is represented by images of order geometry optics astronomy and of course masonic symbols by contrast for the queen of the night planetary orbits dissolve into chaos papageno the common man naturally has birds both caged and free some images were funny a rhinoceros dancing to taminos flute a lion and then a guillotine appearing on one of the omnipresent blackboards to frighten papageno with video taminos journey and the dark places in the temple where he undergoes his trials are very frightening and dangerous when he sings hopelessly of the endless night we feel it along with him fire and water actually surround tamino and pamina in their final ordeals at the end they are engulfed in the brightness of the sun the relationship between the images and the singers was mixed however one never felt that mr kentridge was deliberately calling attention to the visuals at the expense of the opera indeed some arias such as paminas "ach ich fuhls " had no video accompaniment at all but sometimes the singers seemed to be illuminating the video rather than vice versa this was partly the direction "flute" usually plays up the contrast between the grand and the mundane the formality of sarastro and the terrifying hysteria of the queen are very different from papagenos insistence on food drink and girls but mr kentridges stage direction had a very informal and colloquial style and everyone seemed part of the same species the noble tamino was a little goofy and sarastro a little pretentious even sweet papageno had a dark side his bird calling pipes were actually a flask indeed mr kentridge suggests that perhaps sarastros much vaunted wisdom isnt so all encompassing after all one of the cleverest bits came in the papageno papagena duet at the end the two "common" characters flanking a blackboard got to teach a lesson too as bird after bird emerged from an egg papageno and papagena dont usually participate in the final triumphal scene in the temple of wisdom yet in this version they were there an endorsement of the value of simple love and family this was not a show about great voices the best of the principals was tenor jeremy ovenden a sweet toned tamino others were fair and milagros poblador the queen of the night sounded good only in the very top extension of her range conductor piers maxim set extremely speedy tempos which kept everything moving but skimped on the grandeur and there was one stage pit train wreck in act ii greta goris designed the handsome edwardian style costumes which introduced a colonial motif without clashing with the monochromatic palette of the scenery jennifer tiptons lighting enhanced mr kentridges work mr kentridges version of monteverdis "il ritorno dulisse in patria " seen here three years ago was more unconventional the "actors" were huge puppets animated by puppeteers and voiced by singers in that production the combination of music theater and video decor worked more seamlessly integrating humans completely into the mix is a tougher job but certainly worth pursuing the technological advances that make such events possible olga neuwirths opera "lost highway " performed by the oberlin conservatory at miller theater in new york is another recent example open remarkable vistas for opera production it will be interesting to see what mr kentridge does with his next opera project shostakovichs "the nose " scheduled for the metropolitan opera in ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
