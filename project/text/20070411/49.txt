electric attraction for europes utilities a frenzied power grab as deregulation nears bids top &# billion will consumers benefit madrid with more than &# billion of deals proposed in the past two years europes giant utilities have one of the worlds biggest cases of merger mania just yesterday two european companies culminated a messy battle and agreed to a &# billion bid for spains endesa sa behind all the deals is a big collision between europes new push for a unified marketplace and the national pride of europes politicians starting july the european unions power sector will be officially flung open to competition allowing utility companies from any of the blocs member nations to sell electricity in any other by unshackling the energy sector european regulators hoped to boost competition and lay the foundation for stronger growth on the continent they wanted to inject the continents electricity marketplace with new players that would spur cheaper energy prices but that vision has bumped up against a messy reality politicians in european capitals are reluctant to loosen their grip on the state run national champions that dominate strategic sectors rather than invest in new capacity transmission lines and other upgrades the dominant players have instead been bulking up for a wave of mergers big utilities are scrambling to buy up assets from bulgaria to scotland in a mad dash to get bigger when the deregulatory rules come into full effect last year paris rushed a merger between french utility suez sa and gaz de france sa though the pact has hit legal and political hurdles and the outcome is unclear earlier this year two midsize power companies in the netherlands essent nv and nuon nv said they would tie the knot spains iberdrola sa will complete its &# billion friendly takeover of scottish power plc in the united kingdom this month making it the worlds biggest marketer of renewable energy sources such as wind power some are worried that the huge private players will simply replace the old state owned monopolies creating a new breed of corporate titan "we could end up going full circle with a handful of megaliths" dominating the sector says malcolm keay head electricity researcher at oxford energy institute in the u k "it could end up being just like the old preliberalization days " "the commission is aware that what weve done so far is hardly perfect " european energy commissioner andris piebalgs one of the architects of the policy conceded in february in madrid the merger and acquisition spree he says is "not the kind of activity id prefer to see " the fight over endesa shows the new dynamics at work a once sleepy power firm endesa was cobbled together out of a host of tiny spanish utilities two decades ago it was privatized at the end of the s but was never particularly well managed its share price profits and ambitions lagged behind its peers still the utility sits in the catbird seat in spain europes fastest growing electricity market with large latin american operations as well as power businesses in france italy and poland it was ripe for an ambush so two years ago when spanish utility executive salvador gabarro announced he was launching a hostile offer for spains reigning utility power he could barely contain his enthusiasm as the gas natural sdg sa chairman unveiled a &# billion bid for rival endesa he boasted that the company had planted an important seed "in nine months the creature will be born " he said though endesas executives frowned on the deal mr gabarro knew he could count on government support spain wanted to marry the two leading energy companies to create a gas and electricity giant that could go hunting across europe once the eu rules took hold the goal was to quickly grow in size in order to eventually get even bigger endesas longtime chairman manuel pizarro vowed to fight the deal several days after mr gabarros boast mr pizarro thundered to reporters on a visit to his native region of aragon that it was not a deal of mutual consent and that the "aggressor" had to be stopped he insisted endesa was worth at least twice as much as gas natural was offering "when you start a battle in a hostile fashion the answer is going to come in the same style " he railed he also lashed out at fellow utility iberdrola which had signed a deal with gas natural to carve up endesas assets after the proposed takeover but five months later in february of gas naturals bid for endesa was trumped by german giant e on ag which counterattacked with a &# billion all cash offer the german takeover attempt alarmed the spanish government which worked in earnest to block it the spanish government had supported the bid by barcelona based gas natural in part as a political favor to its coalition partners catalan separatists when german owned e on entered the picture the government was horrified plans for a super national champion were under attack and spains biggest power company stood to end up in foreign hands for more than a year madrid did everything in its power to sink the germans at one point the spanish market regulator even chimed in ordering endesa to remain passive and not fight the hostile gas natural bid still e on was determined europes largest publicly traded utility and germanys biggest company by market capitalization it was under shareholder pressure to do something with its cash pile of &# billion it had accumulated the stash from major divestments and its dominance of the largest electricity market in europe madrid quickly began battening down the hatches to fight the german offer arguing that spain had the right to defend a strategic sector such as electricity even if it meant a showdown with competition authorities in brussels to disarm foreigners the spanish government quickly rewrote its energy sector laws peppering rules with various technical changes and giving its energy regulator new powers the regulator in turn slapped a score of heavy conditions on e ons bid to cripple its advance "we run the risk of being called hicks but thats a risk im willing to take " proclaimed spains then industry minister jose montilla when he hastily rewrote the countrys energy laws last year to torpedo e ons bid for endesa last month the european unions executive body said it will take spain to court for repeatedly violating common market rules during the takeover battle other countries such as france have also armor plated their energy sectors to prevent foreign companies from buying their national champions the eu has investigated out of the member states for failing to gradually open up the sector when the eu demanded that spain explain why it kept breaking common market rules by blocking the german bid the government flippantly responded that it would answer "when it gets a chance " e on also counterattacked with a battery of lawsuits in spain brussels and new york where endesa adrs also trade in late september a year after the battle had begun a flashy spanish billionaire and blue blood business scion named jose manuel entrecanales orchestrated a so called "dusk raid" on endesa in the hours after the stock market closed he spent about &# billion to snatch up more than of endesas shares the next morning mr entrecanaless family controlled firm the construction to windmills conglomerate acciona sa was endesas biggest shareholder a stunned e on decided to counterattack jacking up its takeover offer by almost to &# billion endesa had become twice as costly in months without doing much to better its business the share price rise had become a boon for many small spanish investors and u s hedge funds and the ongoing battle for endesa became a staple of spanish nightly news things were about to get more interesting in mid february e on made an even higher bid for endesa during a live television broadcast just before midnight on feb spanish regulators sliced open an envelope to reveal e ons final offer &# a share or more than &# billion for endesa e on followed it up with a splashy news conference in madrid where it laid out its plans for the future of endesa with a triumphant air chief executive wulf bernotat detailed how endesa would become the german groups most profitable division and would make e on the worlds biggest utility but they had underestimated how strategically vital endesa had become in the rapidly consolidating european power sector rome had been anxious to find a way for its former monopoly enel spa to make a major acquisition to prevent it from being relegated to the second tier of european power companies in march enel spa spent roughly &# billion to snatch up a stake in endesa on the open market the move dashed e ons takeover hopes for the first time the german companys executives floated the idea of settling for a minority stake in endesa hoping to wrest control of the company later on then in a surprise move spains acciona and italys enel teamed up with the promise of their own joint offer for endesa at about &# a share for spain an italian interloper appeared better than a german one the spanish and italian governments both run by center left coalitions are much friendlier than madrid and berlin spanish officials were also able to claim a quasi victory since acciona the senior partner in the proposed endesa takeover is a big spanish company that would keep endesa nominally spanish despite the italian involvement by early april e on which had already spent more than &# million on the endesa deal retreated in a furious three day meeting it signed a peace pact with enel and acciona the germans would kill their bid if the victors would sell them some of the assets they would be forced to shed to satisfy regulators enels board gave the green light to proceed with the spanish italian deal yesterday the same day e ons bid formally expired the companies expect to make their formal bid by the end of the month but mr bernotat swore that the german power company would soon be back on the warpath as he conceded defeat at a news conference in madrid he warned "this isnt the last transaction consolidation is just beginning " chip cummins in london contributed to this article
