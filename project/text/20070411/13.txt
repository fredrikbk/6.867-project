banks court small businesses u s banks are aggressively wooing small businesses offering credit lines to young companies that in the past would have struggled to get loans banks are extending credit to start ups with practically no track records are accepting lower quality assets as collateral and are imposing fewer restrictive covenants on borrowers the result is that small businesses today enjoy nearly unprecedented access to capital a boon to entrepreneurs and the overall economy but the easy money is raising concerns that some banks have weakened their lending standards and could be on the hook for costly defaults if the economy cools "we do see some banks stretching on some deals from a credit perspective " said michael carbone chairman of small business banking at commerce bancorp inc in cherry hill n j "i dont think deals are getting priced to risk the way they were six or seven years ago " small businesses werent always a priority for banks bigger borrowers are more lucrative and lending to small businesses can be risky about one third go bust within two years of their inception and fail within four years according to the small business administration but banks have embraced smaller commercial borrowers hoping to rake in the low cost deposits they stash in checking accounts and eager to peddle lucrative wealth management products to their proprietors a year end survey by the national federation of independent businesses found that of small businesses that sought loans in the past three years successfully obtained them "credit availability has moved from a critical issue for many to an afterthought for most " the group concluded bank of america corp is one contributor to the phenomenon until recently the bank based in charlotte n c lent money only to businesses that had existed for at least two years but in august the nations largest retail bank started offering unsecured credit lines of up to &# to start ups "a small business owner in business for only one day could qualify " according to a bank of america press release at the time for loans under &# a small business doesnt have to provide financial records the goal is "to provide capital to businesses that we previously would have had a harder time providing capital to " said mark hogan head of small business banking at bank of america the bank is comfortable lending money to unproven businesses because it examines factors such as the owners personal credit score and how he or she uses other bank products mr hogan said "by no means are we out there recklessly providing capital " mr hogan said he wouldnt disclose the volume of these small loans or how the portfolio is performing banks such as wells fargo &amp co have long extended small unsecured credit lines to startup businesses without encountering serious problems with defaults but some bankers say the practice is risky "the failure rate of startups is extremely high " said kevin watters head of business banking at j p morgan chase &amp co chase avoids loans to businesses that are less than two years old and instead offers them credit cards the wider availability of loans to small businesses reflects the broader easing of credit standards amid a flood of capital worldwide the phenomenon helped fuel a boom in subprime mortgage lending and has supported the wave of buyout deals by private equity firms nobody is predicting that small business lending will produce the same problems seen in the subprime mortgage business where lax lending standards have led to a rash of early defaults but a rise in defaults by small businesses could dent banks profits "it could add to their losses and slow their earnings but wouldnt be crippling " said jeffrey brown a principal with deloitte consulting llp the impact might be tough to detect most banks include their small business portfolios in their broader consumer banking arms credit quality in those divisions reflects a diverse array of loans often including home and auto loans which have been souring at higher rates than small business loans still higher losses from small business lending would exacerbate the already worsening outlook for consumer credit quality "some institutions because of where interest rates are because theyre looking to get their volumes up they are taking on more risk " said christine barry a small business banking consultant at aite group llc "theyre just trying to get customers in any way they can " in addition to offering lower interest rates on potentially risky loans some banks also are growing lenient about what they accept as collateral said mr carbone the commerce bancorp executive banks traditionally required small businesses to secure loans with valuable assets like real estate today mr carbone said banks increasingly are accepting assets such as accounts receivable inventory and equipment that will produce less cash in a liquidation "were just not going to take that kind of risk " he said as a result he said "we probably lose some deals " more banks also are waiving requirements that businesses maintain certain amounts of cash on hand and keep financial ratios such as loans to assets below specific thresholds said patricia hines a senior bank analyst at towergroup a financial services consulting firm that is a unit of mastercard inc she said fewer banks today insist that small businesses agree not to seek additional loans from other banks a provision aimed at preventing borrowers from getting overextended so far the looser standards havent translated into higher defaults but ms hines said banks are relaxing loan terms that have given them some protection in the past "banks are lending to what would traditionally have been considered riskier borrowers " she said "it will be interesting to see if the economy weakens if that becomes a problem down the road "
