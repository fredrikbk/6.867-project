mccains finest hour these columns have had more than one disagreement with john mccain over the years especially on issues that typically win the arizona republican accolades from the rest of the media campaign finance reform global warming detainee interrogations and tax cuts yet now that he is under attack from his erstwhile media "base" for refusing to repudiate the war in iraq we think he deserves some covering fire the word for what hes demonstrating is character presidential campaigns often have their defining media moments for better or worse think of teddy kennedys fumbling replies to roger mudds chappaquiddick questions in or george h w bush shaking off the so called wimp factor in his interview with dan rather its too soon to say if mr mccains interview sunday with scott pelley of cbss " minutes" will be equally defining but it certainly illuminated the chasm that distinguishes mr mccain from the beltway media that used to adore him the most revealing exchange came when mr pelley in all apparent seriousness asked the senator "at what point do you stop doing what you think is right and you start doing what the majority of the american people want " answered mr mccain "i disagree with what the majority of the american people want i still believe the majority of the american people when asked say if you can show them a path to success then theyll support it " later mr pelley observed that mr mccain was betting his entire campaign on the success of the current "surge" strategy in baghdad the senator replied that hed "rather lose a campaign than lose a war " its hard not to respect that hard too not to notice that statements like those exist at a vast and principled remove from the recent solonic utterances of other senators who supported the war when it was popular such as "lets cut and run or cut and walk" oregon republican gordon smith running for re election next year and "if we knew then what we know now there wouldnt have been a vote and i certainly wouldnt have voted that way" hillary rodham clinton trying to appease the antiwar left as she seeks the democratic presidential nomination the difference is not merely of consistency but of conviction mr mccain is making clear he understands that leadership is often by nature unpopular he has been equally clear about the consequences of u s withdrawal from iraq "chaos" and "genocide" were among the scenarios he painted for mr pelley he has also shown that he understands the moral obligation his vote authorizing the war entailed which was to see it through to victory or at least until the conclusion becomes inescapable that victory is impossible with general david petraeus only recently installed in baghdad and his surge strategy not yet fully under way mr mccain realizes that we are nowhere near being able to draw that conclusion not surprisingly all this has the media in a state of apoplexy with his former liberal pals shaking their heads in phony regret that his supposed blunder in baghdad observing last week that a market is safer than it was only a few months ago is going to sink his candidacy our view is that mr mccains difficulty so far in attracting conservative voters has nothing to do with iraq and everything to do with the positions that once made him the media darling on the contrary his support for the war and his appreciation of the stakes is one thing that keeps his candidacy alive at least within the republican party later today mr mccain will deliver a speech at the virginia military institute about how the war in iraq can be won along with many americans we will listen with interest and respect not because we always agree with mr mccain but because he has demonstrated that his views on the subject are serious and born of belief not of polls thats more than can be said for most of our political and chattering classes and a reason to admire a politician whose newfound unpopularity coincides with his finest political hour see related letters "letters to the editor a man of principle who must feel lonely" wsj april
