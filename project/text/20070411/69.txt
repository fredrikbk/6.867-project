catch up online once considered a license to print money tv stations have suffered body blows from the web lucrative p m newscasts are sinking in the ratings as more viewers go to the internet for cable channels to get weather and sports information viewers no longer have to tune in to catch shows such as abcs "lost" because networks are making programming available all over the web and key tv advertisers such as auto manufacturers are moving cash toward online campaigns while newspapers have had success building heavily trafficked web sites "people still dont automatically think to visit a tv station web site " says brent magid chief executive officer of media consultancy frank magid associates inc "stations need to do something online to get noticed " some have done so and are doing well hearst argyle television inc for instance which has been aggressive in offering exclusive online content says its stations streamed million videos on their web sites in up from a year earlier and smaller station operators have had success experimenting with a variety of web attractions witn a greenville n c station owned by gray television group inc is hosting video tours of houses for sale on its web site while nashvilles wkrn owned by young broadcasting inc started blogs on everything from religion to hunting meredith corp s wnem in flint mich produced a whole program a type of senior citizen talent show including a voting element a la "american idol" for its site these sites fall below the radar for tracking firms such as nielsen netratings but all three companies have seen traffic to their sites grow as a result at wnem for example according to internal figures total clips played in by the station increased to and total unique visitors increased to million "we cant build a strong web business by just doing online what we do on air " says jimmy goodmon general manager of new media at capitol broadcasting co s wral in raleigh n c over the last year the cbs affiliate has added a social networking component to its site and quadrupled the amount of web only stories the revamp was in december since then the sites traffic has grown a month now drawing two million unique visitors in line with the local newspaper most local broadcasters though are coming late to the party one key measure of how far they are lagging on the internet newspaper sales of local online video ads totaled &# million in compared with a relatively paltry &# million for tv stations according to research firm borrell associates inc complacency and greed are two reasons station operators have fallen so far behind say media analysts and consultants the majority of local stations enjoyed profit margins as recently as the mid s compared with to today because they had little competition many didnt see a need to invest in their web operations as a result says mr magid some were leery of moving too quickly online after getting burned when the dot com bubble burst others resisted building up their web sites for fear of giving viewers a reason to switch off the tv set another challenge changing the dna of broadcast newsrooms cbs corp s cbs affiliated stations have been some of the most aggressive on digital initiatives cutting a deal last october to supply video news clips to yahoo inc but prompting station executives to shift to an "always on" mentality breaking news on the web around the clock has been hard says jonathan leess president of cbs stations digital media group "they needed to understand that this is a threat " he says "if they continued with a holding back approach it will severely limit their growth " as stations try to catch up some are trying to build on their long established strength as a source of local news philadelphias wcau owned by nbc universal a unit of general electric co is putting the finishing touches on a new web site called digphilly that will offer movie and restaurant reviews job listings and personal ads visitors will also be able to share homemade videos "the goal is to go hyper local with our coverage right down to the street corner level " says wcau general manager dennis bianchi but stations are finding this a crowded area existing web players like craigslist org and iac interactivecorps citysearch are already providing these services and plenty of local newspapers have also been adding similar information listings to their web sites taking notice of all this activity are big tv studios which rely on stations for their giant syndication units several studios are starting to offer web content either for sale independently or as an add on for on air deals for instance time warner inc s warner bros the industrys largest supplier of tv programming is preparing a syndicated tv show for next fall based on its popular celebrity gossip web site tmz com to heighten buyer interest warner bros is offering stations additional content from tmz com for their web sites "we hope its going to drive a lot of traffic to our site and keep people on the site for longer amounts of time " says derek dalton general manager of kgtv a san diego abc affiliate owned by mcgraw hill cos some smaller station owners have successfully persuaded their affiliated networks to help them out fox affiliates earlier this month successfully won the right to stream episodes of such hit fox shows as "" on their individual web sites the day after the network airs the original fox a unit of news corp will share revenue from video advertising tied to the streamed episodes with affiliates stations can also sell downloads of episodes walt disney co s abc agreed to a similar deal with its affiliates last year and is now working on new video player software that affiliates can use to offer local news content on their web sites along with prime time shows the player will also be available on abc com but will be able to identify the location of visitors that means anyone watching on abc com will see branding messages promoting their local affiliate says john rouse abcs senior vice president of affiliate relations to date abc affiliates covering of the country including major affiliate groups as well as the abc owned stations have launched or have committed to launching the player on their own web sites and are taking advantage of the opportunity to incorporate local advertising into the programming news corp and disney have reason to help of course they both own stations however their stations along with those owned by nbc universal and cbs tend to be in less of a bind because they are clustered in big cities with more robust advertising markets
