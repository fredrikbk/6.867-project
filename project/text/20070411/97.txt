politics &amp economics former afl cio unions hit hurdles new membership fails to reach groups goals as internal rifts emerge nearly two years after leaving the afl cio with big plans to organize more workers and re energize the labor movement a group of unions has accomplished much less than it hoped and is grappling with internal divisions the disagreements within the new labor group could ultimately hurt democrats as the presidential primary season approaches if those disputes cause the unions to split their support among several candidates the change to win federation was formed in september by seven unions that felt the afl cio spent too much money on politics and not enough on organizing workers the group pledged "to jointly carry out the largest organizing program in more than years " with the aim of reversing the labor movements decline no such turnaround has materialized union membership in the u s continued to fall last year to of private sector workers from about in the early s the federation which represents million workers in health care trucking hotels and construction among other industries has failed to significantly increase its membership moreover membership growth within change to win unions has been mixed recent government filings show that unions that had strong organizing departments continued to perform better than the rest while others continued to trail the fast growing service employees international union added members expanding to million members unite here and the international brotherhood of teamsters each had net gains of several thousand members but the million member united food and commercial workers lost roughly members and the laborers international union of north america lost about to fall to members bruce raynor president of unite here said the group had made some strides in organizing but that it would take more time to show broader results "i knew from the beginning we werent going to build an organizing program overnight " he said "i think by and large change to win has been a success " greg denier communications director for change to win said union leaders havent disagreed on core issues such as the need for health care overhaul but on tactics "where people cant agree they will pursue an issue that they believe is in the best interests for workers in their industry " he said mr denier said unions have beefed up organizing staffs and created a strategic organizing center to run big organizing campaigns the center helped unite here organize hotel workers last year and is helping the teamsters organize school bus drivers and port drivers "we are committed to doing more but change to win is certainly implementing a new vision in terms of how we organize " but there are signs the group is unhappy with its performance in a march letter to the federations leadership anna burger chairwoman of change to win cited areas in which the group has failed to reach consensus including its own internal finances immigration policy health care policy retirement security policy presidential politics and on how to confront wal mart stores inc the group has made decisions on most of these topics "but when there is any resistance from staff of the affiliates we dont implement them " ms burger wrote "as a result affiliates are frustrated and opportunities missed " in the case of immigration for instance the service workers union favors a guest worker program while other unions in the federation oppose such a program change to win unions which represent many immigrant workers failed to follow through on plans to develop a "structured relationship" with the national day laborer organizing network and allocate &# "for outreach to immigrant and latino community " according to ms burgers letter the unions also had agreed to identify five employers to bring to a summit on health care early this year but failed to identify employers or schedule the summit "we have no strategy for the implementation of our policies for health care reform so each union continues to move forward on their own strategy " ms burger wrote her letter was earlier reported by the los angeles times tensions within the new organization stem partly from a news conference in february in which andy stern president of seiu announced that he was teaming up with lee scott chief executive of wal mart as well as other business and labor leaders to lobby congress for health care overhaul joseph hansen of the ufcw quickly denounced the event as a "publicity stunt " the ufcw has been trying for years to organize workers at wal mart and is currently waging a campaign to tarnish the retailers image the meeting undermined labors criticism of the company by giving the appearance of accepting its health care policies mr hansen argues he declined to comment for this article steve trossman communications director for seiu played down tensions between mr stern and mr hansen "mr hansen obviously has strong opinions about this there are going to be some areas where they agree to disagree but life will go on " mr stern declined to comment on the issue of the groups accomplishments mr trossman said "i think people would like to see things move faster than they have " he added "but there is also a lot of exciting stuff on the board that could result in some major campaigns " jim papian a spokesman for the ufcw declined to discuss the relationship between mr hansen and mr stern "of course people have convictions and positions they argue their position with conviction and a sense of urgency and passion but then they hash it out and move forward " he said the issue of how to deal with wal mart and the potential for disagreement could easily become a factor in the upcoming democratic primaries last month mr hansen sent a letter to all of the democratic presidential candidates asking them for their views on wal mart in order to be considered for an endorsement he asked candidates if they would publicly support the ufcws campaign against wal mart finally he asked if they would agree "not to take part in any publicity stunt" that helps wal mart
