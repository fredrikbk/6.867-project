digging out of delinquency more borrowers fall behind on home loans complicating efforts to work out solutions as mortgage delinquencies climb lenders say they are taking new steps to work with homeowners in financial trouble but many borrowers say red tape and other obstacles are keeping them from resolving their problems the sharp rise in delinquencies in recent months is straining mortgage companies ability to respond quickly to borrowers with such solutions as new repayment plans or modifications to loan agreements borrowers often must make many calls before finding someone in a position to help them by which point their problems may have worsened the process can be particularly complicated when mortgages have been packaged into securities and sold to investors which can limit the mortgage companys flexibility in working out a solution and for some borrowers there may not be a good solution apart from the sale of their home or foreclosure "if youre a borrower trying to deal with a mortgage company or even a private attorney youre likely to run into brick walls " says iowa assistant attorney general patrick madigan whose job includes working on behalf of iowa homeowners benjiman johnson a single father on a fixed income who lives in sacramento calif fell behind on his &# mortgage in january after the combination of loan and property tax payments became unmanageable he says hes talked to at least a half dozen people at the company that services his loan gmac mortgage "but nobody wants to pay attention to what you can do its like being talked to like a child " now mr johnson has put his house up for sale but given the weak housing market he hasnt gotten any offers a spokesman for gmac a unit of gmac financial services says "because of federal privacy laws we cannot comment about specific customers " he adds "we strive to reach out and work directly with our customers to try to resolve issues when they arise " the mortgage delinquency rate climbed to in the first quarter from at the end of last year and from a recent low of in the fourth quarter of according to a new study by equifax inc and moodys economy inc thats the highest level since the companies began tracking delinquencies at the beginning of delinquencies also were up sharply for home equity loans and lines of credit "the erosion in credit quality is greater than i expected " says mark zandi chief economist of moodys economy com who expects mortgage delinquencies will peak at about in mid "its the noxious mix of all those aggressive loans now facing resets combined with falling house prices and a deceleration in job growth particularly in some markets " until recently mortgage delinquencies had been at historically low levels with low interest rates and rising home prices making it easy for those who ran into trouble to refinance or sell their home now as problem loans increase lenders have tightened their standards adding further to pressures on the housing market as long as job growth remains strong mr zandi says he doesnt expect the housing downturn to derail the economy but the impact on consumer spending is likely to be "more pronounced" than previously expected in an effort to head off loan problems mortgage companies are using computer models to predict which borrowers are most likely to run into trouble they are also reaching out to borrowers earlier and encouraging them to get in touch if they are having trouble meeting their payments last week bear stearns cos emc mortgage unit announced it was creating the "emc mod squad " a team of loan modification specialists who will help delinquent borrowers avoid foreclosure the specialists are charged with being "more counselors than collectors " says emc president john vella working out a solution is easiest when the borrowers income has been interrupted perhaps because of illness or job loss then the amount owed can be added to the mortgage balance or repaid over several months says steve bailey senior managing director of loan administration for countrywide financial corp the nations largest mortgage lender finding a solution is more complicated when borrowers cant afford their monthly payment on an ongoing basis because of a decline in their income an interest rate increase or other factors countrywide has become more willing to lower the interest rate or outstanding loan balance for such customers but the chances are greater if borrowers live in the home and can show they are committed to paying the lower amount mr bailey says lenders say the sooner they hear from a borrower in trouble the easier it is to work out a solution but housing counselors and government officials say thats often not the reality "we dont look at it as a viable option " says pam canada executive director of neighborworks homeownership center in sacramento calif which counsels borrowers in financial distress in many cases its more effective for borrowers to turn to family members for help or to sell their home to get out from under their debts she says mortgage payments are typically collected by loan servicing companies which are also charged with resolving any problems sometimes the servicer is also the company that made the loan but often it is working on behalf of another party usually investors who own mortgage backed securities when problems arise borrowers are often first referred to the loan servicers collections department says ken wade chief executive of neighborworks america a non profit group in washington that works on affordable housing nationally only later when things are worse are borrowers shifted to loss mitigation where someone may have the authority to modify the terms of their loan or come up with another solution he says the red tape can be greater when loans have been packaged into securities and sold to investors as two thirds of mortgages are in such cases trust documents determine how problem loans are handled roughly one third of bond deals include restrictions on the number of loans that can be restructured according to a recent analysis by credit suisse group that looked at deals made up of subprime mortgages even where there arent specific restrictions the servicer may not be able to change the terms of the loan until the borrower is at least days delinquent even if its clear that trouble looms says doug duncan chief economist of the mortgage bankers association rules for modifying loans can be vague leading to legal disputes between servicers and investors changing the trust agreement can require the approval of the investors who can be difficult to locate mr duncan says his group is meeting with investors borrowers lenders and community groups to find ways to overcome such obstacles and come up with ideas for new products aimed at troubled borrowers the rise in delinquencies has been steepest in markets that benefited heavily from the housing boom including parts of california and florida according to equifax and moodys economy com on an absolute basis delinquencies are highest in areas such as detroit livonia dearborn mich and brownsville harlingen texas where employment has been weak in a sign that more borrowers are having trouble getting back on track the number of mortgages in default climbed to million on an annualized basis in the first quarter from last year lenders report defaults to credit bureaus when they begin the foreclosure process some borrowers refinance go on a repayment plan or sell their home before the foreclosure is completed working it out mortgage delinquencies climbed in the first quarter to their highest since at least lenders say troubled borrowers should contact them early to try to come up with a solution borrowers say they often run into red tape when dealing with mortgage companies foreclosure or a home sale may be the only solution for some
