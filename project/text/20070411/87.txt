originates from cbs corp s wfan radio station is simulcast on msnbc a unit of general electric co s nbc universal the advertisers reaction suggests fallout over mr imuss remarks could persist marketers arent saying whether their pullouts are permanent and they are likely to watch carefully to see if the fuss dies down but the withdrawal of more advertisers could potentially undercut support for mr imus returning to the air civil rights groups such as the naacp have called for him to be fired while the rev al sharpton is calling for advertisers and guests to boycott the program mr imus has long been known for his irreverent humor but he has come under intense criticism since referring to the rutgers team which lost to the university of tennessee in the ncaa championship last week as "nappy headed hos" during his show mr imus went onto mr sharptons radio program on monday to apologize but the controversy hasnt let up talkers a trade publication estimates mr imus has a

watch i cant blame them for supporting his show prior to this incident he does have pretty good ratings " said team captain essence carson p&amp gs reaction is likely to have the most impact the marketer was the th biggest advertiser on msnbcs simulcast of the imus show last year according to tns advertisers dont necessarily buy time on msnbcs broadcast of the show instead they buy time on the channels daytime schedule and are rotated around different programs because of that practice p&amp g pulled its ads off the channels daytime schedule it said yesterday that "any venue in which our ads appear that is offensive to our target audience is not acceptable to us " bigelow tea a regular advertiser on mr imuss radio show said it was suspending its current advertising and re evaluating its future relationship with the show "we do support the good work and efforts don imus has done over the years" for various charities said cindi bigelow co president of bigelow tea but "we are deeply saddened by imus remarks " she didnt say how long the suspension might last staples the office supply chain said it was pulling its ads from mr imuss program on msnbc "recent comments made on the program prompted us to revise our decision to advertise on the program " said staples spokesman paul capelli "as of now we are not advertising on the program " staples says it cant speculate as to when it may return msnbc said others have pulled out as well "a handful of advertisers have asked to move their spots to other programs and we are accommodating them " said jeremy gaines an msnbc spokesman another radio advertiser bertelsmann ags random house said it would be "evaluating" its future commitments "going forward " the imus program is a popular forum for authors to promote their books and random house publishers periodically buy ad time to advertise individual titles working in mr imuss favor are his close ties with some of the advertisers such as private jet service netjets which said yesterday that it didnt condone his remarks but that "we know his apology is heartfelt we plan to support him much like we would any family member during a challenging time " general motors which has historically advertised on both the imus radio show and msnbc broadcast has "no plans to make any changes at this point " says gm spokeswoman ryndee carney advertising on the programs "doesnt mean that we agree or disagree with any of the viewpoints expressed on the show by mr imus and his guests " she says for cbs radio which runs mr imuss show on its wfan radio station in new york the controversy comes at a difficult time the groups revenue declined last year in large part because of the loss of howard stern another controversial radio host mr imuss show generates about of

syndicates mr imuss show to stations across the country cbs owns an stake in westwood westwood too has been struggling with revenue slipping last year a major advertising boycott of one of its biggest stars could further dent westwoods financial performance a spokesman for westwood one referred calls to cbs radio which declined to comment on advertiser decisions typically radio executives say controversy around a host provides a ratings spike that might last several weeks or months advertisers tend to return after the controversy has died down in this case some media buyers already
