tunecore marches to own beat an upstart distributor of digital music rattles industry with flat fees the digital music business has only been around for a few years but that was long enough for a start up called tunecore inc to upend the business model in one corner of the industry most companies involved in the business of formatting a song or album and preparing it for online music services take a percentage of sales as their payment but in a departure from standard practice tunecore charges its clients independent labels or artists flat fees and then passes of the wholesale price on to its clients it is still a small market digital distribution of independent labels not affiliated with one of the big music companies distribution arms was likely worth no more than &# million last year according to nielsen soundscan data tunecore says that figure may be low because many independent artists sell their music without the accompanying data necessary for soundscan to track sales when the music business went online with the launch of apple inc s itunes store independent record companies faced many of the same challenges they do in the world of physical retailing no single retailer digital or physical is equipped to strike separate deals with the thousands of independent labels that release music every year in the physical world distributors take up this slack handling logistics like storage delivery and returns in exchange for a percentage of sales when it became clear there was a need for similar middlemen in the digital realm several companies jumped in mimicking the same fundamental business model they took between and of sales to virtually "package" songs for sale on itunes and other digital services there is a key difference though between physical distribution and digital "aggregation " as the online version of the business is known when music is sold digitally much of the work distributors get paid to do no longer exists theres no warehousing shipping or returns and no breakage jeff price owner of the new york independent label spinart started tunecore to provide the same services as other aggregators but using a flat fee model clients record labels or artists pay a one time charge of cents a song plus a handful of other modest fees for example a five song "album " sold for a year on four different online music stores would cost a user &# each additional year selling the album on the services would cost &# tunecore then passes along of the wholesale price it receives from itunes emusic com or others that fee is about cents from itunes emusic calculates its payments to record labels using a more complicated formula that generally results in much lower payments per song sold tunecore says mr price says he sees his new venture as a fundamentally different proposition from running a record label "we moved out of the exploitation business into the service business " he says all his labels online sales go through tunecore he adds that he started tunecore after examining his options as an independent record label operator most other aggregators he says collected fees based on old line ways of doing business taking a percentage of every sale despite the fact that digital distribution is more or less a one time proposition "they dont have warehouse and pick and pack " he says and unlike traditional record labels "they dont advance money for touring or recording " tunecore had a soft launch last year and is still technically in "beta " or public testing mode still through word of mouth it has garnered about albums worth of music and is currently adding to albums a day mr price says performers using the service include country veteran joe ely independent rock phenomenons tapes n tapes and mc hammer the rap musician two albums distributed online by tunecore won grammys this year ziggy marleys "love is my religion" and ricky skaggss "instrumentals " to be sure the market tunecore is entering is a niche and there are some services tunecore doesnt provide such as paying "mechanical" royalties to the music publishers who own the copyrights to songs but the company recently added features that enable record labels and musicians to calculate the royalties they owe and to disburse funds directly from a tunecore account to a third party such as a music publisher guitar center inc the big national musical instrument retailer recently took an undisclosed stake in tunecore and has been promoting the service heavily on its web site
