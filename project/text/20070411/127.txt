why canada opposes two u s lng plants in response to your march editorial "maine chance " which claimed that "canadas protests dont hold water" when it comes to the two lng facilities proposed for the passamaquoddy bay area of maine you mischaracterized canadian and new brunswick concerns over these two lng facilities as "an emerging trade dispute" driven by "energy protectionism" on our part you also are misguided in attacking the canadian federal governments decision to deny lng tankers transit through head harbor passage at the outset there simply is no basis for your accusation of protectionism and there are many examples of cross border cooperation in energy as well as other sectors new brunswick recently has signed a memorandum of understanding mou with maine to improve inter connectivity on our electrical grid there also have been a number of other joint projects with the new england states not the least of which is an international kilo volt transmission line that is being constructed right now at a combined cost of &# million we encourage competition but competition is not the issue when it comes to the quoddy bay and downeast lng terminals what you dismiss as "contrived energy protectionism" with regard to lng we see as protecting the legitimate economic environmental safety and security concerns of the people of new brunswick to the best of our legal ability our interests in the maine terminals are evident and significant our province borders maine campobello island and deer island both within new brunswick are located along the proposed vessel transit route new brunswickers living in these areas depend on the passamaquoddy bay for their livelihoods moreover all vessels destined for these proposed terminals would be required to transit through head harbor passage which is entirely canadian waters once the vessels have transited through head harbor passage and turn into the western passage they will encounter the old sow whirlpool the largest in the western hemisphere it shifts location depending on the tides and is near one of the narrowest points of the transit at about yards across between the southwestern tip of deer island new brunswick and dog island maine consequently our province has intervened in the ferc proceedings regarding these lng terminals in maine to ensure that the ferc considers how the resolution of matters within its jurisdiction might impact the lives of new brunswick citizens thus despite any protests to the contrary the province is playing by the rules as u s laws and regulations have defined them at the same time our intervention before the ferc does not and cannot place within that agencys jurisdiction any aspect of the canadian governments decision regarding head harbor passage and passamaquoddy bay the government of new brunswick supports the federal governments head harbor passage decision without reservation matters of access to canadian territorial waters lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of our federal government and are not subject to review or critique by the ferc the truth of the matter is that not all sites are ideal for the construction of lng terminals the development of an lng project represents a complex undertaking even under the best conditions and presents myriad potential safety security and environment concerns it is precisely for this reason that the u s and canada have adopted thorough regulatory processes to evaluate the siting and construction of lng terminals and facilities on at least one occasion the ferc process has rejected a proposed lng terminal on safety grounds because the proposal "would be inconsistent with the public interest " in contrast to the proposed maine terminals the canaport lng facility in saint john new brunswick and its approaches are in easily navigable waters shawn graham premier of new brunswick fredericton new brunswick see related letter "letters to the editor lng u s has right to innocent passage" wsj april
