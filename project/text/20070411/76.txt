northrop embraces small satellite plan plan to sell spy systems from israel may lead to more influential role colorado springs colo striving to differentiate itself from rivals northrop grumman corp is taking the contrarian step of forging an exclusive partnership with israel aerospace industries ltd to propose lighter more flexible spy satellites to the u s military and intelligence agencies the project which was code named "trinidad" during development and which is expected to be announced today at a space conference here reflects northrops drive to move beyond being primarily a supplier of subsystems for government space programs into the more influential and potentially more profitable role as a prime contractor the los angeles company proposes to buy and modify several israeli built high resolution spy satellites each costing less than &# million that is a fraction of what a larger more complex u s satellite would cost initially the satellites would be deployed in low earth orbit as a stand alone system "this would be an operational asset" and "a cost effective way to watch our adversaries " said jeffrey grant a senior northrop space official northrops strategy is surprising because it relies on foreign off the shelf technology in a classified arena reserved for custom built top of the line u s solutions and it is far from certain that the defense department and congress would be willing to try it small satellites account for a tiny slice of the estimated &# billion that the u s spends annually on all military and intelligence space systems northrop is searching for initial u s government funding although it has briefed some prospective users the company proposes starting with as many as eight low earth orbit satellites with a combined cost of less than &# billion designing testing and deploying the same number of large high earth orbit spy platforms in the u s could cost closer to &# billion moreover the israeli option would become operational long ahead of any larger homegrown alternative israel is expected to launch the first version of its satellite weighing about pounds later this year northrops move comes at a time when some defense department brass are clamoring to acquire an inventory of smaller more affordable satellites that could be launched in weeks or even days to respond to fast changing threats this type of capability took on new importance late last year when china successfully conducted a test in which it shot down one of its own satellites demonstrating its ability to render orbiting spy platforms useless the battle is on to introduce that kind of flexible system companies including northrop and raytheon co as well as second tier industry players such as alliant techsystems inc and orbital sciences corp are pushing their versions of gear that promise continuous and enhanced global surveillance capabilities available to local commanders nearly at any time and regardless of weather support for shrinking satellites isnt unanimous inside the services though air force gen kevin chilton head of u s space command said he is willing to explore possibilities of so called responsive space initiatives but he hasnt bought into the "theory about the benefits of these systems " northrop is competing against lockheed martin corp to build an advanced u s space radar system and is betting that the latest move will help generate momentum for that broader effort northrop envisions a hybrid constellation of equipment in which smaller satellites aircraft and drones would augment and help fill coverage gaps sometimes lasting for more than half a day between passes of the larger satellites comprehensive space radar plans have been stalled by budget constraints and turf battles between the air force and the intelligence community nevertheless the concept is getting a lot of attention from senior acquisition officials air force undersecretary ronald sega the pentagons point man for space said he is considering "whether it makes sense for us to look at systems in space" that include a mixture of satellites of different sizes and orbits northrops vision differs from that of raytheon which prides itself on having developed a number of small cutting edge technology demonstrators including twin radar mapping satellites and a separate optical sensor which was built in months and for under &# million "these are going to fly very near term so this is not just a pipe dream " said brian arnold the raytheon executive overseeing the work if they can work together a cluster of minisatellites could provide a broad range of surveillance and communication functions mr arnold said but there arent "a lot of dollars" to push the concept forward by contrast northrop aims to provide real world capabilities to troops and intelligence agents in the field potentially in less than three years rather than the experimental one of a kind projects raytheon hopes will blossom into mature programs northrop may be eager to establish its credentials in the burgeoning small satellite sector but at the same time it is striving to challenge the dominance of satellite builders boeing co and lockheed at the upper end of the market senior northrop executives see the israeli connection furthering both goals by providing immediate as well as long term advantages industry officials said lockheed considered but opted against a deal using the israeli satellites partly because it believes it has the inside track to build the next large satellite surveillance system with about &# billion of israel aerospace industries or iai and israeli government funds invested in developing the satellite model iai said northrops experience with surveillance systems made it a "natural partner
