poor mans therapy in brazil a deadly bug spurs a stem cell project in a debated study patients will get their own marrow salvador brazil bartolomeu dos santos reis was bitten by an insect some years ago and contracted a tropical ailment called chagas disease the infection little known outside poor regions of latin america lay undetected in his body for decades until it caused his heart to enlarge so much he couldnt climb a flight of stairs today three years later mr santos reis years old is alive well past the time most chagas sufferers die and back to selling sunglasses on the streets of this beachside city a local scientist ricardo ribeiro dos santos believes mr santos reis owes his survival to an experimental treatment an injection of the patients own stem cell rich bone marrow into his arteries dr ribeiro dos santos and a group of fellow doctors surmise that cells from the injected marrow somehow reduced swelling and stopped more scar tissue from forming helping his heart pump better encouraged by this and other cases brazils government is undertaking an ambitious study of how a persons own cells can be used to repair a damaged heart no drug can do that today a patient trial now under way in brazil is the worlds largest medical study of the hotly debated potential of stem cells the multipurpose cells that can generate new tissue the most malleable kind of stem cell and the most ethically controversial comes from embryos but excitement also surrounds so called "adult" stem cells which have important regenerative properties and can be harvested relatively easily from peoples bone marrow for brazil a developing country of million people the stem cell study is a bid to develop affordable treatments unlike pricey medicines that poor countries cant afford theres no patent on bone marrow and the infusions dont rely on foreign technology brazil has already turned its sugar cane industry into the worlds most efficient producer of renewable ethanol fuel helping to effectively eliminate foreign oil imports with stem cells government health officials say they see another chance to become self sufficient mr santos reiss treatment consisted of an espresso cups worth of cells that doctors removed from his hip and injected into his arteries it cost about &# just a fraction of the price of carrying out a similar procedure in more heavily regulated laboratories in the u s or elsewhere "its a poor mans cell therapy " says hans dohmann a cardiologist in rio de janeiro and one of the projects leaders yet the willingness of heart experts in brazil and elsewhere to experiment on humans is prompting some medical pushback amid an expanding wave of similar studies from south korea to finland and intense competition to report breakthroughs a recent editorial in nature called for a "moratorium" on human stem cell tests in heart disease because there is no consensus yet about how the cells work not every study has found benefits and some fear that premature optimism could put patients at risk of unknown side effects moreover the approach used in brazil is relatively crude researchers are injecting marrow a soup of different cells into the bloodstream rather than first discovering which of those cells may be responsible for the benefits a more expensive approach that many experts believe has greater chance of success doctors involved in the brazil study acknowledge the unknowns but say the potential payoff is huge as in many countries heart disease is one of the top killers and biggest health care expenses in brazil the brazilian approach "wont be the treatment of the future but it could work for brazil now " says dr dohmann for some brazils huge study highlights the benefits of forging ahead faster with human testing in innovative fields in recent years stiffer rules and higher hurdles in the u s pushed human studies of adult stem cells overseas where doctors moved more quickly to experiment on people this january following promising initial reports from brazil and germany the u s government awarded &# million to test adult stem cell treatments on heart patients james willerson president of the university of texas health science center and a cardiologist overseeing several of the newly funded u s studies calls humans the "right model" to determine if such cell treatments work because bone marrow injections use a patients own cells and have already been used safely in cancer treatments he and others have argued that it is acceptable to skip some pretesting usually done first on animals doctors at houstons texas heart institute where dr willerson also is medical director participated in early stem cell studies in brazil when the research was more difficult to do in the u s at the center of brazils stem cell research is dr ribeiro dos santos who works at salvadors fundacao oswaldo cruz research institute known as fiocruz an early proponent of stem cells dr ribeiro dos santos won &# million in government funding to create a large new laboratory in salvador to study stem cell therapy like other doctors here dr ribeiro dos santos believes stem cells have a role in dealing with brazils social inequalities particularly the toll of chagas disease according to the university of brasilia as much as of brazils population may be infected a third of those will eventually develop symptoms the illness is spread by barbeiros also known as kissing bugs aggressive insects that bite peoples faces as they sleep the bug favors environments common in poor rural areas such as mud houses covered with palm leaves inside the bugs droppings is a single celled protozoan trypanosoma cruzi that enters the blood stream through the bite mark years later usually in the prime of life the infection can cause deadly swelling of the heart and intestines because it usually afflicts the poor the disease carries a strong stigma doctors say some brazilians die of the disease refusing to admit they suffer from it dr ribeiro dos santos comes from a wealthy local family and has a son trying out for the elite brazilian equestrian squad in julys pan american games as a young scientist he became infected with chagas after stabbing himself with an infected syringe in a laboratory accident "i am chagas too " he says showing the scar on his left forearm he has been treated with drugs and has no symptoms but could eventually fall ill the idea of treating any heart disease with stem cell therapy gained momentum in that year heart researchers led by the national institutes of health reported that bone marrow injections caused heart muscle to regenerate in mice that had been induced to have attacks the cells seemed to act as chameleons that took on whatever role that they detected the body needed in the rush that followed to try that technique on humans brazil played a starring role dr dohmann at rio de janeiros pro cardiaco hospital teamed up with the texas heart institute and began injecting heart patients in brazil shortly after a group in germany launched a similar study in the brazilian u s team published a report showing a small but noticeable improvement in patients with heart failure who received the cells because the early brazil experiments like those in germany went forward with few preliminary tests in rats dogs or other large animals the treatments were strongly debated even at that time brazil has sometimes been a magnet in the past for poorly supervised tests of new drugs or medical devices doctors involved in the study agree it wouldnt have been allowed then in the u s says jose eduardo krieger a researcher at incor a big heart hospital in sao paulo and a rival of the rio de janeiro doctors "brazil appeared on the scene for some bad reasons " by dr ribeiro dos santos was already launching his own tests in the city of salvador on another class of heart patients people with chagas disease chagas is incurable once patients exhibit symptoms and advanced cases die within a year mr santos reis was the first to undergo treatment he grew up in a mud and wood house sleeping on a wooden plank he now lives about miles from there and supports a wife and two teenage children with &# a month from sunglass sales and a government disability check "we tried this in mice and now well try it on you " mr santos reis recalls a doctor joking because chagas is a regional problem and not one that wealthy countries are likely to tackle the results from salvador were particularly important to brazil dr ribeiro dos santos and cardiologist fabio vilas boas writing in a article published in portuguese described how mr santos reiss heart seemed to be pumping considerably more blood just a month after the treatment "we cant find any explanation that could explain the improvement in ventricular function other than the stem cell treatment " they reported even as the brazilian doctors charted progress however theories about how stem cells work began coming under revision newer research has shown that stem cells from bone marrow dont become muscle at all or if they do the effect is negligible that undercut the initial logic behind the human studies yet by then the tests in brazil and in germany had shown that one way or another the treatment seemed to be helping patients thats proved a powerful argument to continue human studies emerson perin a brazilian born cardiologist at texas heart says his institution used the human data collected in rio de janeiro to persuade the u s food and drug administration which had been keeping such research in tight check to permit similar experiments at home in "the fda looked at reams of brazilian data " he says in addition to the texas heart study the agency has green lighted several more mindful of u s competition the brazilian doctors have pushed hard for government funding to keep from giving up their early lead that has happened before when researchers at fiocruz in brazil claimed the trypanosoma cruzi parasite as a brazilian national priority labs elsewhere held off decoding the germs dna but the brazilian scientists didnt raise the &# million needed for the job eventually teams in the u s and sweden deciphered the parasites genetic code publishing it in to substantial fanfare close to brazilian cardiologists and scientists went to rio de janeiros national cardiology institute to argue their case some government officials first assumed the treatment could be offered to the public within a few months recalls dr vilas boas one of the doctors who met with them in rio de janeiro the scientists had to tamp down their enthusiasm "we said whoa this is research " dr vilas boas recalls government officials agreed to spend &# million on a large clinical trial in order to speed up the research with more than participating heart centers the study is one of brazils first u s style megastudies of a new treatment led by brazils top cardiology centers it is examining four different heart conditions that have in common the death of heart cells including chagas and heart attacks brazils health ministry estimates that if the stem cell treatments work it could save &# million a month in public health care costs the stem cell trial is "going to be like brazils genome project " says antonio carlos campos de carvalho the government scientist monitoring the project referring to the mapping of all human dna brazil also has beefed up its regulatory regime governing medical research and stem cell research in particular that sets it apart from other developing nations with lighter regulation medical centers in china are already selling bone marrow infusions as a panacea for a host of ailments from autism to spinal cord injury despite scant evidence on some of those applications in thailand a company called theravitae is selling treatments for heart disease for more than &# executives say the company has presented promising results in patients though that number is too low to convince many other doctors so far about additional chagas patients have received stem cell transfusions in brazil says dr ribeiro dos santos while the treatment doesnt cure the disease he says it seems to improve patients heart function and stamina and he is convinced the treatment works another doctor involved in the study augusto mota whose mother has chagas disease is more cautious under the rules of the research study half the patients get a real infusion of bone marrow cells and half get a dummy injection of saline solution only dr mota the hematologist who prepares the syringes knows whats in them he has detected a strong placebo effect among the patients many of whom are grateful to be getting any treatment at all "the next day people say they are better and they have saline in their arteries " he says dr ribeiro dos santos recently made a bid to have an early look at the data from the chagas patients treated so far under the government study he hoped the data would prove the treatment is helping so those chagas patients who had gotten the placebo could also receive stem cells "otherwise they will die " he says dr campos de carvalho the government scientist who controls the data says he decided to follow the original plan and wait until more patients had completed the study to release the data "we dont want to be one of the countries that do things without solid scientific evidence " he says
