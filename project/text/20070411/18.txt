big apple on a small scale moses panorama upgraded queens museum of art open wednesday through sunday www queensmuseum org flushing n y in "robert moses and the modern city the transformation of new york" an exhibition at three sites in two boroughs one can see the master planners legacy writ large in bridges highways beaches and buildings in the city and its surrounding suburbs but visitors to the queens museum of arts section of the show can also see in the qmas permanent collection a moses creation built on a much smaller but no less encompassing scale "the panorama of the city of new york " the square foot model of the citys five boroughs its waterways parks bridges highways airports streets and buildings was conceived by moses for the new york city pavilion at the worlds fair originally visitors saw the miniature city while on a mock helicopter ride upon its founding in the qma became the panoramas official guardian when it took up residence in the new york city building where the panorama had remained since the fairs closing the fairgrounds are now flushing meadows corona park though some updates were made to the replica in it wasnt until when the qma underwent its own renovation that the panoramas infrastructure was dramatically altered by changes compliments of its original builder lester associates in addition the panorama was fitted with an ascending elevated ramp designed by rafael vinoly architects which enabled visitors to walk around its perimeter and observe the city from various aerial vantage points as a life long resident of queens ive hopped on the no train many times to check out the museums exhibits always capping the visit with a peek into the cavernous gallery that houses the panorama and though the birds eye view of its sweeping landscape never failed to thrill me discerning particular landmarks both public and private had at times proved frustrating due to the darkness of the room as of february however that hindrance has been rectified with the installation of a computerized multimedia program that combines a state of the art lighting system with a video presentation the idea of upgrading the panorama began five years ago when tom finkelpearl took over as the qmas director and soon realized how the antiquated semifunctional lighting system which dated back to was impairing the panoramas visibility according to david strauss mr finkelpearls right hand man "updating the lighting became a priority along with the desire to take advantage of the latest technology to further the educational and entertainment aspects of the panorama experience " the melding of these two goals became a tangible reality when the qma was introduced to david lackey of whirlwind creative who was using the panorama in a multimedia presentation for the nyc olympic campaign impressed with the technological aspect of mr lackeys olympic project the qma asked him to tailor a program to suit its needs thanks to whirlwind creatives ingenuity and &# in funds from the mayors office the office of queens borough president helen marshall the department of cultural affairs the new york city council and the new york state assembly the multimedia upgrade of the panorama was brought to fruition the lighting component which includes general illumination of the panorama in addition to nuanced spotlighting allows visitors to clearly perceive the panoramas myriad structures and complex layout the renewed visibility also makes one appreciate the hundreds of craftsmen whose nimble fingers built the miniature city in guided only by maps and aerial photographs its when the lights start to dim however in preparation for the minute audio visual presentation that the viewing experience becomes truly engaging the sound of chirping birds peppers the air and a simulated sun rises in the east as a new day dawns in the mini metropolis the visitors attention is drawn to the video which has been projected on three of the gallerys walls the narration begins with details about the panoramas development and construction then continues with a succinct historic account of new york citys transformation from a dutch settlement to a complex city of five boroughs while images of actual locations and structures appear on screen spotlights shine down on their diminutive counterparts articulating each ones significance and geographical position within the urban landscape the statue of liberty and central park are among the many pinpointed sites as are the twin towers which here still stand intact though the commentary notes that "this is not exactly the city as we know it today but the city as it stood in " the qmas objective after was to remove the towers and replace them with a miniature tribute in light after learning however that dust or moisture particles would have to be circulated in the air for the lights to be effectively reflected substances detrimental to works of art the idea was abandoned in keeping with its policy of ensuring that all qma visitors including those with special needs such as the visually impaired have a rewarding museum experience the upgrade also features a tactile model of a small section of the panorama built on the same scale as the original one inch representing feet for visitors to touch the area spans manhattans th street and then crosses the east river into queens and brooklyn the panorama has always been the qmas magnet exhibit attracting more than visitors annually in recent years in its newly embellished state the panoramas magic has been brought to the fore and with it the promise of an exceptional experience ms rossi is a member of the journals editorial page staff
