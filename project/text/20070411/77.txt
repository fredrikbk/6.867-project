not yet circling wagons wells fargo shares hit a subprime rut but wheels stay on much like the stagecoach that made its name in the old west wells fargo &amp co has hit some ruts because of its exposure to risky subprime loans but the situation may not be as ominous as it appears shares of wells fargo the nations fourth largest bank with a market value of about &# billion are taking an unusually harsh beating as many investors worry that the end of the subprime sectors woes is nowhere in sight the stock listed on the new york stock exchange trades at about times this years projected per share profit a year low the stock closed yesterday at &# up four cents this year the share price is down compared with a decline by the dow jones wilshire u s banks index its valuation premium over other large banks has "eroded materially " says howard mason an analyst with sanford c bernstein &amp co which does business with wells fargo he rates the stock the equivalent of a "hold " while wells fargos shares remain relatively expensive with a price earnings ratio still roughly higher than its peers the recent slide is a setback for a bank widely regarded as one of the best in the business known for its success at cross selling multiple products to customers the san francisco bank routinely churns out double digit annual earnings growth that near magic formula has made richard m kovacevich wells fargos chairman and chief executive a hero among bank analysts and investors long accustomed to pricey takeovers and other grandiose strategies that dont pan out along the way wells fargo became a player in offering mortgages to riskier borrowers originating &# billion in such so called subprime loans last year according to one industry publication that ranked wells fargo the no issuer making it appear to have more exposure to such loans than beleaguered rivals such as new century financial corp which filed for bankruptcy court protection last week this has caused some concern since wall street seems increasingly leery of any subprime exposure "it wouldnt be the first time our stock has been penalized out of ignorance " mr kovacevich said prior to the banks pre earnings quiet period grumbling aside there is plenty of evidence to suggest wells fargo isnt a disaster about to happen in recent weeks executives have been telling analysts and investors that the bank is shielded from any problems on about of the subprime loans it made last year the reason wells fargo says most of its subprime loans are made under what it calls "co issue arrangements " in which it acts only as the servicer of the loans in such cases the bank maintains financial risk is borne by investment banks and other firms that securitize the subprime mortgages the deals wells fargo says eliminate the possibility that the bank will be forced to repurchase loans if borrowers miss payments "there is no credit risk to wells fargo" on those loans howard atkins the banks chief financial officer maintains contrast that with the shock waves caused by m&amp t bank corp s first quarter profit warning last month the buffalo n y lender is having trouble selling a type of mortgage called an "alternative a" loan which requires little documentation from borrowers that category is between subprime and prime but credit woes are causing m&amp t to buy back more loans than anticipated this week american home mortgage investment corp in melville n y cut its first quarter earnings forecast citing the poor market for alt a loans at wells fargo most of the subprime loans still on its books were made through the companys consumer finance offices not by volume obsessed mortgage brokers which should help reduce the possibility of sloppy underwriting during boom times the bank steered clear of interest only and no documentation loans for less credit worthy borrowers and wells fargo doesnt make any negative amortization or option adjustable rate mortgages the bank says it has purchased mortgage insurance for all subprime loans with high loan to value ratios a key metric wells fargo is "very smart with credit " concludes sam lippe co manager of tamarack value fund a boston mutual fund with &# million in assets as of february it holds about shares of the banks shares "we dont see the company blowing up at all " mr lippe says unfortunately wells fargo didnt help itself by keeping private many details about its co issue arrangements when the subprime business was booming but once it decided to tell investors more wells fargo also asked trade publications to subtract those loans from the totals used to calculate industry wide rankings as a result revised figures dropped the bank from the biggest to the ninth largest subprime lender in with &# billion in originations such loans were to of wells fargos overall loan portfolio as of dec analysts estimate "they removed the target from their back " says guy cecala publisher of inside b&amp c lending a bethesda md newsletter that tracks subprime lending in a written statement a wells fargo spokeswoman says changing how the bank reports its subprime volume will help "make clear the distinction between our co issuance volume and volume we originate " skeptics fret that recently tightened subprime lending standards and job cuts of about employees are proof that wells fargo isnt immune to the ongoing shakeout the bank also has sustained losses in its subprime auto loan business though it is taking steps to shore up collections any stumble when wells fargo releases first quarter earnings april could deflate the stocks p e multiple even more gary townsend a friedman billings ramsey &amp co analyst who rates wells fargo the equivalent of a "buy " says concerns about its subprime exposure are "exaggerated " turmoil could help the bank as weaker competitors are weeded out he adds according to thomson financial of the analysts following wells fargo have a "buy" recommendation on
