hot topic battle brews over executive privilege top democrats threatened to cite the white house for criminal contempt this past week if it continues to refuse to turn over documents related to the firings of eight federal prosecutors a congressional committee has given the white house until monday to explain its basis for claiming executive privilege in withholding documents and testimony congress also has set a july deadline for the white house to respond to subpoenas in its investigation of the warrantless wiretapping program approved by president bush shortly after both challenges bring the democratic led congress and the white house closer to a constitutional showdown over congresss investigative powers and the presidents use of executive privilege to keep discussions secret heres a closer look what does congress want congressional investigators want testimony under oath internal emails and other documents from white house advisers to learn if some of the presidents senior advisers discussed firing eight u s attorneys last year and if so why the white house has offered private interviews with advisers that wouldnt be under oath and that wouldnt be transcribed or recorded separately investigators want internal documents about the legality of the national security agencys warrantless wiretapping program and agreements with telecommunications companies that cooperated with the initiative several republicans have joined democrats in calling for attorney general alberto gonzales to resign over the prosecutor firings and the senate judiciary committee voted to approve subpoenas in the surveillance investigation in a vote two weeks ago what is the white house response president bushs rationale for invoking executive privilege matches those of past presidents advisers wont offer candid guidance to the president if they fear being forced to testify about those deliberations before congress the bush administration has worked hard to re establish executive authority that it believes was weakened by several post watergate presidents who conceded too much to congress what are the chances of a compromise if history is any guide a compromise between both sides is likely congress has issued only citations for contempt since and most are settled before criminal proceedings begin but two wild cards could make confrontation more likely president bushs lame duck status and his low approval ratings "what makes this situation different is the fact that president bush is in almost a no lose situation politically " notes mark rozell a political scientist at george mason university congress and the white house traditionally avoid a court showdown because both sides view the risks of losing as too great a ruling against congress for example could hamper future congressional investigations and a ruling the other way could unravel the bush administrations efforts at rebuilding presidential power and if the case went to court the investigations could drag on through the end of president bushs term carrying political risks for each party democrats could jeopardize their leadership of congress if they are seen as using all of their power for investigation and not legislation republicans want to stem negative headlines that ongoing investigations could produce during the election season how would the supreme court rule it is a legal gray area because courts have traditionally avoided settling such disputes "we have an area where there are good faith legal positions on both sides " says cass sunstein a constitutional law professor at the university of chicago law school the supreme court issued its landmark ruling on executive privilege in the case of u s v nixon when president nixon invoked executive privilege to withhold audiotapes of oval office conversations he and his colleagues had regarding the watergate break in the court upheld the principle of executive privilege especially regarding military and diplomatic secrets in addition to communications with the president but it forced the president to hand over the tapes leading to the presidents resignation when it ruled that executive privilege wasnt absolute legal experts warn that the case offers few clues about how the court might rule on the current dispute because it addressed a criminal investigation and not a demand from congress the administration takes comfort from a supreme court ruling that said the white house didnt have to reveal which energy industry lobbyists met with vice president dick cheneys energy task force in and the administration won a procedural victory on friday when a federal appeals court said that the american civil liberties union and other plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the presidents warrantless surveillance program but other recent court rulings have been skeptical of president bushs broad claims of executive power rejecting administration arguments that courts had no jurisdiction over guantanamo prisoners and striking down the white house effort to create special military courts without congressional authorization legal experts say that the military commission decision casts doubt on the legality of the presidents domestic surveillance initiative because it was done without the consent of congress nick timiraos points of view its really a high stakes constitutional game of chicken and at the end of the day the stakes are so high that somebodys going to blink " ray shepherd former chief counsel and staff director senate permanent subcommittee on investigations facts presidential aides have testified before congress times since world war ii either voluntarily or under a subpoena according to the chairmen of the senate and house judiciary committees the constitution doesnt explicitly give congress the power to issue subpoenas or contempt citations the supreme court has upheld the practice since first ruling on the issue in anyone who is cited for contempt of congress faces a year in prison and a fine of as much as &# congress last passed contempt charges in executive privilege isnt mentioned in the constitution george washington and thomas jefferson invoked the privilege during their administrations arguing that it was part of the separation of powers before this year president bush had invoked executive privilege on one other occasion when in he refused to give to congress documents of prosecutors decision making in cases ranging from decades old boston murders to the fund raising probe of president clintons campaign
