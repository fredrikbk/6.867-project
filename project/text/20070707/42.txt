pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings whatever happened to regional critics in the fine arts a shortage of local informed reviews is bad news new york were the last generation of newspaper critics you know " a new york drama critic told me the other day "after us everybody will be online " forecasts of apocalypse tomorrow usually turn out to have been exaggerated but this one is looking more plausible than most the atlanta journal constitution recently dropped its book review section though it continues to run reviews so many other papers have cut back on the space they devote to books that the national book critics circle has launched a "campaign to save the book review " several major newspapers including the chicago sun times and minneapolis star tribune no longer have full time classical music critics and regional movie critics like stand alone newspaper book sections are fast becoming an endangered species whats going on the answer is painfully simple newspaper circulation is declining driven downward by the rise of the new web based media and many papers are trimming their staffs to make ends meet whenever times get tough at an american newspaper fine arts coverage gets thrown off the back of the sled first and thats whats happening now not surprisingly critics and arts advocates are up in arms over the latest wave of cutbacks and some of them seem to think that amateur artbloggers who post their opinions for free on the web instead of publishing them for money on paper are part of the problem richard schickel times film critic actually published a testy op ed in the los angeles times in which he compared blogging to "finger painting" "i dont think its impossible for bloggers to write intelligent reviews i do think however that a simple love of reading or movie going or whatever is an insufficient qualification for the job we have to find in the work of reviewers something more than idle opinion mongering we need to see something other than flash egotism and self importance we need to see their credentials and they need to prove not merely assert their right to an opinion " speaking as a veteran newspaper critic who started a blog four years ago i suspect that mr schickel hasnt looked at very many artblogs i on the other hand read dozens of them each week in fact i now spend more time reading art related blog postings than print media reviews increasingly theyre sharper livelier and timelier than their old media competition this is why i have mixed feelings about the decline of regional newspaper criticism much of which is uneven in quality and not a little of which is pointless why for instance should a medium size newspaper run locally written reviews of blockbuster movies or beach blanket novels thats like assigning a restaurant critic to discuss the difference between big macs and whoppers to the limited extent that such commodity art requires "serious" criticism wire service copy will do the job perfectly well the fine arts however are a different story one of the most important civic duties that a newspaper performs is to cover the activities of local arts groups but it cant do that effectively without also employing knowledgeable critics who are competent to evaluate the work of those groups mere reportage while essential is only the first step its not enough to announce that the hooterville art museum finally bought itself a picasso you also need a staffer who can tell you whether its worth hanging just as you need someone who knows whether the hooterville repertory companys production of "private lives" was funny for the right reasons can bloggers do that of course and some of them do it better than their print media counterparts you wont find a more thoughtful literary critic than houstons patrick kurp www evidenceanecdotal blogspot com a more imaginative commentator on music than san franciscos heather heise www musewings blogspot com or a better informed art writer than tyler green of washington d c www artsjournal com man but blogging valuable though it can be is no substitute for the day to day attention of a newspaper whose editors seek out experts hire them on a full time basis and give them enough space to cover their beats adequately the problem is that fewer and fewer newspapers seem willing to do that in any consistent way i dont care for the word "provincial " but i cant think of a more accurate way to describe a city whose local paper is unwilling to make that kind of commitment to the fine arts to be sure its hard for medium size regional newspapers to attract serious critics but it can be done indeed a well edited regional paper is often the best possible place for an up and coming young critic to learn his trade i got my start reviewing second string classical concerts for the kansas city star years ago now that such entry level jobs are drying up i fear for the future of arts journalism in america any artist whos been side swiped by a lame brained critic will doubtless be tempted to cheer this news before such aggrieved folk break out the dom perignon though they should pay heed to the warning of virgil thomson who dominated american music criticism in the s and s "perhaps criticism is useless certainly it is often inefficient but it is the only antidote we have to paid publicity " if you think you can do without that antidote more power to you but youd better be prepared to buy a lot of ads mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write
