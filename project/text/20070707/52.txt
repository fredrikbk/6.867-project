digital watches with their space age readouts bulova was already a venerable name in the watch business when mr henshel took the reins as president in founded in by his grandfather jacob bulova as a jewelry shop in new yorks financial district the company grew to become the largest american producer of watches for the middle and luxury markets starting in mr henshel targeted the budget market by signing an agreement with japans citizen watch co for inexpensive watches it marketed under the caravelle brand to compete with inexpensive timex corp timepieces bulova also made military fuses and timers for sporting events but the biggest coup for mr henshel who died june at age in scarsdale n y was the accutron an early electronic watch instead of a mainspring and a balance wheel a battery powered transistor circuit sent impulses to the watchs tiny vibrating tuning fork which in turn drove the hands bulova guaranteed the watch to be accurate to within two seconds a day a brisk seller it became a staple gift of state during the johnson administration and an accutron mechanism ticked off seconds for a seismometer moonwalkers left behind to transmit lunar data from the sea of tranquility the company was adept at marketing since the days when it swapped free clocks to early radio stations in exchange for on air mentions of "bulova watch time" and boasted of its fifth avenue observatory to get the right time from the movements of the stars in its annual report the company claimed its mid to high end bulova brand had of the american market for wristwatches while accutron

shockproof while bulova relied mainly on its proprietary accutron technology at the high end it failed to emphasize the quartz watch battery powered timekeepers that used the vibration of a quartz crystal instead of a turning fork and promised even greater accuracy and bulova treated digital watches as a fad its first line didnt appear until five years after pulsar unveiled the product
