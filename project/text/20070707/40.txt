pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations we need to talk it is late afternoon in manhattan on the fourth of july and im walking along on lexington and th in front of bloomingdales suddenly in my sight theres a young woman standing on a street grate she is short about feet tall and stocky with a broad brown face she is i think latin american maybe of indian blood she has a big pile of advertisements in her hand and puts one toward me "mens suits new york to off sale armani canali hugo boss dkny zegna tailor on premises excellent service large selection " then the address and phone number you might have seen this person before shes one of a small army of advertisement giver outers in new york which means her life right now consists of standing in whatever weather and trying to give passersby a thing most of them dont want if this is her regular job she spends most of her time being rebuffed or ignored by busy people blurring by you should always take an advertisement or from the advertisement giver outers just to give them a break because once they give out all the ads they can go back and get paid so i took the ad and thanked her and walked on and then half a block later i turned around i thought of a woman id met recently who had gone through various reverses in life and now had a new job as a clerk in the back room of a store she was happy to have it a new beginning but there was this thing they didnt want to pay for air conditioning so she sweltered all day this made her want to weep just talking about it ever since that conversation i have been so grateful for my air conditioning i had forgotten long ago to be grateful for it anyway i look back at the woman on the street grate its summer and shes in heavy jeans and a black sweatshirt with a hood on top of that literally shes wearing a sandwich board mens suits new york her hair is long and heavy her ponytail limp on her shoulders shes out here on a day when everybody else as she well knows the streets are not crowded is at a ballgame or the beach everyone else is off so i turned around and went back i wanted to say something i dont know what find out where she was from encourage her i said hello and she looked at me and i patted her arm and said "happy fourth of july my friend " she was startled and then shy and she smiled and made a sound and i realized she doesnt speak english "god bless you " i said because a little while in america and you know the word god just as minutes in mexico and you learn the word dios and we both smiled and nodded and i left i went into bloomingdales and wrote these words "we must speak the same language so we can hearten each other " the question of whether america should have an "official language " of whether english should be formally declared our "national language " is bubbling and will be back in congress the next few sessions when you look at papers outlining the facts of the debate things break down into dryness very quickly should "issues of language diversity" be resolved by imposing "linguistic uniformity" this is like asking if the robots should speak logarithmically or algorithmically there are few things you can rely on in this turbulent world but one is the tendency of academics to use language poorly even when discussing language but theres something odd about the english question it feels old fashioned because we all know america has an official language and a national language and that it is english in france they speak french and in china they speak chinese in canada they have two national languages but thats one reason canada often seems silly they dont even know what language they dream in the real question ultimately is whether america wants to go that route should we allow america to devolve into a nation of two official languages in this case following recent demographic trends and realities english and spanish weve never done that in more than years it would be radical and destructive to do it now we speak english here its a great language luckily a rich one its how we do government and business its the language of the official life the outer life in america as for the inner life of america the language of the family it would be just as odd to change longtime tradition there which has always been anything goes you speak what you came over speaking and you learn the new language italian immigrants knew two languages english and italian they enriched the first with the second this was a great gift to all of us and wound up with greater opportunities for personal communication to boot talk about win win and so with every group from every place but in a deeper sense we should never consider devolving from one national language down into two or three because if we do we wont understand each other and were confused enough as it is in the future with the terrible problems we face we are going to need to understand each other more and more better and better were going to need to know how to say "this way" and "let me help" and "stop" and "here " were going to have to negotiate our way through a lot of challenges some dramatic some immediate and it will make it all the harder all the more impossible seeming if we cant even take each others meaning and be understood the only other debate i suppose we should really be having on languages is how to help our future generations learn more of them mexican immigrants who speak spanish and english have a leg up here and will benefit from it we live in the world and we want that world to understand us better we want to understand it better too europe is lucky all those different cultures and languages are bundled up all close to each other and next to each other they learn each others languages with ease we have oceans to the left and right and vastness for us or at least the older of us learning another language is still a leap as a nation we probably should leap more but on english as the language in which we live our shared national life and share our culture and our dreams we should stay where we are which hasnt for years now and counting been a bad place to be
