pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece a beautiful confusion istanbuls hagia sophia seems to yearn for its past sanctity anatomy of a classic approaching istanbul by water as travelers did in past centuries the eye is intoxicated by the skylines punctuation of domes and minarets luminescing in sea light the spectral blue mosque sails by then the sultans palace and then the strange ancient futuristic form of hagia sophia bulking like a giant jedi helmet cast from dark red masonry as most observers have noted the church of the holy wisdom aya sofya to the turks appears enclosed and inscrutable from the outside more impregnable than inviting predictably so perhaps as it was designed by fort builders those massive arched supports attached from without like robotic arms doing pushups theyre called flying buttresses were added in later centuries to steady the structure the great byzantine emperor justinian who smote the barbarians codified the laws and secured the empires borders built the church from to actually he rebuilt on the site of one recently destroyed by riots and fire he fully purposed that it stand as a formidable emblem of faith and power proclaiming eastern orthodoxy as the inheritor of the mantle of rome in the city of constantine rome itself had been sacked a century before and now declined into the dark ages for hundreds of years hagia sophia served its purpose as the supreme edifice of christianity the worlds most desirable stand alone chunk of sacred real estate it proved irresistible in fact to would be conquerors armies of arabians bulgars russians and others tried and failed to take constantinople with hagia sophia as its richest prize in the end it was despoiled in by christian knights from western europe on the fourth crusade and ultimately turned into a mosque by the ottoman turks when fatih sultan mehmet conquered the city in the sultan famously rebuked a soldier he found hacking at a column in the church and instantly ordered its preservation along with most other buildings he too considered himself the inheritor of rome in the post ottoman era to avoid religious animosity over its use mustafa kemal sensibly turned it into a museum in justinian manifestly never intended hagia sophia to have a human scale and informally user friendly feel the main communicants after all were monks priests bureaucrats noblemen and the royal retinue he did however envision it as magnificently monumental which is precisely how it feels even today in its deracinated tourist infested incarnation in our time we often see lofty atriums around us in hotels and office buildings but the size and height of justinians dome was unprecedented remained unparalleled for a millennium until michelangelos st peters and still seems astonishing at some stories high ones first impression upon entering the central nave the main space is of rembrandt hued cavernous gloom paneled by shades of marble and studded with huge looming pillars some borrowed from pagan sites veined gray marble pocked greenish marble pietra dure in walls and floors pillars whose marble seems to have flowed with time like thick antique glass surround the onlooker airy radiance dissipates the gloom as the eye travels up past the windowed galleries to the gold painted ceiling to the great dome raised on semidomes and arches finally to the sun trap of the cupola one contemporary observed that it all seemed "not illuminated by the sun from outside but by glow generated from within so great an abundance of light bathes this shrine all about " light symbolized holy wisdom and celestial truth and was intentionally curated into the design one of the almightys own special effects gold mosaic covered the entire dome face in justinians time multiplying the shimmer an earthquake later shook off much of that mosaic also silver sheeting covered numerous surfaces such as the bishops pulpit while high officials wore gold ceremonial garb so one imagines how exquisitely light scintillated about during byzantine services the ottomans preserved what was left of the mosaics most of them post justinian which they plastered over with care because in holy places islam forbids the depiction of living beings as a form of icon worship experts have uncovered them slowly some are still astonishing hovering archangels with powerful wings just below the dome seem about to swoop down on the congregation the famed th century deesis mosaic of the virgin jesus and john the baptist standing in trio caught in their fates feels profoundly intimate and heralds early renaissance humanism on either side of jesus the virgin mary and john the baptist can barely endure their inescapable roles an observer from justinians time commented that "whenever you go to pray at the church you believe at once that it is not by human power or skill but by divine influence that this church has been so wonderfully built the visitors mind is lifted up on high to god feeling that he cannot be far away but must love to dwell in this place " these days its hard to feel what they must have felt shimmer and ceremony are displaced by renovators scaffolding and the deritualized flow of gawping crowds looking for coherence one realizes it always needed and always had ordered processions to impose sense on its inchoate decor every element flows into the next and often not symmetrically upper gallery colonnades for example dont echo ground floor ones in symmetry color or size one doesnt know how to take it all in the eye finds no rest except perhaps internally in prayer allowing the space to assemble a theater for ones thoughts the ottomans added beautiful touches but often so misaligned and ill fitting that they compound the confusion their famous giant oval discs of calligraphy lovely in themselves hang inaptly where they can by all accounts though the sultans revered their acquisition hagia sophias centuries as a mosque were filled with rapt awe the murmur of prayer consecrating the structures otherwise overwhelming scale stand there long enough and you get the message this place yearns for its past sanctity it doesnt much reward aimless staring it asks for ritual and invocation and in return its muse will come alive then everything will fall into place mr kaylan writes about culture for the journal
