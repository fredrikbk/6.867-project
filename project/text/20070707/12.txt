etf price war looms as vanguard looks to catch up new product takes aim at big barclays fund mr bogles dissent a potentially cutthroat price war is shaping up between two of the biggest firms in the exchange traded fund business in coming weeks vanguard group plans to roll out an etf designed to directly undercut one of the biggest products on the market from rival barclays global investors a unit of barclays plc the etf world is closely tracking the race jim wiandt publisher of the popular index research web site indexuniverse com has called the vanguard etf a full "frontal assault" on bgi etfs resemble index tracking mutual funds but trade on an exchange their selling point is low costs compared with traditional mutual funds so fees are a crucial differentiating feature for investors the move is one of vanguards most important efforts to play catch up in the booming etf business the etf at the center of the battle tracks the popular msci eafe index a broad benchmark of developed market stocks in may vanguard filed with regulators to launch the vanguard europe pacific etf to track the index vanguards new etf which will trade on the american stock exchange takes aim at a similar one from bgi the ishares msci eafe etf the vanguard fund will have an expense ratio of which is less than half the cost of the bgi fund vanguards unusual business structure it is owned by the firms clients helps it keep fees relatively low compared with rivals with more than &# billion in assets the ishares product is bgis largest etf by far more than twice the size of its next largest fund it is also the second largest in the etf industry overall accounting for about of u s etf assets it is about the size of famous mutual funds like fidelity investments magellan and has become a cash cow for bgi which earned &# million in management fees for the fund last year up almost from thanks to a steady increase in assets vanguard says it is launching the new etf because "its important to offer competitive products in broad market segments" like this says gus sauter vanguards chief investment officer it isnt necessarily a "duplicative offering " even though vanguards etf will track the same benchmark says noel archard of bgi that is because the two firms offer different support services to investors and financial advisers he says the vanguard fund is also tax managed meaning it uses investment strategies specifically to avoid taxable capital gains distributions the new product is the latest of several aggressive efforts between the two firms in one of the highest profile moves in the industry mr archard left vanguard last year to join bgi where he now is in charge of u s ishares product development in april the firm announced a vanguard veteran was joining as a new national sales manager the launch is a big step for vanguard the godfather of low cost index mutual funds it has fallen far behind in etfs in recent years one challenge has been losing access to an etf for the ever popular standard &amp poors stock index thanks to a lawsuit standard &amp poors corp won a few years ago that precluded vanguard from using its s&amp p and many other indexes for etfs under its existing licensing agreements other hurdles have included an explosion of competitors rapidly launching products for popular market niches and backlash from its own founder and former chief executive jack bogle who has emerged as one of etfs most vocal detractors mr bogle has voiced concern about trading costs and misuse of narrowly focused etfs that dont track broad market swaths vanguard executives note that mr bogle hasnt been directly involved in running the firm for several years vanguards etf strategy is typical of the firm try to beat out rivals with low fees and broad market exposure in the past this strategy has generally proven successful against mutual fund rivals but in the etf world the effectiveness of this strategy remains unclear given bgis lead currently bgi dwarfs not only vanguard but all other etf rivals it now controls about of the u s etf market with more than funds this compares with vanguards market share of more than in products of which were launched only in the past two years bgi also had the most net inflows in the mutual fund industry overall last year after capital research &amp managements american funds bumping vanguard from that perch according to stock and bond asset data from financial research corp bgi says it has no plans to change its fees on the etf for now while the firm has lowered fees on several products over the years it has generally been because they accumulated enough assets to warrant the reductions not necessarily so they could underprice competitors since last year for instance bgi lowered expense ratios on more than international etfs by four percentage points and on products for health care and technology by percentage points the new product is vanguards latest effort to undercut the industry titan this year it also launched products like the vanguard total bond market etf which holds about bonds and charges in expenses the comparable ishares etf charges in fees and holds about bonds a smaller sample size that bgi says still lets it track the benchmark well such efforts seem to be paying off for vanguard its etf assets have roughly doubled to more than &# billion since last year vanguard offers its etfs as share classes of its mutual funds today the vanguard total stock market etf and vanguard large cap etf are some of the cheapest etfs on the market selling at a expense ratio but there are holes in vanguards etf lineup mainly it lacks an etf to track the s&amp p besides the ishares msci eafe etf the two other biggest etfs today are the spdr s&amp p etf from state street global advisors and the ishares s&amp p etf those two funds together comprise almost of u s etf assets corrections &amp amplifications barclays global investors lowered expense ratios on more than international exchange traded funds by percentage point and on products for health care and technology by percentage point since last year a july money &amp investing article incorrectly said the expense ratios were lowered by four and percentage points respectively wsj july
