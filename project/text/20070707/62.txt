the weekend interview with ahmed chalabi survivor baghdad these people need help the army must help them more the government must help them more they have been fighting alone against a vicious enemy fighting for all of us to make our country safe " im in diyala province watching ahmed chalabi shouting into a tv camera over the sound of mortar shells hes imploring the iraqi state to support tribesmen fighting off al qaeda attacks such as the one were now experiencing in the end our entourage which had driven from baghdad for lunch with local leaders escaped unharmed but the episode showed as so many events in his turbulent past few years have that mr chalabi is hardly the transient opportunist that his detractors at the state department cia and on the antiwar left once made him out to be hes still in iraq despite long ago losing whatever american support he once had and failing to win a seat in the last parliamentary election he was deputy prime minister in iraqs first elected government and almost alone among the iraqi political figures he not only lives but travels widely outside the green zone last month i spent some days in mr chalabis company in and out of the capital and at his residence in a well fortified warren of cul de sacs in the wealthy but dangerous mansour district though hes not in the current maliki government he is still courted by the state and given key appointments he heads up the de baathification program and the committee for public support of the "surge " which engages in reconciliation activities like reopening sunni mosques in shiite neighborhoods community leaders from all sides troop through his doors daily returning residents back to their purged neighborhoods mr chalabi says "is a slow process because people have to learn to trust each other all over again theyre often glad to see their old neighbor again and it can be very emotional and moving but underneath it you cant be sure because after all theyve had brothers or fathers killed perhaps by people in their neighborhood reconciliation takes time " on one occasion in the post prayer evening hours we visited the football field sized mosque complex of khadimiya in baghdad it is one of iraqs top shiite holy sites decorated intricately with floral tiling and cut mirror facades wearing his trademark suit and tie mr chalabi was continuously mobbed by crowds of women and children astonished and delighted that a famous official should appear in public and lend an ear to their complaints not an hour before a motorbike borne suicide bomber had been disarmed nearby mr chalabi would appear to be the nearest thing iraqis currently possess to a genuine walk and talk democratic politician one who will risk life and limb to embody the principle personally in fact the u s s main error in iraq according to mr chalabi has been trying to micromanage the development of iraqi politics "the u s should make a choice " he says "either to accept full democracy and live with the consequences or undertake full control they keep trying to give local initiatives a boost instead of letting iraqi democracy succeed on its own when you make your own mistakes you learn when outsiders make them unfortunately they get treated as the enemy " his recounting of post war iraqi history which began with the high handed regency of l paul bremer and then the appointed iraqi government of ayad allawi returns again and again to this point "the problems began when the u s declared an official occupation " he says "we told the u s not to have an occupation that it would be a disaster we never intended that we wanted the iraqis to run their own affairs but we were not trusted to do that two years ahead of time we asked the u s for a man multiethnic military police force of iraqis to be trained we were refused " mr chalabi continues "we could have prevented the looting and the disbanding of the army we planned to deploy in front of the army barracks to disarm the soldiers and keep them in their barracks and tell them we are your brothers help us run the country keep order and have democracy we intended to pay them and absorb them selectively into our ranks we had good intelligence we knew who was who look at it now the u s has had six intelligence chiefs since the war started they keep changing do the allies get any useful intelligence " with such views mr chalabi quickly added parts of the bush administration to his enemies on the antiwar left relations became so strained during the bremer era that on may u s soldiers raided his offices in baghdad he was also accused of leaking intelligence to iranian operatives inside iraq to the effect that the u s had broken their communication codes from mr chalabis side the accusation meets with a ready dismissal "its strange that the iranians then used the same code to inform tehran of the fact " but mr chalabi remains unrepentant in his criticism of what he calls "elementary mistakes" by the u s which he believes would not have happened if iraqis had run things from the start "we always said keep the allied military here for a while but not as part of an occupation government that was the point when the president said mission accomplished he should have followed through and handed civilian government over to iraqis as was originally agreed " so much for the past does he think the "surge" will succeed "not if its just a military action " he says "its intended as a political initiative backed by military force it creates the opportunity for political initiatives to work but they must be pursued it wont work forever without underlying political agreements if sadr city stayed quiet for some months its because there was a political rapprochement and moqtada al sadr agreed to rein in his militia but paradoxically the overall political scene may not clarify while the u s is too engaged all sides are waiting for the real iraq to emerge from underneath the u s shadow only when they have to face each other directly will iraqis make their deals " mr chalabis hardheaded views on the allied occupation have an implicit flipside that some beneficent outcome can still be shaped from the chaos and that iraq can gain stability even or especially without u s ballast doesnt he think as most outside commentators do that a u s withdrawal will create an all out regional conflict sucking in nearby countries "id say its possible but not probable look at everyone who works for me from all sides of iraqi society people want peace they want to go back to their homes if the u s leaves the present government will fall and there will be elections quickly " to mr chalabis thinking this will improve things because iraqis will choose their real leaders and they will be accountable to the electorate for delivering peace and practical benefits such as electricity and water "still in the end " he says "u s policy in iraq will not be determined by the interests of iraqis but by u s strategic interests and by u s domestic pressures the iraqi conflicts domestic unpopularity will drive americas decisions on its presence here in my view being constructive in preventing conflict is the surest way for the u s to exercise positive influence in the region iraq is a very strategic country it borders six countries including the gulf so its in u s interests to keep it stable and to keep influence in it " after listening to mr chalabi over time one learns how to hear the meaning in his more cautious phrases by the "real iraq" he likely means the majority shiite dominated iraq he talks about how "the sunnis have lost the battle for baghdad " and that the arab states having incited them to fight ultimately abandoned them in ways comparable to the palestinian conflicts with israel he believes that the sunnis will ultimately face reality and make accommodation with fellow iraqis once they accept that they are an even smaller minority than previously thought some shiite to sunni in baghdad by his estimates this perhaps is what mr chalabi means by "letting iraqi democracy succeed" that is letting the sheer weight of numbers dictate "being constructive in preventing conflict" likely refers to the u s reining in arab support of sunni baathists and al qaeda in iraq mr chalabi has had a lifelong feud with baathists and one feels that he regards their car bombs as more dangerous and destructive to iraqs future than the shiite militias still he defends his position as evenhanded "with baathists its more complicated than sunni vs shiite " he says "there were more shiite than sunni baathists the shiites hate them whereas in sunni areas theyre quite popular " in his de baathification program he has he says returned most of the baathists either to their jobs or pensions "there were some million party members and we have reintegrated all but some and those are the hardcore ones and only of those dont have their pensions the u s now wants us to return all the baathists to their former positions or comparable ones but with the old military and security personnel thats impossible theyre too hated we just cant do it " its dangerous mr chalabi believes even to return sunni baathists to certain key strategic posts such as those responsible for guarding electricity plants he draws a rough s shaped diagram and says "saddam positioned electric plants around baghdad in that configuration the very people he put in charge of protecting them are now wrecking them to choke the city thats one reason why we dont have electricity " most interesting perhaps are mr chalabis views on iran which differ substantially from the alarm expressed by many of his current and former american backers "the influence of iran on iraq is inevitable " he says "its been there for centuries they supported the anti saddam resistance for years they were the first to accept trade agreements transit rights electricity linkups and the like with the new iraqi government some of iraqs population lives within miles of iran we have an enormous land border in common and its the only country that ships goods to us unhindered " "i understand the u s has worries about iranian power so heres a solution " he continues "let us quantify and monitor the amount of iranian influence lets make an agreement on how much trade how much electricity how many trucks and so on can come through iraq needs as many friends as possible and nobody wants to be dependent on one source of help everything can be worked out we will have to in the end anyway what choice is there " mr kaylan is a writer living in new york
