pursuits travel summer trips moroccos dangerous mystique exotic hotels and busy markets are drawing travelers despite the risks marrakesh morocco im walking back to my hotel after an evening enjoying the public square here full of busy cafes and snake charmers but the day ends on a jarring note as i pick my way down twisting alleys too narrow for cars i soon realize that im lost a teenage boy presses upon me his services as a "guide " and he is so persistent that i eventually take shelter in a little open front restaurant visiting morocco can evoke that kind of anxiety there are real safety concerns the u s state department says the potential for "violence against american interests and citizens remains high " but more tourists keep coming drawn by an unusual combination of modern glamour and ancient history some million people visited morocco last year up almost since hundreds of old family mansions called riads are being converted into small luxurious hotels there are beaches on both the atlantic and mediterranean coasts mountains for hiking and vast stretches of desert for four wheel drive touring the drive across the high atlas mountains to the town of ait benhaddou the ancient mud walled kasbah featured in "lawrence of arabia" and "gladiator " is worth a trip to the country in itself above all there is fez the cultural capital and marrakesh a city that captures the fun and frantic spirit of the country both have vast medinas the old arab quarters which are full of twisting streets the fez medina is comparatively sedate and reflects more of the countrys history while the marrakesh medina throbs with the intensity and prosperity that the tourist revolution has brought zooming motorbikes on the cobblestone streets send pedestrians scurrying for cover rug merchants will grab the arm of visitors and attempt to pull them into their shops restaurants try to lure you to the outdoor dining tables that give you a ringside seat on all the action whether its taking a trip to bali beaches visiting the great monuments of jerusalem or braving the notorious crime in south africa to go on a safari instinct rather than government warnings seems to prevail for many travelers in the decision on traveling to any particular country and that instinct apparently counts heavily on the trendiness of the destination rather than on a weighing of the actual safety factors morocco for instance isnt on the list of more than two dozen countries that the state department recommends americans avoid but the country has sustained terrorist attacks and violence is a potential daily threat in march a suicide bomber blew himself up in a casablanca internet cafe wounding several people in april two men blew themselves up in casablanca near the u s consulate and the american language center just five days after three bombers did the same after being cornered by police michael brein a portland ore psychologist who specializes in travel calls the interest in more risky destinations "the cancun effect " a reference to the fact that mexicos upscale beach resort remains popular despite other parts of the country being plagued with robberies abductions and extortion attempts "we seek romance excitement and adventure just to the point of danger which is a fine line " he states "and the more expensive and exotic the destinations and hotels the more secure the tourists will feel " but is morocco really dangerous despite the night i got lost in the marrakesh medina morocco is generally a safe place to visit the streets of the medinas are patrolled by plainclothes policemen who will yank away and interrogate a young local man for even approaching a tourist penalties for crimes against foreigners are so severe that incidents of crime are minimal hotel owners and tourism officials claim morocco is "much safer than europe " insists adil douiri the countrys tourism minister "crime figures show this " peter sporn an associate professor of medicine at northwestern university who was on vacation in marrakesh with his family and friends says he hasnt felt a moment of danger "theres no hostility none " he says "weve encountered no one who has had a bad experience " the phenomenon of the riad has been one of the saviors of moroccan tourism a factor that helps put it into a category entirely apart from other arab lands mr douiri boasts that the riad found only in the medinas of fez and marrakesh is "a unique product theres no competition a hotel is a hotel but a riad is morocco " moroccan families who own crumbling old mansions are discovering that they can sell them for a small fortune to be turned into these high end boutique hotels marrakesh the center of moroccan tourism got its first one only a decade ago but today there are more than fez the cultural capital has although prices of rooms in riads run up to &# and although they lack some of the amenities of larger hotels many are booked solid six months in advance morocco is primarily a destination for european vacationers but so many americans are now patronizing the high end riads that when i had dinner in one all people in the four table dining room were from the u s while the riads are indeed luxurious theres a downside the rooms are long and narrow with windows only on one side looking out into the inner courtyard you have to keep your curtains closed since guests are walking past making the rooms dark and stuffy and since the alleys are too narrow for taxis going out for dinner can be a hassle in marrakesh the british co owner of riad noir divoire jill fechtmann can still barely believe what happened when her riad opened its doors last year in mid december "we were totally naive " she says "in hours we were fully booked for christmas and new years we have guests who have already been here two or three times " she calls marrakesh "unbelievable" "its so fashionable its now the st tropez of northern africa " trip planner morocco
