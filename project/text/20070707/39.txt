pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state picking the right glass i want to buy good wine glasses and was going to get riedel please let me know if you have another suggestion im not sure what type of glasses to get we mostly drink cabernet pinot noir and shiraz is one glass suitable for all three reds with a different one for whites andy schiffer demarest n j you certainly cant go wrong with glasses from riedel rhymes with needle and as you progress down the path of your wine journey it is fun to have different glasses for reds whites dessert wines and sparklers you might even decide at some point that you prefer older reds in a somewhat smaller glass than younger reds because the younger wines need more room to breathe and open up all that said however the first order of business is to get a nice everyday glass that you can simply use without thinking about it we dont know about you but after a day at work weve made enough decisions and we dont want to ponder our choice of wine glass we want a glass that will help both reds and whites show their best and that will be special enough to say "welcome home " but thats not so expensive that well cry if we break it our everyday glass is spiegelau vino grande burgundy which is available at wineenthusiast com for &# for a set of six its widely available elsewhere for a little more and a little less riedel owns spiegelau whatever glass you use here are some things to look for in short form a minimum capacity of ounces so there is plenty of room for the wine to breathe so you can swirl to your hearts content and because a larger glass feels more generous clear glass a slight inward curve at the top to focus the smells a stem thats long enough to hold comfortably and thin glass so you taste wine not glass decoding champagne while discussing champagne in one of your columns you explained what the "nm" and "rm" code numbers on the label indicated could you repeat what you had written also if champagne is to be stored for six months or more should it be stored cork down cork up or on its side peter weiner ventura calif bottles of real champagne from the champagne district of france have a tiny code on the front label its worth looking for most of the time it starts with nm meaning its a negociant wine made by a big producer rm means its a growers own wine and these can be excellent filled with personality and they are often good deals because most people have never heard of the producer you might also sometimes see cm which means its a cooperatives wine we store champagne on its side like other wines for the same reason to keep the cork moist and therefore the seal intact melanie grayce west contributed to this column
