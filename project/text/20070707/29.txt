progress report strong jobs data signal economy is gaining steam fed is wary of inflation despite wage restraint a goldilocks moment washington the job markets solid performance in june along with recent signs of vigor in manufacturing and a buoyant stock market suggest the u s economy is entering the second half with considerable steam despite nervousness on wall street about cracks in the credit markets and woes in housing employers outside agriculture added people to their payrolls in june and tallies for the previous two months were revised upward the labor department said friday unemployment remained a low the report suggests the economy is healthy enough to further diminish the chances that the federal reserve will cut interest rates in the next few months and investors friday pared back those odds at the same time the report cast doubt on the possibility that the job market is so tight it is fueling inflationary wage gains in short the u s economy seems to be enjoying a goldilocks moment not too hot not too cold after a few quarters of subpar growth and a few flickers of uncomfortably high inflation that conjured images of the s job growth averaged in the first half of the year slower than last years pace but faster than some fed officials anticipated given demographic changes that are slowing the growth of the labor force average growth in the wages of production and other nonsupervisory workers remained muted suggesting the low unemployment rate still isnt putting much pressure on labor costs the u s economy grew at an annual rate of just in the first quarter but forecasters expect the government to report at the end of july that gross domestic product grew at better than a pace in the second quarter because of volatile swings in inventories economists have averaged the first two quarters to get a clearer reading on the underlying health of the economy brian sack an economist with the forecasting firm macroeconomic advisers expects growth for the rest of this year to be close to the expected long term trend of just under and said "the employment situation is helping that outlook " nigel gault economist at global insight says second quarter growth which he expects was between and likely overstates the economys strength but he anticipates the rest of this year will be "closer to the second quarter" than to the first he anticipates second half growth will be about a wall street journal survey of forecasters released monday found that on average they see the economy growing at a pace in the third quarter and in the fourth though many anticipate growth above for the rest of the year corporate executives are sounding similar notes "the weakened industrial sector is currently limiting demand for transportation services " fedex corp s chief executive fred smith said in releasing the companys earnings late last month "but we expect the u s economy to begin to show modest year over year improvement in the late summer to early fall time frame " the fed still sees the labor market as tight and the low jobless rate has prompted it to warn that the "high level of resource utilization" could enable firms operating near full capacity and workers in a tight labor market to win higher prices and wages but the central bank is less certain than it was six months ago that the unemployment rate presages that sort of threat fed officials have expected the slowdown in growth to push up unemployment creating slack in the economy that would keep wage and price gains from accelerating the economy did slow but unemployment didnt rise and the pace of wage inflation didnt quicken a suggestion that the jobless rate though near a six year low isnt indicative of a worker shortage average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers rose in june from may the labor department said over the past year these earnings were up from a year earlier in line with the rate of growth for the past year consumer prices rose for the months ending in may the june reading comes july the more comprehensive employment cost index was up in the first quarter from the previous year close to the range for the past several years acceleration of broader measures of compensation in the first quarter may reflect the vagaries of employee stock options and one time bonuses janet yellen president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco in a speech delivered friday via video to the risk management institute of singapore before the release of the jobs data noted the possibility that "labor markets may not actually be particularly tight " she said it is possible that low unemployment amid slowing growth means the economys long term trend rate had dropped but she was open to "benign explanations" instead such uncertainty means that the fed while still expecting unemployment to rise may not need to see it rise as much to conclude that inflation risks are easing still the fed is likely to remain vigilant on inflation for now even if the job market isnt as tight as the low unemployment rate implies it remains "somewhat tight " ms yellen said which presents a risk of inflation the fed is also wary that a recent dip in core inflation which excludes food and energy is temporary and the indirect effects of rising import and commodity prices could yet nudge it up again with joblessness near six year lows and wages rising albeit slowly consumers have the wherewithal to keep spending despite continuing weakness in home prices which decreases homeowners wealth signs of a pullback by lenders and rising energy prices consumer spending makes up about two thirds of economic output even modest growth of this component can offset sizable drags in other sectors in a sign that weakness in housing hasnt rippled yet through the economy construction payrolls advanced last month construction employment gains were concentrated in nonresidential building and contracting which has remained resistant to the slowdown gripping the residential sector payrolls also rose in health care education leisure and government manufacturing firms cut jobs the th straight decline employment in retail trade and professional and business services also posted losses
