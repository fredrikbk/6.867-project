journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources asia some north koreans test regimes iron grip north korea is notorious for its repression of free expression and dissent but lately a few cracks have emerged in the regimes iron rule although outsiders have a very limited ability to know what transpires inside the secretive nation it appears some north koreans are testing the regimes absolutist grip on everyday life foreigners living in pyongyang say that people break petty laws daring to smoke beneath no smoking signs and sitting on the moving rail of escalators people have blocked traffic by selling furniture in streets famous for regimented traffic flow and some have dared break the seal on their radios that block the reception of nonstate provided broadcasts whats more north koreans gathered in public places are more willing to chat with foreigners the newsweekly says underground economic activity has picked up and another hallmark of less authoritarian societies crime is on the rise too chinese truck drivers report being intercepted by highway bandits these once unthinkable if minor acts of disobedience come amid what the economist calls the slow disintegration of pyongyangs "unique brand of stalinism " a process that began in the mid s famine during that time is thought to have killed one tenth of the population and presumably punctured many peoples belief in a long promised socialist paradise still pyongyang isnt showing any outward signs of insecurity about its future it has placed more restrictions on foreign aid groups and has recentralized the distribution of food the regime also is cracking down on north koreans seeking to illegally cross the border into china at the same time there are indications that the leadership is beset by infighting for a brief time following the february six nation agreement aimed at north koreas denuclearization fewer military officials were sighted in public with leader kim jong il lately the uniforms have returned the economist july media should journalists make their private lives public journalists could significantly enhance their credibility with the public if they disclosed more information about their backgrounds and personal interests says national journals william powers that is going too far responds cbsnews coms brian montopoli who says forcing journalists to reveal such details is both risky and unfair at one time says mr powers it might have made sense that media consumers knew little about the people delivering the news both print space and airtime were limited and the public had fewer apprehensions about journalists impartiality but today news organizations have web sites with unlimited room to divulge information the need for greater disclosure has increased too recent scandals at major news organizations have diminished journalists credibility mr powers the national journals media critic says the more open a reporter is about her life where she went to school where she used to work and what her political passions are "the less likely that readers will be suspicious of her work and motives " there is some value to the openness mr powers is advocating counters mr montopoli on a cbsnews site whose stated mission is "to bring transparency to the editorial operations of cbs news " but he asks where would the disclosures stop revealing information that might be considered highly relevant to a story the sexuality of a journalist who is reporting about gay marriage legislation for example would require the journalist to sacrifice his privacy "i dont think reporters should be contributing to political causes related to the issues they cover " writes mr montopoli "but there is something mccarthyesque about the idea that everything a reporter has done over the course of his life should be fodder for discrediting his work " national journal cbsnews com july aviation bats airborne maneuvers get on

model bats engage in airborne maneuvers that are more subtle and intricate than those of birds or airplanes scientists say the wings of the nocturnal mammals contain more than two dozen independent joints that help generate lift and reduce drag the curve in bat wings helps the animals carry out turns at angles impossible for birds and so sharp that they would cause existing airplanes to stop and
