pursuits books bloomsbury in love uncommon arrangements by katie roiphe dial press pages &# in harley granville barkers play "the madras house " a randy department store tycoon scandalizes his family by "turning turk " moving to arabia and marrying multiple wives it was absurd for him to endure societys censure for showing interest in his shopgirls he decided when a man of his means could easily support a whole harem of young women the fault then was not in himself but in society barker satirizes nicely the tortured sort of logic to which some of his intellectual contemporaries in britain resorted when explaining their own eccentric marriages in "uncommon arrangements " katie roiphe chronicles the romances and rationalizations of seven post victorian power couples who she says sought to modernize marriage turning it into a more humane and equitable partnership a goal that many today of course still strive for yet a century ago these advocates for the equality of women and skeptics of conventional morality found their efforts as messy and frustrating as forward thinking contemporary couples do ms roiphe is staunchly committed to feminism but to her credit she seems compulsively interested in picking away at its contradictions in particular marital equity for these couples often seems indistinguishable from equal opportunity philandering h g wells maintained prolonged and passionate extramarital affairs including one with rebecca west he would even go so far as to set up a mistress in a separate household though always with the understanding and approval of his wife jane who throughout his life remained his helpmeet confidante and private secretary bertrand russells older brother john francis russell did wells one better actually committing bigamy he was convicted of it in when he married before his unhappy first marriage had ended the third time was not a charm for russell his marriage to popular novelist elizabeth von arnim succeeded only in that he gave her plenty of fodder for ridicule in print the women in these partnerships were quite as romantically promiscuous von arnim herself had a hidden door installed in her bedroom at her house in france in order to facilitate her affairs with none other than h g wells society hostess ottoline morrell carried on with bertrand russell among many others painter vanessa bell lived the last several decades of her life with the erstwhile homosexual duncan grant while her husband clive never divorced her and even allowed her daughter by grant to be raised as his own because these people were intellectuals their affairs were more to them than just affairs attempting to modernize marriage was in keeping with their dreams for transforming the rest of society romantic urges must not be denied lest one become the sort of hypocrite that ones victorian parents were affairs or even flirtations were not to be hidden but discussed openly with ones spouse who was an artistic and intellectual companion as much as a romantic or sexual one what lifts "uncommon arrangements" well beyond warmed over gossip is that ms roiphe is more interested in her subjects theories about their own behavior than in the behavior itself they had "an enduring faith in rationality in the power of intellect to subdue emotion " she writes by formalizing what one of them called the semi detached marriage "they believed they could control and organize their intimate lives " this book then provides another lesson that an intellectual should never be allowed to organize anything for into eden jealousy anger and resentment inevitably did creep in practice almost all these supposedly "open" relationships were decidedly one sided jane wells loved her husband too much to rebuke him ms roiphe argues in return for feeling that she was collaborating in the advancement of morals she could savor the rather hollow victory of knowing that no matter what wells occasionally told his mistresses he would never leave her ottoline morrells husband philip comes across as a kind but pathetic creature whose forays into romance seemed restricted to making occasional passes at a nonplussed virginia woolf the children of vanessa bell grew up justifiably confused a daughters decision to marry one of her fathers former male lovers understandably upset the poor woman ms roiphe takes her subjects ideas and dilemmas seriously though not quite as seriously as they took themselves and from that discrepancy arises much of the books wisdom and wit her writing displays an intimate knowledge of the era and when she resorts to speculating about her subjects interior states her guesses are always limited and convincing i was less convinced however by ms roiphes contention that her subjects theories about marriage have much to say to us in the present day the revolution in marriage that these men and women sought never took place waited on by servants and accustomed to packing children off to boarding school from as young as they never struggled with the primary challenges faced by most modern couples their problem wasnt how to square family life with work but how to pursue both marriage and sexual promiscuity ms roiphe never really makes the perhaps obvious point that in an age when divorce was difficult and socially frowned upon one of the most practical ways to seek sexual variety was to find a cooperative spouse today of course partners who want to sleep around generally end up getting a divorce and a wife who shows a wayward husband the door may well be praised as strong minded not blamed for adhering to any "old fashioned" idea of marriage in short the marriage bond has survived modernization better than most other institutions even many of those whose homosexuality would have scandalized some of ms roiphes supposed bohemians now sing the virtues of the sacralized monogamous bond if the lives recounted in "uncommon arrangements" have anything to teach us it may be that marriage is a tougher institution than we typically give it credit for tougher too than the flawed comic characters who so often make a mess of it mr propson is an editor at the week
