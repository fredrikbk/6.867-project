the week ahead our take on coming events aerospace boeing plans a grand unveiling for dreamliner but can it fly by j lynn lunsford after five years of tantalizing aerophiles with artists renderings of a futuristic jetliner called the dreamliner boeing co this weekend is going to throw the equivalent of an aerospace industry debutante party to reveal the first glimpse of the actual plane on sunday amid fanfare usually associated with the visit of a pope or a president the ceremony at its everett wash manufacturing facility will be broadcast world wide on satellite tv in nine different languages in the seattle area boeing is expecting so much interest that it has rented out the seattle seahawks football stadium so that those who arent on the person a list to witness it personally at the factory can watch on a giant screen the dreamliners rollout ceremony marks a major milestone that proves boeing has been able to bring together enough parts to assemble at least one airplane the real test will be whether boeing will be able to keep its promise to begin delivering the first planes in may "well celebrate for a day and then as soon as the partys over the plane goes back into the hangar to get it ready for its first flight " said mike bair the boeing vice president who has led the development of what has become the most popular jetliner boeing has ever launched the chicago aerospace company has accumulated orders from airline customers by promising that a combination of lightweight carbon fiber composite building materials and fuel sipping engines will make the plane less costly to operate and a third less expensive to maintain than current long haul jetliners the value of the orders for the plane total about &# billion at list prices roughly equal to the gross domestic product of new zealand the orders also mean up to final assembly jobs at boeing a figure that doesnt take into account the suppliers where of the dreamliner will be built mr bair and other top boeing officials insist that the airplane will be delivered on time but they acknowledge that many of the companys suppliers are struggling to meet the ambitious schedule during last months paris air show mr bair was asked if he would have done anything differently on the project he joked that an additional "three months would have been nice " boeing officials need only to look across the atlantic ocean to see what can happen if they mess up europes airbus rolled out its giant a superjumbo jet on jan in an elaborate ceremony where the unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co portrayed the double decked airliner as the culmination of all human thinking up to that point in history months later airbus acknowledged that engineering teams in france and germany had used different software to design the planes wiring resulting in serious manufacturing errors the mistake translated into billions of dollars of costs for airbus not to mention dealing a huge blow to the companys reputation the first a is now scheduled for delivery to singapore airlines sometime in october hedge funds for st century democratic party a defining issue by john harwood on both sides of the capitol next week congress will begin delving into the risks and riches of wall streets hottest properties hedge funds and private equity the conclusions they reach will help answer two big questions about the st century democratic party one question who are todays democrats anyway the other what are they afraid of the identity question by stereotype seems a no brainer democrats are the party of the poor of racial minorities of the have nots and have less of working class voters seething with resentment at the mostly white wall street elite considered that way the house financial services committee hearing into hedge fund risks and the senate finance panels consideration of preferential "carried interest" taxation make perfect sense but in fact the stereotype is growing less accurate with each passing year the line between "the people and the powerful " as al gore phrased it in his campaign against george w bush seven years ago has grown blurrier just as the republican party has been transformed by the infusion of social conservatives with modest incomes the democratic party has been reshaped by the economic success of baby boomers who share the democrats social issue liberalism in their midterm election breakthrough democrats nearly broke even among voters with incomes above &# barack obamas &# million in donations has hardly all come from blue collar america indeed the democrats field outraised republicans in first quarter donations from wall street even the leading democratic populist john edwards has &# million invested with his former employers at the fortress investment group hedge fund these changes have altered the election risk calculus that democrats confront as they consider whether to raise taxes on hedge fund managers or tax fortress and the blackstone group as corporations the democratic benefactors on wall street may not vote their wallets abortion rights and global warming move them more but they arent eager to become political punching bags either its no coincidence that neither charles schumer chairman of the senate democrats campaign committee nor hillary clinton the presidential front runner and the two senators from new york has taken a stand on hedge fund taxation beyond that democrats remain jittery over traditional republican "tax hike" attacks however carefully democratic message meisters select their targets for additional revenue oil companies drug makers americans earning more than &# republicans will seek to cast it as the same old "tax and spend formula " mr edwards has signaled how the party will come down by pointing to the "moral disconnect" between tax levels on the working class and the wealthy including his old fortress colleagues but hes fighting to stay alive in the democratic primary race those focused on november like sens schumer and clinton have more calculating to do metals no white knight alcoa sits tight by paul glader eyes will be focused on alcoa inc early this coming week as the company launches the second quarter earnings season and marks the expiration of its tender offer for alcan inc but the real news could come in the days following if reports are accurate that global miners bhp billiton ltd and rio tinto plc are getting closer to completing due diligence for possible all cash bids for alcan on monday alcoas results are expected to be humdrum because of lower prices on the london metal exchange on tuesday the global aluminum giants &# billion hostile tender offer for canadian rival alcan expires in all likelihood alcoa will simply say it is seeking an extension of its existing tender offer beyond the tuesday deadline alcoas offer stands at about &# a share though the figure changes slightly based on alcoas daily share price neither company is saying how many shareholders have tendered their shares on friday alcoa said the justice department wanted more information from the company unlike some other hostile takeover battles alcoas bid for alcan has started to resemble a tug of war rather than a boxing match the two companies have largely refrained from lawsuits dueling public relations offensives and advertising campaigns instead they seem to have maintained a respectful dialogue alcoa we think a takeover makes sense for us both alcan no thank you with no one at its heels yet alcoa could take its time perhaps extending its bid until alcans annual shareholder meeting next april and launch a proxy battle to take over alcans member board "alcoa is not going to raise their bid unless alcan can come up with a third party or unless alcan approaches alcoa and says lets go friendly " said chuck bradford a metals analyst based in new york with bradford research soleil "it is up to alcan to come up with something right now alcoa has the only bid why should they raise it " so far nothing has come of the initial flurry of rumors of white knights rescuing alcan but that could change as reports are resurfacing that bhp and rio tinto are engaged in due diligence for a bid and are attracted to the hydro powered smelters in alcans portfolio both companies declined to comment on the rumors rio tinto said recently that it plans to invest &# billion to expand its yarwun alumina refinery in australia while some experts suggested that meant rio tinto isnt interested in alcan others suggest it indicates rio is interested in alcan and furthering its presence in the aluminum industry londons daily telegraph reports that rio tinto has hired credit suisse group and deutsche bank ag to advise it about several options
