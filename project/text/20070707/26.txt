pursuits books writers block a literary geological shift beyond sleep by willem frederik hermans overlook pages &# the porter is disabled " thus begins "beyond sleep" with what is easily the most famous opening line in dutch literature of the past century the porters handicap is that he is blind though as willem frederik hermans soon lets us know blindness is the human predicament since life on earth is an experiment that cannot be repeated we are all groping in the dark even in frigid northern norway where the novel is set but where the sun seldom does since its publication four decades ago "beyond sleep" the dutch is "nooit meer slapen" has come to be regarded as one of the founding books of modern dutch literature even if hermanss countrymen never quite embraced the man himself the novel which has inexplicably languished until now without an english translation tells the story of alfred issendorf an ambitious geology student from holland who joins a scientific expedition to lappland one that is beset by bad equipment and bad luck under hermanss steady hand the tale is marked in turns by exhilarating comedy and fateful tragedy but no thumbnail description of "beyond sleep" can begin to suggest the richness and complexity of a novel that humbled many a dutch critic into nail biting sessions of rereading hermanss expression of his "creative nihilism" was anything but simple though it was conveyed in the authors hallmark style short pungent sentences studded with details gleaned from close observation the style is what one might expect from a writer who was also fascinated by science hermans taught geology for years before turning to writing full time in the early s when he was a young man his science studies were interrupted by world war ii and it was during the war that his literary interests began to flower "it is characteristic of man that he has to describe the chaotic reality that surrounds him " hermans once wrote "he describes it as if it has order writing a novel is doing science without proof " he read voraciously and wrote his first stories and novels during the war but found his true voice after the shooting stopped most notably with the novel "tears of the acacias" a sardonic depiction of dutch resistance to nazi occupation the book was also in effect a broadside against dutch writers and publishers who hermans believed were eager to forget the conflict and return to prewar themes and styles disgusted by their timidity he decided to level the dutch parnassus and erect a new one hermans collected his polemics in a volume called "mandarins on sulfuric acid" but for years was unable to find an editor who dared to publish it he eventually brought the book out himself in after "mandarins on sulfuric acid " with its attacks on complacent nostalgic fiction dutch literature was never the same by then hermans was teaching geology at groningen university in the netherlands but his reputation as an incendiary literary and social critic was well established conflicts swarmed around him like mosquitoes and he made many enemies in dutch literary circles after clashing with the university administration over his teaching duties in the early s hermans moved to paris the outsider was now truly outside but even though hermans was happier in france he remained very much a dutchman and continued to be the most powerful and nettlesome literary presence in holland he might have had thousands of admiring readers in the netherlands but when hermans died in at age his funeral was attended by only his wife and son hermans compared "beyond sleep" to "the pilgrims progress " but alfreds journey does not lead to the eternal city he arrives instead at the insight that man is the eternal loser of the universe "a secret consciousness reveals itself " alfred observes "the veil of mystery shrouding life in its entirety lifts momentarily and i know that at all times and in everything i do i am defenceless and powerless as replaceable as an atom and that all my resolve hopes and fears are nothing but manifestations of the mechanism governing the movements of human molecules in the fathomless vapour of cosmic matter " the reader of "beyond sleep" is treated to an array of side stories short essays and soliloquies but whether hermans is discussing mans identity or mere computers his message is the same copying is the true nature of existence authenticity and originality are extremely rare "just as the iguanodon became extinct due to its size " one character remarks "so will the human race die out from sheer redundancy " as if to underline the message hermans has alfred spend much of his time looking at his mirrored reflection in his compass the chief stylistic device of "beyond sleep" is alfreds interior monologue which enables the egocentric narrator to mix memory and desire empiricism and deluded paranoia it is a cocktail that often leads the reader astray hermans can become so preoccupied with an idea that his narrative seems to take second place realism is exchanged at will for the surreal the carefully chiseled phrase for the quick thought sometimes seemingly thrown on the page but there is nothing careless about any of it hermanss oeuvre is marked by detached precision and brutal directness and when hermans had a chance to reflect on his published work he often revised it in favor of even more precision almost every reprint of his novels came with hermanss latest improvements a note to the th printing of "beyond sleep" announced about changes needless to say he was often in conflict with his publisher which might help explain the shabby quality of the translations of his other work happily ina rilkes translation of "beyond sleep" comes as near as possible to the real thing in the netherlands we know that small literary worlds sometimes maintain well kept secrets hermans has been ours one that we now gladly share mr otterspeer is a history professor at the university of leiden in the netherlands
