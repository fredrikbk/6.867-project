pursuits did it myself grass warfare is what you put on your lawn your own business growing local movements say using pesticides is a choice that affects the whole neighborhood the battle over how green your grass should be finally the grass is greener on my side of the fence ive spent the past year converting my lawn to organic care after some early setbacks my lawn looks pretty great and the only herbicide ive used is an all natural corn substance thats safe enough for my dog to eat the same scene is playing out in yards around the country but its not a peaceful transition as the organic lawn movement grows so are tensions in some communities the latest front is over whether lawn care methods are the horticultural equivalent of secondhand smoke a choice that affects the whole community neighborhood activists argue that using pesticides on one lawn exposes everyone nearby to the chemicals including kids and pets enthusiasts are trying to shame their neighbors into joining them with pro organic lawn signs prompting some residents to apply their chemicals covertly homeowners who want to stick with pesticides say how they groom their lawns is their own business even spouses are facing off over which comes first eliminating chemicals or creating a dazzling no fuss lawn the lawn care industry meanwhile is walking a tightrope hoping to profit from organics without turning against their traditional products in wisconsin the village of whitefish bay has become a microcosm of the new turf wars intent on switching the community over to an organic approach a citizens group is hanging tags on residents doors urging them to lay off pesticides and posting "all living creatures welcome" signs in their own yards "its really dicey and some people are receptive and some are hostile " says sandy hellman age a member of the healthy communities project "i look at it as the secondhand smoke issue kids run back and forth between the yards and windows are open all the time " organic supporters say data are slowly building to cause concern last year researchers at the harvard school of public health found that individuals reporting exposure to pesticides had a higher incidence of parkinsons disease than those not reporting exposure the report notes that among individuals who are not farmers the significant association is "most likely explained by use of pesticides in home or in gardening " that study echoes findings of a parkinsons pesticide link in men reported last year by the mayo clinic there have been other studies including one in the journal of the american veterinary medical association suggesting that exposing dogs to some herbicide treated lawns and gardens may increase their chances of developing cancers the pesticides used in lawn care products found on shelves nationwide are considered legal by government standards but broader research on health risks from such chemicals has prompted general warnings the environmental protection agency which regulates pesticide use notes on its own web site that kids are at greater peril from pesticides because their internal organs and immune systems are developing in addition to the scientific debate lawn care is also highlighting questions about personal property rights some critics say the organic push is a nanny state attempt to tell people what they can do on their own land ms hellmans group convinced whitefish bay officials to stop spraying pesticides on medians near an elementary school but didnt initially get funding for the pricier organic weed control or fertilizer products when dandelions returned in droves neighbors balked fearing the seeds would spread to their properties money was later approved to hire an organic lawn care service but not soon enough for some residents "i dont want those weeds thats the bottom line " says gloria tylicki who has written whitefish bay town officials complaining about the organic results near her home she hires a service to spray her lawn with herbicides three times a year and doesnt like the trend of neighbors telling her what to do on her own property "can i not plant a certain flower because someone blocks away doesnt care for that " elsewhere similar battle lines are being drawn this spring foot billboards were erected on the platforms of new york area railroads depicting a young father standing on the lawn of his home cradling his young daughter the caption "ive got one great reason not to use chemicals on my lawn " the ad campaign was part of a larger pesticide reduction program being pushed by the grassroots environmental education organization a port washington n y based nonprofit fundamentally "going organic" simply means getting grass and soil healthy enough to crowd out weeds without pesticides the umbrella term for chemical substances that destroy unwanted pests or weeds a herbicide is a pesticide targeting plants an insecticide kills insects pesticide opponents say homeowners unwittingly bring the toxics into homes via shoe soles and pet feet tracking it into carpets where kids play they also worry about runoff into streams rivers and groundwater and into their own yards organic supporters also advocate using natural fertilizers instead of synthetic ones most packaged fertilizers contain three key ingredients nitrogen phosphorus and potassium which are listed in a familiar n p k ratio in organic versions the nutrients come from plant animal or mineral sources such as blood meal seaweed extract bone meal and sulfate of potash because the soils microorganisms must first digest the organic nutrients to make them useful to the grass it takes longer to get that dark greening effect many homeowners are accustomed to seeing after they fertilize a square foot lawn costing &# to treat traditionally might be double using organic solutions at least initially currently nothing on the market annihilates existing weeds as fast as chemical solutions so while many people like the idea of going organic they dont so much like living with some weeds while they convert "we used to accept a few weeds " says jay feldman director of beyond pesticides a nonprofit group that runs the national coalition for pesticide free lawns now uniform swaths of green weedless grass are the standard the rise of pesticides says mr feldman "redefined our aesthetics " in some cases families themselves are split about whether to switch last year mary beth nawor of highland park ill marched through town in a fourth of july parade promoting safer pesticide use "it was all the women taking the info we had and the men brushing us off " she says but that wasnt the biggest surprise when ms nawor later recounted to her husband how a friend had marveled at their chemical free lawn he sheepishly admitted to putting down an herbicide "its a point of pride for men " says ms nawor a high school environmental science teacher "they like to be out there showing their grass off " andrew sprung of south orange n j grew his lawn from seed and uses a four step annual lawn program that includes pesticides and fertilizers his wife wants him to stop using chemicals he says and hes moderated a bit still he says "i find it hard to believe that the legal chemicals i drop on my lawn in moderate quantities is harming anything " today the organic movement is a bright growth spot in an otherwise lackluster &# billion u s lawn and garden market growing at double digits over the last five years while overall sales stagnated in according to marketresearch com this january scotts miracle gro launched its first organic lawn fertilizer it has a natural bio herbicide in development and aims for half its product line to be naturally derived in coming years the nations largest lawn care company trugreen chemlawn this year shortened its name to just trugreen in part to deflect criticism about its pesticide use home depot is carrying organic landscape products in every store and executives insist they are here to stay but the split in public sentiment makes it tricky for companies to navigate the divide homeowners often tell professionals they want organic products says trugreens chief marketing officer vic yeandel then complain when it costs more or takes longer "they say i dont want the weeds to grow do you have a weed control that is not a pesticide and the answer is no we dont that defines what the issue is " to try to make everyone happy in harmony sustainable landscapes in bothell wash offers three tiers of weed programs "no weeds " "minimum pesticides " and "completely organic " when new customers call up co owner mark gile says he subtly encourages the latter two programs community peer pressure is one thing its another to mandate organic care by law in canadas supreme court ruled that the nations communities can restrict cosmetic pesticide use on private as well as public property to date more than have done so that ruling mobilized the u s pro pesticide movement like never before both on a grassroots and legislative levels says allen james president of the responsible industry for a sound environment a trade group representing makers and suppliers of pesticides and fertilizers "canada was the warning shot for us " he says partly due to rises efforts today all but nine states currently forbid local lawmakers from enacting such residential bans because it would pre empt state laws as a result organic activists to date have instead concentrated on getting pesticides banned in public properties where municipalities have control just last month connecticut extended a ban on lawn pesticides through the eighth grade currently at least u s towns have pesticide free parks and several hundred school districts have laws or policies designed to minimize kids exposure to pesticides such actions unnerve homeowners such as john schmaltz in cromwell conn who fears private property could be next he sees a hypocritical undercurrent to organic lawn enthusiasts pleas "people put on deodorant perfume and cosmetics and whos to say about those " given homeowners passions things can get tense philip dickey runs the washington toxics coalition a seattle based environmental health organization and estimates his group has distributed nearly pesticide free zone signs with ladybugs on them to get a sign homeowners must promise to speak with at least three people about organic care on the coalitions web site are talking tips including playing the kid card they often run barefoot on grass and avoiding a "holier than thou attitude " still not in my backyard brawls do surface mr dickey says "i got a photograph back from a guy who put up a pesticide free sign and his neighbor then put up a sign that said hazardous material storage there is no dialogue going on there " nor in harvard ill where andrew cook showed his neighbor a note from his wifes doctor explaining she was highly sensitive to pesticides no dice his neighbor refused to change her lawn care regimen mr cook then aimed one of the ladybug signs squarely at her house "you can only lead a horse to water " he says to keep peace for now some homeowners are brokering their own land resolutions tihamer toth fejel uses no lawn care treatments whatsoever on most of his ann arbor mich yard but throws down an herbicidal weed and feed product on the portion abutting his neighbors property so "he wont think im trying to infect his perfect lawn " jim mcnicholas of lagrange ill asked his organic neighbor to tell him when shes going on vacation so he can spread fertilizer without strife and in lyndhurst ohio city councilman joe gambatese agreed to hire good nature organic lawn care to treat his own home turf for a three year trial after residents there pushed for pesticide reductions so far he says "my yard looks fantastic " as for my block a couple of acres separate me from my neighbors so they havent had to witness my battle with the weed brigades after a frustrating summer fighting dandelions and plantains last fall i plowed up the lawn replanting it with new grass seed and pounds of organic compost that did the trick my grass was among the first up in my area this spring which helped choke back any weeds i spread corn gluten meal a natural pre emergent herbicide just as the forsythia began blooming and have spent only a few hours total hand weeding as for fertilizer this year im trying a worm waste product from a company called terracycle as well as scotts new organic choice lawn food i left a swath of old lawn for comparison and so far the difference is notable in the meantime theres not much to do other than mow email me at wendy bounds wsj com
