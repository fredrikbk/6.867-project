pursuits food &amp drink in the kitchen how to kill a lobster a top seafood chefs answer to the delicate and controversial problem of dispatching dinner special to the wall street journal new york i am standing next to eric ripert chef of the famous seafood restaurant le bernardin here confronting a common culinary fear we are about to kill a lobster mr ripert who uses a knife to dispatch lobsters raises his weapon i mimic him this is a moment i like many home cooks have been avoiding all my life one of the biggest debates in lobster cookery is the best method to take the creatures life boiling steaming or killing the lobster with a knife most pro chefs eschew boiling which they say can produce rubbery waterlogged meat on the other methods there are two camps some like to steam them including jasper white of the massachusetts based summer shack restaurant chain mr ripert is among those who prefer the knife kill believing it to be quicker and more compassionate its also a challenge if you havent done it before you can avoid the chore by buying cooked and chilled lobster meat and even frozen lobster tails but the meat is less fresh the texture is compromised and its more expensive the best way to cook lobster at home is to kill it yourself lobsters are plentiful right now and there are few dishes as summery as a lobster roll or for a more refined meal poached lobster with a delicate vinaigrette but these are turbulent times for lobster lovers the issue of cruelty to food animals has gained traction the city of chicago for instance has banned foie gras lobsters have been targeted too with some stores suspending sales in italys emilia romagna region made it illegal to boil lobsters alive "the only place city folks encounter killing their food is with lobsters thats what makes it such a hot button issue " says jelle atema a lobster expert and professor of biology at boston university does it make a difference to the lobster diana cowen a senior scientist at the lobster conservancy in maine says that people should cook lobsters in whatever way they like best to eat them even if that means a longer suffering period ms cowen chooses to steam her lobsters lobsters have clusters of nerves that independently control every segment of their bodies though the lobsters brain is the master control operator the body parts can act independently she theorizes that this may mean that they register pain only in isolated parts of their bodies minimizing their suffering in addition lobsters can autotomize which is the ability to break off a claw or leg if the appendage is damaged "if something really bothers them they drop their parts if you drop them in boiling water and they dont drop their parts maybe they dont feel it " says ms cowen boston universitys dr atema advises to kill the lobsters as quickly as possible "the best way to do it in my recommendation is to place them head first in vigorously boiling water " he says i witnessed my first mass lobster execution while working as an assistant pastry chef nine years ago at no park in boston i sensed movement behind me and pivoted around to see the last of a legion of blue black shelled lobsters being dropped into boiling water one lobster on top had its claw hooked over the pots rim its head above the others i turned my back and shivered since then despite my career as a free lance writer and cookbook author i have avoided killing and thus cooking lobsters altogether now armed with scientific reasoning that im not being sadistic i go to mr ripert about preparing lobster he leads me to a worktable where one of two pound lobsters is complacently waiting its demise while the other inches toward a mirage of freedom at the edge of the countertop mr ripert slides the escapee back to the cutting board and places a hand firmly on its back he leaves the rubber bands around the lobsters claws so he doesnt get pinched then he places the tip of the knife in the cross where the head of the lobster meets the body and with a quick jab and downward swish splits the lobsters head in half i attempt to copy but after making my initial plunge i have trouble forcing the knife through the lobsters unexpectedly hard underside mr ripert grabs the knife and finishes the job my lobster dies instantly mental note next time put more muscle into it once the deed is done mr ripert proceeds to twist off the claws and tail the claws go into a saucepan of boiling water and are soon followed by the tails which are threaded onto a skewer and wrapped in plastic wrap to keep them straight this makes removing the meat easier during the eight minutes it takes to cook we whip up a dijon vinaigrette to dress baby lettuces and the poached lobster meat we slice the tail on a diagonal into coins use the whole claw as a focal point on the plate and drizzle the vinaigrette over all i take a bite its rich and light at the same time most definitely a taste worth wielding your knife for eric riperts poached lobster with mustard tarragon vinaigrette yield servings active preparation time hour cooking time minutes  to pound live lobsters fine sea salt and freshly ground pepper  teaspoon minced shallot  tablespoons sherry wine vinegar  teaspoon dijon mustard  tablespoons olive oil  tablespoon finely chopped fresh tarragon  cups mesclun greens after knife killing each lobster see directions above twist off the claws and tail and set aside save the head and legs to make lobster stock if desired bring several inches of salted water to a boil in a large pot hold the lobster shell side down and insert a skewer lengthwise through each lobster tail just under the clear soft shell of the tail tightly wrap each tail in plastic wrap this helps keep the lobster tail from curling as it cooks add the lobster claws to the boiling water and poach them for to minutes minutes for lobsters under pounds minutes for lobsters over pounds add the tails and poach the tails and claws for another to minutes minutes for smaller lobsters minutes for larger ones remove the lobster claws and tails from the water and set aside to cool for the vinaigrette whisk the shallots sherry wine vinegar mustard and some salt and pepper in a small bowl while constantly whisking drizzle in the olive oil and season to taste can be made up to one week in advance unwrap the tails and remove the skewers if you see a black vein from one end of the tail gently pull it out carefully crack the back of the tail and using a fork remove the lobster tail in one piece remove the dark vein from the tail slice each lobster tail on an angle and into inch thick slices to remove the meat from the claws first twist off the elbows from the claws using kitchen shears cut open the elbows and remove the meat remove the pointer "thumb" from each claw hit the center of the curved part of the claw with the back of a large heavy knife to crack it twisting sideways with the knife until the shell splits open and the meat can be pulled out when ready to serve whisk the tarragon into the dressing place the greens in a large bowl and toss with some of the vinaigrette then divide the greens lobster tail slices and claw meat between the plates drizzle a little more vinaigrette over the lobster and serve immediately see related letter "letters to the editor lobsters last binge" wsj july
