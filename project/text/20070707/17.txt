billion into foreign real estate funds this year substantially more than was invested in domestic property funds according to morningstar inc those big inflows follow strong past returns for foreign real estate investment trusts the main holdings of these funds which rose nearly a year in the three years ended april according to fidelity investments by comparison u s reits rose in that period while the s&amp p was up driving the trend the number of reits overseas which makes it easier to launch foreign real estate funds money managers say for decades reits which usually own income producing properties apartment complexes commercial buildings and other buildings that charge rent traded mainly in the u s and a few other places but in recent years the reit structure has gained wider approval and they are now found in nearly two dozen countries earlier this year they were introduced in the united kingdom still reits can vary between countries in japan for instance reits are passive investment vehicles that are mostly barred from redeveloping properties they own in other places however including singapore the reit structure is more similar to what is found in the u s

international real estate fund foreign funds also often take small stakes in non reit companies including home builders property developers and construction or lodging concerns these holdings can spice up a portfolio but also can be more volatile than reits aim global real estate fund for instance has a small stake in chinese property developer agile property holdings ltd and the dryden global real estate fund owns shares in orient express hotels ltd a bermuda based operator of upscale hotels one of the first decisions to make in buying a fund is whether to choose an international real estate fund which invests almost entirely in foreign property or a global fund which can hold a third or more of its assets in the u s a global fund can be more stable because of the large size and depth of the u s market but an international fund because it has greater exposure to foreign economies could mean more diversification for your portfolio most foreign real estate funds have the bulk of their holdings in large developed markets in western europe north america and asia where the range of available companies is wide franklin global real estate fund has about of its assets in the u s

countries around the world including hong kong and poland another target brazil whose expanding economy could make it "one of the great places to invest over the next decade " says alpine funds

risks one big concern many real estate stocks around the world are relatively pricey following several years of gains mr foster at the franklin fund says the value of reit shares around the world has in some instances surpassed the value of the underlying properties "we think asia is very strong and will continue to have good growth in returns from the local property stocks and reits europe and the u s are overvalued a bit " he says currency is another risk if the dollar weakens against other currencies as many economists are concerned it might continue to do it reduces the value of u s
