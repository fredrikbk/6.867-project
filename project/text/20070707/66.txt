whole foods wild oats and the antitrust urge in attacking the federal trade commissions challenge to whole foods acquisition of wild oats holman jenkinss june business world column "whole food fight" elevates simplicity over reality mr jenkins does suggest market realities matter when noting for example that wild oats stores are "much smaller and offer a shrimpier array of products" than whole foods and that the financial markets have deprived wild oats of the capital to compete head on with whole foods in other words there are nuances even as to the nature of competition between whole foods and wild oats no less the nature of competition between whole foods and safeway mr jenkins however ignores any market nuances in concluding that the ftc complaint is "shoddy and sophomoric " he notes that whole foods growth must have come from someone presumably the likes of safeway kroger and wal mart and those retailers are now making there own organic forays presumably to compete with whole foods therefore whole foods acquisition of wild oats cannot be anticompetitive because whole foods faces these and other formidable competitors a more realistic examination of the market may find that for reasons far transcending whole foods a growing number of consumers have become concerned about the health effects real or imagined of pesticides and processing as the market dictates the entire food industry farmers processors restaurants supermarkets has responded in myriad ways tying all those changes to competition with whole foods is myopic the fact that i can now buy organic milk at wal mart tells us something but very little about the realistic nature of competition between whole foods and wal mart or about the effect of whole foods acquisition of wild oats the blunt words of industry experts such as the ceo of whole foods helps illuminate the market realities therefore the ftc relies in part on those words but understanding markets is ultimately complex imprecise and expensive it may be preferable to eliminate the antitrust laws but absent that we should not substitute simplicity for reality arnie celnicker arlington va the author was formerly employed as an attorney for the ftc and the antitrust division of the justice department see related letters "letters to the editor unwholesome additive to market nosy ftc" wsj july
