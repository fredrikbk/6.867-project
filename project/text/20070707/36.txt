pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink the basques beverage elko nev a few friends of mine have driven through this town a way station on the lonely highway between reno and salt lake city each made the mistake of stopping to eat at one of the grim dim casinos on the main drag one of which the commercial casino features the stuffed carcass of a giant polar bear a towering old fellow who looks positively perplexed and slightly embarrassed at having ended up in a dusty glass case in nevada settling for casino grub is a profound mistake because just a couple of blocks over is a string of venerable basque restaurant bars where the hungry traveler would be feted with heaping plates of steak piled with sauteed garlic and where a desert crossing thirst is satisfied with the traditional "basco" drink picon punch one of those welcoming spots is called the star where i found myself surrounded by cheerful men speaking basque a language unto itself and decidedly unlike either spanish or french when my picon punch arrived andy lejardi and anastasio arriaga switched to english to ask what i thought of the favorite drink of basque americans and to offer a warning that the picon punch can sneak up on you mr lejardi left the spanish basque country in after an obligatory stint in francisco francos army like young basque men for a century before him he came to nevada to herd sheep now retired he lives across the border in idaho one of some old world basques and their descendants who according to william douglass author of "amerikanuak basques in the new world " live in the western states mr lejardi noted that the picon punch isnt much known in the old world basque country where the most distinctive local drinks are a sloe berry liqueur called patxaran and the sweet herbal izarra mr arriaga pointed out a couple of small wiry men at the end of the bar "theyre from california very tough " he said with admiration "woodchoppers " toughness is a singular basque quality and is reflected in their sports feats of strength and sheer exertion chopping wood is a staple with basques but the signature basco sport is the hefting and schlepping of crushingly heavy weights the woodchoppers were in town to compete at the national basque festival much of which took place in elkos streets and parks last weekend but before the tough guys got to take their whacks there was dancing taking to the street were boys dressed in white shirts and pants with red sashes around their waists and jingling bells strapped to their shins the girls were in green skirts red aprons and white blouses and scarves their legs cross gartered they danced with garlanded hoops to the skirring of an electrified accordion the steps looked like a distant cousin of the highland fling from the sidelines mothers of the dancers tossed back their heads and let loose a ululating yell that got its start as a basque war cry "ley ley ley ley ley ley ley ley ley ley ha ha ha ha hooooooooooo " there were more berets being worn than on new yorks nd street during the height of bebop the next day i went back to the star to see how its picon punch is made the drink takes its name from the brand of the central ingredient amer picon "amer" is the french word for "bitter " gaston picon concocted his own aperitif of bitter orange peel herbs and alcohol as a tonic and started bottling it commercially in but amer picon hadnt been doing boffo business in the states of late and the brand abandoned the new world fortunately there is a worthy substitute torani amer now the staple for picon punches the stars bartender miguel leonis puts a stemmed goblet on the bar and fills it with ice after putting in a healthy dash of grenadine he fills the glass with torani amer leaving just enough room on top for a float of brandy he takes a twist of lemon and rubs it around the rim of the glass before tossing it in "some people add club soda to water it down a little " says mr leonis "but we dont this is the real deal " the result is a delicious cocktail with a subtle orange flavor that isnt so much bittersweet as perfectly balanced between bitter and sweet the real deal is still possible because shortly after prohibition r torre &amp co a california firm making flavored syrups and liqueurs came up with its own version of amer picon to sell to the many basque restaurants in san francisco torani amer is now the only liquor marketed by the company which focuses instead on its torani syrups for baking and flavoring coffees amer isnt a big business line but it is a steady one especially since amer picon took a powder ask for amer picon at your local liquor store and youre almost sure to come up emptyhanded unless youre lucky enough to find a dusty old bottle languishing on a back shelf unfortunately ask for torani amer and you will likely be just as frustrated some california liquor stores such as bevmo and wallys regularly stock the liqueur and shops in northern nevada have naturally heard of the stuff but otherwise your chances of finding a store that sells torani amer are slim that doesnt necessarily mean it cant be acquired anybody can push a bottle of grey goose or smirnoff across the counter at you but the store worth giving your everyday business to is the one that will make every effort to acquire rarities when you need them better yet if you ever find yourself between salt lake city and reno stop in at the star or the nearby biltoki restaurant and enjoy a picon punch in its natural habitat a treat as rare as the basque language you will hear spoken all around you should you want to join in the conversation raise your glass and say "to your health" zure osagarriari email me at eric felten wsj com picon punch  oz torani amer or amer picon  oz
