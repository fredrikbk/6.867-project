pursuits books football and the indian effect the real all americans by sally jenkins doubleday pages &# the most stirring football locker room speech of all was not the knute rockne "win one for the gipper" halftime address to notre dame football players that inspired them to beat army in nor was it t a d joness telling his yale players in that playing harvard was more important than anything they would do for the rest of their lives no the best locker room speech ever has to be the one delivered by glenn "pop" warner "your fathers and your grandfathers are the ones who fought their fathers these men playing against you today are soldiers they are the long knives you are indians tonight we will know if you are warriors " the occasion was the momentous college football game in between warners renowned carlisle indian school squad and a vaunted army team carlisle a small town in southeast pennsylvania was the home of an industrial school for native americans drawn from reservations across the country army was army its football playing cadets linebacker dwight d eisenhower among them marching over opponents during the youthful heyday of college football when the two teams met at west point on a saturday in november memories of the last armed confrontation between indians and the u s army at wounded knee in had not yet faded as sally jenkins recounts in "the real all americans " her history of the carlisle indians warner told the members of his squad that he didnt really need to prepare them for the contest "just go to your rooms and read your history books " the games symbolic resonance and clash of titans aura made the meeting notable even before the kickoff the bruising army steamroller would face the speed and deception of carlisle a team led by the fabled jim thorpe who a few months earlier had won the pentathlon and decathlon at the summer olympics in stockholm but it was what happened on the field that made the carlisle army game one of college football legend warner introduced the double wing offense on carlisles first play from scrimmage the offense in vogue at the time was the single wing overloaded on one side for grinding running plays the double wing distributed players more evenly putting both halfbacks close to the line of scrimmage outside the defensive tackles thus multiplying the indians options and the cadets confusion thorpe "ripped off runs of twenty yards as if they were commonplace " setting up touchdown after touchdown ms jenkins writes the new york times said that trying to stop him was "like trying to clutch a shadow " carlisles defense was impressive as well not allowing an army first down in the second half the indians won it was a historic win by a historic team in a historic era and yet it is often overlooked in college football lore the major chronicles concentrate on the ivy league teams of the era noting in passing that the powerhouses of harvard yale princeton and penn occasionally played carlisle always on the ivies home fields never at the modest carlisle facility but the games are regarded if at all as curiosities the feisty indian team with its barebones budget and creative approach to the game actually managed to hold its own with the mighty ivies now ms jenkins a washington post sportswriter has rescued carlisle and its achievements from the archives sculpting a story that is at once a fascinating historical account and an implicit commentary on modern sports we talk easily about the redemptive power of athletics but most such chatter is piffle its hard to discern who or what is redeemed for instance by the big money big media college football game today by contrast ms jenkins shows how carlisle during its decade of football ascendancy beginning in the early s used the game to build teamwork and character in a people who had been yanked off their lands sent east when the rest of the country was moving west thrust into an alien culture and forced to speak an alien language this is not the place to debate the right and wrong of american indian policy but in a story with very few heroes surely lt col richard henry pratt carlisles founder is one pratt was a soldier of the old school with new ideas a u s cavalry veteran of the indian wars he thought indians should be absorbed into mainstream american life in short they were not "savages" to be kept apart from "civilized" society he persuaded washington in to hand over to him the mothballed carlisle military barracks in pennsylvania near harrisburg for use as a school the first students were several dozen lakota sioux children that pratt brought back after overcoming their parents deep suspicions from the dakota territory pratt gradually built up his school in the s and s then after the turn of the century pop warner built up a football dynasty ms jenkins describes the sport a century ago as "the perfect contest for young men of a newly industrialized society " it was an artless game that relied on brute strength and the run according to ms jenkins the indians coming from an anything but industrialized society revolutionized the sport with innovations including the long spiral pass downfield that are now football essentials undersized but faster than their opponents the indians learned to beat the white men at their own game much of the success hinged on deception whether that meant thorpes astonishing fakes or warners ingenious tricks he was the sort of coach who had football shaped leather patches sewn on carlisles uniforms to confuse the opposition and was known to tell his perfectly healthy players to wrap themselves in bandages for pregame warmups to make the other side think they were racked with injuries carlisles ultimate coup though may have been introducing the hidden ball trick in in a game against harvard the indians fell just short of a shocking upset but the under the jersey ruse caused headlines across the country ms jenkins says charles chadwick a onetime yale star who was the leading sportswriter for the new york world wrote of the game "the poor indian so often sized up as deficient in headwork is now to be regarded as a person of craft he has added his quota to the history of strategic football " ms jenkins has added her own quota to the history of football the carlisle indians reign had ended by as star players moved on and the school itself began to decline as well "like so many other federal experiments regarding the indians what in was seen as a creative solution had come to seem wrongheaded " in the school was turned into a hospital to receive soldiers wounded in world war i ms jenkins seems ambivalent about carlisle calling it a "bloodless attempt at extinction" but acknowledging that it was an "undeniable success" as a training school that was beloved by many graduates ms jenkins is not so conflicted about carlisle football team though and has done a handsome job of retrieving a remarkable story from the past one that helped give the sport its future mr shribman is the executive editor of the pittsburgh post gazette
