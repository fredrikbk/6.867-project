the buzz marketwatch weekend investor accounting scandals not a problem face it nobody cares much about accounting scandals anymore proof is the stock markets reaction or lack thereof to the continuing saga surrounding "accounting irregularities" at international rectifier a wall street favorite and stalwart among technology companies this past monday its shares actually moved higher immediately after the california maker of semiconductors to control power flow said it had fired its chief financial officer it also said its head of global sales and marketing had quit the stock while volatile at first is now nearly back to where it was at the start of trading on april the day the company first disclosed "accounting irregularities" in a news release that sparked little in the way of media coverage or investor outrage to be sure international rectifier isnt exactly a household name although its well known among tech investors and the stock soared in and yet heres a company with a market value of nearly &# billion revenue of more than &# billion and earnings exceeding &# million whose disclosure of "accounting irregularities" caused the equivalent of a yawn the meek reaction oddly enough is understandable the original announcement skirted details saying the irregularities were limited to a foreign subsidiary and "include among other things premature revenue recognition of product sales " the bad stuff appeared to occur in the preceding six quarters and the fiscal year that ended june pretty humdrum if you didnt know better analyst todd cooper of stephens &amp co told clients in a note the day after the announcement that he didnt believe international rectifier management was "unethical " though he acknowledged that it was sometimes promotional he was so unconcerned about the investigations findings that he wrote the most likely outcome "could be that revenue could move from one quarter to the next but that overall revenue would not change " he added that "issues with shipments around the end of a quarter and when those shipments should be recognized as revenue are probably at the root of this issue " fast forward to may in filings with the securities and exchange commission not in a formal press release international rectifier dribbled out a few more details that suggest a situation a bit more dire than being a little too aggressive with revenue recognition this time the companys investigation found that "among other things" the foreign subsidiary would occasionally enter "unsubstantiated orders" into the system "these orders " the disclosure continued "resulted in the shipment of products and the recording of sales with no obligation by customers to receive and pay for the orders " my favorite part "the practice included routing certain product shipments to warehouses not on the companys logistical system " did they say warehouses not in the companys logistical system in the world of accounting those are often better known as "phantom warehouses " jack ciesielski publisher of the analysts accounting observer an accounting advisory service for analysts says it "sounds like someone was very concerned about meeting targets and felt compelled to be creative " international rectifier declined further comment and has said the investigation is continuing and while the company has said that the artificially inflated revenue may have stretched into several earlier quarters mr cooper the analyst hasnt wavered from his original opinion in a more recent report he says that the "accounting errors were likely at international rectifiers japanese subsidiary which is responsible for about of total revenue "we believe that a fraction of this amount is in question which would mean less than of the companys total revenues are at risk " still the markets indifference to possible fraud no matter the size is astounding especially since at times aggressive behavior reflects a companys culture one reason for the overall indifference mr ciesielski says is that despite the findings at international rectifier the sarbanes oxley law aimed at cracking down on accounting fraud has for the most part worked "there have been no horror stories like we saw routinely in the early s " he says "something like international rectifier is repulsive but its no enron " furthermore "since enron is the yardstick by which accounting importance is defined " everything else pales by comparison finally theres the human factor over the past six years the skepticism analysts and portfolio managers built up after enron has evaporated and therefore they simply dont care about accounting scandals not yet at least herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer and doesnt sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of dow jones which publishes the wall street journal email hgreenberg marketwatch com
