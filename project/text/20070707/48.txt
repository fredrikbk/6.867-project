pursuits sports golf journal a slippery slope the games obsession with superfast greens may need some speed limits earlier this week playing in a local amateur tournament i missed a simple uphill foot putt by a couple of inches to the left strictly routine given my putting skills and i wouldnt have bothered mentioning it except for what happened next the instant the ball stopped rolling forward it started slowly rolling back and back and back until it came to rest about feet farther from the hole than where it had started this wasnt the u s open mind you it was a qualifying event for a regional amateur competition but the obsession with making greens faster to heighten the challenge is such these days that even in tournaments as expertly run as those by the metropolitan golf association which sponsored this one mistakes will happen several players afterward compared the green in question to the th hole at a minigolf course the kind where you have to knock the ball into the clowns mouth or else it comes rolling back down the ramp for you to try again for the record i did manage to sink the next putt albeit with my heart in my throat fast greens have always been prized but the mania for super duper fast greens probably dates back to the early s that was when augusta national home of the masters tournament switched to speedy bentgrass for its greens from coarser bermuda strains the result was lethally quick slopes more exciting televised tournaments and clubs across the country saying "i want some of that too " in recent years the introduction of heartier bentgrass varieties that can thrive when cropped to an eighth of an inch or even shorter plus other advanced agronomic techniques have ushered in an era of expensive green speed oneupsmanship among clubs "its like a nuclear arms race nobody wins " says ran morrissett host of the authoritative web site golfclubatlas com by coincidence this desire for superfast superpenal greens may have reached its absurdist apogee the same day i was playing in my tournament in new jersey but at a much more serious event the final round of international qualifying for this months british open at the highly regarded sunningdale golf club west of london the green on the par three fourth hole was running so fast and the hole had been cut in such a steeply canted area that the first few groups had trouble putting out one of the first golfers four putted from feet away the next golfer five putted after eight competitors had completed the hole officials decided they had seen enough they suspended play and relocated the hole to a more benign spot after the first eight finished their rounds they were required to replay the fourth using the new hole location ironically two of the eight scored worse on their replay "i admit it was a mistake and the responsibility lies on me and me only " bravely said martin kippax who set up the course for the event and is the championship chairman for the royal &amp ancient golf club of saint andrews in scotland which runs the british open as best i can determine nothing like this has ever happened before in elite level tournament golf although it nearly happened in the final round at the u s open at shinnecock when crews had to water the seventh green being groups to keep putts and approach shots from running off playing on speedy greens can be thrilling the ball rolls on and on as if self powered and the slightest twitch in your stroke can send it zooming off the putting surface yet once you get used to them its possible to make a lot of putts on fast greens because the shorter grass deflects the ball less than longer grass and putts tend to roll truer up to a point that is when slopy undulating greens get too fast even the best players in the world have no choice but to putt defensively they arent really trying to make or foot putts so much as trying to prevent the putts from spilling way past the hole this may have helped angel cabrera never known as an ace putter win last months u s open on the scary fast greens at oakmont when practically speaking no one is able to focus on actually making midlength putts the advantage the best putters have is partially negated superfast speeds are especially problematic at classic courses in the northeast and elsewhere where the original greens were built with substantial tilt to improve drainage and with lots of bumps and swales "the contours of older greens dont do well at modern speeds " says rees jones a golf course architect who has refashioned many older courses to be suitable for play at u s opens a case in point is the steeply pitched th green at the bethpage black course in new york during his extensive renovations to the course prior to the u s open mr jones created a puttable area at the front of the green hoping to make a challenging pin place possible near the fronting bunker but as it turned out at the speeds at which the u s golf association likes the greens to run during its opens that putts from the back of the green toward a front pin were in danger of running off the putting surface and into the bunker so throughout the tournament the holes had to be cut near each other at the top rear of the green the pity both at older courses and at some new ones is how many potentially great hole locations have been lost because of galloping greens "once you reach a certain speed the greens just arent as interesting anymore because it limits the type of places you can put the holes " says mr morissett in the olden days rapping the ball up and over undulations and banking it off slopes was a fun and challenging part of the game "im not sure it didnt take as much skill to putt those old greens as it does the modern fast ones " says mr jones "there was a lot of technique involved in hitting the ball properly now the players basically just have to guide the ball tap it in the right direction " and hope they dont have to tap it four more times from feet before it finally goes in the hole email me at golfjournal wsj com
