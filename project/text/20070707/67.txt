why the trade talks collapsed the wto talks between the g nations brazil india the united states and the european union have collapsed yet again this time the only surprising twist was that u s trade representative susan schwab put the blame primarily on india and secondarily on brazil in truth the breakdown of the doha round in potsdam germany had less to do with india and brazils protectionism than with the u s s paralyzing inability to respond to long standing world wide demands for the reduction of its and the eus agricultural subsidies until we confront this central fact success will remain beyond our grasp the good news is that the doha round has already made substantial progress on other contentious issues such as poor nations gaining easier access to generic drugs and the least developed countries enjoying virtually free market access without duties and restrictions with many of these issues settled or taken off the table and many players placated the endgame came down to the four "big players" the u s the eu brazil and india each had to make substantive trade barrier and subsidy concessions to close the doha round the eu needed to make concessions on agriculture where its barriers and subsidies were huge it did not seek concessions in this sector from india and brazil but rather wanted reciprocal concessions in manufactures and services with its strong farm lobby the u s could not permit meaningful reduction in its substantial subsidies simply in exchange for concessions in manufactures and services it sought "sectoral reciprocity" in agriculture itself its not hard to see why the situation was unacceptable to india and brazil at potsdam ms schwab refused to offer any real concessions on u s agricultural subsidies while at the same time insisting that the poorer countries offer more even as the g talks were in progress at potsdam late last month the agriculture subcommittee of the u s house of representatives voted to retain the subsidy portion of the farm bill for another five years ms schwab cannot ignore that it is politically impossible for a democratic developing country such as india to persuade the public that its farmers often at the margin of subsistence should agree to competition from rich country farmers who enjoy heavy subsidies furthermore contrary to what u s officials might like to believe india is hardly a protectionist spoiler that refuses to make concessions on manufactures and services consider first the unappreciated fact that india is now substantially open on manufactures with some tariff peaks just like those in the u s and eu its top applied or actual tariff rate is customs duty collection as a proportion of merchandise imports was down to during the fiscal year meanwhile tariff reductions since have helped imports expand at annually in current dollars from to and the merchandise imports to gdp ratio has risen to in from in since indias budget has driven unilateral trade liberalization the finance minister used it to reduce tariffs again this year even as doha was being negotiated indias top industrial tariff rate came down to in from in the multilateral trade negotiations on the other hand have always related to the ceiling or "bound" tariffs established by gatt or wto negotiations and to "rules" such as on anti dumping where the track record of the u s is unfortunately appalling the result of the massive unilateral trade liberalization in actual tariffs has been a large gap between indias bound tariffs and those actually applied by the country for manufactures which are lower for instance the simple average of the bound rates is brazil exhibits a similar distance between applied and bound rates despite indias great strides in trade liberalization ms schwab now insists that india and brazil cut the bound industrial tariffs sufficiently deeply to bring about substantial cuts in the significantly lower actual tariffs since there are currently many unbound tariff items india would then have to cut its average for all import categories bound rates by an extraordinary to even begin cutting its applied tariffs on the average brazil faces a similar situation indian and brazilian officials have also argued that the u s and eu have asymmetrically expressed no willingness to make matching drastic reductions in the bound subsidy rates in agriculture ms schwab has ruled out bringing the u s bound rate on agriculture down even to its current applied rate unless the u s moves to cut its actual agricultural subsidies drastically india and brazils actual industrial tariffs cannot move nor can indian commerce minister kamal nath persuade his people to open indian agriculture to heavily subsidized u s farm exports in this situation it is clear what the ustr should not do getting mad at india and brazil and making the insulting argument that brazil is simply toeing the indian line is not going to work nor is it credible to scare other nations by saying that the u s will not renew fast track authority and will go the bilateral route the fact is that the u s most of all needs fast track or "trade promotion authority" an all or nothing vote in congress to do even bilaterals except in the case of simple "security driven" ftas such as jordan and morocco in the absence of fast track every other nation will pursue bilaterals but the u s will not be able to the damage from not renewing fast track will fall on the u s alone instead of scapegoating and bluster ms schwab can choose options to help push doha forward her problem is that currently there is no political support from either party in the u s for reducing agricultural subsidies the democrats are salivating to take the white house the republicans are terrified that they will lose it neither will risk the farm belts vote there is one politically viable solution take the estimated &# billion worth of these production distorting subsidies and turn for example two thirds into nondistorting ones unlinked from production levels and given instead for instance to farmers for environmental purposes todays popular issue that worked in far more protectionist europe let us try it here if that is done mr nath should be able to pry open more agricultural market access from indian farmers but the expectations must be modest indias congress led government believes for example that they won the election because the previous government neglected farmers and that trade liberalization will harm not help agriculture these beliefs both exaggerated and even erroneous will take time to overturn ms schwab therefore needs to have patience and perhaps should come to an understanding that while the doha round should conclude with significant reforms in u s subsidies india will return to the agricultural agenda in the round to follow in the previous uruguay round the poor countries settled for almost no changes in the level of u s and eu agricultural protectionism now the u s needs to do the same in its negotiations with india doha is not the endgame mr bhagwati university professor of economics and law at columbia university and senior fellow at the council on foreign relations is
