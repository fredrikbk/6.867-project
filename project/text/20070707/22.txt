peace paradox call it dumb luck but president bush and his allies have a chance to end this year having made significant progress toward ending the arab war against israel while helping to establish a palestinian state on the west bank how so because hamas has seriously overreached in gaza the takeover erased what little legitimacy hamas had gained from winning last years elections earning the seemingly genuine condemnation of most of the worlds governments more important the iranian backed hamas has introduced into the israeli palestinian conflict a militant non arab state whose bellicosity is also now a key factor in a palestinian civil conflict if leadership means guiding people to where they already want to go then president bush this time informed by tony blairs strategic vision could lead moderate arabia not into righteous war but into sensible peace up to now autocrats in saudi arabia egypt and much of the arab world have demonized israel in order to consolidate their own diplomatic and domestic power hamass coup has changed the game suddenly the autocrats realize that should israel be defeated the west bank would fall to hamas helping revolutionary iran secure its hold on the region while slicing in half the entire sunni middle east the clock is ticking hamas does not have much time which means fatah does not have much time either suppose however as all the polls have been saying for years that ordinary west bank palestinians in fact favor peace with israel so long as the arab notables in jordan egypt lebanon and particularly saudi arabia bless the terms of the peace suppose too that despite its congenital inability in past situations to sort out the "logic of hope " todays palestinian leadership has the sadat like cunning to sort out the present situations "logic of power " finally suppose the europeans especially now under the leadership of nicolas sarkozy angela merkel and gordon brown suspended their appeasement of their former colonies and attended to the sino russian iranian oil cartel building up against them and their energy supplies then we could imagine the following scenario first palestinian president mahmoud abbas pre emptively denounces any hezbollah or syrian saber rattling against israel as a precursor to a hamas led iranian assault on the palestinian people second saudi arabia jordan and egypt reframe the casus belli from israeli to iranian occupation changing the subject from a few dusty settlement trailers on hilltops near hebron to the violent iranian proxies in lebanon and palestine third tony blair links future european financial support of fatah to the west banks negotiating an immediate and enduring peace with israel on the heels of this one two three punch the regional and international alliances could rapidly be redrawn mr abbas ends the state of war with israel and declares a palestinian state in the west bank egypt jordan and saudi arabia bless the terms of the peace after some proper diplomatic back and forth with mr blair taking the lead while the american president declares vigorous support before the year is out egypt and jordan with israels acquiescence back mr abbas in a military campaign to liberate gaza from its iranian proxy proclaiming for gazas palestinians as well as for the palestinians in all the refugee camps their rightful citizenship in the newly established state of palestine by next year palestine jordan lebanon and israel could be rolling back hezbollah from southern lebanon and with frances help rolling back syria from the rest of lebanon a palestinian peace and a lebanese rollback would materially compromise syrias geopolitical situation and likely move it away from its flirtations with iran in the meantime under the bright light of palestinian statehood and some anti terror momentum in israels and palestines environs american troops could pull out of iraq under the auspices of saudi arabia jordan and a non iranian iraqi shiite majority with a weakened syria no longer jamming the works on the border short of an immediate and coordinated war against israel a war that would require saudi arabia to collaborate with iran and fatah to collaborate with hamas a war between the arabs and israel that would complicate the other on going war between the arabs and america mr abbas has little alternative but to call for a peace with israel saudi arabia jordan and egypt have few plausible other means to put iran in its proper place and the western europeans could well exploit the moment to their advantage by cementing alliances with a more humble u s and a more energy dependable and energy rich sunni arab world rather than banking their energy and economic future on a fickle iran and a belligerent russia with china lurking in the wings in short the current moment provides an unusual opportunity for visionary leaders to resolve some of the most intractable geopolitical challenges of our generation ms kass is the director of strategy and evaluation at the avi chai foundation
