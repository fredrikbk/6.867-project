how erisa may trip up bids to extend coverage states across the country trying to extend health coverage to the uninsured increasingly are looking to employers to help pay the bill but their plans could be derailed by a three decade old federal law big states including california pennsylvania and illinois are debating proposals that give employers a choice between providing insurance or paying into a fund to subsidize coverage for those who cant afford it several other states are considering the approach but business opponents and others say the strategy known as "pay or play " might violate a law that bars states from regulating certain health plans the employee retirement income security act or erisa prohibits states from imposing state rules on the health plans of multistate employers that assume the risk of their workers health costs such self insured plans can avoid a patchwork of state regulations and offer uniform benefits helping to keep down costs about million americans or half of all workers with employer provided insurance are covered by such plans "states are concerned about the erisa issue " said laura tobler a health policy analyst with the national conference of state legislatures "when you look at the history of state regulation and erisa they have a right to be concerned " last year a federal district court struck down a maryland law that required companies with more than employees to spend at least of their payrolls on insurance or pay the difference to the state medicaid fund the ruling upheld on appeal concluded that the law was designed to force wal mart stores inc to offer health insurance rather than to simply raise money for the state and violated erisa industry groups say erisa serves a vital function in assuring that business doesnt have to meet varying state rules "erisa pre emption of state laws is the crown jewel of health care coverage by employers " says mark ugoretz president of the erisa industry committee a washington based trade group that represents big employers "without it health coverage would be next to impossible " he argues that erisa bars any state levies that are large enough to force employers to offer benefits such warnings arent keeping states from including "pay or play strategies in their proposed health care overhauls in pennsylvania democratic gov edward rendell has proposed that all but the smallest employers spend at least of their payroll on health coverage or contribute the difference between that and what they actually spend to a state fund "this plan will mete out pain to everybody in the health care delivery system everyone " he said as he outlined his proposal in december california republican gov arnold schwarzenegger has proposed that employers that fail to offer health coverage contribute of their payroll into a state fund demcratic legislators are pushing an employer mandate that would be nearly twice as high of payrolls some business groups in california including the national federation of independent businesses already are preparing to possibly file a lawsuit challenging either employer mandate under erisa massachusetts and vermont have already enacted laws that require employers that dont offer insurance to pay into state pools though the annual amounts &# per employee in massachusetts and &# in vermont are small neither state has been sued so far possibly reflecting the small size of the penalty in the two decades after erisa was enacted courts expanded the laws scope ruling that a variety of state rules didnt apply to erisa protected health plans says patricia butler an expert on erisa who is advising california and other states but in a new york law requiring all insurers operating in the state to make certain payments to a state fund survived an erisa challenge the case went to the u s supreme court which held that the state law was acceptable because it didnt directly influence health plan structures or dictate choices ms butler and others argue that it is possible to craft a universal coverage law that includes an employer mandate that would survive an erisa challenge indeed the judge in the maryland case j frederick motz indicated that a plan like massachusettss might pass muster because it was a comprehensive plan that had minimum impact on employers "it is strongly in the public interest to permit states to perform their traditional role of serving as laboratories for experiment " judge motz wrote states working to revamp their health care systems are trying to avoid colliding with erisa pennsylvania and illinois are considering imposing broad based taxes on employers while giving credits to ones that already spend a certain amount on insurance one problem under erisa the state has no power to examine the quality of the insurance offered even modest tinkering can be discouraged by erisa montana in an effort to reduce the number of uninsured young people enacted a law requiring insurers to allow children as old as to stay on their parents policies john morrison montanas insurance commissioner told congress that the requirement was a "cost effective way" to provide coverage but couldnt be imposed on self funded employer plans because of erisa and thus was only "a partial solution " congress currently is considering whether to grant waivers from erisa or otherwise help states that want to include employer requirements as part of a comprehensive health reform it has only given a waiver once before in to hawaii which requires employers to provide health insurance to employees who work at least hours a week "it appears to me our status quo has hit a brick wall or maybe its gone backward " says rep rob andrews a new jersey democrat who heads the house subcommittee with jurisdiction over erisa he would like to give states the authority to put pressure on employers that can afford to provide insurance perhaps as measured by net profits per employee but choose not to he said he would consider waiving erisa rules for certain state plans or creating new standards that would allow any state to qualify for a waiver employers are opposed to waivers said kevin covert testifying before mr andrewss panel on behalf of the american benefits council a washington trade group whose members include large employers and companies that help them run their benefits programs he said waivers would be difficult to design and to administer opening up tricky questions about how far states could go "we think the best approach " he said "is a federal solution that builds on erisa and promotes uniformity and cost containment "
