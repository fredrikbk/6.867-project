hanging out in the neighborhood if you are of a certain generation you remember standing next to your mother her skirt billowing about her legs while she hung out the wash and if you were a girl you thought that when you grew up there you would be pegging up your own sheets to snap in the breeze your husbands trousers to dance his shirts to twirl and dry all the while your own children carefully handing up to you the clothespins as the bright sun shown in benevolent good will and then later down it would all come so sweet and fresh you just had to push your nose into it ok agreed thats an aesthetic profoundly in the past tense but now we find that the clothesline that clean clothes institution of absolute industry and perfect common sense is considered such a horror that its presence looming out there in the backyard like some porn shop across the street from the elementary school means that you no longer have a "nice neighborhood" "the right to dry a green movement is roiling america " page one sept we can only imagine what malevolent force what vacancy of mind has decided that the very presence of a clothesline and dangling clothes damp from a good scrub and spin signal poverty ignorance bad people among us people who cannot afford a clothes dryer is this how we now judge each other are these really the neighborhoods where we seek a home the conditions under which we agree to live if so then we deserve clothes that smell like dryer sheets and sheets that smell like a long day at a boring job julie lange sequim wash the right to receive energy from the sun is about as fundamental as it gets that some in our society would deny others this right out of fear for their property values suggests we have lost our way as a nation we should applaud those who dry their clothes in the sun they help to make the world better for all of us one shirt at a time doug landfear oakland calif tell ms taylor that she should buy carbon credits and take down the clothesline gene schwarting tucson the article on the clothesline dispute made me so nostalgic for my mother in laws home our family used to pick peaches and tomatoes for eating and canning swim in the lake and enjoy her very fine clothesline approached via a step apparatus outside the kitchen window and cranking out over her garden the smell and feel of sun dried clothes is one of lifes small pleasant enjoyments we still do the garden and home canning but i think we will put up a clothesline as well and be happy that we dont live in a community with so many rules lucy chambers blaine wash i agree that the laundry shouldnt necessarily be hung up where all the neighbors can view our undergarments but i think a clothesline can be done in such a way as to be unobtrusive the homeowners association though should update its rules to recognize that we now live in a world where one can afford to be considerate to our environment and not be a slave to what a few people think "looks" wealthy melanie prieger agoura hills calif one mans eyesore may be anothers semaphore proclaiming a worthy cause on behalf of the planet kevin conway cleveland ohio although i dont give a hoot about "global warming" and consider the crisis atmosphere surrounding the issue a big hoax i have been a devoted outdoor clothesline dryer my whole adult life the clothes both smell and feel better and i cant for the life of me understand paying the power company to burn coal in order for me to put my clothes in a machine when the sun and wind will do it for free and yes we do have a clothes dryer for rainy days bill brockman atlanta
