microsoft fires volley at google in ad battle it seeks facebook stake names new executive to close internet gap the battle of titans between microsoft corp and google inc over the future of the internet is about to get even hotter microsoft is in talks to buy a minority stake in the popular social networking web site facebook inc a sign of a new urgency by the software giant to jump start its online business at a time when google is widening its lead in the fast growing internet advertising business as part of its catch up program microsoft also has quietly granted broad powers to an executive recently hired from outside the company who is expected to help shake up the software giants online business microsoft in recent weeks approached facebook with proposals to invest in the startup that could value the fast growing site at &# billion or higher said people familiar with the matter if those talks bear fruit microsoft could purchase a stake of up to in the closely held startup at a cost in the range of &# million to &# million the people said but microsoft must first outgun google which has also expressed strong interest in a facebook stake according to people familiar with the matter the facebook talks come as microsofts top management is making another significant move at its online advertising business the company is expected to give increasing oversight of its internet operations to brian mcandrews an advertising executive who joined microsoft just last month through its &# billion acquisition of aquantive inc an online advertising specialist that is also part of microsofts strategic push his broad mission will be to increase the number of advertisers that buy ads through microsofts system and web publishers that tap into it for ads to run on their sites microsofts internet thrust is fueled by concerns among its executives that the maturing tech company isnt moving quickly enough to establish a broad beachhead in the online advertising world say people familiar with the company along with google time warner inc s america online unit yahoo inc and others microsoft is racing to establish whats known in technology circles as a "platform" in this case a single system through which advertisers can buy ads that appear on a multitude of sites and web publishers can tap for ads to appear on their sites that approach has taken on added importance as users and advertisers increasingly spend time and dollars on sites other than the big established web portals some industry executives believe the internet today is facing the sort of turning point that the computer operating system sector confronted two decades ago whoever controls the technology platform for buying and selling online ads could hold tremendous power over the internet industry for years to come much as microsoft was able to use its windows operating system to shape the personal computer google microsofts chief rival in that area remains far ahead of microsoft in terms of the online advertising revenue it generates and the number of advertisers and web publishers that use its systems one person familiar with the matter says that over one million advertisers now buy ads using googles system microsoft is believed to have only a small fraction of that number google brought in &# billion in revenue in the second quarter almost entirely from online ads while microsofts online group posted revenue of just &# million in the same quarter google handled of all u s search queries in august more than four times the share of third place microsofts search engine according to research firm netratings inc yahoo in second place handled in another front in their internet ad battle microsoft executives and a public relations firm retained by the software giant have recently been trying to stir up opposition to googles planned &# billion acquisition of doubleclick inc an online advertising specialist and aquantive rival microsoft believes a closer relationship with facebook could help shift the balance of power by helping it tap into a fast growing pool of users and advertisers for its platform facebook which is used by more than million people to set up their own personal web pages to communicate with each other and to share photos and videos has emerged as the poster child for the latest internet wave the company expects this year to have a profit of &# million on revenue of &# million according to people familiar with the matter based on that profit level a &# billion valuation for the company is sky high but an investment in facebook could give microsoft or google greater opportunities to tie their services in with facebook at a time when theyve both recognized that social networking is changing how consumers tap into the core activities they offer such as web search and email facebook also has discussed possible ad relationships with google said a person familiar with the matter though an existing microsoft agreement over serving ads limits the options microsoft representatives declined to comment for this story a facebook spokeswoman and a spokesman for google declined to comment facebook still could wind up not taking an investment from either microsoft or google said people familiar with the matter factors in the discussions include the valuation the suitors would offer to facebook and other business considerations they could contribute to sweeten any deal facebook is considering raising as much as &# million total in cash that could be used for acquisitions investing in computer infrastructure and adding to its roughly person head count said people familiar with the matter facebooks top priority now is developing an ad platform of its own that would let marketers target users with ads based on their personal information using an automated web based system according to people familiar with the matter one sticky issue a microsoft investment could ultimately give facebook ammunition to fuel its own rival technology and advertising platforms facebook has aspirations of competing with google and microsoft on its own and has indicated that it might hold out for a higher valuation than microsoft is willing to agree on as much as &# billion the people said microsofts push is the latest in a string of attempts to energize its internet activity in recent years with mixed results the company for instance spent hundreds of millions of dollars to release its own search engine to replace technology it was licensing from yahoo then saw its search market share drop such disappointments have spurred an openness among microsofts top management for new deals such as the one with facebook and new perspectives mr mcandrews years old is a central player in the online advertising industry and has strong ties to traditional advertising companies and large advertisers connections that have been lacking at technology centric microsoft microsoft is now banking on mr mcandrews to add what insiders say is much needed leadership to its online efforts mr mcandrews will oversee microsofts relationships with internet companies and advertising agencies and manage the ad platform his team from aquantive is expected to assume greater responsibilities over the next year people familiar with the matter say mr mcandrewss rise marks a power shift from microsoft executives who to date have guided the companys internet strategy just months ago microsoft hired steve berkowitz from internet search company ask com a unit of iac interactivecorp as a vice president in its online group much as mr mcandrews is seen today mr berkowitz was positioned as the outsider needed to lead a cultural change at a company strong on technology but short on experience in the advertising industry a lack of political chops in working within the huge company and a clash with a highly respected engineering manager have hampered mr berkowitz say people familiar with the matter several of mr berkowitzs duties were recently ceded to mr mcandrews mr berkowitz remains the head of microsofts web properties and existing deals with facebook and news site digg com a microsoft spokesman declined to comment about mr berkowitz but mr mcandrews probably would play a key role in managing any deeper facebook strategy as part of any new deal microsoft and facebook may also expand an exclusive agreement signed last year under which microsoft serves display ads to facebook according to a person familiar with the matter the existing deal is expected to bring in about &# million for facebook this year and a total of at least &# million to &# million through say people familiar with the matter the actual numbers will depend on facebooks traffic growth and other factors these people say the existing agreement covers only the u s and expires in but the companies are discussing whether to extend it for a longer period and expand it beyond the u s this person said microsoft has considered trying to buy the company outright but people familiar with the matter said its unlikely at this time facebook founder mark zuckerberg has steadfastly kept his company independent with the goal of eventually taking the company public in a round of negotiations last year mr zuckerberg rebuffed acquisition approaches from microsoft yahoo and others the startup also is considering raising funds from financial investors which could be in addition to or instead of an investment from a strategic investor like microsoft or google one person said the company has so far raised about &# million from venture capital firms including founders fund accel partners and greylock partners one open question amid the courting of facebook is whether the site which adds more than new users a day will be able to translate its popularity into google scale revenue and profits some advertisers say ads on facebook dont bring sales leads as effectively as those on other sites that could be because facebook users dont pay as much attention to ads as people conducting web searches for instance jen zepeda a year old stanford university graduate who has a high paying finance job at an internet company travels often doesnt look at price tags when she shops and dines out at fancy restaurants but though she visits facebook at least once a day she says she barely notices the display ads and never clicks on them "i like that the ads on facebook are subtle " she says "but i guess thats not good for them " facebooks own plans for an advertising platform which it hopes to release later this year are aimed at addressing the issue by displaying ads that appeal more to individual users based on those users personal information microsoft also has plans to improve targeting for the display ads it brokers on facebook news corp s myspace has also started testing more targeted ads in the past few months but its unclear whether some users will be uncomfortable with such ad targeting and revolt
