columbias conceit on saturday john coatsworth acting dean of columbia universitys school of international and public affairs made the remark that "if hitler were in the united states and if he were willing to engage in a debate and a discussion to be challenged by columbia students and faculty we would certainly invite him " this was by way of defending the universitys decision to host a speech yesterday by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad an old rule of thumb in debate tournaments is that the first one to say "hitler" loses but say what you will about mr coatsworths comment it is at bottom a philosophical claim about the purposes of education about the uses of dialogue about the obligations of academia about the boundaries or absence of boundaries of modern liberalism and about its conceits so rather than dismiss the claim out of hand lets address it in the same philosophical spirit in which it was offered a few preliminaries when mr coatsworth postulated hitlers visit he specified the year just prior to germanys invasion of poland and the beginning of world war ii this then is not yet the hitler of auschwitz though it is the hitler of dachau the nuremberg laws guernica and kristallnacht mr coatsworth takes the optimistic view that "an appearance by hitler at columbia could have led him to appreciate what a great power the u s had already become " and thus presumably kept america from war less clear is whether mr coatsworth issued his invitation in the name of columbias current faculty or on behalf the faculty of the s or s well assume the answer is the current faculty since its unlikely that a committee led by jacques barzun mark van doren lionel trilling or other columbia luminaries of the day would have had much use for "discussion" with the fuhrer though it seems columbia hosted a speech by hans luther hitlers u s ambassador in what then would be the purpose of such an invitation columbias president lee bollinger offered a clue in a statement issued last week "columbia as a community dedicated to learning and scholarship is committed to confronting ideas to understand the world as it is and as it might be " he said "necessarily on occasion this will bring us into contact with beliefs many most or even all of us will find offensive and even odious we trust our community including our students to be fully capable of dealing with these occasions through dialogue and reason " thats an interesting thought coming from a man who wont countenance an rotc program on campus but leave that aside whats more important is the question of how columbia defines the set of ideas it believes are worth "confronting " whether its confidence in "dialogue and reason" is well placed and finally whether confronting ideas is a sufficient condition for understanding the world in a march essay in commentary magazine on "george orwell and the politics of truth " trilling observed that "the gist of orwells criticism of the liberal intelligentsia was that they refused to understand the conditioned way of life " orwell he wrote really knew what it was like to live under a totalitarian regime unlike say george bernard shaw who had "insisted upon remaining sublimely unaware of the russian actuality " or h g wells who had "pooh poohed the threat of hitler " by contrast orwell "had the simple courage to point out that the pacifists preached their doctrine under condition of the protection of the british navy and that against germany and russia gandhis passive resistance would have been to no avail " trilling took the point a step further assailing the intelligentsias habit of treating politics as a "nightmare abstraction" and "pointing to the fearfulness of the nightmare as evidence of their sense of reality " to put this in the context of mr coatsworths hypothetical trilling might have said that in hosting and perhaps debating hitler columbias faculty and students would not have been "confronting" him much as they might have gulled themselves into believing they were hitler at columbia would merely have been a man at a podium offering his "ideas" on this or that and not the master of a huge terror apparatus bearing down on you to suggest that such an event amounts to a confrontation or offers a perspective on reality is a bit like suggesting that one "confronts" a wild animal by staring at it through its cage at a zoo there is also the question of just what ideas would be presented by hitler at mr coatsworths hypothetical conference and whether they would be an accurate reflection of his beliefs and intentions in his speech amb luther made the case for hitlers "peaceful intentions" in europe according to historian rafael medoff millions of europeans believed this right up to september just as millions of americans did right up to december lets assume however that hitler had used the occasion of his speech not just to dissimulate but to really air his mind to give vent not just to germanys historical grievances but to his own apocalyptic ambitions in "terror and liberalism" columbia alumnus paul berman observes the way in which prewar french socialists keenly aware and totally opposed to hitlers platform nonetheless took the view that germany had to be accommodated and that the real threat to peace came from their own "warmongers and arms manufacturers " this notion mr berman writes rested in turn on a philosophical belief that "even the enemies of reason cannot be the enemies of reason even the unreasonable must be in some fashion reasonable " so there is adolf hitler on our imagined stage ranting about the soon to be fulfilled destiny of the aryan race and his audience of outstanding columbia men are mostly appalled as they should be but they are also engrossed and curious and if it occurs to some of them that the man should be arrested on the spot they dont say it nor do they ask "how will we come to terms with his world " instead they wonder how to make him see "reason " as reasonable people do in just a few years some of these men will be rushing a beach at normandy or caught in a firefight in the ardennes and the fact that their ideas were finer and better than hitlers will have done nothing to keep them and millions of their countrymen from harm and nothing to get them out of its way see related letters "letters to the editor columbia
