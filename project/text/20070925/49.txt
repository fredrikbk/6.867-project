eyes on the road seeking a cure for automotive ennui in u s "im bored im the chairman of the bored " iggy pop new car sales are sagging in america and car makers are blaming the housing slump or the credit crunch i suspect something else boredom face it a lot of the cars sold in the u s are just dull whose heart leaps at the thought of firing up a toyota corolla if you took away the logos who could discern a significant difference among the interiors of any five &# luxury cars black plastic faux wood grain even "metallic look" plastics cliches all sport utility vehicles and crossovers ho hum under the hood too many cars are equally uninspiring car makers have done wonderful things improving upon century old gasoline internal combustion engine technology but it is still a century old it is as if instead of the ipod we still got our music from lacquer records that had been refined to hold minutes of songs pause a moment and ask yourself if most cars and trucks priced less than &# arent essentially interchangeable if the cars dont bore you the driving probably will the latest urban mobility report released by the texas transportation institute finds that urban congestion has intensified to the point that "free flowing traffic is seen less than one third of the time in urban areas over million population " congestion the report concludes wasted billion gallons of fuel annually in and exacted a cost of &# billion from the economy the average motorist spent hours a year caught in traffic jams americans consumers car makers and regulators only have themselves to blame for automotive ennui consumers have been fixated on getting the best deal and paying as little as possible for fuel as distinct from buying cars that use as little fuel as possible car makers particularly the strapped detroit three have been unwilling to take bold technology risks regulators and policy makers have done little to encourage fundamental power train innovations case in point the pseudo hybrid tax credit which was rigged to dwindle the more hybrids a company sold it is clear the european approach to the issue of automobiles and energy efficiency combining high fuel taxes with tax policies aimed at promoting innovation in small displacement power trains is working better than the haphazard american way early last week i took a trip to seattle to spend a few hours driving the ford focus compact ford extensively redesigned the exterior and interior of the car but left intact the nearly decade old architecture and proportions of the car under the hood you can get a horsepower aluminum block gasoline engine with an old tech four speed automatic or a five speed manual fuel mileage is estimated at miles per gallon city mpg highway the driving experience i do recall that my driving companion and i had fun spoofing the new voice recognizing telematics system sync that ford motor co is offering in a partnership with microsoft corp seattle is a tough town for ford microsoft may be fords partner in telematics but the vehicles microsoft uses to shuttle people around its suburban seattle campus are toyota priuses the redesigned focus is competent relatively inexpensive for an american made car and will be toast when chinese auto makers figure out how to design a vehicle that will pass a u s crash test by contrast a friend in the business procured for my use during the weekend a european honda civic i ctdi acquired at a dealership in europe and brought to detroit for testing and for influencing the opinions of people like me the euro diesel civic is more fun to look at than most american small cars it has a three door hatchback profile but look carefully and you see the car has four side doors the front and back are decorated with chromey jewelry the dashboard glows at night with a techno blue light information about mileage is projected on what looks like a hologram floating in the center of the main dash screen my year old daughter declared the euro civic "cool " the liter honda diesel is rated at horsepower but that isnt the important figure it is the pound feet of torque at revolutions per minute that separates this car from the focus which pulls with pound feet you start up the euro honda by turning the key then hitting the red "engine start" button slide into the first of the manual transmissions six forward gears and the thing lunges like a shark that skipped lunch the euro civic averaged about mpg liters per kilometers by comparison the priuss combined mileage rating under the new more stringent environmental protection agency labeling system is mpg european diesel engines arent common in america for good reasons most dont meet clean air rules in all states notably california the tax breaks that subsidize the added cost of diesel technology in europe arent available in america u s fuel costs even at &# a gallon are still too low to achieve a short term payback of the cost premium for customers some of these conditions are about to change several major car makers including honda motor co daimlerchrysler ags mercedes benz bmw ag volkswagen ag general motors corp and chrysler llc have confirmed plans to bring new diesel technology to america in cars or suvs that will pass clean air muster in states within two years there could be more than a dozen new diesel vehicles on offer in the u s honda spokesman chuck schifsky says the car and engine i tested arent the same package that honda intends to offer in the u s the u s honda diesel will be clean enough for all states without using expensive urea injection systems to clean the exhaust honda also has hinted it will focus its diesel offerings on larger vehicles and suvs u s consumers should welcome the coming battle between european diesel and japanese hybrids as should members of congress who are wrestling with the century old fuel economy scheme that has given us a fleet of cars that are behind the curve and not terribly fuel efficient in a worldly context it is past time for us to wake up if we are bored maybe it is because we arent trying hard enough send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
