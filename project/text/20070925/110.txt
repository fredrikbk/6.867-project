the daily fix on the brink of the playoffs padres face surreal hurdles online edition nothing brings out good sportswriting like a late season collapse and unprecedented seemingly unreal events during the last four days the san diego padres have had their share of both on monday the padres lost their fourth straight game and learned that left fielder milton bradley was out for the year with a torn acl after getting tossed literally by his manager bud black while center fielder mike cameron had torn a ligament in his hand mr bradleys injury occurred when he was arguing with umpire mike winters and mr black was trying to hold his angry player back mr camerons injury occurred when mr bradley stepped on the hand during a play in the outfield henry schulman of the san francisco chronicle sums up the padres fortune and helps us feel better about ourselves at the same time "so you think you had a rough weekend because you drank too much ouzo at the greek tavern lost half your paycheck at the card room and got caught lying to your significant other about all of the above you still had nothing on the san diego padres weekend in the span of three home losses to colorado the padres had their national league west title hopes fractured and a game lead for the national league wild card frittered to a half game and that was not the worst of it in the span of two innings sunday they also lost two of their three starting outfielders to a pair of bizarre and serious injuries " it got worse for the padres when chris young who hasnt won since july lost to san franciscos barry zito who hadnt won since aug the padres are now three games behind the arizona diamondbacks in the nl west and are tied with the philadelphia phillies for the wild card lead alan schwarz of the new york times offers some historical perspective "baseballs playoff races have been influenced in bizarre manners over the years from runners missing bases to black cats sauntering before dugouts add an event in san diego on sunday to the list the padres milton bradley while arguing with an umpire got his legs tangled with his manager and sustained a season ending knee injury " but before we start feeling bad for the padres lets remember that they were the ones who took a chance on mr bradley an offensive force in more ways than one a couple of weeks ago associated press writer bernie wilson remembered some of bradleys low lights "he was suspended for the final five games of the season when he slammed a plastic bottle at the feet of a fan in the box seats in the right field corner at dodger stadium after someone threw it on the field nobody was injured " mr wilson writes "in he accused dodgers teammate jeff kent of a lack of leadership and an inability to deal with black players bradley had two run ins with police during traffic stops in ohio one that resulted in a three day stay in jail and another that nearly sent him back for a second visit when he was with the dodgers police responded three times to bradleys home on domestic violence calls but he wasnt arrested or charged " it appeared at that time that mr bradley had changed and that was the point of mr wilsons story but after the latest incident chris jenkins of the san diego union tribune doesnt want to see mr bradley back in san diego "it was fun and games and the games were fun " mr jenkins writes "the padres were back east tearing up the mets and phillies rocket fueled by the bat and positive energy of milton obelle bradley the padres were downright giddy amused by bradleys antics as he played to the crowds bowing to their boos and urging phillys phools to get louder in their abuse of him milton bradley injured in mid tantrum ejected from game awaiting suspension its the story of bradleys baseball life all in one sentence a sentence as incomplete as his career yet perfect indeed bradley left the game in the grasp of a trainer but still screaming at an umpire " speaking of troubled and perhaps former athletes with a temper ex heavyweight champ mike tyson pleaded guilty to charges of drug possession and driving under the influence tyson could receive up to four years and three months in prison but associated press columnist tim dahlberg doesnt think tyson needs jail time "the biggest danger he now poses is to himself and prison wont help that " mr dahlberg writes "a more proper sentence would be probation with a mandatory prison term should he test positive for drugs and alcohol or break any laws " not all troubled athletes throw bottles or are arrested for drug charges some like former nfl lineman sean jones allegedly are moving into white collar crime the securities and exchange commission charged mr jones with failing to turn over records from his investment firm amaroq asset management mr jones played for the los angeles raiders the houston oilers and the green bay packers from to the sec says mr jones told the agency the firms files were destroyed in a fire lost on a moving truck or mistakenly sold by a storage company according to the new york posts janet whitman ms whitman points out that this wasnt mr joness first off the field in the office trouble mr jones "was arrested in houston in june for bank fraud in a real estate scam involving inflated mortgage loans he also fouled up a career as a player agent in when the nfl players association suspended him for two years for financial shenanigans involving former oiler cris dishman and ebenezer ekuban whos currently with the denver broncos " the new orleans saints fell to after a home loss to the tennessee titans how bad has it been for the saints in a blog post benjamin hochman of the new orleans times picayune tries to wrap up both the game and the sorry start of the saints season "the score in case you turned off the tv early was titans " mr hochman writes "the final stats are dreadful quarterback drew brees threw interceptions last season and now has seven in three games this season the saints had net rushing yards and running back deuce mcallister left the game with a left knee injury after resting his injured right knee for part of this past week lance moore who didnt start led the saints with six catches " meanwhile the tennessee titans appear headed in the opposite direction but people in the state already knew that according to jim wyatt of the tennessean "the rest of america got a chance to see what fans in nashville already were beginning to believe the titans are again a legitimate contender in the afc " mr wyatt writes many have saluted the best ballparks in major league baseball but dave sheinin of the washington post ranks the worst ballparks "congratulations shea stadium when the washington nationals said goodbye on sunday to rfk stadium forever you regained your title as the worst stadium in baseball " mr sheinin writes about shea he adds "ah the dingy concrete the never ending pedestrian ramps the funky smell the tiny visitors clubhouse and last but not least the incessant din of airplanes taking off from and landing at la guardia " but once shea is gone its set to be replaced by a new stadium in the as devil rays marlins and white sox will be in the running for the worst home field at least in mr sheinins book tip of the fix cap to reader don hartline found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix
