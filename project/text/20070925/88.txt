nuclear energys second act bid to build two new reactors in texas may mark resurgence nrc gears up for many more in a move that could mark the beginning of a nuclear power revival a new jersey based energy company today plans to submit an application to build and operate two new reactors the request the first submitted to the nuclear regulatory commission in years comes from an unlikely source nrg energy inc a company that has never before built a nuclear plant the application for a two reactor addition to the companys existing south texas nuclear station could offer the first full test of the nuclear agencys new licensing process which has been under development since the s the new process allows companies to submit a single application for a construction permit and conditional operating license eliminating the risk that a firm could build a plant but not be allowed to run it the nuclear agency has geared up for an expected flood of applications over the next months which could cover as many as new reactors at sites and represent a possible investment by the u s power industry of &# billion to &# billion companies are rushing to get their applications in quickly hoping to qualify for potentially billions of dollars in federal incentives and loan guarantees offered in the energy policy act of barring an unexpected move on the part of congress a decision by the commission could clear the path for nrg to go ahead with its plans congress has mostly encouraged the revival of nuclear energy concluding the nations aging nuclear fleet needs refreshing though opposition could surface now that the industry appears to have momentum the nrg application likely will revive debate about the wisdom of building more nuclear reactors especially since the industry still doesnt have a federal repository for the radioactive waste from an existing u s fleet of operating reactors efforts to license a waste repository at nevadas yucca mountain have been opposed by nevada officials and senate majority leader harry reid still the renewed optimism within the industry is noteworthy given that it was virtually left for dead a decade ago in the wake of safety worries stemming from the accident at the three mile island plant huge cost overruns and disappointing operating performance in the late s plants were practically being given away by frustrated operators a handful of consolidators started picking them up and the industry dramatically improved its productivity often spurred by the profits available in deregulated electricity markets like texas more recently the industry has regained momentum partly because other forms of power generation have continued to show significant flaws coal fired plants undermine efforts to combat global warming many natural gas fired plants rely on a fuel with volatile prices and renewable energy mostly comes from intermittent forces like wind rain and sunlight this first application comes from a somewhat unlikely source nrg is a so called "merchant generator " a company that makes electricity and sells it on the open market nrg has never built a nuclear plant and because it doesnt own a utility has no ratepayers to whom it could bill the estimated &# billion to &# billion expense "were like the uncola " says david crane nrg chief executive in princeton n j in december nrg exited federal bankruptcy protection the result of overly aggressive expansion in the s recently it announced plans to spend about &# billion adding megawatts of new generation to its existing fleet it has a ownership interest in the existing south texas nuclear station and intends to bring in other investors to share in the cost of the additional plants if approved under the new application process nuclear regulators are pushing standardization both in plant design and in applications seeking licenses for those companies that satisfy the nuclear agencys requirements the agency is promising a month review period culminating in a license decision but the level of scrutiny will be strict and demanding the agency says nrg says it hopes to have approvals in hand by though the nuclear agency hasnt promised that the review will be that quick nrgs ultimate aim to install two new megawatt units designed by general electric co with toshiba corp taking the lead on construction the company hopes to have them ready for commercial operation in and in order to speed the process nrg is using a reactor design that the nuclear agency already has certified for u s use and which has been in use in japan for more than a decade it is the only reactor design being considered in the u s that can make both claims both the power industry and the agency face significant risks going forward the industry risks spending billions on designs not built here before the agencys challenge to stick to timelines promised and maintain high safety standards with a work force facing large numbers of retirements to date most of the companies that have expressed an interest in building nuclear units have been traditional utilities that built plants in the past such as southern co dominion resources inc and duke energy corp regulated utilities expect to put new investments "in ratebase " meaning they are allowed to charge ratepayers for the expense and book a profit but a few merchant operators such as nrg exelon corp constellation energy group inc and txu corp are now jumping in proposing to build plants without traditional rate protections because they have no one to whom to pass along the costs the merchant operators must cover expenses and make a profit as a result of open market power sales if they guess wrong shareholders will be hurt nrgs mr crane thinks merchant operators with so much at risk will provide the truest test of the financial viability of nuclear power mr crane says his firm has arranged for toshiba to build the nuclear reactors because "the japanese have built four of these already on time and on budget " andrew white president of ge hitachi nuclear energy a joint venture of general electric and hitachi ltd said both firms participated in construction of ge advanced boiling water reactors in japan and taiwan and he said ge helped nrg prepare its license application due to the u s s long period of dormancy in nuclear reactor construction many u s companies are playing catch up with japanese and european outfits the ge design selected by nrg was certified by the regulatory commission in mr crane said he looked at other reactor designs including the westinghouse ap reactor the only other design currently certified by the safety commission but in the end mr crane decided against "building something thats never been built before that creates a risk i cant quantify " contract terms also were a factor mr crane said toshiba "understood we would need a fixed price fixed schedule contract where if youre late you bear the cost" and was able to offer more cost certainty because its built the plant before other vendors he said offered less protection he said toshiba is offering units with a blended price of &# to &# per kilowatt of capacity substantially less than the &# per unit of capacity that other utilities have cited as a ballpark estimate of cost so far it appears merchant generators think texas provides the most promising market deregulation in that state has resulted in a sharp run up in wholesale power prices since a recent decision by dallas based txu to abandon efforts to build eight coal fired plants could result in shrinking electricity reserves in the coming years creating an environment receptive to operators looking to bring large units online and sell such units full output
