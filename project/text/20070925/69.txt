in the inner city of philadelphia horsey set bridles traditional black stables get booted as government and developers encroach philadelphia in a gritty inner city neighborhood here a group of teenagers older men and a few women gathered one saturday recently to parade their horses more than horses are squeezed into a row of rickety brick stables and a dusty vacant lot here on west fletcher street in the rough neighborhood of strawberry mansion they are among the last major remnants of a decades old tradition in philadelphia of inner city riding on horses kept in yards and odd corners of the city dozens of urban horsemen nearly all of them african americans gather here most days to ride brush their animals and swap stories some offer rides or lessons to neighborhood children in hopes of keeping them off the streets of north philadelphia on this day several dozen horsemen and children planned to march their animals during a neighborhood cookout to demonstrate opposition to violence with an antigun message printed on their t shirts as they gathered charlie gough years old was considering the prospect of a third marriage after two that each had lasted years "id have to be with a woman that likes horses thats for sure " he said "im down here every day and shed say "you love the horses more than me " nearby a year old boy named tyheed smith was brushing a gray horse named classic when her owner al lynch piped up "where your jeans at " asked mr lynch "wheres your white t " tyheed told him he would put on the unofficial uniform all riders were wearing "theyre in the truck " the horsemen that weekend were also worrying about their future for decades fletcher street and most of the citys horsemen were largely ignored by officials stables came and went over the years but there has always been vacant land to claim or another stable to squeeze into now inner city development is creating competition for property stables around town have been condemned and torn down the city has not announced specific plans for fletcher street but the local city councilman darrell clarke says he wants to see houses replace the stables mr clarke grew up in the neighborhood and knows several of the older horsemen from his childhood but he says "its not an ideal place for them they are in the middle of a residential block " most horsemen are unprotected half the block is owned by the philadelphia redevelopment authority an agency charged with developing underused property with a special emphasis on affordable housing the city aims to finish a major renewal project just to the south of fletcher street by neighbors have complained of the noise and smell and city animal control officials have fingered fletcher street as a "problem area" a finding the horsemen dispute mr clarke and other city officials say they believe the horsemen are doing something good for the community but cannot protect them "to be candid it is not a priority " says joyce wilkerson chief of staff for mayor john f street ms wilkerson who keeps a horse of her own in a stable in nearby fairmount park says "i look at a city that has an operating deficit a school system with problems " and too much crime "i dont think you take a sport like horses and make it a priority " comments like those have made the horsemen anxious "theres a pushout coming " says devon teagle a year old former jockey as horsemen around him nod "i dont know when but its coming " if the stables werent here says mr gough a retired welder "id just be home twiddling my thumbs " he comes to fletcher street every day to be with old friends horsemen say that many more horses used to live in their neighborhoods most of them kept in small stables of or so animals these urban stables thrived in the second half of the th century as the city abandoned industrial buildings that then made ideal rent free or inexpensive stable locations a large park system has fed the custom with nearly miles of trails in the middle of the city nearby amish auctions provide cheap horses costing as little as &# the horsemen do their own grooming and stall maintenance some have learned to do their own veterinary work and re shoeing but a recent boom in the center of the city pushed real estate developers into once off limits neighborhoods and that has put pressure on the stables in the city condemned a swath of land in west philadelphia to make way for a housing development when alisa sneed who worked for the city council went to the site to supervise the move out of displaced residents about a week before demolition she discovered horses living in what the city thought was an abandoned building that day she remembers "someone said what about the horses i said what horses as we were standing there one of the owners let a horse out of a building " she says "suddenly an abandoned lot became pasture " she and colleagues worked frantically over the next hours to make sure the horses left before bulldozers arrived a unit affordable housing development is expected to be completed on the site this year a more dramatic shutdown took place in when the city invoked eminent domain to take over a warehouse and land in brewerytown another north philadelphia neighborhood there were at least horses being kept at that site which acted as a central meeting place for riders all over the city after each shutdown some horsemen find another stable or just use their backyards which is legal in philadelphia but some also sell their horses more of the refugees are moving outside the city but that takes away the community element horsemen have enjoyed the city is "trying to push us to new jersey " where there are many stables says benjamin wright a longtime fletcher street regular known as uncle deek who hobbles because of hip surgery "im not going to run out to new jersey every day " adding to the concerns is a split on fletcher street where a stable about to move keeps about horses it is run as a nonprofit organization that teaches children to ride and compete in horse shows the strawberry mansion equestrian centers founder wayne harris has fought for a larger space to expand into for several years a few weeks ago the city tentatively agreed to give him a plot in an isolated area about four blocks away abutting railroad tracks mr harris an outsider who didnt grow up in the neighborhood and often sits apart from others on the street says he likely will start moving his horses to the new location in the next few months as he raises money to build a larger nicer facility he wants to make sure animal control or neighbors are never again a threat to his mission "i really want to make a class a stable so they cant bother us they cant say muddy or makeshift or anything " he says but he and others here are starting to realize that the move will make it easier for the city to shut down other stables remaining on fletcher street mr clarke says he hopes the other horsemen will follow mr harris but mr harris and a founding partner mr lynch say thats a bad idea mr lynch who grew up in a house directly behind the fletcher street stable says he and his partner dont want that many adults hanging around their stables cursing smoking marijuana and not riding properly in any event the two say potential boarders will have to follow their rules banning drinking cursing and fighting "it has to be family friendly " mr harris says
