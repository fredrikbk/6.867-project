blu ray or hd dvd which side are you on consumers hesitate to choose a high definition format batman plays it both ways its becoming a holiday tradition the two competing high definition dvd formats are gearing up for the christmas season each hoping to consign the other to the dustbin of consumer electronics and declare victory and just as last holiday season santa isnt going to declare a winner yet in fact a vexing contradiction has settled into the marketplace that is likely to prolong the fight between the toshiba backed hd dvd and the sony backed blu ray formats one contender hd dvd has taken the lead on the hardware side with about of sales according to adams media research hd dvd is moving ahead in that department because players in that format are cheaper at least two hd dvd players are available for less than &# and by the holidays there should be an offering at around &# many movie studio executives believe by contrast blu ray players start at &# yet blu ray has taken a big lead in sales of movie titles blu ray discs are outselling hd dvds by about to this year thats in part because so many people who bought sonys playstation game console which also plays blu ray discs have bought some high definition movies plus supporters of the blu ray technology have had an edge so far in brokering deals with movie studios for exclusive distribution of titles the upshot both formats remain viable and even though consumers can get free movies when they purchase a player millions of people are sitting on the sidelines their wallets untouched couper samuelson a producer in los angeles recently bought a top of the line samsung high definition television set but he skipped buying a dvd player of either format to go with it "if there was a clear winning horse i would have bet on that horse " he says instead mr samuelson mostly watches high definition movies and shows that his digital video recorder snags from his cable service compare the situation to regular dvds which were launched years ago in march that calendar year consumers bought dvd players according to the consumer electronics association but while high definition players of both formats have been available since the middle of last year only about have been sold according to adams media research gaming devices that play one format or the other add about million to the tally mostly blu ray but not everyone uses gaming devices for movies paul erickson an analyst at npd groups displaysearch says that like many analysts he has been forced to revise his next generation dvd sales projections downward this year though he declines to give a precise estimate he blames the format war less than the industrys failure to deliver a compelling product at compelling prices "you have to get people to care about this category to begin with " he says the growing popularity of big screen high definition tv sets which can play either format depending on the player you buy to go with it suggests that consumers are eager to watch cutting edge super crisp movies and hardware prices for both hd dvd and blu ray players are dropping but the battle over availability of titles is further muddying the picture until just a few weeks ago it was looking like blu ray could take a decisive lead the sony led coalition that backs blu ray has exclusive deals with news corp s fox walt disney co and sony corp s sony pictures blu ray alone would be able to offer high definition versions of two big expected holiday dvd releases disneys "pirates of the caribbean at worlds end" and sonys "spider man " the toshiba led consortium that backs hd dvd had only one of the major studios general electric co s universal signed on exclusively warner bros and viacom inc s paramount were publishing on both formats but last month after offering huge financial incentives like marketing support and cash payments the hd dvd camp got paramount and dreamworks animation skg to agree to publish high definition versions of their titles on hd dvd only that added two big holiday flicks paramounts "transformers" and dreamworks animations "shrek the third " to the list of hd dvd exclusives now just one expected top dvd blockbuster warner bros "harry potter and the order of the phoenix " will appear in both formats all of these movies of course are available in the traditional non high definition dvd format the latest deals were key for hd dvd says tom adams president of adams media research "generally paramount and dreamworks animation are moving toward bigger market share than theyve had in the past " he says "their move has more long term significance" than it would have even a couple of years ago trying to pick the winning format by looking ahead to next years hot releases is tricky too releasing new titles in hit movie series is always a sales driver but neither camp has the clear lead here the disney "pirates" franchise is on pause at least for now new "spider man" and "shrek" movies wont be ready yet many sequels that people will be buzzing about next year like the new "batman" movie will be coming out on both formats however universal will have new installments in the "hulk" and "mummy" series headed for hd dvd only while disney has a new "narnia" movie exclusive to blu ray the respective studios that have signed on exclusively to one format or the other are putting some of their own marketing heft into the battle anyone buying a player can expect free dvds with their purchase most toshiba players for example come with two free hd dvds in the box and coupons for five more sony players come with coupons for five free blu ray movies expect such promotions to ramp up as the holiday season gets into high gear
