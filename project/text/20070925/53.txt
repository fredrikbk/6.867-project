gertrude &amp alice b two lives by janet malcolm yale university press pages &# gertrude stein first met alice b toklas in when stein was living in paris where she had settled four years before and was still spending much of her time there with fellow americans it was hardly love at first sight in the notebooks she kept at the time stein was as brutal about toklas as she was about other members of her set "sordid " "conscienceless " "mean" and "low" were just some of the adjectives that stein lavished on her before long however gertrude and alice had become inseparable companions and they were to live together for nearly years until gertrudes death in their names became even more closely linked after gertrude published her most popular book "the autobiography of alice b toklas" a memoir in disguise that she dressed up as the work of her friend among other things the device enabled her to praise herself without reserve gertrude was the star alice was the worshiper gertrude was stout and striking looking alice was small and by conventional standards unattractive but they also had a great deal in common they were both the children of rich san francisco families and close in age they shared many artistic and domestic tastes and even at a time when people didnt talk publicly about such things there were no prizes for guessing that they were lesbians their relationship was strong but complicated it has many puzzling or problematic aspects and in "two lives" janet malcolm addresses herself to some of the more fascinating of them she begins by focusing on something to which gertrude and alice themselves almost never alluded the fact that they were both jewish this might not have been of much practical consequence if it had not been for the rise of nazism and if they had not chosen to remain in france during world war ii they spent the occupation in the french countryside in "the house of our dreams " as gertrude called it which had served as a holiday home since they had bought it in the s but literary eminence or eminence of any kind was no protection against the nazi death machine and many readers must have wondered how they managed to survive the main answer seems to be that they enjoyed the protection of an old friend a french writer named bernard fay fay had been appointed head of the bibliotheque nationale by the vichy authorities in he conferred with marshal petain once a month and claimed to have interceded with him on gertrude and alices behalf after the war he was tried as a collaborator and sentenced to life imprisonment that much is familiar from stein biographies but ms malcolm has drawn on the lesser known work of specialists and dug deeper herself she draws a vivid sketch of fay and reveals that his activities were much worse than a loose general reference to "collaboration" might suggest his specialty was persecuting freemasons he was responsible for of them being imprisoned and for more than being sent to their deaths gertrude provided fay with a testimonial while he was awaiting trial after the war alices loyalty to him went further in she helped finance his escape from a prison hospital he fled to switzerland where he lived until he was granted a pardon in it seems highly unlikely that gertrude knew anything about fays treatment of the freemasons although fay had told her during the war that he had to do a lot of things that were "not always pleasant " he also persuaded her to start work on a translation mercifully abandoned of petains speeches this at a time when the vichy persecutions were already in full swing ms malcolm devotes about half her book to gertrude and alices wartime experiences but not all at one go her account is woven together with a more general consideration of their lives and personalities a very acute one in recounting what might be called the "may" and "can" affair for instance she offers a powerful glimpse into sadomasochistic undercurrents in their relationship that for the most part can only be guessed at when alice discovered that more than years earlier before she herself knew her gertrude had been in love with a young woman called may alice ordered gertrude to go through the manuscript of her latest book deleting the word "may" wherever it occurred and substituting the word "can " even when it made no sense gertrude duly complied although the force with which the words were crossed out suggests that she was burning with anger ms malcolms book is shrewd humane and beautifully written she makes steins work seem more meaningful than most commentators do by bringing out its full psychological interest and while she doesnt flinch from showing stein at her worst she reminds us of her good qualities too her humor for instance her offbeat intelligence her courage in following her own artistic road in the end ms malcolm finds herself drawn back to the question of jewishness she points out how evasive stein remained in print about being jewish herself even after she had begun to come to terms with what the war had really meant still at least she sometimes broached the issue which is more than can be said for her partner "toklass un jewishness " ms malcolm writes "is one of her signatures " in her autobiography her real autobiography that is it was called "what is remembered" alice describes a trip to poland to visit her paternal grandparents without giving any indication that they were jews let alone that her grandfather was a rabbi in at the age of alice became a catholic one of the anxieties of her final years was that when she got to heaven she would find that gertrude was stuck in limbo but alice still lived in the hope that they would ultimately be reunited and spend the rest of eternity together mr gross is the author of "the rise and fall of the man of letters" and "a double thread growing up english and jewish in london "
