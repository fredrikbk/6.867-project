business technology web address theft is everyday event short or memorable domain names can fetch millions of dollars like real world theft the hijacking of an internet address can happen quickly and with little warning new york computer consultant ronen inowlocki knows firsthand in july a thief connived to take control of the yyy com address that mr inowlocki has owned for years mr inowlocki is still fighting to get it back and cant access the " yyy com" email addresses he had used to communicate with clients meanwhile the thief shifted the internet address also known as a domain to a service in germany and lists a mailing address in iceland as his contact info experts say the theft of internet domain names occurs every day the thieves taking advantage of companies that have either let down their guard or failed to take adequate precautions are often after financial gain since short or memorable domains can be sold for millions of dollars and generate web traffic and online advertising revenue some domain hijackers are former employees or others looking to extract payments or take revenge "its a complete rampage in our industry " says monte cahn founder and chief executive of moniker online services llc in pompano beach fla which handles domain services such as registrations and auctions bob parsons chief executive officer of godaddy com inc says the domain registrar is aware of daily hijacking incidents with the frequency having increased as internet use grows but he and other domain experts say businesses can take simple measures to protect domains and notes there are techniques that help in the event they are hijacked companies or individuals register web domain names with some of the roughly independent registrars world wide or their affiliated resellers usually paying a small annual fee the registrars who are accredited by the nonprofit internet corporation for assigned names and numbers collect identification and technical information from those registering that information is used to route internet traffic so that when someone types a web address say www apple com into their browser software they are directed to apple inc s computer servers or when they send an email it ends up at the right place once they register them owners can transfer or sell the domains to other people the sale of the "porn com" domain for &# million is the biggest reported sale so far this year according to domain name journal internet domains are prized for several reasons including their individuality their brand recognition or simply because they are easy to remember thus increasing customer traffic two companies cant both own and use "car com" simultaneously for example numerous businesses have suffered from domain name hijacking in january a thief took control of "panix com" away from internet service provider public access networks corp emails to panix customers bounced during the roughly two days that panix lost control of the domain in another case it took the owner of "sex com" years to regain the domain after it had been hijacked using a forged letter to the registrar domain experts say protecting the email address used to register the domain safe from break ins is one of the most important steps to guarding the domain contact information for the person registering each domain is made publicly available online in a "whois" database hijackers sometimes break into the email address listed for a domain and use that account to change the domain owners password with the registrar and authorize the domains transfer thats what happened to mr inowlocki with the domain thief breaking into his free yahoo inc email account to seize yyy com the domain experts say it is generally safer to use a corporate email address rather than a free web email account offered by portals such as yahoo thats partly because the free web email addresses can expire if they arent used for a few years and then a domain hijacker can easily snatch them up passwords that are hard to guess and changed frequently are also key owners need to "treat access to their email account as securely as they would treat credit card numbers and other important information " says john berryhill a lawyer in media pa who handles domain related issues other measures to protect domains include keeping the information in the whois database up to date and registering it in the name of one of the owners or senior executives of a business if the contact information held by the registrar isnt accurate registrars can have a tougher time verifying who is trying to make any changes domain experts say problems frequently occur when an outside contractor or employee registers a companys domain in their own name later on they can use that to claim personal ownership of the domain in order to try to extract money from the business or cause problems experts are divided on whether businesses should use private registration services where registrars information is listed in the whois database rather than that of the owners such a measure could make it harder to impersonate the owner or crack into the email account but richard lau a london based domain name consultant says that can make it harder for individuals trying to quickly verify ownership of a domain that has been transferred mr lau advises businesses with valuable domains to use free and inexpensive services offered by some registrars that require additional layers of verification before a domain can be transferred from its owner one of his clients has an "executive lock " which requires the companys chief executive to meet personally with the registrars staff before it will transfer a domain "the more valuable your domain name the more you need to sacrifice convenience for security " says mr lau moniker for one offers a free executive lock service as part of its domain registration service which costs about &# to &# per year owners get a separate password they need to provide for the domain to be transferred for a few dollars annually godaddy com will lock a domain from being transferred under most circumstances and extend the ownership for another year even if the owner forgets to renew it at least one company offers insurance against domain theft when a domain is stolen the owner needs to contact his registrar as soon as he becomes aware of it in some cases the owners registrar can negotiate with the hijackers registrar to have the domain returned in others the owners registrar needs to file a formal complaint if those dont work the owner can file a lawsuit mr lau says it is important to act quickly "if the current owner sells the domain to an innocent third party then it really gets murky and thats when you really have to be committed to a long fight " he says in mr inowlockis case his registrar says it hasnt had any luck recovering the domain from the registrar that yyy com was transferred to key systems gmbh in germany key systems ceo alexander siffrin says that is because mr inowlockis registrar tierranet inc unit domaindiscover hasnt yet made a formal complaint or gotten a court order once it supplies "definite evidence of illegal activities involved in the transfer process we will agree to transfer the domain name back " says mr siffrin
