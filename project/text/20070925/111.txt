the divided world of berlin in in regard to gabor steingart "from berlin to baghdad " editorial page sept i also grew up in berlin after the war however contrary to mr steingarts assertion berlin then and baghdad now have nothing in common except that both cities start with the letter "b " in baghdad today a civil war is raging between sunnis and shiites with the kurds standing by not liking either of these factions in berlin after the war people were relieved that the war was over those of us in the american british or french sectors were glad that we werent in the soviet sector and people in the soviet sector were overwhelmingly unhappy that they werent in one of the western sectors the division of the city was not due to civil strife but to geopolitical factors such as the cold war which started almost immediately after the end of world war ii caused the soviets to occupy east germany with several hundred thousand troops for years and didnt end until the berlin wall came down in at that point the two halves of germany reunited peacefully the united western powers led by the u s stood firm during world war ii which was started by germany and they stood firm in the cold war this time supported by the germans president kennedy could stand on the balcony of the berlin city hall because the german people loved what america was doing today it would be difficult for an american president to travel like this almost anywhere in the world comparing the cold war to our unilateral involvement in todays civil war in iraq is far fetched indeed karl m von der heyden new york mr steingart is well wide of the mark when he compares berlin in and on into the cold war with baghdad in if the u s withdraws from baghdad and from iraq for that matter the shiites will remain in control of baghdad and the central government iran would not permit the sunnis to recapture control of the city or the central government and nothing the u s does or does not do will alter that basic fact of the equation the soviet union posed an enormous threat to western europe and to the u s and confronting soviet forces in a determined but peaceful fashion saved the planet from catastrophe by contrast a shiite government in iraq was the certain outcome of the overthrow of saddam hussein and the dissolution of the sunni controlled armed forces and secret police jacques chirac told tony blair before we invaded that a shiite government in baghdad was not to be confused with democracy james canning seattle
