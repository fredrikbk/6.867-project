a farmer outstanding in his field maze making sharon conn we are wandering through a field corn reaching to a height of feet towers above us on either side it is late afternoon and i am somewhere in a acre corn maze at ellsworth farm in sharon conn attempting to find a crop of soybeans planted somewhere within my guide is allen cockerline the maze designer who has planted the soybeans after taking any number of turns we seem to be retracing the same path we had traversed five minutes before theres still no sign of the soybeans and i begin to think we may never reach them let alone ever find our way out of the maze mr cockerline however is elated for him this seems to be a kind of litmus test "this is good news " he declares triumphantly "since if i can get lost in my own maze it must be a good one " he pauses thinks makes an abrupt turn and we continue to zigzag and circle a few more minutes he announces that we are now on the right track and indeed suddenly the path opens into a large glade thickly planted with soybeans one of four destinations he has carefully organized within the confines of the maze ive never seen soybeans growing so we stop to admire the crop covered with green leaves and beginning to form tight little pods then we set off again in search of the other three plantings our trail leads us first to sorghum used in the south for making syrup next to broom corn and finally to a dramatic mass of sunflowers just about to burst into bloom mr cockerline is a local farmer who began designing mazes eight years ago he got interested when a friend of his described a corn maze he had recently visited it struck him as an interesting idea a chance to make a little money and a good way to get children interested in the land as a farmer he knew the correct way to plant a corn field so he got out pencil and paper and worked on a plan next he came up with the idea of planting different crops within the maze and using them as "destinations" that provided the answers to a series of questions about the crops the composition of the soil and the contours of the land a sheet with a list of questions is given to each child or family group entering the maze theres nothing dumbed down about these questions and to answer them requires good observation skills for instance do you know what a drumlin is mr cockerline estimates that to "do" the maze reach all the crop destinations and answer the questions takes most people about an hour and do children ever get lost in the maze "well the only time that ever happened " he told me was when "i had this grandfather come out of the maze and tell me hes lost his grandson so i went into the maze to find him and soon enough the kid appeared but im not lost he tells me i just wanted to ditch my grandfather " mr cockerlines first maze which ran from labor day to halloween and was open on weekends proved extremely popular so much so that he has made one each subsequent year and last summer he introduced two "moonlight maze" evenings which were a big hit this year he decided to take a break rather than organize his own maze he chose to design one for a local farmer michael bozzi whose farm is well known in the area for its "pick your own" berries in the past years corn mazes have become big business not only in this country but all across europe the generally acknowledged father of the maze movement is adrian fisher an englishman who for years not only has created mazes but has turned them into a form of popular entertainment his web site www mazemaker com gives a huge list of his clients and provides details on some of his most fanciful designs from mazes in the shape of a sheriffs badge and a "royal" crown to the worlds first double decker bridge in a cornfield set within the design of a tyrannosaurus rex his biggest client in this country is the davis megamaze in sterling mass go to its highly commercial web site www davisfarmland com megamaze and you will see that this years offering is "the lost vegas" maze experience the other big man in the world of mazes is brett herbst his first was done on his own farm and in he set up a company to design mazes for clients he works on computer and his web site www cornfieldmaze com reveals that he has designed mazes since then this year alone hes done of them either charging a one time design fee which begins at &# or taking a share of the take mr herbst is also partial to fanciful designs such as pirate ships and he told me that some of his mazes attract visitors in a season that typically runs for less than two months the name of the game for mr herbst is what he calls "entertainment" farming at his own farm in lehi utah you mix the "mcdonalds playland concept with a whole lot of fun on the farm " in addition to the maze its theme this year is pirates of the caribbean theres a cow train singing chicken demonstrations pig races and even a target range where you can practice your skill at shooting ears of corn the overall concept of consumer focused activities on the farm which can range from pick your own fruit to hay rides petting zoos to pumpkin fests is called agritourism which it seems has become the latest gambit in small farm survival tactics and is now taught as a subject in many agricultural colleges mr herbst is an agribusiness graduate from brigham young university mr cockerline who cheerfully admits hes small potatoes in the maze game visitors represents good attendance for him wants no part of what he considers the blatant commercialization of most mazes and shook his head in horror when i told him that the questions in one farmers maze were all about finding the names of films and film stars forget johnny depp and captain sparrow for him the maze experience is about getting kids to observe the stems of broom corn and having them understand how this plant has played a role in cleaning houses since time immemorial and drumlins of course ms garmey writes about gardens and gardening for the journal
