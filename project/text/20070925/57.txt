fight over jobs cost cuts spurs walkout at gm first strike since is big test for wagoner investors are unfazed detroit workers at general motors corp walked out of factories across the u s exploding a nearly decadelong truce between the auto maker and its union the strike came as negotiations over a new national contract foundered on a big issue whether the united auto workers having made big concessions on health care should get some kind of jobs guarantee from gm the unions membership has shriveled rapidly in recent years amid big buyouts and it wants to stop the bleeding "globalization is killing us " said jerry gillespie president of a uaw local in warren mich whose members work on engineering and design of future products "they want to build engineering centers in the rest of the world and take that work away from us thats our fight " gm was resisting the uaw demand for jobs guarantees the companys goal in the talks is to win a contract that would allow it to narrow or even eliminate the wage gap with asian rivals at stake is the long term competitiveness some say survival of the unionized u s auto makers as well as the future of a union that once led the way for organized labor in winning health care benefits and retirement security it was the first uaw strike to hit gm since and the first strike over a national contract since production at gms more than facilities in the u s shut down idling workers investors generally took a sanguine view of the strike believing that it was another step albeit a theatrical one in negotiations some cheered signs that gm management was taking a hard line in p m new york stock exchange composite trading gm shares were down cents or to &# for now gm has ample inventory of most of its key vehicles although a prolonged strike could hamper introduction of important new models such as the chevrolet malibu because the strike isnt affecting other auto makers car buyers will still have plenty of choices uaw members make fewer than half of the cars sold in the u s gm could lose &# million a day due to the strike in the short run analysts estimated if the strike extends to a month and production is lost in canada and mexico gm could burn up to &# billion as end of the month costs add to the tab analysts said the canadian auto workers union said it expected to stop work today at car plants in oshawa ontario and production at a canadian truck factory could stop later in the week the teamsters union said its members wouldnt cross uaw picket lines to ship to dealers gm vehicles that have been produced and are sitting on factory lots the strike will push at least caw and teamster members off the job as well as thousands of workers at parts companies that supply gm plants the clash could be short lived gm and uaw bargainers resumed talks yesterday afternoon they recessed in the evening and planned to start again today but the issues are challenging gm wants control over its manufacturing investments including the right to move more production overseas it also wants to be able to set lower wages and benefits for newly hired workers and more flexibility to shrink or expand the work force to meet demand the strike represents a stiff test for gm chief executive rick wagoner and his top lieutenant in the uaw negotiations chief financial officer fritz henderson the strike in was costly for gm and mr wagoner has worked diligently to maintain peace with the uaw even as he steadily brought down the number of uaw workers through attrition and buyouts while quality and productivity improved gm north america is still a money loser on the other side of the table uaw president ron gettelfinger is under pressure from his members not to give away hard won wages and benefits mr gettelfinger expressed frustration during a news conference yesterday that talks with gm management had been "one way " he said the uaw didnt want a strike but felt it was "pushed off a cliff" by gm executives at the big three detroit auto makers believe theyre running out of time to make a major overhaul of costs gm ford motor co and chrysler llc have all lost money and market share in their u s operations during the past several years although sales were decent and the economy was generally healthy now the housing slowdown is threatening to reduce demand for new cars the debt of the big three is rated at junk levels on sept the uaw singled out gm as its so called strike target meaning the auto maker would be the lead negotiator for the big three any deal with gm would be a model for the other two auto makers by last thursday say people involved in the talks the uaw and gm came to basic agreement on a framework for creating an independent health care trust to take over some &# billion in health care benefits owed by gm to union retirees creating the trust would save auto makers the equivalent of about &# to &# an hour in workers wages according to estimates from the management side for the unions the trust is an enormous and historic concession no longer would gm be responsible as a company for the health of its retirees instead the union itself would bear most of the risk of rising health care costs many expected gm and the union quickly to work out remaining issues such as wages and job security but the talks turned contentious over the weekend mr gettelfinger told union leaders on sunday night to prepare for a strike at a m yesterday in a move that took many auto industry watchers by surprise uaw leaders argue that the health concession should be the main one they make in the current contract according to union officials and others briefed on the uaws plans in exchange the union believes gm ought to make long term guarantees of new investments and new products at plants around the country say people involved in the talks for example the uaw would like gm to build its planned electric car the chevrolet volt in the u s preferably at the lordstown ohio assembly plant these people said for its part management says the health care trust would close only about half of the cost gap with asian auto makers who are estimated to have labor costs of around &# to &# an hour compared with &# to &# an hour at the big three that works out to more than &# billion a year in extra labor costs at the big three according to management estimates back in june an auto executive involved in contract talks said the gap "has to be gone by the end of the contract or doing business in the united states is unsustainable " john bergstrom a wisconsin dealer with several gm stores reflected managements view "we have a good inventory of cars and trucks and whether we did or not we would feel very strongly about it being time we got our costs in line with our asian competitors " mr bergstrom said job security is a big issue for the union since the last contract was negotiated in uaw membership at the big three has fallen from to about a decline of more than mr gillespie the president of the local with engineering and design workers said his members used to work on every car and truck built by gm today they are limited to working on big trucks and luxury cars he said work on midsize and small cars has shifted to engineering centers in india china brazil and australia "we want to do all of the engineering all of the design here in the united states " he said people familiar with the talks said gm is resisting jobs commitments unless it is allowed to give new hires lesser benefits such as k plans instead of pensions "gm has pretty much drawn that line in the sand " said david cole president of the center for automotive research and a longtime gm confidant "on one side of the line you guys in the union are competitive and we invest in the united states on the other side of the line we dont and we become much more of a non u s manufacturer " mr cole noted that gm already has about older workers among its uaw members who could retire soon because they are close to the year mark at the company the right to retire after years was won after the strike "the threat is gm says we could add the jobs here or we dont replace them and they go somewhere else " he said morgan stanley analyst jonathan steinmetz in a report yesterday estimated that gm has liquidity to weather a walkout of several weeks he noted that the company has &# billion in cash an additional &# billion due from the sale of a unit and &# billion in credit lines the uaw has an estimated &# million strike fund striking workers receive about &# a week in strike benefits adding to the tension the uaw raised for the first time in the talks the issue of gm executive pay "it seems odd to us that as much as workers do workers cant do enough as much as executives get they cannot get enough " mr gettelfinger said earlier this year gm disclosed that mr wagoner received restricted stock valued at &# million and stock options as part of his pay package for the company says the ceo has previously taken compensation cuts and his compensation is performance based this is the first significant strike by the uaw against gm since when a walkout at two factories in flint mich crippled gms u s production for nearly two months that action largely provoked by a dispute over outsourcing ended up costing the company &# billion and led to market share losses that the company never fully recovered workers began walking out of gm factories at a m and quickly set up picket lines workers at the detroit hamtramck plant which builds buick lucerne and cadillac dts cars walked in circles holding green and white picket signs that said "uaw on strike " passersby honked their horns at the picketers "we didnt want it to come to this " said willie brown a year old worker with years at gm "weve got to do what weve got to do to get what we need to get " joseph b white and mike spector contributed tothis article
