look whos watching your health expenses employers increasingly turn to care managers to control medical costs but some wonder if patients always benefit in a bid to control spiraling health care costs a growing number of employers and health insurers are turning to services that essentially audit an employees health care and look for ways to both improve outcomes and save money but critics contend that some of these programs intrude into the private relationship between patients and their doctors and that they add yet another layer of bureaucracy while saving money mostly by denying or switching specific drugs and procedures the services are provided by companies known as care managers or integrated health managers healthways inc paradigmhealth inc and others in the business often review doctors treatment plans to make sure they conform to evidence based practices established by medical standard setting bodies based on the results of these reviews the companies then may nix certain drugs or procedures some services also help coordinate care for seriously ill people including finding appropriate hospitals and therapies and helping them deal with the tangle of health care red tape some care managers also provide medical second opinions with the idea that an incorrect diagnosis can waste money j b hunt transport inc and conagra foods inc for instance offer their employees the second opinion services of best doctors inc as a free voluntary benefit workers and their families arent required to use the service and dont have to take the advice care management

to be intrusive she says she received repeated phone calls about her asthma and her husbands multiple medical issues even when she asked them to stop "i dont want to talk to a stranger on the phone about my health care when it is being controlled very well by my doctor " ms donatelle says "i dont see the need for another stranger in the mix " a spokeswoman for blue cross blue shield of minnesota declined to comment on ms donatelles case but said "our research shows that over of members who participate with our care management programs say they are satisfied or very satisfied with their interactions in the programs " other critics say care managers can be rigid not taking into account differences among individual patients and the judgment of doctors and nurses on the scene "the patients physician should ultimately be the one in charge " says cecil wilson immediate past chairman of the american medical association he says care management programs can be helpful in delivering quality health care so long as cost reduction isnt the primary consideration but care managers dont always steer patients to the least expensive drugs and procedures jamie rochowiak a year old mail
