how cerberus hedged auto bets buyout shop brought in some savvy investors where the risk lurks with general motors corp hit by a nationwide strike and the debt of companies in the auto industry gyrating hedge funds and private equity firms could be more exposed to any possible problems than many even in the industry realize cerberus capital management lp made headlines when it spent billions buying up majority stakes of chrysler llc and gmac in a big bet on the auto industry over the past year but cerberus mitigated its own risk by selling big chunks of chrysler and general motors acceptance corp or gmac to a group of well known hedge funds and private equity firms including eton park capital management avenue capital york capital and matlinpatterson asset management lp according to people close to the matter each of the firms invested &# million or more in at least one of cerberuss auto deals these people said hedge funds gabriel capital seneca capital and durham asset management which have board seats on gmacs board also invested alongside cerberus it isnt unusual for groups of investors to team up to make a big acquisition but cerberuss group includes some of the top names in distressed debt investing as well as some newer players in private equity some of whom dont usually invest with others the firms are among a larger group of hedge funds with a stake in the auto industry at an especially turbulent moment other hedge funds have been actively trading the shares and debt of gm and ford motor co in recent weeks while still others have taken large stakes in other auto related companies the value of some of these investments has fallen sharply this year dealing the funds with losses but various auto investments have rallied in recent weeks and many of the hedgies are upbeat that their investments will pay off investors in the deals say they arent overly focused on the uaw negotiations in part because gmac does more than auto lending and chrysler has an existing labor deal that has been extended they say they havent counted on labor concessions to make the deals succeed in august cerberus completed a deal to acquire an stake in chrysler agreeing to invest &# billion in the auto maker and its finance unit last april cerberus led a group that bought a majority stake in gmac for about &# billion payable over three years the deals with the other investors allowed cerberus to reduce its risk by trimming its equity investments in the two companies to about &# billion according to an investor in the deal cerberuss investor deals werent well publicized some of the managers of the hedge funds dont themselves know who else invested along with the private equity firm a spokesman for cerberus wouldnt comment one sign of how firmly these investors believe in cerberuss chrysler and gmac deals some of them such as matlinpatterson broke from a policy of putting money only into companies that they can control agreeing to let cerberus run the companies at the same time the private equity and hedge funds agreed to pay cerberus an incentive fee or a percentage of profits from the deal for the right to invest along with cerberus thats unusual some of the firms like avenue capital never have agreed to those conditions before the potential payments mean that investors in the various hedge funds and private equity funds that handed money over to cerberus in effect will pay two incentive fees once directly to the firms they invest with and another time when these firms pay cerberus executives who invested in the cerberus deals note that the fees which are below industry standards will be paid only after the investment is sold and only if it doubles in value they also say cerberus is doing the heavy lifting on the deals including lending its own management expertise which helps justify the potential fees some of the firms such as eton park and avenue capital are involved only in the gmac transaction and not chrysler regarding the gmac deal as an inexpensive way to gain control of an automotive lender that also has exposure to other types of lending they feared that chrysler was a more direct wager on the health of the auto industry the investors in chrysler argue that the purchase was so inexpensive that even if the auto maker runs into more problems the transaction could be a winner in part because of the value of chrysler finance the lending arm talks with the uaw also could bring some relief for the auto makers say some of the investors working with cerberus a deal at gm will set the pattern for contracts at chrysler and ford potentially allowing chrysler to better deal with retiree health care obligations and compete with foreign competition hedge funds say that auto related shares and debt have been among the most popular trades in recent weeks resulting in some losses for various firms gmacs long term bonds for example have fallen to about cents on the dollar from about &# earlier this year though they have rallied from cents a few weeks ago other auto investments including shares of gm and ford have also rallied over the past few weeks
