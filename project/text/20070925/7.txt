a green ride for investors auto makers dread the added cost burdens from tougher fuel economy regulations but some companies in another part of the auto sector could stand to reap windfalls suppliers just as suppliers making antilock brakes and air bags benefited from more stringent safety standards years ago companies focused on products such as advanced exhaust systems more efficient diesel engines and turbochargers could boost their top lines in the years ahead amid concerns over global warming and dependence on foreign oil that could be good news for stock market investors grabbing shares of environmentally focused parts makers is a timely play as congress tackles new auto regulations this fall and the bush administration nears completion of its own rules on vehicle mileage potentially raising the standards as much as over the next decade "for us its a nuisance " said bo andersson general motors corp s global purchasing chief "for suppliers its revenue like hell " one of the biggest potential winners borgwarner inc the auburn hills mich companys portfolio is dominated by parts that improve vehicle efficiency including emissions curbing exhaust gasoline recirculation systems variable cam timing for engines and turbochargers for diesel engines turbochargers also boost power in smaller and more efficient gasoline powered motors borgwarners stock is up since it hit a week low of &# last september and could move higher analysts said just yesterday gms workers walked off the job after the united auto workers and the auto maker failed to reach an agreement on a new contract though a prolonged strike by the union could be a drag on any of the parts suppliers it would have less effect on companies like borgwarner that have limited exposure to detroits car companies in p m new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday borgwarners shares rose cents or to &# the stock trades at about times projected per share earnings for this year according to thomson financial borgwarners stock could balloon to &# by years end and as high as &# by said joseph amaturo a buckingham research group analyst who has a "strong buy" rating on the suppliers shares near term mr amaturo said the supplier is insulated from a sales downturn at u s auto companies detroits big three account for only of borgwarners annual sales and is well positioned to take advantage of stricter fuel economy rules "almost everything that company does is aimed at making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient " said john casesa managing partner of casesa shapiro group an auto industry advisory firm and a former merrill lynch &amp co auto analyst "its very hard to find a company that is a pure play on these themes borgwarner would be one of them " exhaust systems and turbochargers could prove critical as auto makers increasingly employ diesel engines which are about more fuel efficient than their gasoline counterparts diesels make up only about of the u s light duty vehicle market but annual increases in federal mileage rules could push that penetration to about by according to global insight a forecasting firm gm ford motor co and chrysler llc each have announced plans to put diesel engines in their light duty pickups and most auto companies are looking at diesel for passenger cars honeywell international inc like borgwarner stands to see its turbocharger business expand amid interest in diesel other companies that could benefit from washingtons new green streak include tenneco inc and modine manufacturing co which make emissions reducing exhaust equipment another potential beneficiary is johnson controls inc which builds batteries for gasoline electric hybrids some companies that are exposed to less efficient vehicles could stand to benefit in the long term if they meet the changing demands of auto makers navistar international corp for example supplies diesel engines for fords heavy duty trucks but could transfer that expertise to smaller cars as auto makers introduce more efficient diesel engines in that segment a potential benefit that wall street hasnt priced in yet analysts said the same goes for cummins inc which builds diesel engines for chryslers heavy duty dodge trucks the upside is "those two companies already make diesel engines for the big three today " said peter nesvold an analyst with bear stearns cos who has a "hold" rating on navistar and a "buy" on cummins "theyre the incumbent theyre more likely to get the new business " tougher mileage regulations arent a boon for all parts makers investors should be wary of american axle &amp manufacturing holdings inc which makes axles and drivelines that connect a vehicles transmission and wheels about half of the detroit suppliers revenue comes from gms pickups and sport utility vehicles which have suffered sales declines over the past two years as consumers shift to more efficient passenger cars "the capitulation or deterioration in truck market share going forward would impact them certainly near term and they likely wouldnt be able to make up for it " said rich kwas an analyst with wachovia corp of charlotte n c mr kwas has a "hold" rating on american axle which does business with wachovia the bank holds a less than stake in american axle the suppliers shares fell cents or to &# yesterday on the big board
