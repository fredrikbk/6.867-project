imf urges slow approach to financial regulation washington although global economic fallout from the u s subprime mortgage crisis is likely to be protracted governments shouldnt "rush to regulate everything " said the international monetary funds top financial review official jaime caruana in its semiannual review of global financial issues the imf concluded the "threat to financial stability increased " largely because of uncertainty over how credit problems are transmitted globally and how deeply the credit crunch will bite around the world in good times the complexity of the financial system helps spread risk among institutions and countries lessening the possibility that any one sector will be battered in bad times this complexity makes it hard to figure out where problems will materialize "while potentially helping protect the financial system from concentrations of credit risk in banks the dispersal of structured credit products has substantially increased uncertainty about the extent of the risks and where they are ultimately held " the imf said with few developing countries facing financial crises that prompt them to borrow from the imf reviews of global economic problems have become an important part of the agencys role in the late s the imf played a central role in trying to rescue and revive countries ranging from russia to thailand to brazil and got mixed reviews for its efforts as the global economy recovered asian and latin american nations paid off their imf loans early and built up huge financial reserves partly to free themselves from imf mandates the imf said it is trying to help prevent future crises by highlighting potential problems ahead of time "the new element in the global economy is the complexity of the new financial system " said mr caruana mortgages for instance are packaged in so many different kinds of financial instruments held by so many different kinds of investors that individual investors lose incentive to do sufficient due diligence figuring someone else in the chain has already done so ratings firms also have a hard time properly understanding the risks
