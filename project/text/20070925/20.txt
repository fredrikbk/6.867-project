business technology talking tech whats happening on the wi fi scene a year or so ago there was considerable excitement in some quarters and trepidation in others about the prospect of free or low cost wi fi networks being set up in cities philadelphia was among the first to explore the idea and other municipalities followed in recent weeks though some wi fi projects including those in metropolitan san francisco and in the south san francisco bay area known as silicon valley have announced that their networks are being delayed or even canceled esme vos a well known commentator on the wi fi scene explains whats going on q so is urban wi fi dead or are reports of its demise exaggerated a its exaggerated very big projects where the city or the region wanted someone the private sector to put up all the costs are either on hold or dead but other projects are moving forward minneapolis is going ahead with its project in that city there is a commitment to pay the service provider us internet &# million a year for the citys own use of the network that would include public safety mobile workers public utilities these services could be made more efficient by having access to wi fi everywhere q what is happening in philadelphia which received a lot of criticism for its wi fi project a the city is going on with the deployment it hasnt stopped q the proposal for silicon valley seems to have stalled but the geographic region involved in silicon valley is immense wouldnt that be a problem for an internet service provider a yes it makes a difference from the standpoint of your business model im a provider id prefer to be in a city like philadelphia where there are a lot of people and where there are also a lot of businesspeople as well as visitors why because i can charge them a day or weekly rate q how well do these wi fi networks work indoors a not very well right now if you have thin walls or if youre sitting next to an access point it might be fine but otherwise you might need a device called a wireless bridge at your window to amplify the signal indoors these cost between &# and &# q metropolitan wi fi networks are often pitched in part as a way to help bridge the digital divide involving people who cant afford computers or web access but how will it help them if they have to go outside to use it a most of the digital divide programs that ive seen have a budget item for these indoor repeaters so they have thought about this issue q the iphone which has built in wi fi has gotten a lot of attention recently do you think devices like these will lead to greater demand for urban wi fi networks a yes i was just with a friend in new york who had an iphone and i can tell you its like color tv once you get used to it you never go back theres nothing like walking around new york and being able to look up a restaurant no matter where you are q is there anything else interesting occurring in the world of public wi fi a there is free wi fi on a bus that runs between london and oxford which is one of the busiest bus lines in europe the service takes advantage of the g phone network which is available everywhere in europe there is a box inside the bus that converts the g signal to wi fi it costs the bus company gbp or about &# a month per bus to do be able to do that and they love it because it helps them with their goal of getting as many people as possible on the bus
