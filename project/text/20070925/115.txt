that could value all of facebook at &# billion or higher people familiar with the matter tell the wall street journal but these people say that google is also angling for a facebook stake the microsoft bid is a "sign of a new urgency by the software giant to jump start its online business at a time when google is widening its lead in the fast growing internet advertising business " the journal says microsoft executives worry the company is moving too slowly to establish what people familiar with the company describe as "a broad beachhead in the online advertising world " according to the journal the journal says those worries come at a time when some industry executives see the internet at a turning point akin to the computer operating system sectors two decades ago "whoever controls the technology platform for buying and selling online ads could hold tremendous power over the internet industry for years to come much as microsoft was able to use its windows operating system to shape the personal computer " with that in mind microsoft has hired a new executive from outside the company and granted him broad powers former advertising executive brian mcandrews joined microsoft last month when the software giant acquired online advertising specialist aquantive and his mission is to line up advertisers who will buy ads through microsofts ad "platform" a single system selling ads that can appear on many sites and that web publishers can use to get ads for their sites google yahoo and time warners aol are racing to establish their own platforms the journal

billion on the assumption that in the future facebook will become a powerful player in the online world " the times reports but the bidding for facebook comes amid a recent escalation of prices for online properties reminiscent of the dotcom boom and the times notes "these numbers might have little basis in actual revenue or profit " and that it isnt even clear how profitable facebook currently is the journal reports that the price of a facebook stake will depend on how its traffic growth and other factors change in the coming years still facebook comes with baggage just yesterday the office of new york attorney general andrew cuomo revealed it is investigating how facebook protects its users after undercover investigators posed as under age web surfers on the site and repeatedly received sexual solicitations as ad age reports and authorities said facebook failed to respond at times to the investigators complaints about predatory behavior whatever the risks facebooks attraction for microsoft and google is just the latest affirmation of the importance of social networking and user generated content in any consideration of online media and commerce a factor that could give a boost

journal says whether the uaw should get "some kind of jobs guarantee from gm" in exchange for its big concessions on health care gm is resisting that because "the companys goal in the talks is to win
