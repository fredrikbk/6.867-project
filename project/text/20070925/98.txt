politics &amp economics u s plans on co percolate both aid and penalties would cut emissions by developing nations washington the bush administration will offer a variety of diplomatic carrots this week to encourage china india brazil and other large developing nations to join a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which are warming earths atmosphere meanwhile congress is working on what amounts to a stick an economic penalty that could be imposed on goods imported from developing nations if those nations dont move to curb carbon dioxide and other related emissions by ministers from countries representing large industrial and developing nations that produce about of the planets warming emissions are set to meet at the state department on thursday the two day meeting is expected to be the first in a series designed to come up with a process to include developing nations in a new reduction effort when the kyoto protocol ends in meanwhile the united nations held an unprecedented debate on climate change yesterday u n secretary general ban ki moon opened the discussion by calling for a breakthrough in talks for a broader global emissions reduction program former vice president al gore gov arnold schwarzenegger of california and secretary of state condoleezza rice also spoke at the u n the bush administration hopes to encourage a variety of reductions by developing countries that could supplement more formal regulatory programs by industrial nations including the u s one reason the bush administration withdrew from the treaty in was because developing nations were not required to reduce their emissions one u s official described the new administration effort as "passing the hat " getting each developing nation to contribute what it can in return industrial nations would promise help on trade and technology developing nations led by china have argued for decades that they should wait until the u s and other industrial nations make reductions industrial nations are expected to use the forum to counter that rising sea levels and other damage expected to come with global warming can only be mitigated by a prompt global effort congress is studying various bills that would require reductions on emissions and could pass as early as this year the environmental protection agency is working on administrative regulations that would take a similar approach but the agency says they may not be ready until late next year nobuo tanaka executive director of the paris based international energy agency said that during this weeks meeting in washington he will outline "feasible" steps that all countries can take to quickly reduce emissions they include phasing out the incandescent light bulb and requiring computers television sets and other appliances to use less power while they are turned off annual electricity reductions from the two steps he estimates could equal the output of average size power plants meanwhile an unusual coalition including major utilities labor unions and some environmental groups are backing a proposal on capitol hill to punish u s trading partners that dont take greenhouse gas reduction actions it would be part of a u s cap and trade system that proposes to cap carbon dioxide emissions and then gives u s companies allowances to emit based on a declining scale over time the allowances could be traded the proposal would require countries that dont act to reduce emissions by to compensate for the energy in certain goods exported to the u s by buying "international reserve allowances" from the u s the allowances would be imposed on imports of iron steel aluminum cement glass paper and other goods that require a lot of energy to make michael morris chairman of american electric power co the huge columbus ohio utility said his company came up with the plan to keep u s companies and workers competitive on an "uneven playing field " he argues that the imposition of the penalty wouldnt amount to a trade tariff because it would simply equalize economic conditions if and when u s products made under carbon restraints would be competing with unrestrained products the proposal which assumes the u s would begin restricting its emissions by has been endorsed by the international brotherhood of electrical workers the afl cio and several other labor unions "we think this will strengthen the next presidents hand in both multilateral and bilateral agreements" on climate said david doniger of the natural resources defense council a new york based environmental group the proposal is included in bills sponsored by sen jeff bingaman the new mexico democrat and sen joseph lieberman the connecticut independent who caucuses as a democrat and its being considered by democratic leaders in the house where formal bills have yet to be outlined the bills have bipartisan support though it is hard to predict whether they would be able to muster the votes needed to beat a senate filibuster the proposal would allow the president to impose the sanction on imported products starting eight years after u s regulations begin if all diplomatic efforts to encourage greenhouse gas reductions by the countries that made them have failed the bush administration which has taken no position on the provision expects this weeks major emitters talks to be the first of five or six meetings to develop a new process that can be agreed upon by the end of next year james connaughton chairman of the white house council on environmental quality said one goal will be to develop a uniform system for measuring each nations output of greenhouse gases new systems of measurement which count carbon dioxide from the destruction of forests and other land use policies along with emissions from burning fossil fuels show china indonesia brazil and malaysia among the globes top emitters
