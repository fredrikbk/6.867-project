flu shot supply to hit record health officials aim to boost low rate of immunizations health officials anticipating a record vaccine supply for this years flu season are trying hard to make up for past missteps and boost low immunization rates by urging people to get flu shots even if they wait until after the holidays "we must use december january and beyond to protect more americans against influenza " said jeanne santoli deputy director of immunization services at the centers for disease control and prevention she spoke recently on a panel of health experts hosted by the national foundation for infectious diseases during the season the most recent period for which complete data are available from the cdc flu vaccination levels among high risk groups fell far short of the federal governments goals one in five babies and young toddlers was fully vaccinated meaning receiving the necessary two doses when getting the shot for the first time no state fully vaccinated more than of its children rates were better among the elderly with of those age and older getting a shot but that is a far cry from the goal of "were still failing to protect a large proportion of people " cdc director julie gerberding said last week that is worrisome because influenza causes about deaths mostly of elderly people and more than hospitalizations in the u s each year on average between and of the population annually gets the flu a respiratory illness caused by a virus that produces symptoms including high fever headache extreme fatigue runny nose and muscle aches the flu season generally is considered to begin oct one likely reason for the lagging immunization rates is a series of vaccine shortages in recent years that made it hard for some patients to get shots leaving them frustrated and discouraged in the fall of a severe early season flu outbreak caused demand to skyrocket straining supplies the next year during the season a shortage ensued when one of just two vaccine makers at the time had safety problems at a plant and had to destroy much of its production during the past two years early supply was sometimes spotty forcing some doctors to turn away patients in october and november by the time more doses arrived many patients had given up this year supply isnt expected to be a problem dr gerberding said four licensed manufacturers anticipate shipping as many as million doses about million more than last year "were in the best position weve been in years " said steve pellito national director of maxim health systems which holds flu shot clinics for those age and up at corporate offices grocery stores and other retail outlets clinics are set to begin saturday he said in another boost the food and drug administration recently widened eligibility for flumist the only flu vaccine that isnt administered by a shot flumist previously approved for children and older now can be given to children as young as the nasal vaccine is made by medimmune a unit of astrazeneca plc the other vaccine makers are a sanofi aventis unit glaxosmithkline plc and novartis ag mark mlotek executive vice president for business development at henry schein inc a distributor of health care products to office based doctors said his firm has products from all three makers of injectable vaccine "in stock and ready to ship " barring unforeseen glitches he said the supply chain looks solid flu cases usually begin appearing in late fall since it takes about two weeks for immunization to become fully effective officials urge patients to get shots as soon as vaccine is available typically in october and november because flu cases usually peak in february and sometimes as late as april or may officials emphasize that the shots can provide protection even if given during the winter effectiveness of the shot depends on how closely matched the virus strains used in the vaccine are with the viruses circulating in a given season health experts relying on research from the prior year recommend the vaccine composition based on their best estimate of types of flu virus that will be prevalent when the vaccine is well matched it can reduce the chance of getting the flu by to in healthy adults and can prevent at least of flu infections in young children according to the cdc in years when the vaccine isnt well matched it can still provide some protection with the supply outlook strong the cdcs immunization advisory panel urges a shot this year for those people "including school aged children " who want to lower their risk of getting the flu or giving it to someone else vaccination is important for groups at higher risk for complications including children age six months to years adults older than age patients with chronic illnesses and pregnant women shots also are recommended for close contacts of higher risk groups even as the cdc urges better vaccination of the elderly some researchers said more study is needed to determine whether the role flu shots play in preventing deaths among seniors could be exaggerated since few controlled trials have been conducted involving elderly patients especially those older than in a report published in the lancet infectious diseases scientists with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases urge development of better vaccines as well as other steps such as immunizing more people in all age groups to provide indirect protection of frail elderly people the authors emphasize the elderly should continue to get a seasonal flu shot in the meantime as "even a partly effective vaccine" is better than no vaccine at all
