smaller oil companies fuel britains north sea revival as large producers decrease presence over higher taxes opportunity knocks for others london tax changes and investment incentives are transforming the landscape of britains north sea reinvigorating europes second largest oil basin after norway and raising hopes that its long decline may slow the revival has taken many in the industry by surprise because when the government in announced it would raise taxes on oil production big international companies warned the move would discourage investments two years later the biggest oil companies are reducing their presence but a clutch of smaller companies have moved in to fill the void the shift in ownership suggests the government may be able to capture more revenue from high oil prices while limiting risks to its energy security needs this year royal dutch shell plc chevron corp and exxon mobil corp started to offload a sizable number of their north sea fields much as bp plc and conocophillips did last year as they reduced their exposure small independent companies such as fairfield energy ltd oilexco inc venture production plc and perenco sa seized what they saw as a good opportunity these smaller companies have leaner cost structures that make them better suited to the mature high tax basin energy analysts say the north sea is to the united kingdom what the gulf of mexico is to the u s a province that pipes oil and gas straight into one of the worlds largest economies reducing its dependence on tight international energy markets the future of the basin which in produced million barrels of oil equivalent a day is crucial to global energy supply but ever since a peak in production has been in decline falling in as fields slowly deplete large companies have warned higher taxes could accelerate that trend and are speeding up asset divestments programs in august chevron said it was selling its interests in the mariner and bressay fields to norways norsk hydro asa for a sum not disclosed pending regulatory approval in june shell and exxon mobil unit esso put a string of north sea assets up for sale and entered exclusive negotiations to offload their dunlin fields to fairfield energy of the u k the major oil producers arent abandoning the north sea altogether the assets shell put up for sale in june represent just of its north sea production but shell has said it will reduce its u k north sea investment in the coming years like other companies it has moved to new areas such as norway qatar west africa or russia to find better value oil companies raised a clamor last year when the british government raised tax on oil production profits by percentage points bringing the tax rate to the labor government also said it wouldnt rule out further tax increases if it wins the next elections due no later than the tax increase worsened what is already "a very high cost environment " says tom botts shells head of exploration and production for europe smaller companies though see the majors pain as an opportunity u k midsize company venture production which bought a smaller peer for million euros &# million last year has said it is looking into buying the shell and esso assets the u k fiscal system is "the best deal in the world " says arthur millholland chief executive of oilexco a canadian company that is moving aggressively into the north sea he pointed out that the u k rewards companies investing in drilling wells with a tax deduction on such investment compared with to in the u s this incentive introduced in has been gradually expanded the tax deduction was deferred from to and new investment can be used to offset part of the tax for as many as six years meanwhile a measure put into place in the so called fallow initiative is also helping the measure forces companies to divest themselves of undeveloped acreage and has been one of the factors pushing the major oil companies to monetize some of their licenses the consultancy hannon westwood notes the newcomers are now playing a big role in investment according to hannon westwood recent entrants none of which are major producers accounted for more than of all drilling in search of oil or natural gas in a proportion it expects will rise this year the consultancy said drilling in and reached its highest level since with wells oilexco drilled about a quarter of the wells in all of the u k north sea during more than bp shell total sa chevron and conocophillips put together according to figures from wood mackenzie an energy consulting company oilexco has expanded by acquiring stakes in north sea fields that were left undeveloped by chevron italys eni spa or conocophillips the smaller companies benefit from their leaner cost structure in particular says oilexcos mr millholland they employ fewer staff "we are as professional as big oil " he says "what we do not have is corporate bureaucracy " a spokeswoman for oil and gas u k a british oil industry association disagrees that smaller companies can take better advantage of u k tax rules than bigger ones "a number of factors such as rising costs fiscal uncertainty and lower production levels is having an impact on u k north sea competitiveness and these will affect the business decisions taken by companies no matter their size " she says hannon westwood says the ownership change will have a positive impact on oil production as acreage where no exploration is taking place is being acquired by more active players it points out that exploration drilling in and discovered an estimated billion barrels of oil equivalent mr millholland says he agrees with the u k governments view that the incentives will help slow the rate of decline of north sea production
