business technology try software on workers first fix it later no pain no gain strategy angers a universitys staffers but it department loves it when jay reinkes july paycheck wasnt automatically deposited into his bank account the year old painter at arizona state university went to the schools human resources office a paper check was waiting for him for &# mr reinke is one of roughly arizona state employees who have been underpaid or unpaid since the school started using new software from oracle corp to manage its payroll others have received paychecks thousands of dollars too high the payroll problem has caused so much unrest that armed police guarded the universitys hr office on several recent paydays "when you live paycheck to paycheck " mr reinke notes "it is tough to survive " the frustration that comes with switching computer software is a perennial water cooler complaint especially when like arizona state it involves integrating disparate programs into one system to manage everything from admissions and class registration to finance and hr so called enterprise resource planning or erp software is notoriously costly and difficult to implement hershey co and nike inc blamed faulty software for multimillion dollar write offs in and and hewlett packard co estimates that it lost &# million when it couldnt respond to an order backlog caused by its new inventory system in "no one wanted to use the word erp for a while it was taboo " says lee geishecker a vice president at amr research but in a way the confusion at arizona state was all part of the plan the tempe ariz school has installed its new software using an unconventional if painful approach admit from the start that there will be mistakes then work through the glitches with users help most companies take their time and dont start using a new computer system until they are convinced almost everything works right then they are caught off guard when mistakes inevitably happen often the delays allow them to expand the projects scope which adds cost and can further compound problems the information technology department at arizona state decided it would be more effective to stick to rigid deadlines releasing the software on schedule even if all the kinks hadnt been worked out and try to fix problems on the fly admitting there will be flaws from the beginning is "like having your wisdom teeth out " says adrian sannier the universitys technology officer "you can have them out one at a time and have it hurt four times or you have them done once " the models for arizona states project are internet companies like google inc these companies label the software they release "beta " meaning that it is good enough to use but it isnt finished sometimes they keep it that way for years using feedback from customers to create ever more refined versions academic tech leaders familiar with the project have mixed opinions the chief information officer at the state university of new york at buffalo elias eldayrie says he is seriously considering following the arizona state model albeit without the payroll glitches "erp implementations are difficult projects " he says "considering the cost of these projects its important to look at it " but lev gonick cio of case western reserve university says that missing multiple payrolls is a cardinal sin of tech projects and that calling it a "beta release with some finishing touches to be completed because we reinvented erp implementation is spin " while unpaid employees may have been less than thrilled school administrators and consultants and software companies involved in the project rave about arizona states strategy oracle hailed it as a model for both universities and corporations to follow in a report it published in april in a statement jim mcglothlin an oracle vice president called the project "highly successful " gary somers who worked on the project for cedarcrestone inc the consulting company that helped implement the system calls arizona states method "the wave of the future " the final price tag for arizona states project is &# million to deploy the software and another &# million to support it over the next five years which includes &# million that the schools board of regents approved at the end of august the total is well below the &# million the board expected to spend charlie moran a chicago based software consultant who advises the board of regents says the cost savings are unheard of and deems the project a phenomenal success arizona state one of the two largest universities in the country planned to avoid delays and cost overruns by doing things fast squeezing into months a project that has taken similar sized institutions upward of four years to maintain the breakneck pace arizona states mr sannier elected to spend money on extra programmers and consultants rather than risk missing a deadline there would be moments of pain as people started using a system that wasnt a finished product but managing the pain was part of the plan mr sannier calls this strategy "implement adapt grow " since it not only relies on the it department to fix any technical glitches but requires employees to help identify problems as well as to adjust to working within the new system he acknowledges some mistakes but insists that hindsight will show that they are just a small piece of a more successful whole "you cant repave the road and have no one know that you did it " he says arizona state started using the new payroll system in july at the beginning of its fiscal year there were problems right away employees werent getting paid in some cases this was because they didnt know to use a computerized punch clock that was part of the new system in particular this was a problem for employees who dont have their own computers like the schools maintenance and janitorial staffs mr reinke the painter says he had to wait in a line people deep each morning to use the one computer in his department but more often it was a natural byproduct of converting employee records from one system to another an inconsequential error in the old system could lead to a meaningful error in the new one mr sannier who didnt miss a paycheck accepted the risk that there might be payroll problems as part of the projects pace and approach and the university developed a plan to deal with these problems in this regard the technology systems worked as expected the breakdown occurred with what mr sannier calls the "human systems " to compensate for any technical problems the human resources department was supposed to write checks on the spot to any employee with an inaccurate paycheck no questions asked but check writers couldnt keep pace with the underpaid employees who flooded the hr offices mr reinke says instead of writing him a check to replace his blank paycheck he was told that a change would be made in the system he received his check a week later in the meantime he had to extend his overdraft protection in order to pay his &# a month mortgage hundreds of other employees had to wait as many as days to have their paychecks fixed a spokesman for the arizona state credit union says that people took out short term loans the new strategys pain is undeniable "morale is the lowest its been in the years ive worked here " says allan crouch who works in the universitys human resources department after the problems with the checks two hr employees were placed on administrative leave michael crow the universitys president sent letters of apology to affected employees offered to pay any expenses they incurred and gave them &# gift cards mr reinke calls the gift cards "kind of a slap in the face " yet the it department has been able to fix of known payroll problems within four days which mr sannier says "feels about right " the most recent payroll had a error rate which is bellow the error rate the old system traditionally had while the payroll problems have lessened employees say the campus is still in a state of confusion mr reinke for example recently received a paycheck that was too high "everyone knows therell be problems when you institute new computer systems " says toni genalo who directs data collection for the psychology department "we were prepared for that just not at this level " see
