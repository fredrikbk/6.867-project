the game for facebook geocities offers a cautionary tale can rise and fall of once hot site sway decisions on funding ipo facebook founder mark zuckerberg was years old when david bohnett then a year old mainframe programmer hatched an idea set up a web based "community" where young people could divulge their most intimate feelings he grouped those musings into different themes and ushered in advertisers to hawk volvos and volkswagens this ur facebook of was called geocities and both its rise and fall are a history lesson for mr zuckerberg as his social networking site the th most visited on the planet approaches its own crossroads should it sell launch an initial public offering or take another investment round geocities tale shows just how necessary continual innovation and the capital to support it are for a web media business its a lesson in the perils of being acquired and yet it shows the value of humility even in moments of the sweetest triumph just how many of the top visited web sites of august are still in that ranking nine geocities grew popular before broadband meaning that it would appear terribly crude to modern eyes there was no video it took hours to upload a photograph back then entries were known as home pages not profiles but the basic expressive elements of todays facebook and competitor myspace owned by news corp were all right there "its the same as it is today people want to feel like theyre connected " says mr bohnett now a year old venture capitalist over the phone from southampton n y "give them a set of tools and theyll do it " "i knew right from the beginning that this was going to be big " he says "i got an email every time someone would register there were a second at one point " by august geocities was the third most visited site on the web a distinction that propelled it to a successful ipo it was valued at about &# billion at the time sixteen months later yahoo paid an astounding &# billion calling the new yahoo geocities combo "one powerful offering " the site had yet to turn a profit mr bohnett and other top executives had scored big and their creation would soon whither before their eyes life inside yahoo was smothering for geocities say a number of people familiar with the transition developing new technologies for geocities communities slowed to a crawl as its staff of software developers was cut to a skeleton crew yahoo focused instead of building traffic not necessarily on the programming for improving person to person interaction "had they done things right with geocities there would be no facebook youtube or myspace " says one yahoo didnt immediately respond to a request for comment today geocities is still featured on yahoos site tucked obscurely into the lower left hand corner geocities home page is a bland advertisement for web hosting services many of its user pages are "ghost pages " sites abandoned as if during a volcano eruption yahoos treatment of geocities is particularly relevant for mr zuckerberg who reportedly rebuffed a &# billion buyout from former yahoo ceo terry semel that turned out to be the right move given that many in silicon valley peg facebooks value at upward of &# billion besides mr zuckerberg isnt gunning for just wealth hes gunning for wealth and legacy mr bohnett steered clear of commenting on yahoos stewardship of geocities but if he could give advice to mr zuckerberg hed recommend heavy investment in new technology to "stay true to what the user experience is " and he stressed the importance of keeping a young audience "those kids tend to get older and maintain some connection with an online community youve got to capture that early adopter young audience " mr zuckerberg is in an especially good place right now his site has developed a patina of invincibility which in enabled him to wrangle an especially good advertising deal with microsoft ever the net laggard microsoft is now guaranteeing about &# million in revenue this year which could become as much as &# million by if traffic grows rapidly alas advertisers have found facebook users to be a huge audience that could care less about ads the percentage of users clicking onto site advertisements on facebook and myspace are lower than typical web sites that means its essentially sucking up a subsidy from microsoft which wants to get its hooks into facebook the best it can "its not that easy to monetize social media " says eric hippeau a managing partner of softbank capital that made more than times its investment in geocities he also sits on yahoos board "once microsofts deal with facebook expires as does googles deal with myspace theyre going to have to sell advertising for themselves and its going to be a challenge " so far he says "its not that easy to match the right advertising with the right audience " that squares with the experience of thomas r evans geocities former chief executive "when youre as successful as geocities everyone tells you how wonderful you are it causes you to miss opportunities " now the ceo of web site bankrate com he added that "people at the time were dismissive of old media experience but it turned out looking exactly like the old media business you have to execute and provide both the consumer and the advertiser with significant value " at some point the questions about facebook the business will eclipse the praise of facebook the social phenomenon and once that point hits mr zuckerberg will be less able to dictate the terms of how fresh capital is put to use if mr zuckerbergs primary goal is creative freedom a freedom to build something special the history of geocities suggests that he should take a big investment now even a highly dilutive one preferably this would be a private infusion allowing him to experiment outside the glare of the stock market and maintaining independence with it he could lock in a big valuation build out infrastructure and make some quality hires and acquisitions as necessary myspace owner rupert murdoch had it right when he summed up the state of year old dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal which he is now buying "the first road to freedom " he said of dow jones "is viability " email dennis berman wsj com for a free blog covering up to the minute deals news visit blogs wsj com deals
