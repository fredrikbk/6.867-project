demon rummy a premier u s university invites a controversial international figure to speak on campus the faculty is outraged "speaking truth to power " the professors denounce the legitimacy conferred on a murderous tyrant that is what largely did not happen yesterday after columbia welcomed iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad to morningside heights that is however what is now happening at stanford and the man the faculty views as a tyrant is donald rumsfeld while columbia president lee bollinger opines about "the powers of dialogue and reason " the stanford faculty has mobilized against the appointment of the former defense secretary to a fellowship at the hoover institution a conservative research center affiliated with the palo alto university mr rumsfeld will join a study group exploring terror and ideology in the post world mr rumsfelds experience in these matters cant be denied and though his politics may differ from the professoriates this would seem to make his "perspective" more valuable to a university dedicated to the exchange of ideas especially one as its motto has it where "the wind of freedom blows " something else altogether is blowing now a group of self described faculty "instigators" calls mr rumsfeld "fundamentally incompatible with the ethical values of truthfulness tolerance and disinterested enquiry " their petition has garnered more than professor student and alumni signatures english professor robert polhemus drafted an unofficial platform for the faculty opposition that calls the hoover appointment "contemptible" and argues that mr rumsfeld lacks "intellectual and academic experience and or some measure of achievement " the psychologist philip zimbardo tolerantly noted "they can have any fascist they want there at hoover and they do " so in the interests of "robust debate " a school is obliged to provide a public forum to the leader of a repressive terrorist regime but the mere presence of an american with more than three decades of public service most recently dedicated to combating such regimes is beyond the pale stanfords only saving grace so far is that its administration isnt bending to this faculty intimidation all ideas are not created equal and the beliefs of messrs rumsfeld and ahmadinejad are certainly not rather these two case studies into the academic mindset contrast priorities they confirm if more confirmation were needed that the modern academys commitment to "intellectual freedom" too often fails to distinguish between those who defend freedom and those who would squash it see related letters "letters to the editor public discourse lacking in reason and civility" wsj oct
