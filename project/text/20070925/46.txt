enterprise art seller helps hotels put on the ritz mags prints add culture to rooms guests buy copies in the winter of two globetrotters met on a flight from new york to los angeles and started chatting about their travels one of the fliers a fine art dealer wondered why the art selection at many top notch hotels was so poor "the poster art on the walls degraded the entire experience of staying in a five star hotel " says the art dealer vincent vallarino the other traveler a hotel management veteran agreed and the seeds of a small business were planted the following year they set up shop as metropolitan art group llc and approached upscale hotels with an original pitch metropolitan or mag as it calls itself supplies the hotels with fine art prints to gussy up their rooms and common areas the hotels can then sell copies of the prints to guests who want a memento of their stay so far mag has teamed up with hotels such as the plaza in new york and the savoy in london providing them with a range of artwork from household names like monet to hot contemporary artists like peter brown and guy a wiggins guests can get their hands on prints for &# to &# mag says the arrangement offers the hotels two main benefits for one the hotels get a cut of the print sales then theres prestige each print comes with a museum style plaque identifying the piece as part of the hotels signature art collection which makes travelers associate the hotel with the high toned artwork pam carter director of public relations at the savoy says the hotel liked mags pitch because it presented the hotel "with a steady revenue stream while enabling us to bridge our cultural past to our present " claude monet spent the winters of to as an artist in residence at the savoy where he began work on more than canvases a dallas couple leon and susan holman gush over the &# print they purchased at the savoy in january "our copy of houses of parliament reminded us of the view at dusk from our room at the savoy during our th wedding anniversary " says mrs holman "its the most meaningful work of art weve ever owned " of course hotel merchandising isnt entirely new many hotels have long sold branded items such as bathrobes and in the late s the practice kicked into high gear with hotels offering whole catalogs of tony goodies everything from simple knickknacks to designer beds some estimates peg the hotel merchandising market at &# million and see it topping &# million within the next few years mag a closely held firm wont disclose its revenue but sidney w davidson iii chief executive officer and managing partner of mag says that year over year sales growth was in and is expected to reach to for for an idea of the companys take consider this during a four month trial in the plaza hotel sold limited edition prints from mag generating &# for mag and &# for the hotel according to a company memo the hotels usually pocket to of the revenue for print sales the artists get if its a classic piece like a monet then mag and the hotel divide the revenue part of mags success has been its mix of talents its officials boast a wide variety of backgrounds including art dealers and former investment bankers mr vallarino for one has been active as a dealer and gallery owner for over years that combination of backgrounds helps mag significantly when it comes to marketing most small businesses have to hustle to make a name for themselves among customers but mags members have deep contacts in the hotel and art worlds which helps them get in the door and land deals moreover say some enterprise experts the company has positioned itself well to piggyback on the cachet of the posh hotels "travelers choosing to stay at high end hotels often prefer to associate themselves with a very specific brand much like wearing designer clothing " says chekitan s dev associate professor of marketing and brand management at cornell universitys school of hotel administration in ithaca n y and that can translate into big sales for companies like mag that supply the hotels with branded goods when mag teams up with a hotel it studies the look and feel of the property and recommends artists who complement the decor and setting mag reviews the artists and their work with the hotel management and they jointly select a best fit the two also work together to figure out where to place the artwork in the hotel the pieces are then marketed to guests in a variety of ways from wall plaques to catalogs in the guest rooms and gift shop not all of mags projects have been successful in its latest venture a trial partnership with the waldorf astoria in new york mag has seen slow sales mr davidson says a number of factors are at work for one thing the waldorf astoria project represents mags first entirely commissioned line of artwork so the pieces dont have the same built in recognition among guests in addition mag is still trying to get the hotel to put the artwork in higher traffic areas such as the main lobby for now the prints are mostly showcased in an arcade that connects the park avenue entrance with the garage an area thats home to a high end flower shop james w blauvelt executive director of catering and special events at the waldorf astoria believes print sales will pick up with the fall ball and winter holiday season "mag offered an original product for us to attach our brand to that was both interesting and authentic " mr blauvelt says "not having engaged in a project like this before we are eager to see how things develop from a guest interest standpoint " currently mag is considering expanding its concept into a new venue cruise liners guest artists may offer classes on board while they produce artwork that might be displayed on future excursions
