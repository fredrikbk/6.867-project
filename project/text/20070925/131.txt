world bank nears rate reduction move is part of compromise navigated by zoellick to assist poorest nations washington for the first time in nearly a decade the world bank is poised to make significant cuts in the interest rates it charges china brazil mexico and other big developing countries as part of a deal to boost aid for the worlds poorest nations according to bank officials as part of the compromise the world bank will contribute as much as &# billion to the international development association a world bank unit that provides grants and no interest loans to the worlds poorest nations the deal has been negotiated over the past few months and shows the difficulty in bridging longstanding fissures in the world bank among impoverished countries rich countries and those in the middle such as china and brazil all of which are the banks shareholders the compromise was pushed hard by the world banks new president robert zoellick who has emerged as a pragmatic horse trader unsympathetic to conservative critics who say the bank should cut off lending to countries that can borrow easily on private markets "he believes in linking up poor countries rich countries and middle income countries as way of producing a more inclusive form of globalization " said a senior world bank official bank officials wouldnt be identified speaking on the subject because the compromise is still being refined and must be approved by the banks board which is expected to meet again on the issue later this week the bank is pushing for a final deal in time for its annual meeting here oct the world bank largely finances itself by borrowing on world markets at very favorable rates because it is backed by the worlds governments and then lending that money at a higher rate to developing countries but the ida unit is traditionally funded by contributions from governments since it goes to countries too poor to pay money back with interest every three years the world bank raises new funds for ida the &# billion world bank contribution to ida is meant to encourage rich countries to boost their commitments too it is now looking for donors to commit between &# billion and &# billion for the three years ending june compared with about &# billion for the three preceding years to cover a big increase in debt relief and pay for development projects following the asian financial crisis the world bank increased the interest rates on loans to middle income countries such as china mexico and brazil by about percentage point even though the global economy recovered it hasnt reduced the rate aside from occasional waivers currently middle income countries pay rates of about percentage point above the london interbank offered rate or libor at which banks lend to each other for years middle income countries complained that the rates should be lowered but they were stymied in the banks governing executive board by wealthy nations such as the u s which didnt want the world bank competing with private markets the worlds poorest nations also opposed a rate reduction fearing that it would give a leg up on their somewhat wealthier competitors but now a breakthrough is in the works with mr zoellick revamping proposals by france the u s and other wealthy nations according to bank officials in exchange for lowering interest rates to pre asian crisis levels mr zoellick pressed brazil mexico china and other middle income countries to support a substantial contribution to ida by the international finance corp a world bank arm that lends to private companies rather than governments middle income countries have long opposed such ifc contributions because they wanted the ifc to continue to focus on companies in their countries last year for the first time the ifc contributed &# million to ida earmarked for private sector development in poor nations as part of the compromise the ifc is increasing its contribution to as much as &# billion over four years world bank officials said officials at the ifc also opposed the deal for months arguing the plan would distort the agencys mission to lend to the private sector but the ifc relented after conversations with mr zoellick who was backed by many of the world banks wealthiest nations middle income countries whose construction companies airlines and utilities and other firms depend on ifc lending dropped their opposition to using ifc money in exchange for the rate cut on loans bank officials said the world bank unit that makes loans to governments in middle income countries the international bank for reconstruction and development is also expected to earmark as much as &# billion to ida that unit has long contributed to ida the compromise still has its critics some smaller european countries and poor countries worry that the u s and other large lenders will use the ifc contributions to ida as an excuse to cut their own commitments to the poor a former u s trade negotiator mr zoellick looked for a deal that would tie together the banks various constituencies and personally lobbied the boards directors mr zoellick who worked for about two years at goldman sachs before taking the world bank job has dismissed concern that lower interest rates would put the world bank in more direct competition with the private sector "in my time at goldman sachs i never heard once of the world bank as competitor " he has told world bank officials
