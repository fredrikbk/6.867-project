the middle seat airlines try to appease fliers on delays as "passengers rights" legislation wends its way through congress airlines are taking pre emptive steps to alleviate travel hassles and even making plans to pay passengers when their airline messes up united airlines recently began promising to compensate passengers with travel vouchers if they are stuck onboard a grounded flight for more than four hours jetblue airways does the same starting after three hours most other carriers however make no such promises airlines developed contingency plans and policies for severe aircraft waits after ugly incidents earlier this year when passengers were trapped for eight hours or more on several poorly handled flights the department of transportations inspector general is expected to report later this week on those contingency plans and they are at the core of compromise passengers rights legislation now moving through congress the passengers bill of rights effort took root in winter travel debacles and was well fertilized by this summers travel woes the state of new york went so far as to pass its own requirements for airlines at new york airports mandating food water fresh air power and working restrooms on any flight that has left the gate and sits on the tarmac for more than three hours the law takes effect in january the air transport association the airlines lobbying group says it will challenge the mandate because federal law exempts airlines from state regulation at the federal level the house of representatives has approved some compromise consumer safeguards but it still faces votes in the senate and further compromise to iron out differences hearings will be held this week on delays and customer service and the department of transportation has summoned airline officials to a meeting to address improvements for next summer the house voted to require that the secretary of transportation set some minimum standards and review airline contingency plans for how long airlines will let planes sit when they will deplane passengers who want off and what kind of food water and bathroom servicing stranded flights will get planes with fewer than seats and there are lots of them are excluded meanwhile airlines have been hammering out their own contingency plans amr corp s american airlines promises not to keep passengers involuntarily on a flight if it hasnt gotten off the ground within four hours compensation is made "case by case " american says but ual corp s united decided to go a step further earlier this month by including compensation in its plan as jetblue does in addition to its four hour departure standard united says it will offer vouchers for discounted tickets if a plane lands and doesnt get to a gate within minutes northwest airlines corp says it initiates a return to a gate after a plane sits for three hours without taking off and while the three hour limit is firm captains do have discretion a spokesman says many airlines including continental airlines inc delta air lines inc and us airways group inc say they dont have absolute limits most have added tools to better track long delayed flights delta even alerts senior managers to flights delayed on the ground more than an hour continental says it has stashed extra provisions at airports that are likely to receive flights diverted from its hub airports and says it has had some success using vehicles to get people off grounded flights who want off while others want to keep waiting delta says it will work to provide a gate if passengers want off southwest airlines co says its "goal" is to not have planes sitting more than four hours us airways says its plan is all on a "case by case" basis with no promises laid out for customers american instituted its four hour mark after one of its flights was stuck for more than eight hours in austin texas and flight cancellations are up "we prefer to give them a chance to take off because cancellation is not a good option either " said bob reding americans executive vice president of operations "you go from bad to poor but we understand that being stuck for four hours becomes really difficult " while instances of multihour waits are rare they have been happening more frequently this year through july there have been flights with "taxi out" times of more than three hours in all of last year there were according to the bureau of transportation statistics and those numbers dont count flights that sit after being diverted to other airports or sit waiting to get to a gate after landing the proposed federal legislation has some other consumer benefits such as more funds for the dot to investigate consumer complaints and it calls on the faa to be more aggressive in forcing airlines to stop scheduling more flights than an airports good weather capacity can handle the faa has already done that twice at chicagos ohare international airport and the bill makes a major statement by requiring airports to have contingency plans as well some like san antonio texas already have plans to deliver food to stuck aircraft and commandeer city buses to move passengers to terminals if needed one major gap in all this however is that there is no effort to hold the faa accountable along with airlines and airports and the faa can be a major culprit in these situations long waits do often result from poor airline decisions but many times the faa is culpable this summer we saw planes stranded for hours because of an faa computer failure sometimes a lack of coordination or communication leaves one flight sitting while others that havent waited as long get to move sometimes the faa gives an airline a "wheels up" takeoff time and the flight boards and gets in line with other flights then controllers change the time and change it again the faa could do more to prioritize troubled flights it could use airport space more wisely spreading planes out when they are waiting it could establish procedures for trucks and buses to service aircraft that are waiting it could let planes go back to gates without losing their place in the priority queue and make sure duty time rules dont unnecessarily penalize pilots for going back to a gate to let off passengers the latest "bill of rights" crusade was launched by kate hanni a passenger on the american flight stuck for eight hours in austin in december she was so outraged she became an activist and her hope was to force airlines to return planes to gates after only three hours of waiting but she says shes pleased with the compromise legislation three hours is a heavy burden for airlines and travelers most people on a flight still want to get where they are headed and the flight they are on may be their best bet for a couple of days since planes are so full these days whats needed is flexibility and choices get the people off who want off without ruining schedules for everyone a three hour limit could lead to a lot more cancellations higher costs for airlines and even less reliability in air travel still even some former airline executives think passengers are entitled to more rights while he doesnt believe in federal regulations telling airlines how to deal with customers former american chief executive robert crandall thinks passengers ought to have more legal options "i do think there needs to be some legal approbation for keeping passengers on an airplane for five hours " mr crandall said at a travel conference this summer "that is just not acceptable "
