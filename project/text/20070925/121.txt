traditional style and substance princetons new whitman hall princeton n j when princeton universitys th anniversary rolled around in the trustees decided to adopt the collegiate gothic of oxford and cambridge as the architectural style for the expanding campus it was a timely idea with its picturesque asymmetries crenellated towers elaborate oriels and eye catching grotesques collegiate gothic makes steep demands on the designer but the nations flourishing architectural profession was ready the influence of such titans as richard morris hunt h h richardson and charles follen mckim was widely reflected in a deeper understanding of mass and proportion as well as a surer grasp of decorative detail for most princeton alumni and students collegiate gothic defines the university like no other architectural idiom it is exemplified by the spectacular blair arch and its grand stairway designed by walter cope and john stewardson to make the most of a steep change of grade on the sloping campus princetons gothic buildings offer masterly inventive interpretations of the style by a number of different architects and other institutions adopted the style in due course hence for example dukes magnificent chapel the work of horace trumbauer and james gamble rogerss gorgeous harkness memorial tower at yale collegiate gothic endured at princeton for half a century then came a profusion of modernist buildings as stylistically divergent as i m peis spelman hall whose eight residential structures are triangular in plan and built of prefabricated concrete and robert venturis quirky more contextual brick clad gordon wu hall but the new millennium has brought a startling development whitman college the just completed square foot residential complex for princeton undergraduates is not only gothic in style but traditional very expensively traditional in its load bearing masonry construction the architect is london based classicist demetri porphyrios a prominent member of prince charless artistic circle mr porphyrios will lecture on the project at princeton tomorrow the colleges formal dedication takes place thursday the quality of whitmans fieldstone and limestone masonry is stunning and its thick walls mark a radical departure from current construction norms on this account and because of the astute site planning and massing of its buildings the college is a powerful reminder that new traditional architecture on a level with princetons premodernist gothic remains perfectly feasible the rank inadequacy of whitmans decorative detail thus comes as a big disappointment ebay inc president and ceo meg whitman a princeton alumna and her family donated &# million for the college whose site was previously occupied by a steep foot embankment and rows of tennis courts mr porphyrios has transformed this into a gentle irregularly sloping landscape populated by an architectural ensemble that echoes in the imagination as a medieval town facing wilderness on one side and civilization on the other to the west the college is girded by a thickly tree planted ravine conceived as a moat with a bridge leading from a campus lane into the larger of two courtyards to the east the college opens onto a grassy park and the campus beyond the variety and intricacy in the massing and scale of whitmans buildings eliminates any sense of a plop down design eight of the are slate roofed and built with bluestone which despite its name varies considerably in tint the hand cut bluestone is laid as a highly intricate variety of random ashlar masonry with no readily perceptible pattern allowed to emerge this required enormous skill of the nearly stonemasons who worked on the project less than a third of the applicants were hired mr porphyrios employed limestone laid in more formal ashlar patterns on community hall which includes a high ceilinged main dining hall with a cafe and two private dining rooms as well as the adjoining cloister arcade and a gatehouse building adjacent to the bridge across the ravine the gatehouse accommodates classrooms and students rooms and like the other two limestone structures girds the larger southern courtyard here mr porphyrios has rather clumsily framed a sightline keyed on the community hall entrance by means of three parallel gatehouse arches each of them off center in relation to one another and of different dimensions the sightline is only slightly skewed so the arches read as a forlorn attempt to milk a minor incident for picturesque effect how different are the majestic views of the foot tall main towers sheer bluestone mass rising out of the ravine from the northeast more open planting allows an ample view of the college agreeably nestled in its landscape a view marred only by landscape architect michael van valkenburghs placement of a big swamp red maple smack in front of community hall a crenellated turret at one corner of the main tower by the way is used for ventilation as are the chimneys prominently situated elsewhere over the past decade a number of american colleges and universities have erected traditional buildings usually in emulation of their historic architectural patrimony the virtual monopoly on new campus architecture that modernism once enjoyed is over but it would be hard to find another postwar academic project on whitmans scale involving traditional load bearing masonry construction modern construction typically relies on steel or steel reinforced concrete frames with a thin exterior cladding while skillful traditional architects can work effectively with frame construction it too often conveys a sense of cheapness and insubstantiality and collegiate gothic must look and feel massive this is exactly what whitmans walls generally about a foot and a half thick do they consist of an interior load bearing envelope of concrete block separated from the exterior self supporting stone envelope by a narrow insulation space whitmans walls will last for centuries an unlikely result with frame construction but the college came in at a very steep &# million a senior university official mark burstein estimates that traditional construction increased the project cost by hardly surprising considering the university commissioned some wall mock ups to gauge masonry patterns coloration and textures as well as mortar types given the exquisite results and the otherwise wholly traditional character of mr porphyrioss whitman buildings the inadequate decoration is particularly regrettable especially as its proper handling would have been a marginal expense combining gothic lancets and classical bulls eye windows community hall resembles an early renaissance guild hall erected circa whose members ran out of dough before they could give the building an appropriate finish the cloister arcade looks positively threadbare the grand scale of the southern courtyard these two structures face should be modulated by figurative detail that catches the eye from a distance but here as elsewhere such ornament as mr porphyrios offers is often poorly scaled or even poorly designed and also too shallow in relief and or crudely carved with power tools whitman proves skilled stonemasons are available in this country it so happens skilled carvers are available too but princeton administrators have clearly concluded that if physics has evolved since the tudors or woodrow wilson and social relations have done likewise collegiate gothic might as well get with the program and become more modern and abstract wrong the vigorous interplay of abstract architectural lines and figurative detail is part of the styles dna as for the intensely rationalistic mr porphyrios the short shrift he routinely gives ornament in his work is a serious shortcoming the fact remains that a rich institution has placed a huge bet on a truly unconventional vision and by and large the bet paid off whitman college provides princetonians with ample cause for celebration and its well worth a visit from architecture aficionados of all stylistic proclivities mr leigh is at work on a book about public monuments
