bulky yellow phone books turn the page to online video the yellow pages are turning a new leaf with video on the web idearc media corp s superpages com yellow book usa inc and at&amp t inc s yellow pages already offer listings on the web now these companies and others are beginning to offer online videos allowing advertisers to post versions of their tv commercials alongside their web ads the directory companies are even offering to produce new videos for businesses which run as long as two minutes on some sites in a video posted on superpages com for kent floral in kent wash the camera pans a flower shop where a baby holds a yellow flower and an announcer declares "were not your typical dot com florist " lora cree the shops owner said she bought the video ad to let customers know her store wasnt simply an order taking service the video was made by a crew hired by superpages com she had some input on the content "we really wanted to be able to show in a video that we have a sales floor and a cooler with fresh flowers in it and a large showroom and staff and designers in our store " says ms cree directories are expanding into online video at a time when their industry is getting pummeled by the internet and other new technology the bulky print books that used to dominate local advertising while still profitable are facing increasing competition from search engines that have become more locally focused aware of the long term problems some phone companies like qwest communications international inc have spun off their directory businesses over the past two years most have tried to keep up by creating web sites of their own and striking up web partnerships superpages com for example announced recently that it created a restaurant review feature for facebook inc s facebook com a popular social networking site the feature allows facebook users to read and write restaurant reviews that can be shared with other users some directories are also trying to stay on the vanguard of new technology by selling local businesses mobile search services users who download special software to their cellphones can get the addresses and phone numbers for stores restaurants and other merchants while theyre on the go most directories list business names and phone numbers free of charge they make money by charging for extras like boldface type color print or large display ads which can cost tens of thousands of dollars depending on the size of the market where the business is advertising video fits well into this business model as it gives the directories another feature to sell either charging flat fees for the video ads or small fees per click directories also are adding video because theyre under pressure to distinguish themselves from the wide range of other web sites that are going after local advertisers like google inc and citysearch com a division of iac interactivecorp newspapers which also have suffered from the widespread availability of free internet ads like those offered on craigslist org have begun allowing classified advertisers to post video ads in some cases start ups such as realpeoplerealstuff com also offer video classifieds but online video is still unproven as a local advertising tool superpages com tried to offer online video ads six years ago and abandoned the trial after realizing the format was unfamiliar and too few people had high speed internet connections now that over of u s households have broadband "its absolutely the right time now " says eric chandler president for the internet division of idearc media small businesses also typically have modest advertising budgets so may be reluctant to spring for an online video superpages com plans on offering the feature to a broad base of advertisers later this fall charging advertisers &# to produce a second spot the company said advertisers pay for clicks on the ads some small business owners are leery of the pay per click model ms cree for example says she must pay superpages com &# &# each time web surfers click on her video ad initially it received so many clicks which she assumed were from local competitors checking it out that she immediately blew through her video ad budget now she budgets for &# worth of clicks a month and says it typically runs out halfway through the month which means the video ads disappear until the start of the next month she says her business has received a boost from the video ads and that they were worth the money idearc says that as the ads become more widespread their novelty will wear off and the bulk of clicks will come from interested customers at the same time advertisers have to be careful that they dont hurt business with ads that look too cheesy some directory businesses hire videographers who try to steer advertisers away from content that might turn off consumers but it doesnt always work some of the ads look like snippets of infomercials with shots of cheery employees answering phones at a beauty salon for example directory companies try to avoid problems by screening ads to make sure theyre g rated and include basic information about businesses pat marshall chief new media officer for yellow book says his company tells advertisers that their online videos must be more informative than a typical tv commercial but that they dont have to be boring "we dont want these videos to be just recitations of facts " mr marshall said telephone directory company r h donnelley corp s dex directories formerly owned by qwest started offering online videos in its west coast territory in early after studying googles youtube com phenomenon and realizing how the format could appeal to advertisers the ads are popular with restaurants and hotels a spokesman says "for certain lines of business where its all about showing the aesthetics where you want to demonstrate what your facilities look like and that youre first class all the way its perfect " says donnelley spokesman tyler gronbach ann fetsch owner of a drexel heritage home furnishings franchise in colorado springs colo runs an ad adapted from one of her tv commercials on dexknows com the online directory of dex she says the spot with its soothing music and images of living room and bedroom designs replicates the ambiance of being in a store "we have beautiful full color four page ads that we run but theres just nothing like being able to show that with this media " she said online video ads may appeal to a wide range of businesses such as law firms that want to present the faces of the proprietors as a selling point says charles laughlin program director for kelsey group inc a market research firm "theres an element of vanity in the selling of large display advertising and the same applies to video advertising " mr laughlin says yellowpages com offers advertisers a template for their online video ads which allows them to create graphics and incorporate other features the ads supplement online text and audio ads the company has offered for years with video says company president and chief executive charles stubbs "we can be truly the one stop shop " in mid august imad achmar posted a second video clip describing his chicago franchise of servicemaster a cleaning service on yellowbook com the ad shows workers steam cleaning carpets and couches it was shot by a video crew hired by yellowbook com but mr achmar had some input on the content in particular he wanted to show off his companys signature yellow vans so they are featured prominently pulling into a driveway in a one week time period alone mr achmar said four new customers have told him they called because they saw the video ad "the ad shows customers the quality we deliver " said mr achmar "and once they see the video they dont have to go further browsing through the web site or have to do any reading anymore "
