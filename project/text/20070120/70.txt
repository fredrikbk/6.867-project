remembrances john w simpson harnessing the power of nuclear energy for civilians submarines john w simpson helped bring nuclear power to u s submarines electricity generation and the space program and was one of the few who could hold his own against the volatile admiral hyman g rickover mr simpson former president of westinghouse electric power systems co worked with adm rickover to create a nuclear navy most notably with the ssn nautilus the worlds first operational nuclear powered submarine then despite the admirals anger over losing mr simpsons technical saavy he developed westinghouses commercial nuclear power plant business and organized the companys astronuclear laboratory to build a reactor for nuclear rockets mr simpson who died jan at age "had the most amazing knack for simplifying things he could always articulate it in a few brief sentences " says his son carter he also was an all business executive who believed in multiple backup plans in he was under pressure from adm rickover to make a presidential photo opportunity run flawlessly president dwight d eisenhower was to wave a wand actually a neutron detector in denver triggering a phone hookup to start a bulldozer that would break ground for an atomic power station in shippingport pa "if that thing buries itself on the ground or the engine stalls youre going to be last years toast " adm rickover told mr simpson recalls ted rockwell who served as a liaison between the admiral and westinghouse engineers to be safe mr simpson had buried a railroad rail six inches underground to keep the bulldozer from getting stuck "you cant take chances you know " mr simpson wrote in a book "nuclear power from underseas to outer space " that attention to detail marked mr simpsons career which ranged from making electrical equipment on navy ships shockproof and fireproof during world war ii to negotiating contracts for nuclear power plants in france in the s and s a graduate of the u s naval academy he was denied a commission because of poor eyesight in he met the future adm rickover then a contracting officer when mr simpson was an engineer at pittsburgh based westinghouse electric co now part of tokyo based toshiba corp adm rickover nixed mr simpsons desire to enlist in the army after the attack on pearl harbor in saying his engineering work was more important to the war effort according to his family in months after the japanese surrender following the u s atomic bomb attack mr simpson saw the destruction first hand in hiroshima as a member of a navy technical assistance team "it was a grim start to my nuclear career " he wrote in his book shortly afterward he shared a four bedroom house with adm rickover and others during a leave of absence from westinghouse at tennessees oak ridge national laboratory to help figure out how to apply nuclear energy for generating power "i had gotten along with rickover reasonably well during the war but i knew that wherever rickover was things would be hectic " mr simpson wrote in his book it was not all work though mr simpson continued to use adm rickovers military rank when referring to him since they lived in a dry county the men sharing the house used a bit of subterfuge to avoid police detection when buying liquor in an adjacent county transferring the booze to a second car before crossing the county line and keeping it in "a large security safe" procured by adm rickover mr simpson wrote mr simpson worked closely with adm rickover for a decade overseeing the building of the nautilus propulsion plant at the bettis atomic power laboratory in west mifflin pa and at the nuclear power plant in shippingport "rickover was a real firestorm but by being completely outrageous he managed to bring out capabilities in people they never knew they had " says dr rockwell in his book mr simpson likened the admirals management style to a "full court press in basketball keep the pressure on use unorthodox tactics and never let up rickover broke every management rule but for him it worked " mr simpson wrote that he tried to teach adm rickover the basics of reactor physics but the admiral ultimately quit the lessons to focus on "the big picture " adm rickover died in the bond helped westinghouse develop a strong relationship with the navy according to dr rockwell "the guys at westinghouse always acted as if they were fellow engineers " compared with other companies that treated the navy as "the fiscal bureaucracy that supplied the money " the relationship started to fray in when mr simpson organized westinghouses astronuclear laboratory adm rickover was furious over mr simpsons departure from navy work in part because he would be taking with him several top engineers and scientists at the bettis plant which westinghouse managed for the government meanwhile without adm rickovers support and a lack of government funding mr simpson led westinghouses efforts to persuade national aeronautics and space administration to begin a nuclear rocket program in wearing a full body cast after a skiing accident he testified before a congressional committee and ultimately helped westinghouse win a contract to develop a nuclear rocket engine for nasa the program was cancelled in by then mr simpson already had moved on to other nuclear power fields within westinghouse developing commercial nuclear power between and when mr simpson retired at the age of westinghouse sold large nuclear plants in the u s and overseas ted stern who was responsible for building westinghouses commercial nuclear power business recalls mr simpson enabled his managers to move quickly in when mr stern needed millions of dollars to build a facility in pensacola fla to manufacture a piece required for nuclear reactors he says mr simpson approved it without a fuss saying "i have faith in what youre saying and doing " adds mr stern "i dont think youd get away with that today " throughout his career colleagues say mr simpson remained even tempered even during times when conversations with adm rickover erupted into shouting matches "john always kept his cool " says dr rockwell "he could be upset but basically he kept his head he never lost it " john w simpsons legacy  worked at oak ridge national laboratory then called clinton laboratory on nuclear power  launch of first nuclear submarine the nautilus shown led westinghouse team that built pressurized water reactor  organized westinghouses laboratory for research on nuclear rocket engines  named president of westinghouse electric power systems co harold macneill engineer helped golfers stay on their feet harold macneills company became synonymous with metal spikes for golfers and then scrambled to switch to plastic spikes when courses banned metal to eliminate those pesky pockmarks on greens he built macneill engineering co which he founded in a waltham mass basement with his father in into a company with partners across the u s europe and asia its champ spikes are worn by many of the worlds top pro golfers from tiger woods down and it partners with nike adidas mizuno and cole haan among others the company entered the golf business "really by accident" in the late s according to mr macneills son harris macneill the companys president he says wilson sporting goods co asked macneill engineering to produce a device to test golf balls within the hour mr macneill and his father had jury rigged a device with parts from the machine shop and tested it by smacking cranberries against the office wall from that initial success wilson asked the company to construct a more reliable golf spike than ones then on the market the sure lok that mr macneill helped develop didnt loosen as easily as other spikes orders quickly followed including a shipment of spikes to golf shoe manufacturer footjoy now footjoy worldwide owned by acushnet co that mr macneill delivered personally his son says business also expanded under his watch to produce spikes for shoes worn by national football league players as well as for baseball soccer track rugby and cricket as the company grew mr macneill traded on his friendship with golfing great byron nelson who lent one of his nicknames champ to the product in the s the company faced a fundamental challenge to its business when u s courses began to ban metal spikes "at first they put out a sign that said soft spikes only " recalls gary wiren a golf instructor and former professional golfers association staff director "now i dont even see them anymore because nobody wears metal spikes " actually a few holdouts on the pga tour still wear metal spikes harris macneill recalls "all of a sudden our manufacturing equipment was obsolete we still had machines on order it was a scary time to say the least " faced with challenges from competitors like maryland based softspikes llc macneill invested millions of dollars in new equipment and ramped up marketing and public relations operations although harold macneill no longer headed the company now called macneill engineering worldwide he maintained an office that he worked from daily until dec the day he entered the hospital
