journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources management highly paid executives represent value for money despite the negative coverage dismay over top executives rich compensation is as old as the corporate boardroom and the public outcry shouldnt detract from the fact that the recent pay bonanza by and large has been well deserved the economist
