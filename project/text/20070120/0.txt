catch and release in regard to your jan editorial "the berger files" the treatment of sandy berger brings a question or two to mind why would a known document pilferer ever be allowed to get his security clearance renewed why isnt he in prison also why hasnt big media been running editorial demands that he be forever stripped of his security clearance and jailed uh forget that last question i forgot for a moment that hes a democrat charles mitchell winchester ohio compare the "catch and release" for sandy bergers repeated and confessed violation of law with the never ending prosecution of scooter libby for his alleged perjury to cover up a crime that never happened does it make you cynical about justice in our american legal system yep me too john scherwitz la porte texas
