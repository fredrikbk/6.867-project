politics &amp economics railroads seek tax aid short line firms pursue credits extension washington the small often money losing railroads that connect isolated farm towns to major rail lines won a minor tax break from congress in after strenuous lobbying only to see the internal revenue service write rules last september that limited the subsidy so much it was almost worthless but the short line railroad industry as its known is the little industry that could it quietly got congress at the end of last year to undo what the irs had done a classic example of the lobbying clout a small industry can wield if its pieces are across congressional districts and states from vermont to kansas next stop for the short line railroads getting congress to extend the &# million annual tax break beyond its scheduled expiration at the end of this year some members who endorsed the tax break have retired or were voted out of office "we have all these new members in congress who dont know anything about it " says adam nordstrom lobbyist for the american shortline and regional railroad association an organization of short line operators mr nordstrom also worries about the new pay as you go rules put forth by democrats in an effort to tighten deficit spending will make it harder to get the tax break "so whatever we get it would have to be taken out of someone elses hide " while short line railroads may be seen as a relic of the past they are increasingly integrated into the distribution of commodities that cross the country in there were about miles of short line track in the u s generally with fewer than miles of track and earning less than &# million in annual revenue now there are about miles of short line track the growth reflects the tendency of big railroad corporations which operate about miles of track to shed offshoot lines to concentrate on more profitable long haul routes short lines are a viable business but maintaining and upgrading track lines is expensive and that led the industry to look to the government for help in a bill congress said the taxpayers would pay cents of every &# spent on track maintenance and upgrading the tax credit equaled about &# per mile short lines on their tax returns were to use the credit on their tax bills but since many short line railroads dont earn enough taxable income to take full advantage of the credit they began assigning the track maintenance work to related third party businesses essentially the short lines would trade the tax credit to those construction companies that could use them selling tax credits to companies that can use them isnt unheard of but congress traditionally writes a provision of any law to explicitly permit them in this case congress apparently unwittingly left the provision open for interpretation according to the irs in september after months the irs finally published rules governing the tax credit to the industrys surprise the irs essentially said short line railroads that couldnt take full advantage of the credit couldnt give the full value of the tax credit to the other companies the result the tax credit was worth only cents for every &# spent on track upgrades and maintenance for the industry as a whole the irs also said the rules would apply retroactively but short lines already had completed millions of dollars of track work and were counting on selling the tax credits to pay for it watco cos a holding company of short lines fanned across the country had spent &# million upgrading miles of track for the kansas &amp oklahoma railroad that connects wichita kan to the railroads northwestern outpost in henderson kan watco was counting on allowing half of that &# million to go as a tax credit to the third parties who actually did the work paying them with tax credits instead of cash "this was scary " said ed mckechnie chief commercial officer at watco "we did not have another &# million " in october two weeks after the irs rules were publicized the short line association met in washington to map out strategy they instructed their members to calculate how much they had spent so far on track upgrades nearly &# million and began cold calling key members of congress to stop the irs big railroad companies pitched in "we support the tax credit for short lines and we partner with them on their legislative agendas " says kelly donley spokeswoman for the association of american railroads which represents major freight railroads such as norfolk southern corp and burlington vermont santa fe railway and also amtrak in december rep jerry moran r kan rep dave camp r mich and rep phil english r pa wrote to irs chief mark everson and accused the irs of overstepping its authority "the regulations should be withdrawn immediately and retroactively and no further guidance regarding such arrangements should be issued by the treasury and the internal revenue service until congress has had an opportunity to address these areas " the irs wouldnt comment publicly about the short line rules it drafted and its interpretation of the law but in the waning days as congress hustled to finish before adjourning for the year sen gordon smith r ore and sen blanche lincoln d ark led an effort to push the legislation through a change to undo the irs rule short lines now can trade the tax credit and get full benefit of the credit to any related
