pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings christopher wheeldon takes a chance the worlds most talented choreographer heads out on his own new york a year and a half ago columbia universitys miller theatre presented an evening of chamber ballets choreographed by an affable young brit named christopher wheeldon and accompanied by the music of gyoergy ligeti the avant garde composer best known for the spooky sounding music heard in " a space odyssey " highbrow totally yet "watching ligeti move" was one of the seasons hottest dance tickets and the word was that miller theatre could have sold out twice as many shows as it put on thats what happens when mr wheeldons name is on the marquee at he is by far the best known of under dancemakers and the only one universally regarded by critics and connoisseurs as a first class talent like jerome robbins hes a dead serious artist with an engagingly popular touch who has worked on broadway "sweet smell of success" and in hollywood "center stage" he became new york city ballets resident choreographer in and since then every other company in the world has either commissioned a wheeldon ballet or wants one nobody is better equipped to take charge of a top tier dance company but instead of waiting for a job to open up mr wheeldon is rolling the dice and starting a troupe of his own so far morphoses named after one of mr wheeldons ligeti ballets exists only on paper but it has already been booked to perform at new yorks city center londons sadlers wells theater and the vail international dance festival in colorado why all the buzz over a group that has yet to dance a single step one reason is that its leader is an exceedingly rare bird not only is mr wheeldon the best choreographer to come along since mark morris started kicking up a fuss in the s but he is unlike mr morris a specialist in classical ballet who makes tutu and toeshoe ballets influenced by george balanchine and frederick ashton the greatest classical choreographers of the th century as a result dancegoers who prefer "swan lake" to edgy modern dance find it easy to warm up to such fresh looking yet fundamentally traditional ballets as mr wheeldons "variations serieuses" and "an american in paris " no less noteworthy though is the fact that mr wheeldon plans to base morphoses in new york city though it will also perform regularly in london a quarter century ago at the height of the dance boom the big apple was home to no less than four classical companies american ballet theater dance theatre of harlem the joffrey ballet and new york city ballet but rising costs shrinking audiences and a drop in arts related charitable giving are making manhattan an inhospitable place for dance dth is no longer performing while the joffrey now operates out of chicago its been a decade since a major ballet company was successfully launched in the u s and that one carolina ballet was based not in new york but raleigh n c where operating costs are far lower no one doubts mr wheeldons ability to lead a high quality ensemble but can he raise enough cash and keep on raising it year after year to make a new york based touring company a going proposition the estimated annual budget of morphoses will be about &# million and will the dancers he hopes to hire be capable of performing the medium to large scale ballets on which his reputation to date has mainly been based carolina ballet has dancers san francisco ballet morphoses by contrast sounds more like an overgrown modern dance group than a classical ballet company will that be enough to satisfy the burgeoning creative needs of a choreographer who for the past six years has been able to draw on the formidable resources of new york city ballet i asked mr wheeldon last week why he wanted to swap his cushy spot at nycb for the high risk job of starting a brand new company "creating morphoses from scratch allows me to assemble dancers with all the qualities i admire and that will be necessary to handle the demands of my work and of the choreographers that i will be commissioning " he replied "id like to have wonderful ballet trained dancers who are ready for a broad and collaborative artistic experience i felt that at city ballet i was always drawn to the same small group individuals who shared my collaborative and creative spirit " fair enough and i can see why mr wheeldon would want to try being his own boss on the other hand i wouldnt be surprised if he also sees morphoses as a calling card a means of positioning himself to take charge of one of the top four classical companies nycb san francisco ballet american ballet theatre and londons royal ballet at some point in the not so distant future either way the most promising young ballet choreographer of his generation is about to become a big time institutional player in the world of dance for christopher wheeldon thatll be quite a morphosis mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings"
