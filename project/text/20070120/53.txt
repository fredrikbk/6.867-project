pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink a fad minted in the s the assembled mercenaries in the film "ronin" are checking their weapons and as none knows another a certain tough guy one upmanship begins "methods to withstand interrogation " says the sandy haired yorkshireman with the blunt scowl "we were taught methods to hold out indefinitely " "nobody can hold out indefinitely " says sam played with a no nonsense wariness by robert de niro no phony bravado for him "is that so " sneers the yorkshireman "yeah everybody has a limit i spent some time in interrogation once " now sam has their attention "i held out as long as i could all the stuff they tried you just cant hold out forever impossible " "howd they finally get to you " asks larry the wheelman "they gave me a grasshopper " eyes widen as each man imagines the horrible instrument of torture it would have taken to break sam finally larry has to know "whats a grasshopper " "lets see " says sam with a sly jut of the jaw "its two parts gin two parts brandy one part creme de menthe " the recipes wrong but the gag is spot on equal parts green creme de menthe clear creme de cacao and heavy cream it is hard to imagine an alcoholic beverage less harrowing than a grasshopper mint chocolate chip ice cream the substance the grasshopper most closely resembles is rarely an ordeal some drinks are born popular the manhattan some drinks achieve popularity the dry martini emerged after a decades long evolution from its sickly sweet ancestor the martinez cocktail and some drinks have popularity thrust upon them the grasshopper is a case in point a fad cooked up by the marketing johnnies the drink seemed to come out of nowhere at midcentury the basic ingredients had been used together before layered in one of the umpteen variations on the pousse cafe but the creme de cacao in the layered drink was the standard chocolate colored variety it was the substitution of clear creme de cacao that made all the difference producing a drink the sort of candied sea foam turquoise green so popular on the chrome clad land yachts of the time that substitution was the work of leroux liqueurs co of philadelphia leroux made only cordials and so what better drink for them to promote than one anchored by a pair of liqueurs soon other liqueur companies got into the act and the grasshopper was everywhere the grasshopper became the iconic girly drink its sweet its creamy its pretty in a year old chicago woman named virginia wantroba sued for the right to enjoy a cocktail at the local bar observing the journalistic niceties of the day the chicago tribune included that the young secretary was "a foot inch pound brunette" illinois had passed a law to raise the drinking age for women from to miss wantroba alleged that this was a blatant act of gender discrimination even though the legal drinking age for men in illinois was already that inflicted on her an "irreparable injury " her boss just happened to be gerald b mullin the attorney for the states beverage dealers association the new law mr mullin argued interfered with her "pursuit of happiness " and what drink in particular was the object of her quest for civil rights the grasshopper miss wantroba was on the tail end of the fad that same year the new york times eulogized the grasshopper as one of those drinks that "catches on for a while and then fades out " a quarter century later the drink had become a sign of sham sophistication in the novel "rogers version " a young woman who lives in the projects visits her divinity school professor uncle at thanksgiving john updike describes the awkward back and forth when he offers her a drink "how about a grasshopper " she asks "and its ingredients are " the professor of course had merely meant to proffer a glass of wine "oh come on guess " she teases him the professor comes up with creme de menthe but thats all and so she describes how they make the drink at her neighborhood bar "the one down at the end of prospect with the burnt out upstairs " the drink for updike is shabby fancy "there was in her manner something of learned vulgarity " a tough girl moxie traced "from a certain vein of american brass going back at least to the andrews sisters " its hard to find anyone with a kind word for the innocuous old orthopteran david embury author of "the fine art of mixing drinks " did not like frothy creamy treats he derided the grasshopper as a "so called cocktail " embury felt that anything properly labeled a "cocktail" had to serve as a preprandial a stimulant to the appetite the grasshopper instead is dessert in a glass in fact it soon morphed into an honest to goodness dessert a liqueur flavored pie that by the late s had eclipsed the drink that inspired it embury discussed various permutations of the drink "one bar in new york city cuts down on the cream and adds blackberry brandy this results in a rather muddy looking locust " he sniffs "with or without the blackberry as a cocktail it is strictly vile " i think thats unduly harsh the drink is generally too sweet for me but it is mr de niros sam notwithstanding no torture those who like peppermint patties will find the grasshopper a pleasant way to wrap up a meal but i do think the classic recipe could stand one simple change every green creme de menthe ive found is colored that particular electric hue otherwise reserved for antifreeze with clear creme de cacao the creme de menthe gives the drink a glaring lime drop brightness but use dark creme de cacao and you get a grasshopper elegantly dressed in a muted restoration hardware style sage green the grasshopper  oz creme de menthe green  oz creme de cacao either clear or dark  oz cream or "half and half" shake with ice and strain into a saucer champagne glass or into a cocktail glass for the classic bright green grasshopper use clear creme de cacao for a more demure sage green version use chocolate hued creme de cacao
