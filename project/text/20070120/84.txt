true charter school idea embodies basic american principles in regard to jason rileys jan editorial page commentary "whats the matter with kansas " yes mr riley is right to praise veteran kansas educators betty horton and sandy lassiter who are trying to reduce the point gap between white and black students in topeka kansas no pleas do not call the law kansas passed a true charter law it is a case study in frustration having helped write the nations first charter law in minnesota and having been invited to testify in more than states and several congressional committees on this subject i think it is vital to be clear about real charter laws the central idea is that parents educators and community members would be able to create new accountable public schools under a contract or charter with a local district or some other entity such as a state board of education university mayors office or approved social service agency true charter laws like those in states like minnesota arizona massachusetts and new york give educators community members the chance to present their ideas to truly neutral groups real charter laws recognize that local districts often are defensive and not willing to support innovation in topeka the lead charter advocates include educators who are year veterans their very strong proposals which i have reviewed have proposed research based approach that have helped narrow achievement gaps in other communities but their ideas were rejected on a board vote other strong proposals have been rejected by local boards all over the nation the charter idea is based on basic american principles giving people a chance to carry out their dreams so long as they are willing to be responsible for results and while providing freedom within broad limits and the separation of powers so that no single group or organization has all the power just as we do not expect one political party to approve candidates of another party or allow one local restaurant to decide whether another restaurant should be allowed to open or give one newspaper the power to accept or reject another local competitor the charter idea insists that applicants should be able to go to a group other than a local board to get permission to operate some states like kansas have passed pseudo charter laws that still give local districts the power to block new schools other states such as new york and north carolina allow advocates to go to a local or statewide group for permission to open but unfortunately have caps on the number of new schools permitted new yorks new governor wisely has urged raising or eliminating the cap hes absolutely right in the past years people like mike feinberg and dave levin at kipp lawrence hernandez at cesar chavez and yvonne chan at vaughn street have used the charter idea to dramatically reduce achievement gaps and increase overall success the true charter idea is america at its best its vital to be clear about what that idea is then kansas and many other states can use the true charter idea as part of their efforts to help all youngsters reach their potential it is noteworthy that rosa parks spent part of her last decade of life trying to help create a charter in detroit your editorial accurately notes that cheryl brown henderson of the brown v board of education family is supporting the proposed racially integrated charter in topeka honoring martin luther king jr s dream isnt just about giving speeches or showing tapes of his work it is about giving power to people like topekas sandy lassiter and betty horton so that they can make a huge difference for young people joe nathan director center for school change humphrey institute university of minnesota
