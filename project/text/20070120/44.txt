pursuits books figaro and a spanish french marriage beaumarchais in seville by hugh thomas yale pages &# when pierre augustin caron the son of watchmaker andre charles caron was born in europe was relatively at peace the future playwright who appended "de beaumarchais" to his name on his way up in the world had the added advantage of a happy childhood adored by his highly educated father and five sisters he was equally adored as an adult by his mistresses and women friends nonetheless beaumarchaiss first great triumph was entirely due to his own intelligence at he invented the essential part that enabled the modern pocket watch to keep accurate time this made him the darling of the french court whose members were enthralled with stylish timepieces add to this the accomplishment of his winning a fortune at cards in madrid in against the ambassador of russia at nearly every session he broke the bank and its clear that beaumarchais had the type of mind that made him a phenomenal noticer he certainly noticed much in spain we know beaumarchais best as the author of "the barber of seville" and "the marriage of figaro " two plays both written in the s that rossini and mozart adapted for the opera house both are set in seville and both turn on the palace escapades of a mischievous servant and sometime barber in the service of an amorous and buffoonish spanish nobleman but how did beaumarchais come to know of this world and its intrigues that is the subject of hugh thomass brief study "beaumarchais in seville " actually beaumarchais never made it to seville the catchy title refers to the spiritual space the city occupied in the french authors mind mr thomas interprets beaumarchaiss trip to spain as a window on the culture he would turn to such good account in his plays ostensibly he went to madrid to help his sister lisette who had settled there with one of their married sisters lisette already had been twice jilted by her fiance in madrid the free thinking journalist jose clavijo and probably had been his mistress mr thomas is particularly shrewd in describing the nonchalant mores of the french spanish beau monde of the period it was chic for a society woman to have at minimum two lovers but a husband in the background was a social necessity lisette had compounded the error of being unmarried by acquiring a second fiance though beaumarchais managed to have clavijo sign a letter attesting to lisettes virtue his mind seems to have been more on the main chance he saw spain as a golden financial and political opportunity spain was that and more way back when i studied european history an essentially british view of the world predominated the very real power of emperor charles vs vast holy roman empire in which seville was sort of the new york of europe receiving the riches of the new world seemed to have got somewhat mislaid instead the historians i read diminished spains role and subscribed to the romantic stereotype that "europe stops at the pyrenees " but spain was a nation of tremendous power and wealth when beaumarchais arrived there and he and his rich french business partner paris duverney the special adviser to madame de pompadour had a firm plan for acquiring some of both for themselves they wanted to interest spain in a piece of the slave trade taking a more worldly view of spain mr thomas is particularly adroit at meshing beaumarchaiss political ambitions to his literary pursuits we know that the playwright who was also a musician championed spanish theater and music during a period when spanish theater and art were undervalued he was stunned at the overt eroticism of spanish dances the fandango and boleras and intrigued by ramon de la cruzs wacky sainetes playlets then the rage in madrid pedro almodovars early movies particularly "women on the verge of a nervous breakdown " capture the sainete mood unlike french theater so influenced by greek rationalism spanish literature comes out of the more fluid jewish relativism by beaumarchaiss time of course the inquisition had withered but writers had acquired a permanent odd man out loner mentality what is called the hispano judaic mindset probably the subterranean antiheroic quality of their work had the same appeal to beaumarchais that it has had on our own novelists notably saul bellow mr thomas is fascinating in his discussion of the spanish influence on beaumarchaiss work but that said it should be noted that beaumarchaiss real idol was voltaire in "the barber of seville " figaro observes "the love of letters is not incompatible with the spirit of business " voltaire who became wealthy before he was he contracted to supply the french army with provisions and munitions seems to have provided beaumarchais psychological permission to become enamored of trying to make a fortune as well as writing one business beaumarchais chose was far removed from his watchmaking apprenticeship even before the american colonies officially rebelled he was supplying them with cannons and ammunition while in madrid he had tried unsuccessfully to have his own mistress become the official mistress of the bourbon king of spain which would have given him tremendous power the peripatetic beaumarchais spent and lost a fortune rescuing and publishing outside of france all of voltaires censored works and the world owes him a great debt for his preservation of them apparently we americans also owe him a debt as we never quite paid for the arms he supplied to us when he was the secret agent of the french crown in a deal with spain to help our revolution voltaires clashes with government censors no doubt influenced beaumarchais to set his own sassy antimonarchal plays safely in seville a city that he might never have visited but one that had a firm grasp on the popular imagination the unstoppable beaumarchais was a man of an amazing variety of accomplishments but his most enduring achievement remains the creation of a character and a story that inspired the genius of two great composers hugh thomas has given us the gift of a superb romp through a mesmerizing but neglected interlude in history ms solomon an essayist and a novelist
