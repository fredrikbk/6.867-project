where others flee storms ross rushes in steel investor bets big on post katrina catastrophe insurance billionaire investor wilbur ross made a fortune buying troubled steel companies and selling them now hes being lured by a different kind of trouble betting on mother nature in the past year or so mr ross years old has been pouring money into companies specializing in catastrophic insurance few industries play in such a high stakes arena hurricanes earthquakes and other catastrophes can easily cause billions of dollars of damage in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in premiums for this kind of coverage soared and remain above pre katrina levels mr ross sees opportunity in that and is now upping his own bets his corner of the market is "reinsurance" the business of selling insurance to other insurance companies that want protection against massive claims after investing &# million last year in companies that specialize in this kind of coverage he recently pumped millions of dollars into a start up reinsurance company panther re bermuda ltd mr ross a part time resident of hurricane prone palm beach fla has made a mint by spotting opportunity where others see danger the man who earned millions on steel mills in the rust belt could lose millions in sun belt disasters if big storms hit as they did in firms that his company has invested in could be on the hook to insurers paying customer claims for damaged homes destroyed cars and the like if major storms dont hit as was the case in he and his co investors could make bundles mr ross acknowledges the risk "what we are betting on is that the perceived risk exceeds the actual risk thats fundamental to the theory of everything we do " he said in a recent interview in his manhattan office on the wall hung a copy of a magazine article headlined "is wilbur ross crazy " mr ross isnt alone in thinking he can rake in supersize returns in this business last year warren buffetts berkshire hathaway cashed in on its own outsized bets on catastrophe coverage hedge funds have been pouring money into the business too one of mr rosss insurance investments already looks like its paying off nicely last spring his firm bought &# million of shares in montpelier re holdings ltd a bermuda reinsurer for &# a share he took a seat on the companys board on friday montpelier shares closed at &# a jump meaning hed be up about &# million if the shares were sold at that price mr ross became a bankruptcy specialist at rothschild inc he left the firm in and formed wl ross &amp co llc which bought up ailing steel mills in he sold international steel group and netted a &# million profit mr ross is also familiar with the consequences of disasters twelve miners were killed last year in an explosion at the sago mine in west virginia owned by a firm that wl ross helped form a state report concluded that the blast was triggered by lightning which the company says is consistent with its own findings he says the differences between his steel investments and his insurance investments arent great "coming into steel when steel prices are at a level below the price at which people can afford to make it is the same thing as coming into insurance" after insurers have incurred billions in losses and premiums have climbed sharply he said insurers paid out roughly &# billion in claims from major hurricanes in and state farm the largest insurer of cars and homes in the nation says it lost &# billion alone if another massive storm hits a place like new york city or miami or a major earthquake rocks san francisco insurer bills will soar that helps explain why premiums for disaster coverage rose drastically after katrina hit in august more than doubling in some cases in hurricane prone areas the price increase caught mr rosss attention as some shocked investors pulled out he sought a way to get in "since our mission in life is to try to go into things where theres a lot of trouble " he said one of his first moves was putting &# million into a company called blue ocean reinsurance ltd that was created to sell reinsurance after katrina in partnership with montpelier mr ross became impressed with montpelier and with its read of the market early last year the company thought insurance premiums should be higher and prices did in fact rise through the spring "we didnt need the cash " said william pollett montpeliers treasurer but the firm saw an opportunity to use the money because demand for reinsurance was so strong in june at the start of hurricane season many feared a repeat of the previous two disastrous years by august and september when not a single hurricane had struck land in the u s mr ross explored increasing his investment in the industry that led to panther re announced in december wl ross is the largest single investor in panther supplying a little bit under half of the &# million in equity mr ross says panther is also backed by &# million in debt providing more capital to back up policies wl ross also has a license to sell insurance directly in florida though hasnt used it yet the risk of paying out big storm claims doesnt seem to trouble mr ross more storms would likely keep premiums high boosting the chance of future profits "were accustomed to very lumpy rates of return so the idea that you might have an individual year where you took losses well that doesnt frighten us very much " he said thats something in common with steel and other businesses where mr ross has invested he said "theyre all cyclical and they all have times when you do badly times when you do well " he said
