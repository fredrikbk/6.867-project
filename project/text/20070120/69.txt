pursuits travel south asia shortcut to india new airline routes are opening up some of the countrys most intriguing cities varanasi india its saturday afternoon in an antiquated airport terminal the immigration officer wearing street clothes instead of a uniform asks each arriving passenger if he can borrow a pen so that he can sign the visa stamp hes putting into passports outside hucksters wait to descend on the passengers in short its a typical day in a typical airport in india a country whose infrastructure often lags behind its charms but for me this arrival is something special for the first time im visiting a major indian tourist destination without first facing the ordeal of an overnight stopover getting to smaller cities in india used to be a nightmare literally travelers would have to stop in new delhi or mumbai where overseas flights often arrive and depart in the middle of the night but during the past three years several foreign airlines have launched nonstop flights from bangkok singapore dubai and other cities to more than a dozen second tier destinations in india this means a tourist or business traveler in asia can now take a long weekend or easy side trip bypassing indias modernized cities and going straight to parts of the country that havent yet been as transformed by the booming economy travelers can spend a long weekend visiting varanasi one of indias holiest cities where hindus come to wash away their sins in the ganges river in the south flights are open to kochi in kerala state a gateway to lavish resorts with traditional ayurvedic massage and treatments or you can take a trip to ahmedabad the bustling capital of gujarat known for its handicrafts museums and th century mosques all of this is a boon for travelers its also marking a new phase in the changes shaping india the countrys biggest cities are becoming accustomed to the influx of westeners now places that have been more insulated may be forced to adapt albeit at a much slower pace due to the lack of infrastructure on a more practical level these cities may not have seen as many foreign visitors as new delhi there may be a few hotels that are four or five star they will be clean and comfortable but not always lavish but foreign tourism is mostly targeted at the backpacker level english is widely spoken in india so communication isnt typically a problem although service isnt usually that quick but one of the most painful adjustments will be witnessing the in your face poverty both in the city and in rural areas foreign airlines led by thai airways international singapore airlines its subsidiary silkair and emirates airlines have only been allowed into these destinations in the past three years and have been progressively adding more flights since then thai airways and emirates airlines each added three new destinations in india last year airlines are taking advantage of a new policy of the indian government that has opened destinations to direct overseas flights this is in an effort to meet the increased demand from both tourists and business travelers that local airlines havent been able to keep up with the number of foreign tourists to india has doubled in the past decade to four million a year i flew to varanasi from bangkok with thai airways an easy three hour flight that began service in october it was quite a difference from the old system which often required arriving in a major indian airport in the middle of the night and taking a connecting flight in the morning the last time i flew from mumbai back to bangkok i left my hotel at a m and arrived at the airport at a m but the lines for check in and immigration were so long that i boarded my a m cathay pacific airways flight with only a few minutes to spare this time my flight to bangkok from varanasi left at p m of the odd passengers who flew to varanasi from bangkok only two others were westerners "the only reason i came here was because of this flight " said avi david an electronics salesman from haifa israel who was taking a three day detour to varanasi on his way to new delhi for business "i discovered it by coincidence on the thai airways web site " travel industry experts say the old overnight flights are a remnant of a time when india was considered a tiny market and often served as merely a stopover on flights between europe and asia the important consideration was getting to the final destination during the day theres little incentive for airlines flying to india to switch to day flights they note because it would mean more tie ups from airport congestion and fewer hours when they could use their aircraft fleet while not all of the destinations approved by the government have international flights yet many appealing places are open from singapore you can fly silkair to thiruvananthapuram formerly trivandrum and kochi cochin in kerala state on the southwest coast the former offers access to hill resorts and beaches while the latter is the gateway to the resorts of the backwater lagoons and ayurvedic resorts on singapore airlines you can go to amritsar in punjab in the far northwest the center of the sikh religion with its famed golden temple many of these cities arent equipped for a flood of foreign tourists there is for instance an acute shortage of hotel rooms in many of these destinations but local businesses are eagerly welcoming the new influx one of them is mannish bharadwaj who owns a tour business in jaipur the frenetic capital of rajasthan popular for its walled old city colorful bazaars and palaces he expects the international flights to start this year "no overnight stay will be needed in new delhi where theres no good hotel for less than &# a night " he says "so when we start the itineraries in jaipur tourists will save &# in delhi hotels coming and going " except for people talking on cellphones i found varanasi to be the old india unchanged the streets are still a chaotic fight for space among old ambassador cars bicycle rickshaws pedestrians cows and water buffalo there are no new hotels but a couple of old renovated ones the ganges river is the center of everything as it has been for centuries people flock to the more than ghats which are stairways leading from twisting alleyways and old buildings down to the western bank of the river with many of the ghats being distinctive communities the most famous is the burning ghat where bodies shrouded with cloth and flowers are brought in on wooden stretchers and cremated at nearly every ghat people are bathing in the polluted ganges whose water is considered holy and just a minute flight away is khajuraho which is home to a group of magnificent th century temples decorated by astonishing sculptures the flight home from varanasi showed how authentic this part of india remains the departure lounge of the old airport had one innovation a tv monitor that flashed information including a repeated message that instructed "do not pay bribes " just a few feet away baggage handlers were asking passengers to identify their suitcases before they were loaded onto a trolley while the equivalent of cents would satisfy them it was clear the suitcases were going nowhere without a "tip " trip planner varanasi how to get there thai airways international flies regularly from bangkok to varanasi through march the
