pursuits book review portrait of a young dictator mailers absurd and absorbing new novel imagines the childhood that shaped hitler the castle in the forest by norman mailer random house pages &# in a interview norman mailer the existential milton of american prose wondered whether "god and the devil war in the galaxies " and he dared to posit the intervention of each in big human events with the devil being served as he put it by "adjutants aides and little demons " it was mr mailers sense that one "can dramatize these notions in a major novel but only a major novel you would wreck a minor novel by introducing such ideas " mr mailer can rarely bring himself to do minor and "the castle in the forest" is indeed major it is his first novel since "the gospel according to the son" the book that reimagined the story of christ and puts him back in ontological territory this time its darker reaches now hitlers boyhood is his subject and the narrator is one of those satanic "adjutants" that mr mailer imagined in that long ago interview the result is a nervy and sometimes pratfallen story both absorbing and absurd dieter "you may call me d t " identifies himself in the books first paragraph as having been a member of an ss intelligence unit supervised by heinrich himmler only on page do we learn that he is actually "an officer of the evil one " the devil who assigned him to adolf hitler "the wild beast of the century " at the very beginning of the fuhrers life "he was my client " dieter finally reveals like a victorian heroine saying "reader i married him " throughout his charges infancy and childhood d t is never privy to the reason that his boss has taken such an interest in a little austrian boy nicknamed "adi " the narrator seems to be tasked with alternately bolstering and undermining the boy at one point he even wonders whether the "maestro" of hell is trying to drive adi to suicide he cultivates the boys "fear of embarrassment" something "prodigious in adolf" and devotes especially careful modulated attention to making adi hate his pompous martinet of a father alois who retires as a customs official of the austro hungarian empire when his son is still quite young no doubt is left that the devil got in on the ground floor of the hitler phenomenon dieter may not have been present at the fuhrers conception but he "was able to ingest the exact experience by calling upon the devil of lower rank who had been in alois bed on the primal occasion " a reader may wish that a less observant cadre had been assigned the coupling offered in slobbering detail isnt the stuff of operetta incest has often been seized upon as a comforting possible explanation for hitlers derangement and enormities mr mailer allows it to run rampant through the fuhrers family tree giving fictional validation to each historical suggestion of it the twisted sexual strands ensure that "klara poelzl who would become alois third wife and adolf hitlers mother was not only alois wife but also his blood daughter " which would seem to say that hitlers mother was also his sister as for the ultimate spawn of this tangle mr mailer succeeds in making the young inbred adi into something vividly charmless the boy is the poisoned apple of his mothers eye but he responds to her occasional criticisms with rage against his fathers punishments he cultivates a "will of iron " adi may be good at german history and war games but he enjoys seeing a dog beaten is stirred by the aroma of a dead rat and perhaps deliberately gives his baby brother the case of measles that kills him his own sulfurous body odor is a gift not of the devil but of god the "dummkopf" who dieter explains is "able to mark each of our clients" with a useful identifying smell what adi does get from his satanic handlers is the idea that "blood possessed magic it could be shared by a people when he looked at the strongest and most handsome boys in his class he tingled " the novel is sprinkled with emblems and episodes that constitute a kind of jokey foreshadowing young adolf attends a benedictine school where a swastika adorns the monastery gate during some masturbatory experimentation he realizes that he can sustain his effort "even while his arm was raised" at a heil hitlering degrees and his father suggests that linz could stand a better opera house when alois is forced to gas a hive of bees that he is raising readers are advised by the narrator against teasing out the too obvious allegory a warning that does more to underline it than anything else and yet a reader who prejudges "the castle in the forest" to be no more than a mechanical joke will not be doing justice to mr mailers complete and sometimes admirable seriousness at its best the book to which the novelist dutifully appends a long bibliography is attention sustaining and uncartoonish the incestuous hitlers are a kind of grim tolstoyan family convincingly unhappy in their own way alois in particular is a fine nuanced portrait of bourgeois pomposity an autodidact willing to worship the emperor who gives him a pension but not the god who gave him life in many ways the novel belongs to him in a similar way mr mailers nonfiction study of lee harvey oswald belonged to a transfixing portrait of the assassins mother marguerite "the castle in the forest" is most compelling when its most earthbound but mr mailer cant stop turning his attentions from the family hearth to the contested heavens and while one hardly wants to discourage anyones big thinking inside the neat cornell boxed world of current american fiction mr mailers dummkopf maestro agon is often no more cleverly imagined than second tier sci fi both god and the devil operate we learn on limited knowledge of each other and the universe theyre competing for the devils party is even hamstrung by budgetary problems as it goes about its strategic business of implanting false memories installing dreams like computer chips and encouraging "cheap" prayers while thwarting the more serious kind human beings we are informed surrender their souls only gradually and sometimes not forever "complete possession rarely occurs " operatives like dieter must continually combat some tough angelic opposite numbers the nicely named "cudgels " who somehow suggest spencer tracy with wings as always mr mailers mind teems with propositions and hypotheses some of them provocative he wonders through dieter if god may have been losing his mojo as the th century began "were we now awash in the dithering of an old divinity " a more sublunary idea that paranoia "is preferable to poor powers of anticipation" is vintage mailer alas so is the somewhat weary theory that emotional repression causes cancer this time in hitlers mother as well as an almost compulsive preoccupation with the proximity of the human sexual apparatus to the excretory one another mailer theme the limited power and knowledge of a devils functionary makes dieter a perfect unreliable modern narrator blinkered non omniscient his perspective always ripe for overrule by another point of view the same as an angels would be dieters tendency to digress comes partly from being spread too thin in his duties he invites readers to skip if they like a long narrative set piece about his doings in the months surrounding the coronation of tsar nicholas ii a kind of extended business trip that forces him to miss adis seventh birthday no a writer cannot fit all of this along with theories of the universe into a "minor" novel or at least a short one but mr mailers late career has been badly imperiled by an elephantiasis that has infected too many of his books from his cia novel "harlots ghost" to his studies of oswald and picasso as that career moves through a seventh decade the reader feels his own exasperation increasing even if his admiration remains undiminished what achievements and what failures lie in mr mailers mighty wake when reading dieters envoi it is hard not to hear the voice of the author himself a brooklyn prospero not yet willing to lay down the tools of his art "i must admit to a surprising degree of affection for those of my readers who have traveled all this way with me i have come so far myself in offering this narration that i can no longer be certain whether i still look for promising clients or search for a loyal friend there may be no answer to this but good questions still vibrate with honor within " there is yet more to come and any reader who remembers the awe with which he first came upon mr mailer four or five decades ago will despite anything stick with him to the end mr mallons seventh novel "fellow travelers " will be published in the spring
