the high price of keeping dad alive mark foster already had a rocky history with his father could he give him part of his liver new york in a stark office at mt sinai medical center last summer mark foster sat on a leather couch alongside his parents scared into silence the question he faced should he donate half his liver to save his fathers life marks father john was uneasy about the plan his mother alice opposed it angry her husband had exacerbated his illness by drinking across the desk transplant surgeon sukru emre gave mark a graphic rundown of what he could face severe pain disfiguring scars bile leaks deep vein thrombosis death "what am i saving in terms of making him go through all this " asked john mark turned to his father "youre not making me go through anything " he snapped as they left the hospital mark asked his parents for a tums to calm his churning stomach the year old headed into central park to find a patch of grass in the warm afternoon sunshine he cranked up his ipod he was scared to be a donor and scared not to be for decades almost all organs used in transplants came from deceased donors but as the operations have become more routine the number of available organs is falling far short of demand as a result living donations have tripled in the past decade to about a year according to the united network for organ sharing which oversees transplants in the u s liver donations make up more than of that number with a close relative the typical beneficiary most of the rest are kidney donations if all goes well the two pieces of the divided liver each grow large enough to do the work of a complete organ yet more than a third of liver procedures have complications since the operation was first performed in the late s more than a dozen donors are known to have died world wide including three in the u s the decision to surrender a piece of a liver can be an affirmation of love and selflessness as mark foster and his parents discovered it also can be an agonizing choice for the donor and recipient one that forces families to confront tensions they might have preferred remain dormant john and alice foster both met as teenagers at the swimming pool in cheltenham pa and they still live in the working class village north of philadelphia married in they soon had a daughter marianne and then a son mark john worked as a research technician creating "contraptions" to test equipment developed by munitions and oil companies mark remembers his childhood as carefree his mother stayed home with the kids for years before taking a job as a part time cashier in a school cafeteria and another painting childrens furniture she collected ceramic birds and bunnies to brighten the backyard marks dad coached his baseball team and taught him to fish holidays were spent surrounded by aunts uncles and cousins around junior high marks relationship with his father changed he remembers bursting into tears after striking out fearful hed let his father down during high school mark says he and his father spoke only when his dad criticized him "he would tell me if he was disappointed with me i didnt want to be a disappointment " john and alices marriage ran into problems after some good years in the late s john was laid off from a job with standard oil in cleveland the family moved back to cheltenham where john bought three struggling convenience stores he says hes still resentful alice wasnt much help with the business which he sold at a loss his next job involved overnight shifts and bosses he didnt like around this time alice says john began drinking more after nights out he would sometimes berate her in their bedroom late at night "he tended to be happy with other people and nasty with me when he got home " she says john whose father was an alcoholic says he was a social drinker "sometimes you lose your temper and sometimes you say things you dont mean " john says "i may be a little bit gruff at times but its not meant to be threatening " in john was diagnosed with hepatitis c a virus that causes inflammation of the liver he says he doesnt know how he got it he continued to drink for about a year worsening the condition the hepatitis and the drinking led to cirrhosis or scarring of the liver eventually johns liver began to fail alice joined al anon a support group for friends and relatives of alcoholics she embraced messages such as "dont get angry today dont worry today be grateful today " which is still tacked to her kitchen bulletin board alice says she learned to accept what she couldnt change including her husband johns doctors in philadelphia made him join alcoholics anonymous in order to get on the waiting list for a transplant he stopped attending after a few months because he says "it depressed the hell out of me " although he had to tell the group he was an alcoholic john says "i never felt i was " he says he hasnt had a drink in several years john landed at mt sinai medical center a leading new york hospital with one of the busier living liver transplant programs in april a liver surgeon assured john he could handle the operation but warned that the chances of reaching the top of the waiting list for a deceased donor werent good the doctor suggested john think about a relative as a living donor john considered approaching one of his five siblings but thought the burden would be too great he says he didnt want to ask his children either that august when he was mark finished classes at savannah college of art and design in georgia and headed north for what he thought would be a short trip home mark had abandoned sports for computers in high school after an injury and now was an aspiring web designer in his free time he liked to update his blog now located at savefoster com mark was shocked at his fathers condition once a strapping man john had little strength in his upper body he tired easily could walk only slowly and was becoming increasing irritable and combative mark wound up staying to help changing his fathers ivs and filling his prescriptions in april as mark prepared to leave and pursue a job lead in austin texas he recalls his father remarking offhandedly "if you leave you wont be able to do the donor thing " taken aback mark replied "what donor thing " john says he doesnt remember the conversation and wouldnt have asked such a thing mark says he took the exchange to mean his father wanted him to be a living donor he put aside plans to leave alice "just froze" when mark told her about his thinking she recalls she was resentful her son might risk his life to clean up a mess created partly by her husband alice made her feelings clear worried mark might feel pressure to be a donor but also said she would support any decision he made then alice looked up mt sinai on the web and was unnerved to learn that a year old man died at the hospital in days after donating a piece of his liver to his brother the state linked his death to shoddy care a resident with only days transplant experience was left to care for patients it imposed the maximum financial penalty and also banned adult to adult living donor transplants for a period that eventually lasted two years in a ripple effect living liver donations dropped off around the country new york became the first state to adopt regulations governing living donations to protect potential donors from being pressured by surgeons or relatives hospitals created "donor advocates" to look after the donors interests as opposed to those of the recipient despite his mothers misgivings mark wanted to learn more on june he and his parents arrived at mt sinais recanati miller transplantation institute for two days of meetings and tests members of mt sinais advocacy team steered clear of john to avoid developing any relationship with him that could compromise their advice to mark when liver specialist lawrence liu stepped into a tiny room to talk to mark he started when he saw the father there too "i dont want to even see him " dr liu said turning immediately to leave during this visit dr emre marks surgeon told the fosters he doubted john would survive five years without a transplant with one he said john had a to chance of living that long he then ran through the list of possible complications and offered to provide mark with a medical excuse if he wanted to back out dr emre mentioned the transplant death but he and others at the hospital blamed it on the patient having eaten a lobster after surgery and downplayed failures highlighted by the state dr emre later said he doesnt dwell on the hospitals errors because it has since made improvements during marks initial donor evaluation a psychiatrist invited alice to join them and asked how she felt she was blunt "its very hard for me to accept that this is his choice that this is what he wants to do " alice told the psychiatrist "i know that eventually i will lose my husband i dont want to lose my son " an additional wrinkle surfaced during the discussions marks insurance which he had through his father would run out in october when he turned his fathers insurance would pay for surgery and recovery for both men but after that mark was on his own dr emre ordered mark to get covered right away in case of any long term effects after the meeting mark with his journal in one pocket of his cargo pants and ayn rands "the fountainhead" in the other headed to central park with his parents john and alice sat on a park bench with john determined to control the situation "the bottom line is its up to me " he told his wife "if i say no its no " after hours in surgery john was wheeled into the intensive care unit past his sleeping son that evening marianne leaned over her unconscious father still attached to the ventilator and whispered "you take care of marks liver " the next day alice and marianne shuttled between johns room and marks room johns new liver worked well but he suffered some sort of delirium possibly from the medication or anesthesia a few days later left on a gurney in a hallway he tried to escape later he physically fought with two hospital workers mark meanwhile was having hallucinations that included bugs crawling out of skulls unable to sleep one night he walked through the hospital smelled what he thought was feces and vomited in a trash can he says he wondered momentarily if he should throw himself out a window he had another problem the thumb and first two fingers on his left hand were numb doctors concluded that a nerve in his wrist had been nicked by part of the iv apparatus full feeling would return within six months they predicted six days after surgery mark was released he moved into the nearby transplant living center a subsidized housing facility his wound was leaking he was still hallucinating and he couldnt sleep without drugs "i keep telling myself i did it for a good reason i did it for a good reason " he said through tears "part of me thinks i didnt understand what i was getting into " over the next few days marks condition improved with periodic setbacks on the day of a follow up he was doing better "i feel fantastic " mark told the surgeon after the appointment mark yawned through a session about how to care for john who was on his way to recovery including instructions on the use of more than a dozen medications afterwards over lunch he told his mother it wasnt her job to make sure john followed the rules his father needed to take care of himself "if dad doesnt do what hes supposed to you can leave " mark said "easier said than done " alice sighed mark just wanted to move on "honestly i dont really care anymore " he told his mother "its my life now " "it should be " she
