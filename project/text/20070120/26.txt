hot topic sizing up the libby cia leak trial opening arguments in the trial of lewis "scooter" libby the ex chief of staff to vice president dick cheney who is accused of lying to a grand jury in the governments leak investigation get started next week the trial promises to be a high profile event with potential witnesses ranging from the vice president to television journalist tim russert but it also represents a bizarre twist in a case that has tested the limits of laws to protect reporters and their sources and could spotlight how key players in the bush administration defended the case for war in iraq heres a closer look at some of the issues what prompted the cia leak investigation in the central intelligence agency sent former ambassador joseph c wilson to investigate claims that iraq was seeking nuclear weapons materials from niger he found no basis for the claims and said his advice was ignored mr wilson argued in an op ed piece in the new york times that the bush administration had manipulated intelligence to sell the iraq war soon after syndicated columnist robert novak reported that mr wilsons wife valerie plame was a central intelligence agency agent and that she had arranged for him to get the job the justice department assigned prosecutor patrick fitzgerald to investigate whether ms plames identity as a covert cia officer was blown by mr novaks sources in retaliation for her husbands criticism is the disclosure of an agents identity a crime in certain cases yes under the intelligence identities protection act investigators must prove that the agents name was intentionally revealed by someone who knew that the agent was undercover and that the agents identity was not previously disclosed the law has rarely been used to prosecute anyone was mr libby responsible for the leak it appears he wasnt prosecutors claim that mr libby discussed ms plame with at least three reporters but last september richard armitage former deputy secretary of state acknowledged publicly that he was the original source who told mr novak that mr wilsons wife worked at the cia mr fitzgerald apparently knew that mr armitage was the original source throughout his two year investigation mr armitage was not charged with a crime because he didnt know ms plame was a covert operative so why is mr libby being prosecuted the government claims mr libby lied when he told investigators he learned of ms plames identity from mr russert washington bureau chief of nbc news the government alleges mr libby learned of ms plames identity from his boss the vice president the prosecution is expected to call the two reporters with whom mr libby discussed ms plames role as a cia agent but because perjury cases require proof that the defendant lied on purpose simply proving that he told a falsehood wont be enough for the government they will try to show that ms plames role had mr libbys attention with testimony from government officials who discussed the matter with the former aide what is mr libbys defense the defense says there was no orchestrated campaign to retaliate against mr wilson instead lawyers will argue that mr libby got his facts wrong because he was facing weighty national security matters and didnt remember the details of every conversation that he had with every reporter if the vice president testifies he may be asked about the copy of mr wilsons op ed that he gave to mr libby with handwritten notes that questioned the rationale for mr wilsons trip mr cheney wrote "do we ordinarily send people out pro bono to work for us or did his wife send him on a junket " what lasting effect could the case have on the media the case initially alarmed press advocates because reporters were forced to reveal their sources during the investigation fueling concerns that sources would be less willing to speak candidly with reporters in the future but the prospect of both the prosecution and defense using reporters as key witnesses during the trial has fueled concerns that the public might see reporters as less independent further eroding press credibility what is the possible penalty if convicted on all five counts mr libby faces a maximum fine of &# million and years in jail though his sentence would likely be less because he has no criminal record mr libbys supporters who say he is an honest man subjected to a prosecutorial witch hunt might lobby the president for a pardon nick timiraos points of view "scooter is entitled to the presumption of innocence hes a great guy " vice president dick cheney "mr libbys story that he was at the tail end of a chain of phone calls passing on from one reporter what he heard from another was not true " special counsel patrick fitzgerald facts a trust fund set up for mr libbys defense has raised more than &# million with leading contributions from republican stalwarts including mary matalin and bill bennett the investigation has cost the government &# million in taxpayer money through last august for the first time in a federal court bloggers will receive credentials to cover a trial valerie plame will write a memoir for simon &amp schuster for an unspecified amount after a reported &# million deal with the crown publishing group collapsed last year pardons have earned public ire in the past as when president clinton pardoned fugitive marc rich in mr libby served as mr richs lawyer until special counsel patrick fitzgerald successfully convicted the suspects of the world trade center bombing potential defense witnesses dick cheney vice
