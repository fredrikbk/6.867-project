politics &amp economics some surge troops may return soon talil air base iraq gen george casey who is overseeing the addition of troops to iraq said the u s may consider bringing some of those new forces home as soon as late summer "i think it will be late summer before people in baghdad feel safer in their neighborhoods " he said gen casey met with defense secretary robert gates here friday after mr gates went out of his way not to reveal his opinion on troop levels in his first weeks in office he seems to have decided that the best way to stem surging violence in iraq and afghanistan for now is more u s troops his statements over the past week as he toured the persian gulf afghanistan and iraq suggest that even if the additional troops dont produce quick results in the coming months he will exercise patience less clear is whether lawmakers on capitol hill and voters who in polls are skeptical about the force increases will be willing to tolerate the bush administrations troop "surge" without quick results if the strategy doesnt work it isnt clear whether the administration has a backup plan mr gates making his second trip to iraq in less than a month spent most of his time here learning about southern iraq where british troops make up the preponderance of forces his visit seemed to highlight the differences between the u s and british in iraq in contrast to baghdad where the u s is adding troops british commanders have told u s officials they will likely withdraw a number of their troops in southern iraq this year in baghdad u s officials talk frequently about the need to disarm shiite militias such as the badr corps and the mahdi army and american commanders are pushing u s troops deeper into baghdads densely populated conflict zones in the british zone the opposite is happening british troops already seem to be taking a less aggressive approach in the south particularly when it comes to disarming the shiite militias they also seem to be pulling back from conflict zones and turning more of the fight over to iraqi troops a british spokesman says united kingdom forces are going out of their way not to confront the shiite militias "we are not taking them on " said maj chris ormand king adding that "the militias are not necessarily a bad thing " he said the militias eventually will be folded into the police and army but he cautioned the process "could take decades " the british position is in large part a product of the fact that they have essentially committed to turning over control to the iraqis in the next few months and to sending troops home or redirecting them to afghanistan where violence has also risen with fewer troops the british say there are limits to what they can do earlier this fall for example the british pulled out of a base in al amarah where u k forces took frequent fire and moved to a less populated area along the iraq iran border within days of turning the base over to iraqi army forces it was looted by impoverished locals the base hasnt been rebuilt "this is an extremely poor area " and what the iraqis decide to do with the base will "be something the iraqis will have to sort out for themselves " maj ormand king said gen casey speaking to reporters said it is too early to know whether the new u s iraqi strategy to secure baghdad will work much will depend on whether the iraqi government provides adequate forces for the fight and doesnt prevent troops from entering key neighborhoods or arresting political figures involved in illegal activity
