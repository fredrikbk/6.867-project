continental guzzlers europes big cars take toll new regulations loom as co emissions cut falls behind schedule brussels european commission president jose manuel barroso says its time to "attack the problem of climate change " but for his own family political europes chief executive owns a vehicle thats hardly saving the planet the family ride is a volkswagen touareg an suv that in its most efficient version emits times the average level of carbon dioxide for new cars from europes manufacturers to demonstrate how powerful the touareg is volkswagen recently used one to tow a despite paying sharply higher fuel taxes than americans europeans are driving faster heavier more powerful automobiles than they did in the past suv sales are rising in europe and amid growing price competition from asian auto makers buyers are demanding vehicles with weight adding features such as air conditioning that trend is jeopardizing europes green credentials and undermining its pledge under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to below levels by although the eu has cut overall greenhouse gas emissions by nearly since co emissions from cars and commercial trucks in europe have risen more than offsetting much of the savings in other sectors according to the u s government emissions of greenhouse gases have increased by in the u s since the auto industrys inability to cut co emissions in europe fast enough is putting it on a collision course with regulators next week the european commission is expected to consider a proposal to impose new co regulations that some experts say could raise the retail price of a new car in europe by euros about &# on average a blow to europes beleaguered car makers and a departure from the eus traditional reliance on voluntary efforts by auto makers any regulations would likely also apply to u s and asian car makers the dispute in brussels over how to reduce auto emissions is taking shape amid a global debate over how to cut emissions of greenhouse gases it coincides with a spate of warnings that have renewed public attention to climate change including the collapse of an ice shelf near the north pole and the bush administrations recent proposal to classify the polar bear as a threatened species amid concerns about melting ice in the u s where the bush administration doesnt treat co as a pollutant as europe does the newly democrat controlled congress is putting climate change high on its agenda the supreme court is weighing whether the environmental protection agency has the authority to regulate car makers co emissions california and some other states meanwhile are moving forward with their own plans to reduce co emissions from cars in brussels the next step could well be mandatory cuts intended to reduce average co emissions from new cars by more than from current levels to grams per kilometer over three to six years for auto makers that proposition bound to entail investments in fuel saving technologies and reductions in sales of their biggest most profitable vehicles comes at a time when europes auto market is racked by intense price competition weak demand and underutilized factories "you cant sustain this industry and millions of jobs if you say by grams is the regulated result " says daimlerchrysler ag chief executive dieter zetsche any effort to impose co regulations is likely to generate fierce resistance particularly in germany one out of seven jobs in europes largest economy depends on the auto industry german manufacturers including daimlerchryslers mercedes unit bmw ag porsche ag and volkswagen ags audi brand are particularly vulnerable because their lines are thick with vehicles that have heavy engines and churn out relatively high co levels to reduce co emissions as quickly as some eu officials would like sales of some of the heaviest most profitable vehicles would have to fall by a step that would cost bmw roughly &# million a year according to a recent analysis by citigroup inc thats more than bmws net profit in the third quarter of research by experts hired by the european commission indicates the price of a new car in europe would rise on average about &# if the industry is required to reduce average co emissions from new cars to grams per kilometer by environmentalists say those costs would be more than offset through savings at the pump from improved fuel economy since the european commission has relied on an industry pledge to cut average co emissions from new cars by from levels by next year at the time european commission officials said a voluntary approach would give companies flexibility to achieve the target in the most cost effective way but several trends have slowed auto makers progress with customers demanding more features and performance the average weight of new cars in europe has risen nearly since while average horsepower has grown by nearly a third sales of suvs which typically consume more fuel and thus emit more co than small cars are up they account for roughly of new sales in europe and are projected to grow to more than by the end of the decade versus less than in in the u s suvs account for roughly a quarter of automobile sales the bottom line the industry risks falling short of its pledge a recent study commissioned by the european federation for transport and environment found three quarters of all car brands in europe have failed to improve their fleets fuel economy at the rate needed to meet next years target "were not on track its absolutely necessary we have binding regulations " says pieter van geel the netherlands state secretary for housing spatial planning and the environment in theory cutting a cars co emissions is as easy as improving a vehicles consumption of fossil fuel but in an echo of long running debates in washington over promoting fuel economy auto makers in europe are warning of trade offs between safety and the environment industry officials complain new eu safety rules have made it harder to reduce co by adding weight to cars and making them less aerodynamic among the most ballyhooed changes is a eu rule that seeks to reduce pedestrian deaths and injuries by setting minimum heights between car hoods and engines the rule is intended to soften the impact when a pedestrians head hits the hood of the car it forces manufacturers to leave more "crumple room" in designs industry officials say the rule undermines fuel economy by encouraging them to install features that add weight such as collision sensors some environmentalists and safety experts say the industry is exaggerating the weight impact of safety rules and that weight increases have been driven more by comfort features europes gasoline taxes havent been enough to deter customers from heavier more powerful vehicles although a gallon of gas in europe costs more than &# compared with &# in the u s as of last month the cost of owning and maintaining a car in europe has been falling for years thanks to better designed engines and the growing percentage of cars that run on diesel which tend to be more efficient than those that run on gasoline another reason europes auto makers are having trouble cutting emissions competition asian rivals like toyota motor corp now account for more than of new car sales in the region compared with in the competition is leading to deals on features that add weight such as air conditioning and navigation systems nearly of new cars sold in western europe now come with air conditioning compared with in many car makers also are rushing to add suvs to their lines including companies better known for small cars or sporty sedans such as volkswagen and renault sa "it is so nice and big and i sit up high " ingrid fischer a year old mother of two in kamp lintfort germany says of her mercedes m class suv she says she doesnt dwell on the m classs co output grams per kilometer compared with the average of for new cars made by european manufacturers the dilemma facing european policy makers stems from a deal with the european automobile manufacturers association which includes general motors corp and ford motor co the group agreed to reduce average co emissions from new cars by by compared with average emissions of new cars sold in a year later eu regulators negotiated a similar accord with japanese and korean auto makers to cut their co emissions car makers accelerated production of small cars promoting its lupo introduced in volkswagen staged a cross continental journey billed as the most fuel efficient road trip in history but in a few years sales of europes smallest cars weakened falling to million units in from million in although demand for europes smallest cars has begun to pick up recently sales remain well below the highs achieved in the late s "the trends went against us " says wilfried bockelmann former director of technical development at volkswagen the lupo derived much of its fuel savings from lightweight but costly materials such as aluminum that drove its price to more than euros "it was a great car but too expensive " says olaf brey a volkswagen dealer in berlin volkswagen stopped producing it in as sales of the smallest models cooled demand for suvs roared in london the mayor derided suv drivers as "idiots " traffic congestion there has grown so prevalent that the city in set a daily fee of gbp pounds &# for drivers entering the citys heart but for many europeans particularly older customers the shift to bigger more spacious vehicles seemed only natural "the seats of all the cars i had so far are much too low for me and this made it difficult for me to get in and out with my aching back " says rainer haase a year old retiree in berlin who replaced his year old bmw series sedan with a toyota rav suv the industrys rate of co reductions is threatening to complicate the pro business agenda of mr barroso the european commission president and a former portuguese prime minister since taking office in mr barroso has pledged to reduce the regulatory burden on business often seen as one of europes economic drawbacks but some say the continents experience with car makers shows the need for more government involvement not less "considering the failure of the voluntary agreement it seems the european commission will have to legislate " says patrick coroller of frances agence de lenvironnement et de la maitrise de lenergie mr barroso through a spokesman declined to be interviewed for this article in written response to questions he said "not enough progress has been made by european car manufacturers" and "we will therefore set a series of options on how to ensure that the targets are met " as for his own choice of vehicle mr barroso added "product choices are up to individuals according to their personal needs and preferences it is against the european concept of a free society to micromanage peoples choices according to one model of supposedly correct behavior decreed by self appointed moral authorities " one idea gaining ground among regulators is an emissions trading system in which companies would get credits for producing cars with low co levels they could then sell the credits to other companies such a system would benefit makers that specialize in small cars and possibly force others to reduce the weight of their vehicles or pay extra for the right to churn out vehicles with high co levels the auto industry meanwhile is prodding eu officials to promote clean burning fuels that emit less co than gasoline possibly through a europe wide tax scheme based on a fuels carbon content "it doesnt make sense to look at just the car " says daimlerchryslers mr zetsche forging consensus on taxes across the eu wont be easy some members are already crafting their own tax schemes to cut co a development that frightens the industry almut schoenfeld in berlin and john
