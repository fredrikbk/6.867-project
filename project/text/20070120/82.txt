the weekend interview with joseph lieberman unbowed washington the war in iraq brings to joe liebermans mind an old mark twain story "when a cat jumps on a hot stove the cat never jumps on the stove again because the cat always assumes the stove is hot " says the senator from connecticut "but we are smarter than that ok so vietnam didnt work out but there are times when youve got to use force to protect your security and to protect your principles " try telling that to the nuisance of congressional felines now prowling around the iraq debate eyeing it like a cooker on high boil next week will witness a senate vote on a resolution condemning president bushs new plan to quell growing sectarian violence and terrorism in iraq by increasing the number of troops while that vote may be largely symbolic it comes amid far more ominous congressional calls to cut off war funding to leave the iraqis to settle their differences to bring the troops home if ever the iraq political debate was at a crossroads its now at the center of this fray is sen lieberman a sort of horatio at the congressional bridge spiritedly trying to hold back a bipartisan stampede out of iraq that he believes will result in devastating consequences for that country the region and most importantly u s national security "iraq is the central part of a larger and ultimately longer term conflict in the middle east between moderates and extremists between democrats and dictators between iran and iraq sponsored terrorism and the rest of the middle east are we going to surrender to them surrender that country to them and encourage people like them to be in authority and power all over the middle east and in a better position to strike us again " asks mr lieberman if only livy had his quill today these are blunt words and quite a few more flow from mr lieberman throughout a lively interview in his office this past week a born gentleman he refrains from lobbing any pot shots at opponents but he made clear that he felt washington had been ducking an honest debate about the war and the consequences of abandoning it hiding instead behind "cosmetic" resolutions and rhetoric four years into the conflict mr lieberman thinks there is value in remembering again why it is were in iraq this is well trod ground for a man who supported not just the first gulf war but sponsored the iraq liberation act that aimed to topple the regime in "we did something that was right and courageous which was to overthrow saddam hussein " says mr lieberman "he was a genocidal dictator he tried to assassinate a former american president he used chemical weapons on his own people he was a hater of the united states " saddam was a danger not to mention a barrier to creating a democratic middle east that ceases to be a threat to the u s this is why the senator remains unmoved today by those colleagues who have abandoned the cause lamenting that they were "deceived" about the existence of wmd or that they have "lost confidence in the leadership of the president " says mr lieberman "if you still think not only that the original purpose of going in was right but that how it ends will have a significant effect on american security for a generation or more to come then you dont back away " and that he says counts even in the face of faltering public opinion "i think we are elected to lead americans are understandably responding to the carnage they see on tv every night and what we have to urge them is not to surrender to the people who are causing that carnage " mr lieberman who returned from his latest visit to iraq in december freely acknowledges what he believes were "the series of mistakes that were made after saddam hussein was overthrown " from the disbanding of the iraqi army to our reluctance to send more troops something he has advocated since the fall of still "we were getting to a point where we were making some significant progress and it is important not to overlook this there were three elections held those were a powerful demonstration of what no one is able to deny even those who now want to turn away and give up on iraq which is that the majority of the iraqi people want a better life for themselves and their families the majority is not involved in sectarian violence and clearly not involved in terrorism " there are still hopeful signs he says his recent trip included a stop in ramadi in anbar province an area thick with terrorist operatives where the senator saw evidence that "weve turned the tribal leaders to our side against al qaeda " mr lieberman also felt from his discussions around the country that there were strong signs a "moderate multiethnic coalition" was coming together among political leaders who would support prime minister nouri al maliki in a renewed push to restore order "this thing is still winnable " says mr lieberman "and it is critical that we take advantage of this opportunity to win " which gets to president bushs proposal for more troops a plan mr lieberman enthusiastically endorses "the people in congress and the public were quite right in saying the presidents got to come up with a different approach and he did its better than any other plan ive seen because it holds the hope of success most of the other plans are effectively just giving up and walking away " are additional troops really enough "i wish it was more truthfully " he answers throwing his own wish of or even "but i believe it is adequate what i hope is that it is implemented quickly " the troops will be vital to quelling what mr lieberman sees as several very different conflicts currently raging in iraq in baghdad more u s soldiers will bolster more iraqi forces who aim to hold neighborhoods wracked by violence between local shiites and sunnis in anbar they will hunt down al qaeda more troops says mr lieberman will also provide the opportunity "to change the dynamic" in the wider war on terrorism by sending a message to iran and others that the u s will not abandon the regions moderates who are struggling to create a new democratic order and what of those americans looking for some guarantee this will succeed "none of us can be certain the presidents plan is going to work all the choices we have in iraq right now are difficult but by far the one that is the worst and would have disastrous consequences is to pick up and leave in small steps or in one large step for all the reasons we know " he replies emphatically he also wants to speak beyond the proposal itself to its author "i have admiration for the president because i believe he gets it he understands the challenge of our time which is from islamic extremism and he knows what hes doing is not popular but hes doing it because he thinks it is right for the country " so what does that say about mr liebermans senate brethren those who now want to turn tail for rome abandoning horatio and his damned bridge to the enemy what i ask accounts for the growing numbers of senators including republicans such as nebraskas chuck hagel maines olympia snowe oregons gordon smith who could well provide the decisive votes to undermine their own president in a time of war mr lieberman offers a few half hearted dare i say gentlemanly explanations for the senates frigid feet some feel let down because the wmds were never found others are "affected in a political context by the loss of public support " but he ends up back at a baser truth conceding that "some people i just think have been partisan about this and that to me is the worst reason " mr lieberman is also frustrated that those supporting the resolution are dodging the tough questions "the resolution that is being talked about in one sense id say it is offensive because it is only cosmetic it wont affect the implementation of a new plan to succeed to win in iraq but at the same time it will send a mixed message to those who are fighting for us in iraq and those who are fighting against us in iraq it will be a very graphic example that we are divided " but what can mr lieberman president bush and others do to stave off such a capitulation for starters he responds his side needs to make sure the naysayers arent allowed to just criticize "part of the case would be look if you are really against the war and you are really against what the president is proposing have the nerve to do what congress under the constitution is authorized to do move to cut off the funding and then lets have a real head to head debate " critics of the presidents approach might also be made to put forward an alternative and justify their proposals beyond some vague notion that this must all be solved by the iraqi parliament which mr lieberman explains isnt so much a solution as wish fulfillment "there is an attempt by some of my colleagues here to say that it is wrong to think a military victory is possible and in the end this requires a political solution among iraqis well of course it does but as president bush said and as i believe you cant have a political solution you cant have economic growth unless you first have security thats key securitys basic " the other alternative of course is to simply admit defeat some in congress are working up the courage to say as much and to further suggest that abandoning iraq wouldnt be all that bad "people say this is just like vietnam we could leave and that would be that that wont be that were in a war which has it origins in this part of the world in the middle east in the conflict within islam if we pull out and essentially surrender to the extremists and terrorists they are naturally going to follow us right back to our shores "if we leave the place collapses and its more than civil war its ethnic cleansing the iranians come in and dominate a good chunk of the country al qaeda takes over a good part and uses it as a base the kurds can sustain themselves but it gets very ominous and then the same group of people who attacked us on they achieve a victory and they will use that victory to strike at us again " speaking of the threat posed by iran mr lieberman has been equally unimpressed by the u s s lack of resolve "im troubled by this reflex reaction to talk with iran were a strong enough country when it seems productive we shouldnt hesitate to talk to anybody but we ought to talk when it is in our interest not theirs and right now it is only in irans interest " he says hes been encouraged by the administrations tougher stance in recent weeks and in particular president bushs decision to move another carrier battle group to the gulf region "which sends a message to iran " mr lieberman also notes that "we know that some of our american soldiers are being killed by sophisticated ieds from iran the evidence is just closed clear compelling i cant believe the concern expressed by some of my colleagues here about whether we have a right to take prisoner iranians who we conclude are either supplying weapons to iraqis who are using them to kill american troops or training them to kill american troops " as for the rest of the world community "theyre in denial " what is remarkable i think toward the end of our conversation is how spry and feisty the senator looks he did after all just come off a draining year fighting a bitter battle against his own party for his political life mr lieberman is now officially an "independent " yet he takes care to describe himself as an "independent democrat " why identify with a party that is so uniformly opposed to him on an issue so dear to his heart he admits he frets that foreign policy is the "achilles heel" of his political side and that "unless the democratic party can prove to the people that as a party it is not either pacifist or isolationist but is willing to stand up and protect the security of the american people then were going to have trouble electing a president " his own democratic heroes are truman and kennedy "the kennedy inaugural was the single speech that brought me into public life those famous words pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty thats what it has meant to me to be a democrat " horatios challenge now is to convince his party and more than a few republicans to also remember just who they are
