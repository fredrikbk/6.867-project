executives get bonuses as firms reprice options aim is to offset losses as backdating is fixed mr deasons windfall the stock options backdating scandal has prompted dozens of companies to fire top executives take charges totaling billions of dollars against earnings and tell shareholders that they misrepresented how options were awarded now a number of companies are taking one more step making special payments to executives or directors who received backdated options companies say the payments will compensate executives and directors who werent involved in options wrongdoing yet saw their potential profit reduced when their options were adjusted to reflect the actual dates they were issued several of the companies describe the payments as bonuses in regulatory filings but the practice has given critics more fodder for attacks on ballooning executive pay levels and special perks federal authorities are scrutinizing the options practices of nearly companies and scores more companies are conducting internal reviews a stock option typically gives its holder the right to buy a set amount of stock at some future time at its price at the time the option was granted the idea is to give recipients an incentive to help boost the companys share price but a number of companies and executives changed the date on their grants to make them appear they had been granted at a time when the price was even lower making them worth more to their holders many companies that have acknowledged options dating troubles are adopting the position that misdated options particularly those granted to top executives should be fixed without taking more out of shareholders pockets for instance sehat sutardja chief executive officer of microchip maker marvell technology group ltd recently reimbursed his employer &# for wrongly dated stock options he already had cashed in he also agreed to forgo another &# million from the value of options he still holds but some companies are taking another course at kla tencor corp for instance chief executive richard wallace is in line for an options related "special cash bonus " according to a securities filing the semiconductor equipment maker is adjusting some of mr wallaces options to carry the share prices that correspond to the dates the options were awarded rather than the wrong ones achieved through backdating the adjustments shaved &# from the value of those grants according to the filing mr wallace will have that amount paid to him in cash in effect mr wallace may come out ahead now that backdating has been exposed since he is swapping unrealized potential profit which could evaporate if kla tencor shares fall for cash by keeping the repriced options he retains the chance to profit from them if shares rise higher in most cases the companies making the payments say the executives in question arent the ones responsible for the options troubles kla tencor has said in filings that mr wallace a year company veteran who became ceo last year had "no involvement" in the improper options granting which it says occurred primarily from july through june a period when mr wallace was a lower level executive kla tencor has said it intends to cancel improper options held by former ceo kenneth schroeder and it will reprice without compensatory payment improper options held by ken levy its former chairman mr schroeder a longtime executive who had taken an advisory role was fired and mr levy left in the wake of kla tencor backdating revelations last year a kla tencor spokeswoman kyra whitten says the bonuses are being paid to mr wallace and two other officials because the company doesnt want employees not involved with the options trouble to be "adversely impacted " she said the company hasnt yet decided how it will treat backdated options held by nonexecutive employees with readjusted prices most of mr wallaces options are still "in the money" meaning their price is below the current market price but a portion arent meaning they wouldnt be profitable if cashed out kla tencor will pay mr wallace &# for that portion according to the companys securities filings meaning mr wallace will be making money from so called underwater options that otherwise wouldnt yield profit for him at all the payment is due in january the bonuses dont sit well with shareholder activists "to do this in the context of the outrage over the practice of backdating is just shocking " says ann yerger the executive director of the council of institutional investors who said she was stunned when informed of the payments "it is a sign that something remains rotten in corporate america with regard to executive pay " brian foley a compensation consultant in white plains n y says "it seems to me that it reimbursement would really stick in ones craw if it goes to the ceo cfo general counsel or anyone who was in the know or should have been in the know " mr foley adds that the cash payments are "awkward " since it means people get paid for options they havent yet and might never exercise at affiliated computer services inc a dallas outsourcer that last year ousted two top executives because of extensive backdating several of those who remain are in line for special bonuses to compensate them for the loss of value on their wrongly dated grants at the top of the list chairman darwin deason who was head of the companys compensation committee and ceo for much of time when backdating occurred mr deason who founded acs and holds more than &# million of company stock will get a payment of &# according to an acs securities filing michael buckley a spokesman for acs said mr deason isnt being treated differently than any other employee another acs executive thomas burlin will get just over &# thanks to the repricing of a misdated option grant that is presently out of the money mr burlins options arent worth anything at acss current stock price meanwhile fossil inc has said seven officers of the clothing and accessories maker could be up for a "cash bonus" if their options were repriced and microchip maker broadcom corp said a top sales executive may be up for a "special" payment of &# next january to compensate him for lost option value top executives of sonus networks inc a massachusetts based telecommunications equipment maker also may have a payday coming the company has said it likely will reprice wrongly dated options though it hasnt yet done so sonus says in a filing that upon repricing it intends to pay certain executives and directors for any lost value sonuss chairman and ceo hassan ahmed has some four million options covered by the payout agreement including one grant of shares that is deeply under water it now carries a grant date of april with an exercise price of &# the stock was near a sharp low on that date meaning a new price from a date even couple of days later would shrink mr ahmeds potential profit if the option is repriced to april for example the exercise price would change to &# and mr ahmed would be in line for a special payment of &# million for an option that is otherwise very far from being profitable sonus shares currently trade at &# "all this really is is acknowledging a previous commitment" to grant an option at the originally agreed price said charlie gray sonuss general counsel he said sonus hasnt determined whether the april grant carried an incorrect price and he added that the company might seek to renegotiate the payment agreement in cases where the grant is well out of the money he said sonuss audit committee examined the granting practices and concluded that no current member of management including mr ahmed did anything wrong the recent disclosures about the repricings come in large part thanks to a provision of section a of the federal tax code section a slaps a excise tax along with other penalties on certain "discount" stock options whose exercise price is below the level of the stock on the day the option was granted options backdated to a day with a low price are a type of discount option by agreeing to reprice the options an executive is saved from the big tax bill executives who already have exercised backdated options may have to pay a penalty tax but at least one company j global communications inc a los angeles seller of telecom services is relieving that burden in a filing the company says it "anticipates resolving the matter directly with the internal revenue service on behalf of all such holders including making any payments that are required " in addition to paying its executives taxes j global also is offering a "compensating payment" to several because of repriced options the company says in its filing that it had used "incorrect measurement dates" for some options but that "no willful backdating took place " the bulk of companies that have admitted to options problems arent being nearly so generous every director and executive officer of chip maker actel corp of mountain view calif for instance will have wrongly dated options repriced with no reimbursement stephen hemsley who replaced william mcguire as ceo of unitedhealth group inc after dr mcguires options fueled ouster is surrendering about &# million in value though the minnetonka minn insurer said it believes mr hemsley did nothing wrong dr mcguire is forfeiting &# million boston communications group inc of bedford mass said in a filing that current or former executives or directors are surrendering outright a total of more than wrongly dated options without compensation
