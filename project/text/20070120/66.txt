pursuits sports golf journal tough luck in the rough like no other athletes golfers are at the mercy of fickle chance the next time you come off the th green and have to pull out your wallet to pay off the bet you just lost tell yourself this maybe just maybe you were unlucky in golf luck is arguably a bigger factor than in any other sport and it always seems to be bad the rule book rather sadistically calls it "a rub of the green " consider payne stewart who lost the u s open with a drive in the fairway that found a divot hole he made bogey lee janzen who won by a single stroke that year had given up looking for a wayward drive in the final round and was heading back to the teeing area only to have his ball decide at that moment to fall out of a tree a minute later and it wouldnt have mattered it had to happen right then and it did mr janzen made par on the hole and won his second open luck plays a part in all sports of course but while say the nba plays where the sun cant be in your eyes and the only wind is from air conditioners that keep the temperature constant at or so golf serves at the whim of the weather a whim that doesnt affect all players equally a wind that blows in the morning can lay down for the afternoon tee times making the golf course a completely different test in the early rounds of a tournament players are often switched from an early tee time to a late one the next day an effort to even up any weather edge but there are no guarantees that the wind and weather wont act in reverse the following day in football when a team goes out of bounds the ball is wiped clean and brought back near the middle of the field for the next play after a foul ball in baseball a perfect new ball is tossed out to the pitcher who can even reject it and demand another if it isnt perfect enough not so in golf sam snead once said he told ted williams that golf was harder than baseball "because weve got to play all our foul balls " unless theyre lost or out of bounds then theres a stroke and distance penalty in the rough a tree can block your way or not oh and if you are off the green and a sprinkler head is on the line you want to play tough six inches left or right would have been great but you have to play the ball as it lies thats one of the basic tenets of golf which is why there is little wonder a golfer can shoot on one day the next then there are strange lies you cant practice for on a driving range mat rocks in ponds that bounce balls on to the green or not even flagsticks that can take an almost perfectly struck shot and send it flying hither and yon ive seen a ball hit from more than yards away apparently about to bury under the lip of a bunker instead hit the handle of a rake casually placed inside the bunker and bound yards farther toward the hole i know a man who had a hole in one off an out of bounds fence my best chance for an ace rolled to the lip but didnt drop it had rained hard that morning so the staff hadnt been able to mow the green that day luck has become a hot topic throughout sports in recent years from baseballs influential "sabremetricians" to efforts in football soccer and beyond but several statisticians i talked with laughed softly and wished me "good luck" in figuring out how to determine why golfers are good one day and bad the next taking a different view is stephen m stigler a statistics professor at the university of chicago with his daughter margaret he has been studying luck in golf since greg normans final round disaster at the masters in applying an algorithm to tournament scores he says theyve found that luck has a large impact on players that is remarkably consistent across tournaments and sexes and plan to publish their findings in the next several months first mentioned in the royal &amp ancient code the role of luck still appears in rule "if a ball in motion is accidentally deflected or stopped by any outside agency it is a rub of the green " so phil mickelsons bouncing his tee shot off the hospitality tent on the nd hole at last years u s open was a rub of the green others have used more colorful though unprintable words of a sport often played on sunday mornings writer henry longhurst once said "if you call on god to improve the results of a shot while it is still in motion you are using an outside agency and subject to appropriate penalties under the rules of golf " the phrase "rub of the green" likely comes from lawn bowling where th century records use the word rub to refer to a deflection of a ball by the uneven bowling green according to "the rules of the green" by kenneth g chapman a usga rules official notes however that if the phrase werent in the book the rules wouldnt change a bit so why keep it in the sacred script "many consider it to be a term of art worth retaining for traditional purposes " so how should golfers treat luck both good and bad when it happens to them dont be paranoid or solipsistic gio valiante a mental game consultant and author says golfers "must separate what is controllable and what is not controllable " weather and bounces both good and bad are definitely not dr valiante who wrote the book "fearless golf " said golfers must "expect the best but prepare for everything " when it seems that all the bounces are going your opponents way remind yourself that golf is a "fair game" and over many rounds of golf the bounces do even out for what most of us call luck dr valiante uses the more mathematical neutral term of probability in other words the golf gods arent always against you really but this time pay up pal john paul newport is off this week email golfjournal wsj com
