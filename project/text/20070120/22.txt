fatal exemption the journal of the american medical association jama recently published a study that received little attention from the press and as a consequence from the public the study examined the incidence of whooping cough pertussis in children whose parents had chosen not to vaccinate them the results were concerning vaccines are recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and professional societies such as the american academy of pediatrics but these organizations cant enforce their recommendations only states can do that usually when children enter day care centers and elementary schools in the form of mandates state vaccine mandates have been on the books since the early s but they werent aggressively enforced until much later as a consequence of tragedy in the first measles vaccine was introduced in the united states measles is a highly contagious disease that can infect the lungs causing fatal pneumonia or the brain causing encephalitis before the vaccine measles caused american children to be hospitalized and to die every year in the early s public health officials found that states with vaccine mandates had rates of measles that were lower than states without mandates as a consequence all states worked toward requiring children to get vaccines now every state has some form of vaccine mandates but not all children are subject to these mandates all states have medical exemptions to vaccines such as a serious allergy to a vaccine component some states also have religious exemptions amish groups for example traditionally reject vaccines believing that clean living and a healthy diet are all that are needed to avoid vaccine preventable diseases and states have philosophical exemptions in some states these exemptions are easy to obtain by simply signing your name to a form and in others theyre much harder requiring notarization annual renewal a signature from a local health official or a personally written letter from a parent the jama study examined the relationship between vaccine exemptions and rates of disease the authors found that between and the percentage of children whose parents had chosen to exempt them from vaccines increased by per year resulting in a fold increase this increase occurred almost solely in states where philosophical exemptions were easy to obtain worse states with easy to obtain philosophical exemptions had twice as many children suffering from pertussis a disease that causes inflammation of the windpipe and breathing tubes pneumonia and in about infants every year death than states with hard to obtain philosophical exemptions the finding that lower immunization rates caused higher rates of disease shouldnt be surprising in a massive epidemic of measles in philadelphia centered on a group that chose not to immunize its children as a consequence nine children died from measles in the late s severe outbreaks of pertussis occurred in colorado and washington among children whose parents feared pertussis vaccine and in a year old unvaccinated girl unknowingly having brought measles with her from romania attended a church gathering of people in indiana and caused the largest outbreak of measles in the u s in years an outbreak limited to children whose parents had chosen not to vaccinate them these events showed that for contagious diseases like measles and pertussis its hard for unvaccinated children to successfully hide among herds of vaccinated children some would argue that philosophical exemptions are a necessary pop off valve for a society that requires children to be injected with biological agents for the common good but as anti vaccine activists continue to push more states to allow for easy philosophical exemptions more and more children will suffer and occasionally die from vaccine preventable diseases when it comes to issues of public health and safety we invariably have laws many of these laws are strictly enforced and immutable we dont allow philosophical exemptions to restraining young children in car seats to smoking in restaurants or to stopping at stop signs and the notion of requiring vaccines for school entry while it seems to tear at the very heart of a country founded on the basis of individual rights and freedoms saves lives given the increasing number of states allowing philosophical exemptions to vaccines at some point we will to be forced to decide whether it is our inalienable right to catch and transmit potentially fatal infections dr offit is chief of the division of infectious diseases at the childrens hospital of philadelphia see related letter "letters to the editor vaccines and individual rights" wsj jan
