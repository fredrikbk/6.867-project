pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece elegant mystery that romes pantheon eludes historical certitudes adds to its enduring magnetism anatomy of a classic it is a common enough occurrence in rome to stumble upon the sublime without warning or fanfare just around the corner from every designer shoe store it seems there is a bernini or an unassuming church housing a caravaggio or a streetscape that echoes an ancient civic perfection yet even amid the visual excellence the pantheon stands out here is a structure so mathematically elegant and imposing that to enter it is to experience a sense of ultimate arrival and so inscrutable that its origins are still the subject of arcane debate just a few weeks ago a conference organized by the institute of archaeology and the karman center for advanced studies in the humanities in bern switzerland devoted itself to sorting out the pantheons history breaking news of a kind caused an "absolute sensation" in a manner perhaps possible only at an academic conference a revisionist case was made on the basis of ancient brick stamps and counter to conventional wisdom that the pantheon was erected under trajan and not the emperor hadrian who some now believe may merely have completed the dome and portico the new thesis if it stands up to scrutiny would lay waste to certain romantic ideas about the pantheon as the legacy of a refined ruler relatively nonviolent for his times bernd kulawik a scholar at the karman center notes that the new findings aired by his colleague lise hetland and others could present an awkward philosophical adjustment for some "the pantheon as an imperial building fits so well in the image of hadrian as a peaceful philhellenic emperor " he says trajan after all was a "war emperor who had a giant column tower erected in his forum decorated with his successes as a military leader " katherine welch professor of art history at nyus institute of fine arts is skeptical of any projection of an emperors personality onto the pantheon and notes that hadrian too was a warrior and that the bricks in question may simply have been a few years old "the pantheon is really about the imperial cult the worship of the emperor and his family " either way the fact that the pantheon eludes forensic certainties adds to its magnetism and our feeling of relative insignificance is reinforced not only by its soaring and sensuously curved interior but also by the knowledge that in nearly years we havent improved much upon the architectural vision of its creators the dome is the largest that survives from antiquity and was the largest dome in western europe until the duomo in florence was completed in rising to feet it is still the most immense unreinforced concrete dome on earth there is no evidence of brick arch support in its upper portions and its exact method of construction has never been fully determined we do know that the materials used were made progressively lighter toward the top where the foot oculus or "eye " remains open to the elements most archaeologists believe that the architect was apollodorus from damascus we know that he worked for hadrian and that he was imprisoned some say killed for his criticism of hadrians own efforts as an architect textbooks have it that agrippa built the first pantheon in b c as a t shaped structure with a pitched timber roof the original inscription on the portico which was later added to the facade of the rebuilt pantheon reads "m agrippa l f cos tertium fecit " or roughly "marcus agrippa son of lucius during his third consulate built this " agrippas pantheon was destroyed in a fire rebuilt by domitian it was struck by lightning and burned yet again in a d until the brick stamp assertions in bern the standing pantheon was dated at about during the reign of hadrian who it is believed intended this temple to the gods as a sort of ecumenical gesture to the citizenry hadrian the adopted son of trajan was a widely traveled aesthete warrior reputed to have a taste for married women teenage boys and all aspects of greek culture the classicist marguerite yourcenar in her "memoirs of hadrian " channeled the rulers passion for architecture with these feverish words "these walls which i reinforce are still warm from contact with vanished bodies hands yet unborn will caress the shafts of these columns " hands in their multitudes do still caress the marble inside the pantheon visitors are free to enter any time except during church functions such as weddings and special masses and by afternoon on most days the place is frustratingly packed although pope boniface iv oversaw its consecration as a church in the pantheon is now more a temple of tourism than a house of worship as well as a handy landmark for lost sightseers but not even the crowded square and the throngs of visitors who mill about inside can diminish its mystery and heft the rotundas internal geometry forms an almost perfect sphere both its height and diameter measuring feet the circular opening at the top a great window to the sky is its only source of illumination and the sunlight reveals orange and purple veins in the marble interior despite the dizzying height of the coffered dome one feels enveloped in a space of human scale when it rains the floor is soaked and then drains off just as it would have centuries ago michelangelo proclaimed the pantheon to be "of angelic and not human design " goethe was "overwhelmed with admiration" for the site both men may have been struck as we are by the apparent force of the ancients regard for the gods why else would they have undertaken a project of such heroic ambition building practices of the day probably involved hand mixing wet lime and volcanic ash and carrying the mixture to the job site in baskets the pantheons columns had to be quarried in egypt dragged on wooden sledges to the nile taken to alexandria by barge shipped to a roman port and then barged again up the tiber many scholars do believe that the original and extant pantheons had some kind of religious meaning but the details are left tantalizingly to our imaginations perhaps we should surmise not that the ancients devotion to the gods was limitless but that the emperors self regard knew no bounds and that this sacred seeming place may in fact have been a rulers tribute to his own imperial self we arent even sure which emperor to credit and architects today arent entirely certain why the dome hasnt collapsed nor have they cracked the sublime math of the pantheons architect the pantheons interior subject to ever shifting light and shadow is an apt metaphor for all we dont know about the building and of the ancients who conceived it ms finnerty writes about culture for the journal
