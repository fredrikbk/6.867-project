pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies the best films you havent seen to find the gems look somewhere between the mainstream and the completely obscure a friend at least i thought she was a friend recently emailed me a link to an arts blog in a british newspaper the guardian the headline was "great unseen films of " followed by "are the mainstream movies that dominate the upcoming awards season really the best movies of the year " her comment which struck me as terse was "i am in agreement with the ideas laid out in this article " not just terse but tacitly hostile since one of the ideas is that the present state of film criticism is just as grim as the state of mainstream movies film critics the blogger writes "have to review every piece of commercial trash that hollywood though not exclusively throws up into their laps every week " it isnt clear what he means by "though not exclusively " but hes an exclusive kind of guy the six films he names as last years greats turn out to be unseen by british audiences because they were also unreleased fortunately i dont have to review every piece of trash thats thrown at me every week theres no need for it and no space for it a perfect situation whats more hollywoods studio executives who know pieces of trash when they make them are increasingly disinclined to expose the dregs of their dregs to critics friday for instance the only movie opening wide on thousands of screens was a horror film a remake of a remake called "the hitcher" and the only screening was thursday night too late for newspaper deadlines i took this to be an act of mercy even though it wasnt meant to be and as i write this at midweek i have no doubt that the studios reward will be the top slot at the weekend box office seen films however abysmal enjoy a certain advantage over unseen films however splendid they may be any sensible movie lover on the other hand would agree with one idea the guardian blogger was flogging the dominant mainstream movies of the awards season are probably not the best of the year yet obscurity doesnt guarantee quality either if youre searching for the good stuff the place to look is between the categories of seen and unseen a remarkable number of fine films along with some great ones lie in the limbo of underseen and far from being unsung theyre doing very well when it comes to amassing awards from critics take the case of "the last king of scotland " which is dominated by forest whitakers performance mr whitaker has already been named best actor by the national society of film critics the new york film critics the los angeles film critics in a tie with sacha baron cohen and at this past weeks golden globes by the hollywood foreign press association until now however his worthy vehicle remains severely underseen varietys domestic top list for puts it at number with a gross of &# or less than of that earned by the years top grosser "pirates of the caribbean dead mans chest " that may soon change of course as of yesterday fox searchlight has given the film a re release and a new ad campaign so too may prospects improve for other highly praised widely celebrated and thus far underseen features guillermo del toros gorgeous "pans labyrinth " which shared honors for the years best reviewed picture with "army of shadows " a hypnotic drama of the french resistance in world war ii unseen in this country until now that jean pierre melville directed in clint eastwoods brave piercingly clear minded "letters from iwo jima" which was voted best foreign film at the golden globes even though it was essentially an american production but cant qualify in that category for the oscars "the death of mr lazarescu " a romanian film about mortality and the health care system that sounds deadly until you find out how affecting it is "iraq in fragments" vividly informative no political axe to grind and not even present at the bottom of varietys top list and a beautiful belgian drama by the dardenne brothers "lenfant " whether those prospects actually will improve is another matter for independent idiosyncratic films are growing ever more underseen part of the problem the most familiar part one that dates back decades in american life is the supposed foreignness of foreign films though i must say i never feel quite as alien as when im watching some thick skulled super violent action adventure that was made in hollywood another part is the increasing cultural deafness induced at awards time every year by the beating of drums for the biggest most expensive productions plenty of good films are still being made being released and being honored but they must be sought out and not to put too fine a point on it seen morgensterns picks underseen pictures every underseen film presents its own mystery sometimes perfectly lovely films will perform imperfectly at the box office for reasons that become clear only years afterward if then and underseen films dont have to be foreign though it helps here are three american releases from the s insufficiently appreciated then as now loving this film was directed deftly and tactfully on a very small scale by irvin kershner who brought similar qualities to the epic production of "the empire strikes back " george segal is brooks wilson a prosperous happily married illustrator eva marie saint is selma wilson his loving wife and janis young is grace the woman he falls for out of what seems to be a clear blue sky don devlin adapted the novel by j m ryan the costumes were designed by albert wolsky and gordon willis who would bring such darkly burnished beauty to "the godfather " did the elegantly simple cinematography the ballad of cable hogue mention sam peckinpah today and people think violence the splatting bullets and spattering blood of "the wild bunch " peckinpah had a lyrical side though one that informed such earlier little gems as "ride the high country" and "the ballad of cable hogue " in the latter film jason robards is superb in the title role of a prospector and desert rat who nearly dies in the desert before discovering a freshwater spring and reinventing himself as an entrepreneur stella stevens is charming as a whore with a heart of gold that beats to the rhythm of ambition the seven per cent solution alan arkin recently the heroin snorting grandpa of "little miss sunshine " here plays sigmund freud who was known to have used cocaine nicol williamson is a coke addicted sherlock holmes who despite being a fictional character goes to freud for
