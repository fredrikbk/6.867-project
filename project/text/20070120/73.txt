should you buy your own city as the municipal bond market booms individual investors get new tools to level the playing field avoiding tax traps and murky pricing individual investors are increasingly trying to cash in on hospitals highways and bridges even the city sewer system municipal bonds those issued by states cities and other arms of government think water districts to fund improvements are a hot commodity the size of the market is at a record level totaling some &# trillion or roughly half the size of the entire market for u s government debt small investors are snapping up this debt open end municipal bond mutual funds ballooned in size to a record &# billion as of late last year the reason for the bonds popularity their tax free status which is appealing to the growing ranks of retiring baby boomers particularly wealthy ones in states with high taxes such as new york and california this special status means that their after tax yield often tops treasuries and other bonds a five year muni yielding would have an effective after tax yield of for an investor in the federal bracket by contrast the five year treasury note is currently yielding less than "if youre in an exceptionally high tax bracket municipals often make sense " says gary schatsky a new york financial adviser but in lower tax brackets they can be a bad deal dabbling in munis isnt for the novice it can be tough for all but the most sophisticated investors to spot a raw deal partly because brokers transaction fees are hidden in the price of the bonds making price comparisons difficult but in the past few years the playing field has started to level regulators are pushing for changes to make the pricing of bonds clearer the municipal securities rulemaking board a self regulatory organization created by congress is expected to propose new rules soon that will among other things make munis"official statements" the equivalent of a company prospectus available online discount brokerages are also expanding their businesses last fall fidelity investments for example began offering more types of municipal bonds as part of its effort to boost its online bond trading at the same time some states including ohio and illinois are starting to make it easier for individual investors to buy bonds when theyre first issued that tends to be a better deal for smaller investors than buying them later via a broker in november ohio issued &# million of municipal bonds distributed through a larger network of brokers and available for sale for longer than is customary in the industry traditionally brokerage firms might provide small investors with only a one day window to buy but with the recent ohio offering incapital llc a chicago investment bank that specializes in offering fixed income securities to individual investors marketed the offering to more than dealers for several days in order to reach more people that offering caught the attention of john procario a cincinnati resident who for the first time bought individual munis instead of municipal bond funds he said the bonds were convenient to buy as he was able to get them through fifth third securities inc a unit of fifth third bancorp the same financial institution where he also holds his bank accounts "the main reason for me are the tax benefits " says mr procario years old despite changes like these there are pitfalls for one thing big institutional investors like mutual funds still get better prices than do smaller investors and it remains tough to compare munis or sniff out brokers true intentions for instance whether they are pitching a particular muni because their firm is trying to unload a big inventory of them kevin olson executive director of municipalbonds com a web site that flags bad muni deals says unsophisticated investors can pay as much as a markup over what others pay thats the equivalent of squandering about a years interest on the bonds investment pros say buying munis directly generally makes sense for people with a sizable pot of money to invest say at least &# smaller investors might be better served with muni bond mutual funds thats because mutual funds provide more diversification than buying a single bond and also tend to get better deals when buying bonds the downside for individual investors is that mutual funds charge annual fees while buying munis directly requires them to pay only a one time fee the average annual cost is a year for a no load long term muni fund according to morningstar inc some low cost muni funds include vanguard long term tax exempt fund and the fidelity municipal income fund some investors like loading up on munis simply because they hate paying uncle sam new york wealth manager lew altfest recalls a "snooty well dressed" client who brushed him off when he advised that her low tax bracket meant she was wasting money investing in munis he recalls her reply "sir you dont understand i dont want to pay the government one red cent more than i have to " munis tax advantages may also be less potent for investors in low tax locales such as florida which doesnt have a state income tax another important tax issue before buying a muni fund or a particular individual bond investors should check to see whether the bonds are exempt from the alternative minimum tax which is designed to prevent well off individuals from completely ducking taxes in recent years the amt has applied to an increasing number of taxpayers interest on munis that fund private projects such as sports stadiums may not be exempt from the amt shopping around with several brokers is still important investment advisers say and haggling over the price is part of the game web sites such as municipalbonds com and investinginbonds com can provide free information on bond prices and other data that may give them more leverage investors should also look beyond munis price and yield and consider other details such as whether the bond is "callable " if a bond has a call provision the issuer can pay off the debt early often this happens when interest rates are dropping which means investors get their money back at a bad time for reinvesting it and while munis which have historical default rates of less than on investment grade bonds are generally safer than corporate bonds theyre not as safe as treasuries that means investors should check the bonds credit ratings and pay attention to how the bonds are backed many bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the state where theyre issued but others could be backed by hospitals or industrial development projects whose revenue sources could suddenly dry up says dan genter of rnc genter capital management a money manager in los angeles do munis make sense for you figuring whether a municipal bond is a smart investment requires some math take for example a five year muni with an annual yield of look up your tax bracket lets assume its the top federal bracket of subtract from that gives you divide into that yield that gives you the effective yield roughly by comparison the five year treasury note is currently yielding less than the lower your tax bracket the less the advantage of munis for a married couple in the federal tax bracket meaning together you make less than &# a year in taxable income munis arent so attractive that muni yield calculates into an effective after tax yield of thats roughly the same yield on a five year treasury note which is a safer credit risk than a municipal bond sources wsj research municipal market
