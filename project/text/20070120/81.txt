the week ahead our take on coming events state of the union the keys to bushs speech energy immigration and iran by gerald f seib president bushs last few state of the union addresses have run at about words each he delivers this years edition tuesday night and the white house suggests this one might be a bit shorter heres a way to cut through the verbiage even more listen especially closely for just three words energy immigration and iran this will be the presidents seventh state of the union address but he has never given one like this before it will be his first given to a congress controlled by democrats that doesnt change everything but it changes a lot mr bush will be trying to lay out an agenda when in fact he no longer is in control of washingtons agenda democrats in congress now have as much to say about what gets acted upon and what is ignored no longer will the president be able to compel congress to consider one of his ideas simply by saying so which was more or less within his power under republican control that argues for more focus on fewer items that have some actual chance of success and less focus on a wish list of items dear to the president but with little chance of bipartisan support so youll hear plenty about balancing the budget but more interesting is how energy and immigration come into play white house officials have been signaling that the president plans to aggressively pursue what everyone in washington euphemistically calls "energy independence " that means reducing americas need for foreign oil until now mr bushs focus has tended to be increasing domestic energy production and democrats has been decreasing energy use but both sides increasingly acknowledge that real energy independence requires both and also requires government action to push alternative fuels the twin threats of middle eastern upheaval and venezuelan animosity should provide plenty of incentive immigration may be the only issue where the change of power on capitol hill has brought congress closer to the president not farther away mr bushs view of immigration reform which includes creating a guest worker program that would allow foreign workers to be temporary and legal and put some of them on a path toward citizenship is a concept embraced more easily by democrats than by republicans these days mr bushs own republicans are much more focused on simply securing the border to prevent foreigners from arriving in the first place though the partys poor showing among hispanics in last falls election also may have many wondering how wise that position is politically take it all together and there may be room for common ground which leaves foreign policy iraq cant be ignored of course but mr bush said his piece on that in his recent address to the nation odds are he wants this time to prompt the congress and the country to start thinking beyond iraq to what he clearly sees as the next big problem and that lies next door in iran energy the new sluggish darling of davos by michael williams at the turn of the century the industry that generated all the buzz at the yearly world economic forum was technology the internet would change everything and fast a tech bust a war and an oil spike later movers and shakers are again headed to the annual talkfest in davos switzerland on wednesday this time the sector in the limelight is energy everything about this most strategic of industries seems to be changing oil prices hit record highs last year investment in renewable fuels such as ethanol is soaring russia is wielding its oil and gas exports as a weapon against the neighbors greenland is melting and even exxon mobil corp sees that curbs on greenhouse gas emissions are inevitable the more than chief executives politicians and journalists at davos will be discussing ways to enhance energy security spread alternative fuels and combat climate change hopes for moving beyond fossil fuels are running high at least among those who dont work for oil companies or live in saudi arabia a consensus is emerging that a new world energy order is needed one that would leave america and its allies safer richer and healthier but even with tech where change happens on a dime the effects on business and society take longer to play out than pundits usually predict the energy system is morphing but it is a tortoise not a hare so revolutionizing it is going to be a far longer process than the internet upheaval the energy business requires planning on vast time scales that are alien to pretty much everyone except science fiction writers some fields pump for half a century or more royal dutch shell plc is spearheading an oil and gas project spanning the russian island of sakhalin that will cost &# billion and take more than years to complete it will still be supplying oil and gas decades from now and hydrocarbon fuels greenhouse gas emitters oil gas coal will almost certainly still make up most of the worlds energy diet last week economists at the international energy agency peered into the future unless demand falls this is what they see fossil fuels accounted for of energy use in and will account for in oils share will slip but it will remain the no energy source while use of coal the dirtiest of fuels will rise renewables such as solar and wind will double their share to why despite the vanishing of the glaciers and fears of oil output peaking investors and governments alike still think fossil fuels are the cheapest way to grow the world economy in a recent one year stretch china built enough coal fired power plants to supply all of italy with electricity these plants will be around for decades meaning coal will remain core the world is going to need a lot more energy in the years ahead but we havent yet identified a technology that will deliver us from oil and its cousins telecommunications at&amp t results hows it growing by dionne searcey when at&amp t inc reports fourth quarter earnings thursday investors will be checking to see whether the new supersize company has solid footing for its ambitious future projects at the end of the year at&amp t completed its

investors will keep a close eye on capital spending to make sure the company isnt going overboard on pouring money into its fiber network that powers its fledgling tv service at&amp t didnt roll out

will also monitor the progress at&amp t is making in selling services to small and medium size businesses the results could serve as an indicator of whether at&amp t will be successful in those markets as it steps up the sale of services in the old bellsouth territory not only is at&amp t going head to head with rival verizon communications inc but now it must worry about cable companies which are entering that terrain also on thursday at&amp t will report bellsouths results separately and investors will make sure that companys final results are strong and at&amp t hopes to impress
