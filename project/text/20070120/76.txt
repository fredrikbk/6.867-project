the buzz apple gets a bruise by blaming a &# fee on accounting rules apple inc recently told some customers they would have to pay &# to download a software enhancement that enables a wireless networking technology already included on some of its computers apples reason accounting rules forced it to make customers foot the bill for the enhancement thats an excuse counter accounting experts and officials at the body that sets accounting rules known as generally accepted accounting principles or gaap for public and private companies rather apple is choosing to make customers pay so that it receives a particular accounting treatment it considers most favorable to it they say "gaap doesnt require you to charge squat " says lynn turner managing director of research at glass lewis &amp co and a former chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission "you charge whatever you want gaap doesnt even remotely address whether or not you charge for a significant functionality change gaap establishes what the proper accounting is based on what you did or didnt charge for it " in a statement friday night apple said that "the proper accounting" for shipping the enhancement was "to charge for this performance improvement in order to be in compliance with software revenue accounting requirements " it added that apple had recognized revenue related to the computers when they were sold the electronics maker recently said customers who bought some new macs including the macbook and macbook pro laptops based on a microprocessor from intel corp called core duo would now be able to use hardware that supports a faster new variant of a wireless technology commonly known as wi fi while apple for several months has shipped computers with the wireless hardware the final technical specifications for software for it werent complete enough to include software to support the technology now that the technical specifications are complete apple said customers who want to turn on the hardware will be able to download software to enable this technology from the apple web site provided they pay &# customers purchasing a new apple product that allows laptops and other computers to connect wirelessly to the internet and which will be available next month will include the software enhancement at no extra charge addressing the &# charge in a statement issued late this past week apple said the fee was "required in order for apple to comply with generally accepted accounting principles for revenue recognition " so why would apple charge customers if it didnt have to the company felt it had no choice based on the accounting outcome that would have resulted had it given the product away said a person familiar with the matter in that sense even if the accounting rules didnt explicitly say such a charge was necessary that was the result this person said when apple shipped the computers with the technology now being enhanced it couldnt defer revenue related to that technology because there was no market price for the enhancement the person added if apple had given the enhancement away free apples auditors could have required it to restate revenue for that period and could possibly have required apple to start in the future to defer all the revenue from computer sales until all such enhancements are shipped this person said that would have had a devastating impact on apple still apples language surprised officials who oversee accounting rules "accounting doesnt require any charge for anything " says edward trott a member of the financial accounting standards board which writes the accounting rules "no gaap doesnt tell you to do anything you need to work out your transaction with your customer and gaap will tell you how to reflect your transaction with that customer " the accounting rules in this case are analogous accounting experts say to income tax rules affecting the sale of stock if an investor sells shares less than a year after buying gains are taxed at personal income tax rates that can range as high as if the investor sells after holding the stock for more than a year gains are taxed at the capital gains rate of the income tax rules dictate the amount of tax to be paid but they dont tell the person when or whether to sell nick wingfield contributed to this article
