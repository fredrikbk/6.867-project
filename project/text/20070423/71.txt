the evening wrap nigerias fractured vote online edition in france voters this weekend winnowed a broad field of candidates down to a stark choice between a candidate of the right and a candidate of the left but in a parallel election in nigeria some say voters never really had a choice at all election officials from africas largest oil producer said to the surprise of none and discontent of many that ruling party candidate umaru yaradua a year old governor of northern katsina state had been selected as that countrys president in a landslide electoral victory but that seems unlikely to be the final word on what by almost all accounts has been an election soiled by corruption second place finisher gen muhammadu buhari whom election officials claimed had lost saturdays vote by roughly a three to one margin rejected the results calling the vote "the most blatantly rigged election results ever produced in nigeria " according to international observers the election was plagued by fraud intimidation ballot shortages and other problems and failed to meet international standards some polling locations never opened state department spokesman sean mccormack said that based upon reports from the scene "these were flawed elections and in some cases deeply flawed elections " max van den berg head of the european unions observer mission said the elections "have not lived up to the hopes and expectations of the nigerian people" and said that the process was not credible but president olusegun obasanjo who leaves office on may defended the vote while acknowledging that it had encountered what electoral commission chairman maurice iwu gingerly described as "difficulties " mr obasanjo said opposition parties could seek to redress their grievances in the courts but also said that the opposition was "fanning the embers of hate" and engaged in "outright subversive activities " mr yaradua all smiles after being told of his triumph urged opponents to "join hands with me to work for this country " but the shadow of fraud seemed to hang rather heavily over the victory party when a television interviewer asked mr yaradua whether he had expected to win his entourage broke into gales of laughter mr yaradua credited his victory to the "goodwill of nigerians " if successful the vote promised to be the first time in which nigeria saw a peaceful transition between elected civilian governments since gaining independence in mr obasanjo climbed to power in after years of military rule and amid accusations of widespread electoral fraud he was re elected in but couldnt run
