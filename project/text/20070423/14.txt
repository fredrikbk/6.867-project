can a company be run as a democracy during a recent strategy meeting at ternary software inc a programmer criticized the chief executives new incentive plan for employees an hourlong discussion insued in which several participants including the ceo critiqued the proposal ultimately all six participants agreed to handle incentives differently that part was crucial ternary runs itself as a democracy and every decision must be unanimous any of ternarys other employees could have challenged the incentive decision and forced it to be revisited running a company democratically sounds like a recipe for anarchy and it can prompt bureaucratic whiplash ternary a company with annual revenues of around &# million adjusted salaries for employees up and down several times last year but ternarys leaders who adopted the system in reaction to experiences of corporate infighting at another small company where they met insist that it works ceo brian robertson says ternary makes decisions more quickly because everyone has a voice and knows that mistakes can be undone the company which writes software programs on contract for other companies is growing and profitable and drawing interest from outsiders "it takes getting beyond your ego " says mr robertson who as one of the founders of the company has the ceo title but little typical ceo authority ternarys practices are extreme but other employers use similar tactics to give workers a voice beverage company honest tea inc bethesda md shares financial data with employees and encourages them to help at annual planning and strategy meetings product design consultancy continuum inc in west newton mass hosts monthly employee townhall meetings to discuss plans google inc prides itself on an egalitarian culture that includes weekly updates from executives who field questions from employees advocates say such systems appeal to workers particularly younger ones searching for careers with meaning "everyone wants to be a somebody " says traci fenton founder of worldblu inc a washington organization that promotes workplace democracy ryan quinn a management professor at the university of virginias darden graduate school of business says these companies typically are willing to sacrifice some short term profit to pursue innovation or other goals mr quinn says unorthodox practices can succeed at large and small companies but says he has never seen a company like ternary that strives for unanimous agreement harry katz dean of cornell universitys school of industrial and labor relations doubts a system like ternarys could work on a large scale in bigger companies "theres an inevitable conflict of interest between managers and employees " mr katz says general motors corp s saturn plant in spring hill tenn for instance experimented with giving employees a strong voice in management but later moved back to a more traditional structure he says a gm spokesman however says the auto maker gleaned many insights from the spring hill plant and still emphasizes employee input ternarys path to workplace democracy wasnt painless the company founded in first tried to draft a mission statement by consensus in when it had grown to more than a dozen employees the meeting lasted two days and ended as participants too exhausted to continue arguing agreed in principle to run the company as a democracy an attempt the next year to create a salary system by consensus was no better but mr robertson persevered guided by two out of print books about a dutch management technique called "sociocracy" or "dynamic governance " he has dubbed ternarys system "holacracy" and has begun marketing it as a managing style the person exton pa company has a policy setting team of seven people including two frontline workers elected by their peers the team is linked to smaller groups through the company that ultimately give all employees a voice the team meets to set policy for two hours once or twice a month the meetings take into account feelings as well as strategy in the "check in" round at a recent session a programmer recovering from a tetanus shot reported a sore left arm as new items are introduced each participant is asked for a gut reaction then theyre asked to state objections the group reworks the proposal until the objections are resolved or the plan is rejected the meeting where the incentive scheme was discussed was typically busy the team rejected mr robertsons proposal to replace the profit sharing program with an "ad hoc bonus system" based on performance formulating a new plan that would keep the profit sharing program and introduce monthly bonus incentives the group also assigned the ceo new responsibility for spurring growth gave the sales manager more authority to negotiate contracts and decided to bill clients by the day rather than by the hour technology chief anthony moquin one of the founders of the company said his gut reaction to the billing change was that it was simplistic but he accepted it saying "we can try it and see how it works " thats a common refrain at ternary managers dont look for an ideal solution merely a workable plan that looks like progress employees who dont like the results can seek a seat at the next strategy meeting or ask a member of the policy group to revisit the issue the repeated changes to ternarys pay scale last year demonstrate employee empowerment in action the company shares financial data including everyones salary with all employees in bill schofield proposed cutting the salaries of senior programmers including his own by and boosting compensation for junior programmers the council agreed then last summer ternary ran into a cash crunch because some customers werent paying their bills on time the strategy council slashed salaries by that rattled chad wolfe a year old canadian programmer who told his representative on the strategy team that he would have trouble paying his personal bills so the team devised no interest loans for needy employees "its frustrating and hard not to be able to count on your paycheck being consistent " mr wolfe says but he still likes working at ternary four months later in november ternary restored the pay cut then in january several employees asked the strategy group to give everyone a raise as thanks for staying through the bad time salaries rose last month ternary paid employees the money they lost during the four month pay cut plus interest mr wolfe will start repaying his roughly &# interest free loan at the end of april mr robertson says the pay saga highlights why the practice works instead of getting upset and leaving the employees "used the system to inject feedback and get their needs met " he says ternarys governance system has won fans among middle age employees such as year old wade lee who survived decades of management fads at behemoths such as international business machines corp and verizon communications inc he says the pay fluctuations are no worse than when he was a salesman working on commission plus he has a voice in the outcome "you dont have to fight and claw to be heard " says mr lee director of business development meetings ternary style a guide to achieving unanimity dont seek the best solution focus only on making progress approve proposals if no one actively objects even if some are skeptical let employees vent ask for gut reactions separately from objections require objections to be based on business reasons defer action when discussions gridlock let opponents discuss privately source wsj
