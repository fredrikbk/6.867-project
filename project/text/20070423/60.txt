sallie mae unlikely to lose federal overseer washington sallie mae is going private but if the &# billion proposed deal goes through the giant college lender still will likely come under a regulators scrutiny slm corp commonly known as sallie mae has a state chartered financing arm sallie mae bank which it set up to handle escrow and other payments and to have more flexibility to originate student loans some of its deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corp as a result the agency will continue to oversee sallie maes books and will have a say in whether the charter will transfer when the purchase led by private equity firm jc flowers &amp co closes there is no indication that the requirement would threaten the deal as the agreement says the bank will be dissolved if the transfer isnt approved in a timely fashion still that would mean sallie mae would lose access to the fdic system through its subsidiary and possibly have to pay more fees for transferring deposits and originating loans it also demonstrates that in the financial services sector taking a company private has its limits sallie mae bank based in murray utah reports &# million of assets and &# million of deposits it was established in as an industrial loan corporation an entity that allows companies to provide some financial services to their employees or customers a vestige of the early s for industrial companies to make loans to their workers the use and number of ilcs have increased in the past decade and there are close to half based in utah using state charters and fdic insurance to make loans collect deposits and issue credit cards they were largely noncontroversial until recently when wal mart stores inc and home depot inc sought charters stirring alarm that the retail giants wanted a foothold in banking regulators issued a freeze on new charters the fdic also began an expansive review of its ilc oversight at issue was whether the fdic could adequately measure the stability of a nonfinancial parent company which even if it owned a bank might have more experience selling hammers than home equity loans ed mierzwinski consumer program director at the u s public interest research groups said the federal deposit insurance system could be at risk if an industrial banks parent company failed and wiped out the banks reserves drawing down the fund that provides deposit insurance to all banks there is precedent for what jc flowers is trying to do in november the fdic allowed a consortium led by cerberus capital management lp to acquire an ilc held by gmac financial services the transfer was controversial in part because it came in the middle of the moratorium but the group was offered an exemption because the gmac deal likely would have fallen apart without fdic approval still cerberus agreed its ownership of the charter would be subject to whatever oversight regimen the fdic established the fdics freeze is still in place for retail type companies wal mart withdrew its application last month after waiting two years but home depots application is still pending even though the fdic has lifted the moratorium for financial parent companies its new proposal would require private equity firms and others to open their books regularly if another federal bank agency doesnt regularly examine it the sallie mae deal would give jc flowers and another private equity firm friedman fleischer &amp lowe llc a combined stake in the company with jc flowers controlling the vast majority j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp would each own of sallie mae because j p morgan and bank of america are both national banks supervised by the office of the comptroller of the currency sallie mae will likely come under review by that agency as well a sallie mae spokesman had no comment messages left for jc flowers werent returned
