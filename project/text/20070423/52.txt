privacy laws guns and the university as protective parent your april editorial "chos madness" concludes with a call "to restore some of the cultural taboos that once served as restraints on anti social behavior " in particular you state "two generations ago colleges felt an obligation to act in loco parentis " now you suggest this archaic concept "would probably inspire a lawsuit " as someone who attended university two generations ago i recall the concept well people werent so quick then to seek court intervention but the role of the university in relation to undergraduates was a subject of serious discussion and there was criticism that the school had no business pretending to act as parents in practice however if the university was a "parent " it was a neglectful one undergraduates were largely ignored left to their own devices sink or swim for the troubled counseling services were meager to nonexistent a strong stigma was associated with psychological counseling itself as the parent of a virginia tech student during the mid to late s i was impressed with the care and attention to the needs of students at orientation the students were told they should not feel alone that counseling was available to them any time hours a day my own generation would have been much better served by that philosophy indeed you might say it is a more responsible way of approaching in loco parentis a more caring concerned parent certainly more has to be done to deal with the rare individual beyond the reach of such resources but your conclusion is certainly correct cho seung huis "madness cant be explained by reason " john s pachter vienna va we are gravely concerned by the way the media has chosen to portray the shootings by centering attention on cho instead of his victims and by referring to his taped rant as a "manifesto " the media not only gives him undue publicity but also unmerited credibility a manifesto alludes to a platform for a reasoned political belief chos video was the raving of a madman though the media could have interpreted the videos contents for the inquiring public they should have handed it over to the fbi without airing it to the masses melissa gibson ross freshwater madison wis in regard to your april editorial "hot topic shooting highlights gun divisions" here we go again the left really takes every opportunity to try to change the gun laws in the u s it seems to me that the laws that should be changed are the privacy laws if we didnt have the privacy laws its almost certain this tragedy never would have taken place there will be more disasters because of these laws and yet the aclu and other liberal organizations continue to scream about our rights as citizens the parents of cho should have been notified his roommate should have been warned about his mental condition the school should have gone to the authorities there are many things that could have been done had it not for the federal privacy act i feel i can give up a bit of my privacy if it would stop some terrible tragedy like this doris stoller valparaiso ind the notion that the horrific massacre at virginia tech would have been prevented by banning guns is as realistic as saying that banning the screws and nails used in homemade bombs would prevent terrorist homicide bombings when an individual is determined to cause mass casualties that person will find a way to carry it out unless there is some form of intervention by either another individual or by law enforcement even then there will be someone who manages to succeed achieving their deadly goal virginia tech was considered a gun free zone where no one was allowed to legally carry a weapon hence the only person carrying weapons was the assassin perhaps the fatality rate would have been significantly lower if responsible citizens had been permitted to carry weapons lisa cohen menlo park calif
