let them be politicians of all stripes seem to worship small businesses and enjoy showering the objects of their reverence with all manner of totems and gifts targeted tax credits regulatory favors preferences for landing public contracts but what the government gives with the right hand it has a nasty habit of taking away with the left theres a much better way to pay respect get out of their way its fitting during this national small business week to recognize this sectors importance according to the small business administrations sba office of advocacy there are about million small firms fewer than employees in the u s employing half of all nonpublic workers and generating of the private non farm gross domestic product while no one disputes the overall strategic importance of large corporations small or medium sized firms can be more nimble than bureaucratized behemoths better able and willing to take risks experiment in new market niches pursue new technologies adjust to emerging consumer demands does it follow as some argue that federal government programs such as sba loan guarantees are needed to help small firms access capital they would otherwise be hard pressed to find to be sure making capital more available is important but many economists report that small business as a whole has plenty of access to capital and not much of it from the sba only of small business loans given out in a year are sba backed making the agency largely irrelevant in the capital market moreover special government programs by their very nature pit those who get support against those who dont this is not to say that there is no role for government heres one free capital from taxes the u s imposes a high tax rate on capital reducing investment giving firms an incentive to move profits abroad and encouraging costly tax avoidance schemes economists instead conclude that an optimal tax system in most cases should not include a tax on capital reducing the capital tax would be a significant policy to help all small firms not simply those favored by a special program what about tax relief in the form of special deductions exclusions and exemptions credits deferrals and preferential tax rates and the like according to the joint committee on taxation and the treasury department these preferential tax policies for small businesses combined to lower tax revenues by more than &# billion in fiscal year thats real money but most small business owners file their taxes as individuals not as corporations wouldnt cutting income taxes be better empirical research supports this intuitive notion economist robert carroll found that cutting tax rates increases the proportion of entrepreneurs who make new capital investments and increases the size of the investment they make furthermore cutting taxes leads to small business owners hiring more new workers and increasing pay to existing workers then too reducing the current complexity in the tax code would free up time and resources for small firms to focus more on business and less on accountants lawyers and paperwork the alternative minimum tax amt is also an increasing burden designed to hit only the very richest earners it is hammering more and more middle income taxpayers including many small business owners the heritage foundation estimated the number of small business owners subjected to the amt has more than tripled between and to million from million nor would a government out to help small business neglect to repeal the estate tax too many heirs find themselves needing to sell off parts of family firms just to pay the taxes due damaging their firms competitive prospects for the future finally governments at all levels should reduce the large regulatory burdens that afflict small business reams of mind numbing regulations add a hefty cost of &# per employee to enterprises of all sizes its worse for small businesses in a sba study on the impact of regulatory costs on the smallest firms economist mark crain of lafayette college notes that complying with federal regulations costs companies with fewer than workers an average of &# per employee yet these are not the kinds of useful reforms that get adopted instead and especially on a federal level congress enacts policies that ensure government selected winners and losers instead of letting all small firms compete on a level playing field unfortunately the targeted subsidies and tax credits congress provides to small firms have perverse side effects often producing the exact opposite of what was intended for example many small firms lose their benefits when their employment assets or receipts surpass a certain threshold this creates a perverse incentive to stay small lest by growing you lose the subsidy as a famous story comes down to us the th century french minister jean baptiste colbert head of louis xivs finances once asked a group of businessmen what he that is what the government could do to help them replied one "laissez nous faire " leave us alone private enterprises will thrive when governments lower taxes keep regulations to a minimum and provide a stable legal environment that protects
