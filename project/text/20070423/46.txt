overweight and unhappy maybe not the article "in obesity wars a new backlash" page one april is another reminder of how we as individuals parents and professionals have improperly addressed one of our countrys most important self destructive and self imposed health epidemics obesity we must accept personal responsibility for the foods we eat and the sedentary lifestyles we live and most importantly we must know that our children learn most from us at home to me the anger of the parents whose children are overweight is a reflection of their lack of responsibility any after school or community wellness program must include everyone that means all students regardless of their body mass index or fitness assessment all parents all teachers and yes the chairman of the school board the director of food service and physical education teachers it isnt enough for faculty to simply receive an assessment to be healthy and show support weight management is important for everyone and the regular participation of parents teachers and professionals in these programs is more likely to result in the desired long term behavior change which generally takes no less than one year the professional community and the commercial fitness industry are equally responsible for inadequately designing and implementing effective health and nutrition programs focused on weight management resistive cords exercise balls yoga and other creative ways to move your body in place or lift weights are gimmicks to sell club memberships individuals interested in weight management would do better through the sustained use of large muscle groups in a continuous or cyclic fashion through a variety of play activities like basketball soccer or ultimate frisbee dr timothy kempf former professor of kinesiology eagle idaho as a fellow pediatrician i applaud dr falls efforts eating is an acquired habit not a hobby overweight children come from overweight parents good for dr fall for providing the opportunity for the children in campbell county wyo leonard janchar m d f a a p smith clinic marion ohio the program fails three principles of medicine the first is "do no harm " an intervention should on balance do more good than harm to the people being treated to abide by this principle a second is required use the best evidence you can find to verify that your intervention has done more good than harm evidence to support the long term value of schools anti obesity programs hasnt been published and it appears that gillette wyo is making no systematic effort to evaluate its program third the people subject to an intervention should give informed consent gillettes parents dont appear to have been given adequate information about the program let alone to have systematically been asked for their consent to it william ira bennett m d cambridge mass i dont agree with the assumption by school board chairman and pediatrician david fall that any child who is overweight is unhappy if that is true i think one reason would be because of the pressure kids feel from others who share dr falls attitude im not sure why dr fall thinks singling out for special treatment and labeling children as "overweight" on report cards would help improve their happiness level as parents we dont need the school system deciding how our children should be raised without input from us if the school wants to set up a voluntary exercise fitness program and offer it to all students i think that would have much more support and student involvement than targeting individual students for additional exercise classes john buckley lincroft n j
