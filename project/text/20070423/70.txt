the doctors office thanks to impatience pride men dont make good patients online edition at first my year old patient didnt mind the weight loss he was busy enough with his business ventures that he didnt pay much attention about six months ago he noticed that he was thirsty all the time and making multiple trips to the bathroom at night he thought getting older accounted for the blurriness of his vision weakness and fatigue were interfering with his work in farming and real estate but he put up with it hes a diabetic but over the years he hasnt wanted to deal with the disease instead of my recommended four visits a year with lab work and an office visit for a diabetic im lucky to see him once a year ive kidded him that he only comes to the office when i run the "push pull or drag it in special " in recent months he didnt take his pills twice a day because it was a hassle he had stopped checking his blood sugars at home as the signs and symptoms worsened he ignored them at his wifes insistence he finally came back to the office because he was grumpy all the time and he just wasnt acting like his old self she came with him to ensure that he actually showed up we started him on insulin once a day because his blood sugars were three times the normal range the journal has a special package on mens health one article by health columnist tara parker pope says that men get sicker and die sooner than women in part because men dont take care of themselves as well thats what ive found too in my nine years of family practice men take better care of their cars than they do their own bodies they seem to carry a sense of pride about not having to see a doctor that was the case with another year old gentleman who came in for fatigue and weight loss this past winter he hadnt seen a doctor in years and thought his problems started after being scratched by a cat several months back he turned out to have precancerous colon polyps and prostate cancer ideally he should have had colon and prostate screening starting years earlier most of the time when a man shows up in my office its because a woman sent him i think thats why married guys live longer see article women get their health information from doctors the internet magazines and television according to the government men get most of their health information from their wife girlfriend or mother if a man makes an appointment but wont tell the receptionist the nature of his concerns it usually means that hes depressed or that his penis isnt working women making an appointment in the future will usually keep it as a general rule guys tend to look for a good excuse to cancel a follow up appointment i think its more a subconscious thing rather than being calculating about it it works best for my secretary to call them for a reminder for every guy who is taking care of himself i think there are at least twenty that are really gambling with their health they rely on their luck many men are fatalistic about their health everybody dies in the end anyway they figure that something is going to get me no matter what i do so why bother they also have a strong sense of denial one of my patients was a nuclear plant technician who monitored the various dials and gauges under his command multiple times per day his work was his life and his personal health resembled a nuclear meltdown he would scrupulously monitor his blood pressure several times a day but didnt want to take the medication for the blood pressure problem he denied for years it took me over a year to convince him neglecting his health caused severe heart disease and lung disease that cant be completely corrected the retirement he worked so hard for turned into a prison of long term disability when guys finally realize they have a problem they usually want it fixed right away its the same results oriented behavior they use when they shop or make decisions fix it or forget it when the treatment calls for taking medicine daily and follow up checks for example for high blood pressure or diabetes i often have better success with women patients than men perhaps thanks to the birth control pill at least some women are accustomed to the importance of sticking with a daily medicine regimen i try to cover as much preventive care as possible in one visit for men because they often wont come back to my office for a very long time my diabetic patient is already improving on his new insulin i just had to show his wife what he needed to do and have her ride herd on him she promised to keep him tuned up if he promised to stick to working on the car write to dr benjamin brewer at thedoctorsoffice wsj com
