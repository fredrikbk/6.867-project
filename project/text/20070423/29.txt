has exemplified a broad turnaround in chinas stock markets an extended rally that has gained international notice the bull market for bank shares reflects investor optimism about chinas overall economy and about improvements in the health of the countrys financial system yet a vocal body of investors argues that the lofty prices reflect only the rosiest expectations while ignoring some of

pacific sun investment management hk ltd "there is a lot of bad news that should be in the prices but is not " mr mantel said including risks that lending will slow lending is critical because chinese

growth " which has averaged annually however that doesnt mean he thinks the stocks are a "buy " because chinas financial industry is "quite fully priced" and hsbc is therefore "neutral" on it rather
