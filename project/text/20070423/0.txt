a third clinton term hillary rodham clinton said saturday that if she is elected president she would make her husband a roaming ambassador to the world associated press can there be anyone with more than a passing interest in politics who is surprised by this the inevitable shoe dropped over the weekend in home away from home iowa when someone asked the inevitable question what role would the former president play in her administration "he has said he would do anything i asked him to do " senator clinton replied "i would put him to work " as it happens mr clinton himself teed up this announcement last week in an interview with cnn "you know i love her very much " he said "all presidents need help they need all the help they can get and were going to have a lot of challenges so if she asked me to do something whatever it was i would probably do it " he added that "shell make the decisions " we suspect so while hillary is clearly pushing the global ambassador idea as a discrete and limited job for her husband anyone who believes thats all hell be is delusional senator clintons election would usher in a third clinton term and a co presidency redux the first group that has to decide whether been there done that is not a problem is the democratic party which would again revert to a clinton subsidiary next come those aspiring to be secretary of state treasury and defense whod likely serve as potted plants in the shade of these two dominant personalities finally voters will either approve this game plan or simply thank them for the memories
