the jobs miscount no single government statistic has a weightier impact on public policy the stock market and even the public mood than the monthly jobs number for just about everyone from joe sixpack to the federal reserve chairman the employment figures released on the first friday of every month are a short hand way to measure the economys strength pity then that these employment numbers have become unreliable how off track are they the department of labor undercounted the number of americans working by just under one million from april through march the original monthly reports suggested million new jobs but the final revisions were corrected to million that means about one of every three new jobs wasnt detected by the statisticians at the dol these lowball estimates were eventually corrected but few other than economic professionals pay much attention to job tallies that come one month to a year after the fact reversing the damage of an overly pessimistic jobs report is as futile as trying to unring a bell this year the great jobs undercount has continued an analysis by economists at first trust advisors in chicago has found that from april through february the latest revised numbers available the federal government originally reported almost one half million fewer americans working than actually were working on average the first monthly forecast for this period was jobs the second report from a month later counted new jobs and the final revision was jobs whoops so this year one of every four new jobs flew below the governments statistical radar which counts as improvement we guess whats the problem well the labor department seems to be using old statistical techniques to measure the dynamics of the new economy the government publishes two different job estimates the one that gets big play in the media is the establishment or "payroll" survey which asks some large employers about their hiring patterns the second is the smaller household survey which randomly calls people on the phone and asks whether the adults in the household are working for at least the last two years the household survey has been far more accurate no one knows the precise reason former department of labor economist diana furchtgott roth suspects that the survey of big and established employers is failing to account for the huge increase in the number of americans who are self employed contract workers or work for start up business ventures that are invisible to washington "we know when ford lays off workers we dont always detect in our sample the small start ups like joes auto parts and other entrepreneurial enterprises that define the new economy " says ms furchtgott roth robert stein senior economist at first trust advisors agrees that labor estimators seem to think "most americans work in factories and punch time clocks " these mistakes can have political and policy consequences an official jobless rate that is higher than the real rate can lead congress to spend more on jobless benefits for example or contribute to protectionist pressure against foreign goods it can also influence close elections because the media tend to play up jobs news in retrospect we now know that john kerrys claims of a "jobless recovery" in were fiction with the latest revisions job growth in this expansion has been similar to the pace of the s expansion we called the bureau of labor statistics to get its take on all of this and acting director phil rones says he believes the jobs numbers arent biased in any direction "there has not been a systematic undercount in the job estimates " he says and to be fair the missed jobs per month is out of a labor force of million perhaps the mistake is putting too much stock in any government statistic in an economy that is growing and changing as fast as americas still the failure to detect nearly million jobs the equivalent of ignoring every worker in north and south dakota and montana suggests there may be a problem in the governments statistical methods and that provides an opportunity for politicians to create mischief and make policy blunders america is working even if the dols statistics dont always say so see related letter "letters to the editor how many have jobs well never know exactly" wsj april see related letter "letters to the editor no fundamental flaw in jobs survey process" wsj may see related letter "letters to the editor a surge in self employed new yorkers" wsj may
