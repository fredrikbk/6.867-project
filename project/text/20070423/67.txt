the daily fix golden state stuns dallas as davis keys win online edition yes the golden state warriors went in their season series against the dallas mavericks but that was assumed to be an aberration in the western conference playoffs the swagger talent and wins that made the mavs the top seed would easily win out nope or at least not in game "after a while you werent thinking baron davis " marvels bruce jenkins in the san francisco chronicle "you were thinking larry bird vinnie johnson charles barkley or the fabled sleepy floyd when somebody gets that hot in the playoffs it stays in the memory forever the fact that it was davis and the warriors made it especially rewarding on a stirring sunday night in dallas throw in the sight of a petulant mavs owner mark cuban looking like a year old kid who just got his bike stolen by a girl and the warriors return to the nba playoffs was incomprehensibly sweet " in the san jose mercury news tim kawakami thinks an upset could be in the works "it doesnt matter if the rest of the universe was shocked " he writes adding "it doesnt matter if we cant quite figure out the alchemy and athleticism that have created this situation though a glance at baron davis eyes during his point third quarter might have given a hint none of that matters now the warriors beat the mavericks for the fourth consecutive time this season and nobody can say that dallas wasnt braced for the challenge " in the dallas morning news tim cowlishaw blasts the mavs for playing scared before turning his attention to dirk nowitzki "its a good thing this game played no part in nowitzkis hopes of an mvp award " he writes adding "in the fourth quarter when the mavericks needed him to step up he was for two of the attempts were from point range i dont know whats worse not scoring in the fourth quarter or playing all but seconds of a period in which dallas was trailing and taking only three shots i dont know what that is leadership it isnt " in phoenix the los angeles lakers put up a superb first half against the suns but faded badly late scoring just fourth quarter points on four for shooting kobe bryant was one for as the suns prevailed in game in the orange county register jeff miller offers this appraisal "we didnt really learn anything new in game of this latest lakers suns playoff series but we did re learn something a team with a lot of options generally is going to beat a team with a lot of kobe bryant especially over the course of seven games so while bryant was dragging kwame brown and jeanie buss and j r rider and mark landsberger and everyone else in lakers history up and down the court for a nine point halftime lead he also was emptying his fourth quarter chamber said another way he was exhausting the lakers only chance at victory sunday " in san antonio the denver nuggets got points from allen iverson and carmelo anthony but the key to their game victory over the spurs was smothering tim duncan tony parker and manu ginobli with an uncharacteristic display of defense its no upset insists mark kiszla in the denver post contributing bulletin board fodder with a chest thumper column "the nuggets sent an unmistakable undeniable message to tim duncan and the once great san antonio spurs its over for you it has been a great run by the spurs including three nba championships but its done " in the east the washington wizards took the court against lebron james and the cleveland cavaliers lacking gilbert arenas and caron butler lost because of injuries to a knee and a hand respectively the wizards played competitively but as mike wise points out in the washington post a good effort isnt the same as a w game went to the cavs "you kept hearing from the players afterward how the wizards competed how they showed up against the cavs in cleveland " mr wise writes "yeah okay so did the clantons in tombstone there was effort and at times execution and a real commitment to defending one of the most gifted players in the league but at no time sunday afternoon did coach eddie jordans team demonstrate a shock the nba fervor an unbridled passion about proving their detractors who rightly thought they had no shot in this series wrong " bam bam bam bam that was the sound of the boston red sox unloading on new york yankees rookie chase wright at fenway in the third inning last night mr wright

wrights predecessor is the los angeles angels paul foytack hammered in by the cleveland indians woodie held pedro ramos tito francona and larry brown from the inevitable department of baseball weirdness tito franconas son terry is the current manager of the red sox the last time players went back to back to back to back was last year when the los angeles dodgers did it against the san diego padres the second hitter in that dodger barrage mr drew "you cant say the kid was cruising along " mike vaccaro writes in the new york post "hed thrown balls and strikes and hed seemed to go to three ball counts on just about everybody but hed still recorded outs without giving up a run he held a lead and hed just gotten david ortiz to fly out weakly to left field for the second out so thats where chase wright was after he threw his rd pitch of the game a ball to manny ramirez the yankees had been fidgeting all night wondering when the kid was going to start finding the strike zone the good news is he was about to find it the bad news is he was about to find it " in the new yorker ben mcgrath tells enjoyable tales of mr ramirez possibly the goofiest great hitter in baseball history the
