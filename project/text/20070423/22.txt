eyes on the road lexus tries to redefine top of the line new hybird luxury sedan relies on technology efficiency instead of power presence online edition phoenix ariz most people old enough to remember the gas shocks of the s and the tiny cars the toyota motor corp was lucky enough to be shipping to america at just that time probably never imagined that some day it would be possible to spend over &# for a large high tech toyota luxury sedan but that moment has arrived with the launch of the lexus ls h l sedan a car designed to redefine what is meant by "top of the line" in the u s car market this is a tall order and its no easier to be sure that the &# lexus ls h l will succeed in its ambitious quest after youve driven it than before pretty much since the dawn of the motor age "top of the line" has been synonymous with power presence size if you prefer and at least recently a european pedigree in the s and s big cadillacs were "the standard of the world " today european names such as bmw and mercedes benz dominate the top of the motoring food chain at least when it comes to ultra luxury sedans the cylinder versions of the bmw series and mercedes s class sedans are the benchmarks for sedans that fly above the &# ceiling a class that also includes the w equipped audi a the bentley and rolls royce brands the lexus ls h l sedan represents toyotas effort to rearrange that formula adding words such as "clean " and "efficient " "high tech" and "japanese" to the list the ls h l is a technology showpiece wrapped in a design that pays homage to the teutonic benchmarks to achieve the horsepower needed to compete with the german cylinder super cars lexus combines a liter v engine and an electric drive system that together to produce horsepower that power is sent to all four wheels through a continuously variable transmission and an all wheel drive system in contrast the bmw li and the mercedes s are rear wheel drive cars using a hybrid electric drive along with fume scrubbing technology such as a "hydrocarbon adsorber" that soaks up fuel fumes during cold starts lexus says the ls h can achieve a super ultra low emission vehicle sulev status meaning its about cleaner than the cleanest of its rivals the company says the epa rated mileage for the ls h is city highway compared to highway and city for the horsepower mercedes s the obsessiveness that toyotas engineers have brought to the development of the ls h is hard to overstate consider this from the materials handed to reporters who attended the companys drive event a few weeks ago "camshafts piston pins and crankshaft are polished to a mirror finish to reduce friction areas " and did i mention that the car has an optional system that allows it to park itself but at this point who doesnt know that given the saturation broadcast of the commercials in which this feature is the star video the problem for lexus is that the ls h shouldnt seek to compete directly with the german uber sedans because it isnt what people who love those cars really want its something else on the road and on test tracks at toyotas arizona proving ground the lexus ls h does remarkable things it has an optional "advanced pre collision system" that can detect when the car is about to hit an obstacle and automatically help the driver brake and steer out of harms way theres even a system that can detect when a driver is nodding off and sound a buzzer and electronically tap the brakes the car sails smoothly and quietly at over miles an hour on a closed track an experience few actual buyers will have but the ls h is still a lexus not a german supercar the german uber sedans have big horsepower numbers but boast equally big or bigger figures for torque pound feet in the case of the s compared to lb feet for the ls torque is key to providing that feeling of mastery when powering away from a stop or zooming around some slowpoke on the freeway this what makes the german supercars feel aggressive and sporty and compensates their owners for the annoyance of dealing with features such as the bmw idrive system the lsh is certainly not slow but the combination of the hybrid engine all wheel drive system and the cvt transmission deliver the power in a much less visceral way like the standard ls the dominant emotion you have behind the wheel of an lsh is tranquility moreover if your values are such that you really want to save gas flogging the ls h to its limits isnt the way to do that driven hard on the track the cars computer puts mileage in the teens driving at a more sedate pace on streets and highways around phoenix i managed to coax my mileage computer up toward mpg not bad for a car that weighs pounds pounds more than an ls largely due to the battery pack and all wheel drive system still lexus engineers and marketers clearly wish this car had more eye popping epa mileage numbers a standard long wheelbase ls with a v engine costs &# and is rated at city highway so saving money on gas isnt a real reason to trade up to the hybrid ls for an extra &# in fact the ls h begs larger questions the ls h may be a rational "green" choice for someone whose alternatives are defined as buying a cylinder german sedan or buying the hybrid ls the hybrid ls is cleaner and more fuel efficient than those german uber cars taken on its own terms the ls h l should find success with the power brokers of hollywood palm beach and greenwich conn who want to be seen as both dominant and progressive but a wealthy person whose priority is reducing greenhouse gases would clearly do better to take &# and buy four toyota prius sedans one for him or herself and one each for three friends now driving gas guzzlers or better yet buy one prius make it the touring edition that starts at &# and use the remaining &# and change to subsidize the efforts of a student or researcher who wants to tackle the many challenges confronting green vehicle technology such as how to develop a commercially viable plug in hybrid after all whether you drive a prius or the ls h youll probably get where you are going at the same speed send comments about eyes on the road to
