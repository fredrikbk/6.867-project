papers web hopes dim a bit ad growth online slows as sources for news burgeon even with all the grim news the newspaper industry has faced in recent years publishers have consoled themselves that they have a lifeline if they could switch content away from print and onto the internet bringing advertisers with them they could save their businesses last week that lifeline began looking frayed new york times co warned thursday that online advertising growth this year wont be as strong as the it had projected on the same day tribune co reported that the growth rate for first quarter interactive revenue was sharply lower than a year earlier gannett co likewise said online revenue growth slowed in the first quarter from a year earlier several other major u s newspaper companies have yet to report for the first quarter including mcclatchy co and washington post co although on friday the chief executive of washington posts online arm caroline little said growth was "slowing slightly across the board but is still very healthy " dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal reported growth in online ad revenue in the first quarter up from a year earlier dow joness business model is different from that of other publishers however because much of the journals web site is subscription only which reduces the amount of traffic but allows the journal to charge higher advertising rates because paying customers are thought to be more committed analysts agree that the results at the times and tribune reflect a broader trend "we absolutely see slower growth coming " says kip cassino vice president of research at borrell associates a media research firm "generally newspapers tend to believe things that have been good are going to get better and thats not always the case " borrell says the growth rate in online ad spending in newspapers will likely fall to a percentage in the low s this year from last year to be sure that may reflect a broader deceleration in the growth of web advertising emarketer a market research firm predicts the overall growth of u s online ad revenue will slow to this year from last year it predicts newspapers will do slightly better but last weeks news came as the number of online news outlets proliferates rival media such as tv stations and magazines have beefed up their presence adding to threats posed by web giants such as google and yahoo and popular sites such as cnn com even the social networking site myspace has added a news feature and is boosting its ad sales efforts media buyers also indicate marketers are beginning to look beyond traditional journalism sites realizing many news junkies go elsewhere too "advertisers are getting less scared of blogs and newsgroups and now are beginning to take money away from the traditional newspapers sites " says greg smith chief operating officer of neo ogilvy an interactive ad agency owned by wpp groups ogilvy &amp mather new york one major issue for many newspapers online roughly to of their online revenue is tied to a classified ad sold in the print edition known as an "upsell " says paul ginocchio a newspaper analyst at deutsche bank and as newspapers see a sharp erosion in classified advertising for real estate and jobs their web sites are being hit as well analysts say papers need to find new categories of advertisers "newspapers need to move beyond the traditional classified sources theyve relied upon " says borrells mr cassino underlining this pressure is a shift under way within internet advertising the ad formats that have so far proved strongest for newspapers banner ads pop ups and listings are losing ground to formats such as search marketing ad buyers say automotive entertainment financial services and travel companies all major newspaper advertisers in print and online are aggressively shifting dollars into search marketing "there is a dramatic shift going on " says eric bader senior vice president director of digital connections at publicis groupes mediavest marketers like search advertising because it leads customers to exactly what they are looking for and is easy to measure he says the problem for newspapers is that the benefits of search fall disproportionately to the googles and yahoos of the world newspaper companies are increasingly looking for deals with such portals and publishers including mcclatchy medianews group and hearst recently signed a comprehensive deal with yahoo that will require the newspapers to use yahoo search on their web sites yahoo and the newspapers would sell ads on each others sites and the revenue would be shared content from the papers would be featured on yahoos channels but some newspaper executives worry that the deal takes too much power away from the newspapers still the biggest opportunity may simply be for newspapers and other web properties to persuade more advertisers to put more money onto the internet a survey of u s advertisers last year found that of the companies with annual revenue of &# million or more will dedicate less than &# million to online ads according to jupiterresearch
