the architects of medicare drug benefit i agree with kimberley strassel "competence man " potomac watch april regarding medicare part d but i would make one addition dr mark mcclellan did an outstanding job implementing the new medicare prescription drug benefit he is indeed one of the most talented individuals in the health care field and part d would not be the success it is today without him because some were skeptical and branded the program a disaster however i would add that the design of the program occurred under the leadership of tom scully administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services and others at cms it is true that without dr mcclellans leadership the program designed by tom scully and others at cms might have failed bob dole washington mr dole was senate majority leader and ms strassels column was most enlightening i was in favor of the program from the very beginning because of the need for coverage for the possibility of catastrophic drug costs i was exposed because of the limited coverage available by medicare supplemental insurance plans as i had no source for other coverage in fact the premium cost for the limited coverage was way out of proportion to the benefits provided the gist of what sen bill frist said at the time of passage is that the plan was good and time would bear that out he was correct one other benefit i received is that my drug costs have been reduced because i am now paying the lower cost negotiated by my insurance carrier previously i was paying the highest price the pharmacy charged and i was forced to compare prices with other pharmacies to be sure i was not paying more than the market one thing i determined in this process is that a pharmacy had no incentive to be realistic in its pricing because it accepted what the insurance companies paid and the rest of us paid whatever they could get it was only through comparisons with low cost providers wal mart costco that i could get relief from the excessive charges you can be sure it didnt take me long to transfer my business to one of the low cost providers robert pitcel lake quivira kan
