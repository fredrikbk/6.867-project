someone walking in and shooting others " says roger brunswick a psychiatrist and president of management consultant hayes brunswick in new york "violence usually builds slowly and starts with bullying

erratic or angry behavior or has a problem such as substance abuse or depression "we felt on balance its better for employees to know they can call with concerns instead of sitting at their desks
