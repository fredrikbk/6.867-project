texas station interrupts commercial interruptions in the wee hours this morning dallas classic rock radio station kzps was scheduled to flip to a rock and country hybrid format called lone star but "stairway to heaven" wont be the only thing missing from the new station regular second and second advertisers wont be part of the lineup either instead the clear channel communications inc station plans to weave in mentions of sponsors no more than fifteen seconds at a time throughout the regular programming a setup that is more akin to public radio than traditional commercial broadcasting the move marks a radical extension of clear channels "less is more" initiative which aims to boost audience ratings by cutting the amount of advertising on each of its stations under the new arrangement a host on the fm station might mention a music festival and let listeners know southwest airlines co flies to the town holding it or after spinning stevie ray vaughans "crossfire " he might note mr vaughans fondness for his fender stratocaster and tell listeners to stop by guitar center to check out the latest models willie nelson will serve as the stations voice taping a series of station identifications and quips lone star can drop into programming the country singer and songwriter will also have opportunities to promote his biodiesel company biowillie hosts typically will talk about the music rather than sharing anecdotes about themselves as is common on hit stations the broadcast radio industry wavering in the face of competition from satellite radio and ipods is eager for ideas that can create new opportunities in this case it is a gamble the sponsorship plan will generate less revenue initially than regular commercials though clear channel believes that over time listeners will flock to a station that isnt cluttered with advertising allowing kzps to collect higher sponsorship rates the sponsorship experiment is spearheaded by clear channels dallas sales director kelly kibler ms kibler said the idea for busting up the traditional advertising on kzps came to her during a brainstorming session a few months ago with lonestars programming director duane doherty who was telling her how he wanted the station to break molds mixing country with southern rock and skipping hyped chitchat between songs "if theres no hype on the air and then we break into a commercial for the new car dealer whos going to be yelling hey come on down thats going to negate the no hype image " she says "i started thinking about how i could model the advertising my way and not have it be done the traditional cookie cutter way " as a student at boston university in the s ms kibler volunteered for the universitys listener and underwriter supported public radio show "car talk " drawing on that experience she decided to go with a sponsorship model envisioning brief messages public radio listeners hear but with more attitude she hopes to create a sense of listener loyalty to the products online advertising and concert sponsorship comes rolled in with the on air mentions to foster a sense of partnership with the sponsor eventually ms kibler won over her clear channel radio bosses and now she is trying to win over advertisers about half of the advertisers on the old classic rock station liked the idea she said although just four have signed up as on air sponsors so far southwest at&amp t wireless coors and guitar center others told her they preferred to work with traditional second spots and the new sponsorship setup would ruin their media plans she says kevin gallagher a senior vice president at publicis groupe sas starcom usa says thinking in terms of or second spots rather than second ones is no harder than thinking how to advertise on new media but some clients dont want to make that leap until the concept is proven he says and others arent sure if the condensed mentions will really make a mark ms kibler wont go into detail on costs but says that sponsoring an hour on lone star with four separate mentions costs no more than buying four second "island" spots in the same time frame on its classic rock predecessor island spots run on their own with no other ads before or after them it will likely take a year before lone star generates as much revenue as the old format ms kibler says in the meantime the station will likely drag down performance in one of clear channels biggest markets giving ammunition to the private equity groups that want to take clear channel private and are offering investors &# per share the move could also prove controversial with clear channel advertising staff who rely on sales commissions as a big part of their compensation southwest was attracted to lone star because of its attitude and maverick musical format a mixture of outlaw country alternative country and southern rock as much as its sponsorship model "it is different and we like to do things differently than other companies " says spokeswoman brandy king the airline also liked lone stars guarantee that no other airline would be able to advertise on the station as long as southwest did lone star projects a certain brazen image reminiscent of the rock music jack fm format that has cropped up around the country over the past couple of years jack plays an eclectic mixture of rock music and in between songs a deadpan voice spouts one liners like "thanks for taking the bait now get ready for the switch " before going into ads lone star serves up similar smart aleck comments such as "if it aint from nashville youll hear it here " the jack concept largely was championed by clear channel rival cbs radio lone star taps into a niche market much as new media competitors such as satellite radio or internet radio do in fact clear channel has been testing lone star on the internet "i think what youre going to see is this moving onto stations around the country " says clear channel market manager j d freeman
