reversal of fortune after big wins in las vegas an investors luck turns authorities eye deal with billy walters and a city golf course las vegas in this city known for gambling high stakes business deals and outsized real estate transactions billy t walters has played a lucky hand as one of the top sports bettors in town he has become a millionaire many times over routinely placing six figure wagers on football and basketball games along the way mr walters who hobnobs with city officials and is a fixture on the local charity circuit has beaten federal and state criminal charges related to various gambling and money laundering allegations using proceeds from his gaming wins he has snapped up golf courses and other valuable property but now mr walterss winning streak faces a threat thanks to the fallout from a deal brokered in late thats when the las vegas city council agreed to eliminate a deed restriction on one of his golf courses paving the way for the land to be used for single family homes the lands value as a result skyrocketed by as much as &# million mr walters purchased the land from the city in at a deeply discounted price on the condition that it would forever remain a golf course the city councils reversal was one of at least six controversial decisions by government officials related to mr walterss land holdings all of them favorable to him "its another deal with billy walters where he gets all the upside and the taxpayer ends up getting all the downside " said lisa mayo deriso a las vegas activist who is part of an ad hoc group that has opposed some of mr walterss land deals with the city and county with his bravado political connections and high tolerance for risk mr walters is the kind of brash charming character las vegas cultivates despite frequent claims of favoritism by local watchdog groups and the media his real estate empire has thrived with government officials greenlighting his projects time and again mayor oscar goodman once mr walterss attorney has called him "sly and wily as a fox " mr walters denies any wrongdoing and has gone on local news programs to rail against his critics and defend his transactions as aboveboard he says the deals are routine and have been misunderstood and sensationalized by some local media battles over land are common in las vegas whose warm climate and relatively low living costs draw thousands of new residents each year the dizzying growth has led to a symbiotic relationship between developers seeking public approval for their projects and the local officials who rely on them for political support mr walterss request to change the zoning rules caught the attention of local officials compelling a police investigation soon after nevada attorney general george chanos also launched an investigation into the matter last fall his office issued a strongly worded report that named a number of las vegas officials who were accommodating to developers mr walters in particular "there has been a consistent pattern of political and financial favoritism granted to mr walterss business entities by the city of las vegas " the report concluded the embarrassing developments prompted the council to rescind its vote putting the brakes on mr walterss land deal no charges have been filed as a result of mr chanoss investigation which focused mainly on the actions of the city mr chanos left office in january only months after being appointed attorney general in that short time he himself fought off criticism over a real estate deal that he inked before assuming office in deciding not to run for a new term he said he was weary of local politics he handed off the investigation to his successor and also asked the federal bureau of investigation to look into the matter during a recent interview mr walters took to task those who opposed him in the golf course deal he says a report of the investigation issued by mr chanos "is the biggest misrepresentation and pack of lies youve ever read in your life " born years ago in tiny munfordville ky william thurman walters says his real passion was "always built around risk taking " he started gambling young carrying on a family tradition "my father was a poker player my uncle bill was a professional poker player i had two cousins who were pro poker players " he even took a few cues from the pulpit "the preacher wasnt up there advocating gambling but he wasnt saying youre going to hell for doing it either " at age he says he lost all his savings &# betting on his beloved new york yankees against the brooklyn dodgers in the world series "whether youve got &# or &# million if you lose all youve got its pretty traumatic " he said "it made me even more determined " in bored by a job as a car wholesaler to dealers in louisville he decided to become a bookie and quickly went afoul of kentucky law "i was as guilty as i could be " he says "i was a bookmaker without a license " he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and paid a &# fine a few years later he successfully petitioned the court to expunge the record but the legal tangle left him with a clear choice go back to selling cars or move to las vegas where gambling was legal when he arrived "i was broke had no money " he recalls eventually he amassed a small fortune as part of a sports betting syndicate and began collecting homes in las vegas the bahamas and california as the years went by he became an established member of the community named philanthropist of the year by a local charitable organization in he cuts a dashing figure on the local social scene with his gray mane and a sweet smile that crinkles his nose most days he wears loose fitting hawaiian shirts hes been known to bet on anything including single putts in a golf game although he says he now bets solely on sports namely college and pro football as well as college basketball in his biggest single take he says he won &# million this year wagering that the university of southern california would beat the university of michigan in the rose bowl usc won but things have not always gone smoothly for mr walters in las vegas even when he came out on top in he was acquitted in federal court on charges related to illegal bookmaking and in the late s mr walters was thrice indicted in nevada charged with conspiracy and money laundering related to his gambling operations judges dismissed the charges each time without a trial by then he had already begun to invest in real estate and was renovating and selling golf courses after profitably flipping links in new mexico illinois and arizona he considered prospects closer to home "las vegas at the time undoubtedly was the best golf market or had the potential to be the best golf market in the united states " he says along the way he came to know and support local politicians often financially in four commissioners in clark county where las vegas is located recused themselves from voting on a land deal citing their friendships with mr walters and a competing developer the remaining three commissioners voted to allow mr walters to build a golf course on the strip las vegass main boulevard none of his deals however has garnered as much attention as the golf course on city owned land now known as royal links golf club in the late s and s the city purchased land adjacent to its sewage plant to prevent housing from being built near the foul smelling site "it stunk like the dickens " mr walters recalls but in when the city decided to take proposals for the land to be developed as a golf course mr walters tossed in an offer several times during the bidding process mr walters received favorable treatment according to the report issued by the attorney generals office for example after mr walters won the contract to lease the land the citys public works director richard goecke agreed to have the city build a water pumping system for the golf course even though bidding documents had said that the developer would have to provide water in the end mr walters paid for the work but the city still agreed to reimburse him essentially granting him free water worth &# million mr goecke who has since retired didnt return calls seeking comment as construction of the golf facility neared completion in mr walters decided he wanted to own royal links instead of just renting the land the city agreed to sell him the land but only with a deed restriction that it would remain a golf course forever even then the price that mr walters paid &# was considerably less than the estimated &# million the city had spent to assemble the land its unclear why the city sold the land for a lesser price than it paid for it virginia valentine the city manager at the time says the appraised value of the land dropped once the city restricted its use to a golf course despite his bullish predictions about las vegas golf courses mr walters eventually found his golf investments including royal links suffering in a saturated market in he received a tentative offer for the course the offer came with a major hitch the buyer would pay up only if the city council agreed to lift the six year old deed restriction so houses could be built on it mr walters declined the offer but it gave him an idea in april mr walters went back to the city council he offered to pay the city &# million to have the building restrictions lifted by that time the treatment plants odor problems had been addressed through better technology a city appraisal predicted the value of the land would jump from &# million as a golf course to &# million if used for houses a difference of &# million mayor goodman who had represented mob figures including tony "the ant" spilotro as a criminal defense attorney before becoming a politician says mr walterss &# million offer "sounded good" to him after all it was money the city wouldnt get otherwise but city councilwoman lois tarkanian wife of former university of nevada las vegas basketball coach jerry tarkanian says she was concerned whether the city was getting a good enough price on nov the city council voted to approve mr walterss &# million offer with mrs tarkanian the only dissenter of mrs tarkanian mr walters says "shes well intended and i dont mean this with any disrespect but shes dumber than a road lizard " mrs tarkanian who holds a ph d in human behavior says people thanked her for her vote the next day the las vegas police department issued its report saying that "very questionable acts" by the public works director mr goecke had favored mr walters in a way that was detrimental to other bidders when mr walters first acquired the land in the late s "if these acts had been investigated at the time of occurrence felony criminal charges would have been submitted to the district attorneys office for review " but the report said the statute of limitations had run out yet mr chanos the attorney general thought there might be other crimes he could still prosecute he decided to farm out his investigation to the law firm of senn meulemans llp the reason his own land deal was coming up for review by the city council mr chanos had put &# into a partnership on land being bought by a developer who hoped to get the zoning changed by the city council the body approved the zoning in january and the land was sold netting mr chanos half the profits about &# million though he received heavy criticism for the transaction which mayor goodman said "didnt pass the smell test " mr chanos says the land deal was "as clean as clean can get " he adds that he signed a personal loan guarantee of &# million and that the land would have sold even if the council had denied the zoning change the senn meulemans report issued last fall criticized the citys dealings with mr walters saying that the lifting of the deed restriction to allow housing at royal links was "clearly a violation of the public purpose doctrine" of state law the recently elected attorney general catherine cortez masto told her staff to continue the investigation though she says she will defer to the fbi if it takes the case federal agents are reviewing the file says david staretz chief division counsel for the fbi in las vegas mr walters says he isnt worried "im extremely confident that once someone looks at what the facts are well get this controversy cleared up " he says "and hopefully the people at the city will get comfortable with the fact that they havent been doing things with a crook for the past years "
