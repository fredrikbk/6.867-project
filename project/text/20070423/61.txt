spitzers moonlighting memo to new york governor eliot spitzer you arent attorney general anymore that seems worth underlining given the rumblings out of the states division of human rights that suggest mr spitzer has yet to give up his role as lord high executioner the governors agency for handling discrimination issues is making its top priority a noisy investigation into h&amp r block readers familiar with mr spitzers losing court record as ag will recognize that this probe is dripping sour grapes this is the same h&amp r block that last year handed mr spitzer a humiliating legal defeat in the middle of the tax season and election campaign the ag alleged that the tax preparer had fraudulently sold retirement savings plans when block ceo mark ernst refused to settle mr spitzer threw one of his famous tantrums threatening fines and hinting at a corporate indictment a judge later agreed with block that mr spitzer had no jurisdiction mr spitzer spent his waning days as ag filing a re tooled suit which is pending now comes his human rights commissioner kumiki gibson whom mr spitzer appointed after he won the governorship and not long after he lost the block suit in december her agency has authority to investigate anything with a whiff of discrimination yet the agencys web site notes only two probes over the past four months and lo the big one centers on the very company that embarrassed ms gibsons boss she is targeting a block service that provides taxpayers with short term cash advances against their anticipated income tax refunds consumers pay a fee and high interest rates and so naturally ms gibson is alleging that h&amp r block and such firms as jackson hewitt and liberty tax service "target low income communities of color" with "high interest loans " this mirrors mr spitzers suit against block which also played the race and class cards and its just as flimsy millions of americans use refund loans which allow individuals to get an advance on their refund within days of filing their taxes many are indeed low income and minority yet this is no surprise because many live on tight budgets and cant afford to wait months for the tax bureaucracy to return their dollars many also lack bank accounts and thus are unable to utilize the governments speedier direct deposit service yes interest rates can be high but nobody is forcing taxpayers to use the loan refund service and even ms gibson doesnt suggest tax preparers are hiding its costs meanwhile the human rights probe was also announced at the height of tax season all the better to pressure block to settle and in a familiar spitzer pattern ms gibson issued a press release announcing her probe on march a day before her office informed block she then refused to allow block more than days to respond unless it first agreed that her office had full jurisdiction block declined the offer the agency then issued subpoenas sound familiar ms gibsons press release suggests her suit was inspired by complaints from such outfits as the national consumer law center yet such groups fire off almost daily missives accusing companies of fleecing low income americans and tax preparers are hardly alone in offering refund loans car dealers also apply anticipated refunds toward down payments why pick on block payback perhaps meantime ms gibson has her own discrimination suit to handle after she fired two white staffers we havent looked at the merits of that suit but we doubt it can be any less justified than the campaign against block that she seems to be carrying out to please mr spitzer
