the morning brief a big deal but abn may still be in play online edition the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here the british financial conglomerate barclays has agreed to buy abn amro for billion euros &# billion in a deal announced this morning that was aimed at cleanly wrapping up the dutch banks somewhat messy process of selling itself but the success of that effort may be judged by how abn now deals with the hostile bidder still circling its gates the barclays offer mostly composed of its own stock amounts to euros for each share of abn a premium over abns closing price before the two banks talks were made public last month and that may seem a pretty good deal for barclays which aims to create a banking colossus that has branches stretching from india to brazil as bloomberg reports but rijkman groenink abns chief executive is still scheduled to meet this afternoon with rival bidders from a consortium that includes fellow dutch bank fortis banco santander central hispano of spain and the royal bank of scotland group while the long awaited european follow up to american bank industry consolidation seems to be here at last with all the global competition ramifications that implies "it isnt happening in the orderly fashion europes bankers expected as hedge funds and other activist investors plunge in and try and shape the outcomes " the wall street journal notes during the weekend negotiations that closed the deal mr groenink even reversed his opposition to selling part of abn the u s bank lasalle in order to make abn less attractive to the consortium which would break up the abn empire if it succeeds in out negotiating barclays lasalle is being sold to bank of america for &# billion in cash the journal sees that deal as a bet by bofa chairman and chief executive kenneth d lewis that the acquisition bofas third major purchase in six months wont undermine the image he has carefully developed for bofa as "a superb banking operator" that isnt over acquisitive if the barclays deal goes through mr groenink is expected to take a less senior role with barclays chief john varley running a combined entity operating under the barclays name and abn supervisory board chairman arthur martinez hoping to assume the new banks chairmanship the financial times says but as the journal notes abn shareholders could still vote to override the lasalle sale and there remain many other complications that could undermine the barclays abn merger to compete with the americans and other global banking giants european banking leaders are trying all kinds of deal making to get into new markets to the east and around the world especially those "where consumers are rapidly taking up credit cards mortgages and other services " the journal says but "as they seek friendly deals european ceos risk putting their companies in play exposing the banks to unwelcome suitors or losing control of the sale process " center left vs center right for france in overwhelmingly choosing nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal for the final round of presidential elections in two weeks an historically divided french electorate seemed bent on avoiding the first round results that tarnished the countrys version of democracy much as the finish did for the u s with an turnout the highest since as le monde notes voters fled from the "little" candidates on either side of the political spectrum and went with the standard bearers of the two main parties the governing center right ump and the essentially center left socialists the national fronts demagogic leader jean marie le pen whose second round appearance last time guaranteed president jacques chiracs reelection came in fourth with just and even the won by the mainstream alternative to mr sarkozy and ms royal the relatively centrist former cabinet minister francois bayrou was significantly less than the of the votes won by ms royal and mr sarkozys with just two out of candidates remaining the french on may will have what newsweek calls "one of the clearest ideological choices" in decades "sarkozy presents himself as a partisan of freer markets tighter law enforcement and warm relations with the u s " the magazine notes "royal the first woman ever to make it into the second round proposes a greater emphasis on social justice and education " and she is "deeply skeptical of the policies pursued by the u s administration" of president bush mr sarkozy would seem to have the upper hand mr bayrous party has allied with mr sarkozys in the past and mr le pens followers if they dont abstain out of disgust with the mainstream would almost definitely adhere to the tough talk on immigration and crime that already attracted fn voters to the former interior minister mr sarkozys biggest goal now is to ease the anxiety of bayrou voters and others who made their first round choice as part of what the left leaning liberation calls the "anyone but sarkozy" movement and his relatively humble speech last night respectful of ms royal and the "diversity" of france seemed aimed at doing just that for ms royal who strangely delayed her post election appearance and almost seemed dazed when she addressed supporters the mission is to show she has what the times of london describes as "the stature of a head of state " a series of campaign gaffes especially on foreign policy issues cost ms royal credibility and for a while lifted mr bayrou in the polls socialists and others on the left flocked back to her side in time for yesterdays vote but she seems to face an uphill battle in demonstrating her competence to the rest of the electorate she now needs the two will hold a television debate may widespread irregularities in nigerian vote on another electoral front nigerias hopes for the first successful democratic change of power in its history seem likely to be dashed by widespread reports of ballot box transgressions in weekend voting the two main opposition candidates vice president atiku abubakar and former general muhammadu buhari today accused the governing peoples democratic party of

regime behavior " her wish to draw tehran into the talks contrasts with her past resistance on the matter the ft notes adding that it signals washington may be ready for "a serious exchange of views "

on options backdating an examination by the san jose mercury news of the backdated stock options granted to apple chief executive steve jobs shows "there is scant evidence if any to support criminal charges against the silicon valley icon " and that the prospect of a criminal case against mr jobs seems dim the paper reports "despite apples disclosure that jobs approved widespread backdating at apple there is no evidence he directed the backdating of his own grant or covered it up afterward based on a review of regulatory filings and interviews with lawyers intimately familiar with the grant who asked not to be identified " the mercury news says "a close review of the events that led to the controversial grant reveals that the backdating emerged from a good faith although clumsy attempt by apples board of directors to reward its star chief executive for resurrecting a moribund company " also of note washington post the food and drug administration has known for years about
