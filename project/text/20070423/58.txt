politics &amp economics strength in newcomers numbers states where immigrants settle are likely to gain political clout record immigration is changing worksites schools television programming and neighborhoods and it is also certain to change congress when house seats are redistributed among the states after the census immigrants legal and illegal will play a key role in the shift of perhaps nine seats to sun belt states from those in the northeast and midwest that trend will only gain steam say demographers at the brookings institution and population reference bureau two washington think tanks that analyzed u s census bureau projections after the census they predict florida where almost one in five residents is an immigrant will add seven congressional seats california which has million immigrants will add two and texas which added immigrants between and will gain eight "that probably even understates the gains " says william frey a brookings demographer "the more immigrants the more these same states are going to get a bigger piece of the pie " it seems unlikely that a big inflow of new residents wont have some impact on a states political complexion although it is hard to predict how they would affect election results still many of the states that will gain seats voted republican in the elections while most of those that are expected to lose seats voted democratic the constitution requires a census every years to divvy up house seats there are currently based on each states population it requires that all "free persons" be counted which is taken to include legal and illegal immigrants and long term visitors that means that much of the coming political shift will be caused by people who arent citizens and may have no prospect of voting whatever congress does about immigration also is likely to have an impact on the political scene a bipartisan house bill to be debated later this year would admit guest workers yearly under a new six year visa among other things those people would likely be counted in the census and would increase the electoral strength of the states where they take jobs just as illegal immigrants are increasing the clout of states where they have settled demographers say states with low immigration will take the biggest hits after the next three censuses ohio and pennsylvania are expected to lose four seats each by and michigan will lose two in some northeastern states that will lose seats growing immigrant populations are forestalling even bigger losses caused by the continuing shift of native born americans to the south and west even new york where the number of immigrants grew by between and nevertheless is expected to lose six congressional seats over the next three censuses if voters in the states that pick up seats stick to their current voting patterns brookingss mr frey calculates that republicans after will have a vote advantage in the electoral college which elects the president and has members one for every house and senate member and three for the district of columbia in republican states had a vote advantage he says most of the million foreign born residents in the u s dont vote so their political influence is limited that is because about one third are here illegally and only of legal immigrants and of legal mexican born immigrants are citizens says the pew hispanic center a washington think tank most immigrants also live in either solidly republican states including texas or solidly democratic states including california where even their huge numbers arent likely to be enough to shift parties however immigrants could cast decisive votes in a handful of swing states where hispanic populations are soaring hispanics now are of the population in once reliably republican arizona and in nevada but so far account for relatively few voters immigrants also are starting to move in big numbers into the deep south where they could upend longtime republican strongholds georgia where the immigrant population doubled between and will add a congressional seat after the census north carolina whose foreign born population has more than quintupled since will gain a seat after the votes of those legal immigrants are still up for grabs democrats cornered the majority of hispanic votes in the past three presidential elections but by a smaller margin each time the republican party tirelessly courted hispanics for years but was hurt in by a house republican sponsored bill that was largely seen as anti immigrant but even illegal immigrants will have a growing impact in the house because they are counted in the census rob paral in a study for the nonpartisan immigration policy center in washington estimates there are four congressional districts with at least illegal immigrants each and another with or more lawmakers representing those districts generally voted against the tough house bill and tend to favor the approach of this years bill which is sympathetic to immigrants "you cant define your constituency selectively you need to care about the people who live" there mr paral says each congressional district has roughly the same number of people about after the census but some districts with many illegal immigrants have relatively few voters which gives those voters more clout the center for immigration studies a washington think tank that favors reduced immigration says that in it took fewer than votes to win a seat in two california districts that have lots of illegal immigrants by contrast it took about votes to win the typical congressional race in pennsylvania wisconsin and other low immigration states the flow of new immigrants also could upset african american representation in the house university of maryland professor james gimpel who studies african american political power says as many as six black house democrats could lose their seats after the census as it is he says hispanics outnumber blacks in five districts now represented by blacks "it depends on how fast latinos decide to naturalize " says mr gimpel the number of adult immigrants of all nationalities who are eligible for citizenship is huge million in california in new york and in florida says the catholic legal immigration network the house bill offers eventual legal status to the estimated million illegal immigrants who would be eligible to vote in about years if the measure passes immigrant groups predict but even if it doesnt pass with the economy hungry for workers there is no appetite among majorities in either party to make them go home
