politics &amp economics sarkozy royal emerge in french vote right left choice awaits in runoff as centrist falters conservative nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal advanced to the final round of the french presidential election pitting two flashy personalities in a traditional right left battle over how to revive the worlds fifth largest economy the success of "sego" and "sarko " as the french media have dubbed them dashes prospects of a realignment in french politics toward the center such a repositioning has been seen recently in other western european countries most notably germany and had been advocated by frances popular centrist candidate francois bayrou who placed third in yesterdays vote french voters will have to choose between mr sarkozy the year old son of a hungarian immigrant who is pro business and vows to boost his law and order record and ms royal who hopes to become the first woman president of france by promising social harmony and higher welfare spending the final round of voting is in two weeks on may "french people wanted a choice between two ideas of the nation two projects for society two value systems and two conceptions of politics " mr sarkozy said in a speech last night the choice they make will have large implications for the rest of europe france has been a leader in european union affairs notably with regard to the regions relationship with the u s but france embodies the woes that are dragging down europe though it boasts leading companies in the energy engineering and pharmaceutical sectors france suffers from a unemployment rate and a billowing public debt violent riots that rocked the countrys impoverished suburbs in the fall of underscored the unrest of the countrys growing mostly muslim immigrant population many people feel frances problems have been exacerbated under president jacques chirac who often focused on grand overtures on the international stage but did little to improve peoples everyday lives "france must rise again " said robert benaddi a handyman and electrician as he drank a beer in a bar in central paris after casting his vote for mr bayrou "there has to be less unemployment fewer people in misery " deep disaffection prompted voters to turn out en masse in yesterdays elections nearly of the electorate cast their ballot to choose among candidates including four communists and an antiglobalization militant after a m in paris with out of frances departments or territories reporting mr sarkozy took of the vote and ms royal according to frances interior ministry mr bayrou received and far right anti immigration national front leader jean marie le pen was fourth with much of the enthusiasm among french voters lies in the novelty of mr sarkozy and ms royal at least in style if not in substance they are part of a new generation of politicians with thin ties to the politics that have dominated france since world war ii born after the war mr sarkozy and ms royal have kept their distance from what was regarded as the brainchild of frances post war policy the eu both have criticized the independence of the european central bank over monetary policy for example and said france shouldnt hesitate to be more protectionist if europe is helpless in shielding french industries against asian competition they are both making their first run for the presidential palace and while they are career politicians both have taken liberty with the dogmas of their parties though pro business mr sarkozy has criticized executives who receive huge paychecks ms royal has proposed military training for young delinquents and urged people to be more patriotic by displaying the french flag in their windows voters desire for change helped mr bayrou emerge despite his failure to advance the history professor and race horse breeder could play a key role by endorsing either of the two final candidates some voters said they hoped mr bayrou could yet provide a centrist balance to the two front runners "france is an old country that needs to adapt to modern reality " said vincent grubesa a year old dental surgeon who voted for mr bayrou "i fear that with the right left confrontation we will remain stuck in ideological debate " as they look ahead aides to both candidates predict the final round campaign will focus on two issues can mr sarkozy appeal to centrist voters after a rightward drift during the first round campaign and can ms royal win over skeptics who say she isnt fit for the job "nicolas will show off his capacity to act and deliver " said patrick balkany a french lawmaker and a friend of mr sarkozy "he will make ms royal look ridiculous " jean pierre chevenement a former interior minister and an adviser to ms royal said in response to similar claims "these are macho allegations she has demonstrated that she can be hard headed and sensitive all qualities required for a head of state " last night as the votes of the first round were still being counted french polling agency ifop released a survey based on interviews saying that in the second round mr sarkozy was expected to win the election with of the vote compared to ms royals mr sarkozy started his campaign last year by addressing business issues positioning himself between free market and state intervention he promised to introduce flexibility in the short time workweek regime and lower taxes for companies but insisted the government should support key strategic industries over the past months however mr sarkozy has tried to capitalize on concerns about public safety that were heightened months ago by frances violent riots mr sarkozys tough guy persona helped him take votes away from mr le pens national front which is adamantly anti immigration but mr sarkozys rightward shift may have alienated more centrist voters while the candidate has said he would lead a different campaign in the next round it is unclear if he can soften his image enough to grab votes from centrist and disheartened socialist voters ms royal has focused on social issues including improving schools for youths in frances impoverished suburbs and introducing stricter penalties for offenders of domestic violence she has also suggested raising the minimum wage and helping young people get started in their professional life through state backed loans in her speech last night she called for the support of "all those who believe that france can be reformed without brutality " christina passariello and marie valla contributed to this article
