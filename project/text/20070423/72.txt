the gray ladys virtue the new york times co will come under attack at its annual meeting this week those urging shareholders to withhold their vote from the companys nominees for director point to a falling stock price diminished earnings and a host of perceived sins by company management what should worry those who care about the new york times is not the nature of the criticism but the proposed remedy the abolition of the two tier stock structure that allows the sulzberger family to elect of the companys board the washington post co of which i am the ceo has a similar stock structure so does dow jones &amp co the publisher of this newspaper and so do quite a few other companies including google inc which proves that a two tier stock structure doesnt necessarily lead to an underperforming stock as the wall street journal has written our company has had its differences with the new york times co but to support morgan stanleys campaign to eliminate that companys two tiered stock structure is to run crazy risks with the future of its most important asset the new york times why because if the stock structure were eliminated a line of buyers eager to purchase the company would form within minutes no one could say no the line would include private equity firms high ego billionaires international media companies lacking a famous property and lots more who would bid the highest perhaps a principled owner dedicated to the welfare of the times and the boston globe willing to anger its friends on a regular basis as good newspapers do and prepared to spend money and run other risks to sustain the paper like the sulzbergers or maybe the bidder would be someone quite different it isnt guaranteed that anyone owning the times would spend more than &# million on its newsroom budget or deploy dozens of foreign correspondents around the world sending any one of those reporters overseas costs lots of money and doesnt add a penny to this years circulation or advertising revenue the times sent them abroad in the belief that in the long term the paper would mean more to its unusual set of readers if it gave them an extensive report on the world and the country no newspaper has been exempt from the economic challenges of recent years yet i would guess that in each of the last few years the times has published the highest profit newspaper in the united states and going forward into the internet age what large newspaper holds cards as good as the new york times and nytimes com i can only think of one the morgan stanley money manager who recommended overturning the two tier structure knew exactly what he was doing it would bring him a huge quick profit but what can we say of institutional shareholder services the supposedly public minded research firm which has recommended following the money managers lead three years ago iss was responsible for perhaps the single silliest recommendation ever made to shareholders that they vote against warren buffetts re election to the coca cola board because im not kidding dairy queen and some other berkshire hathaway subsidiaries did business with coca cola this created a "conflict " iss was displeased because mr buffett served on cokes audit committee and it recommended a vote against his re election presumably his &# billion investment in coca cola was not enough to ensure that he would act in its interests i am in a position to testify to mr buffetts value on a board of directors since our board is now the only one he serves on outside of berkshire hathaways our market capitalization is just over &# billion mr buffetts recommendations to management have been worth no question billions his value to any companys board is incalculable iss later explained that although it recommended a vote against mr buffett for director it didnt really want him off the board presumably they counted on a majority of shareholders being too sane to follow their advice iss now follows up its buffett recommendation with support for a proposal which if adopted would lead to the new york times co being auctioned off like a side of beef after two such demonstrations of devotion to its rules regardless of practical effects iss has shown the need for a management change in at least one institution one tier or two public companies and their boards are responsible for increasing the long term value of their shareholders investments has the new york times co s management done its job well or badly its believers can buy more shares its critics can sell or recommend changes but those proposed changes ought to be scrutinized as carefully as managements performance the current stock structure of the new york times co was established when the company initially went public and it meets the requirements of the new york stock exchange every buyer who ever purchased a share of its stock has done so under those governance arrangements and a sophisticated buyer like morgan stanley understood those arrangements the washington post co went public in june at the very time we were being threatened by the government with the seizure of our broadcast licenses if we followed the new york times in publishing the pentagon papers we did print them that very week katharine graham the companys ceo would go on to increase the stock price by more than in the next years this is what the offering prospectus she signed told those who might purchase the stock i would guess similar words were written in new york "the washington post has the reputation of being an outspoken observer of local national and world events the management of the company and the editorial staff of the post have historically placed great emphasis on the newspapers public responsibilities as expressed in the companys certificate of incorporation which states that it is the companys purpose to publish any newspaper owned by the company as an independent newspaper dedicated to the welfare of the community and the nation in keeping with the principles of a free press publishing the post in keeping with those principles has involved and will continue to involve substantial expenses not necessarily compensated for by increased revenues incurred in endeavoring to achieve and to maintain editorial excellence and independence as well as to provide outstanding news collection and reporting " anyone who cares a bit about what the new york times at its best has stood for should vote against morgan stanleys recommendations mr graham is chairman and ceo of the washington post co
