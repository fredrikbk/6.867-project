on investing investment choices to cut your taxes if youre salting money away for retirement in a tax deferred account odds are youve loaded up on stocks but it may make sense to also put bonds or bond mutual funds into an individual retirement account k or similar investment plan although stocks are a great growth engine delivering higher returns than bonds and cash over most longer periods of time bonds can diversify and stabilize your portfolio some types of bonds and bond mutual funds also make much more sense tax wise in a tax deferred account than in a taxable one while there can be tax benefits to owning stocks and some stock funds outside these accounts dont make changes to your retirement accounts in isolation however instead view an ira or k as just part of your larger investment portfolio says michael kuziw a senior asset manager at lenox advisors a new york based adviser say you want to have more stocks than bonds overall for the stocks higher expected returns mr kuziw suggests putting half of a tax deferred account into stocks and half into bonds by holding additional stocks or stock funds outside that account you can tilt your overall mix more toward long term growth tax deferred accounts allow you to grow assets for years without paying taxes on the earnings even if you sell securities for more than you paid or collect regular dividends or interest so it makes sense to put in these sheltered accounts your least tax efficient investments those that throw off a lot of taxable income once you tap the accounts in retirement youre taxed on what you withdraw at your ordinary income rate currently the top rate is in ordinary taxable accounts meanwhile there are some significant tax breaks available to stock investors capital gains on stocks owned for more than one year and certain dividends are now taxed at a maximum of only at the federal level and if you take a loss in a stock you can use that to offset a like amount of capital gains in contrast if you collect such income within a tax deferred account it will eventually be taxed at the same higher rate that applies to your other retirement income notes eric siber an executive vice president at parsippany n j based brokerage jbhanauer &amp co you can avoid losing the benefit of the lower long term capital gains tax rate by putting stocks that seem to have the brightest growth prospects and that you expect to own for some time into a tax deferred account that often means stocks of small and midsize companies although large stocks also may appreciate strongly over long periods keep in mind that gains realized in a year or less dont qualify for a lower tax rate that rule of tax law also should shape where you stash stock mutual funds their style could make a big difference to your tax liability so called tax efficient funds belong in a taxable account their managers aim to avoid trades that result in lots of capital gains particularly the short term gains that are taxed at the higher ordinary income rate index funds also are tax efficient and thus a good fit for taxable accounts in seeking to match the performance of a broad market gauge like the standard &amp poors stock index they dont buy or sell many securities funds that work better within a tax deferred account are those that use active management strategies their managers may buy and sell more aggressively to boost returns and more turnover can mean extra taxable gains youll sometimes find high turnover in funds that focus on small u s stocks or emerging markets stocks says mr kuziw if you own high dividend stocks in an ira or k you give up the benefit of the lower tax rate on dividends but such holdings can still make sense particularly for older investors says john diehl senior vice president in the retirement solutions group at hartford financial services group such stocks tend to gyrate less when markets are rising or falling "these stocks will help buffer volatility which becomes more of a concern when you are drawing income from an account " mr diehl says among bonds and bond funds treasurys and investment grade or high yield corporate bonds are appropriate to a tax deferred vehicle the income from them is taxed at the same ordinary income rates regardless of where you hold them zero coupon treasurys which dont pay interest until maturity also make sense if you own them outside a tax deferred account youre required to declare and pay tax each year on the interest youve earned on paper but havent actually received similarly tax deferred accounts are a good place to hold treasury inflation protected securities the governments inflation indexed bonds investors who own individual tips directly in a taxable account are required to pay tax each year on gains they havent actually pocketed that issue doesnt arise if you own tips within a mutual fund municipal bonds are a poor choice for a qualified account interest they pay usually is exempt from federal income tax and sometimes from state income tax if you earn it within such an account it becomes taxable once you draw it out at retirement bonds now pay relatively low interest rates so its important to get them in a cost efficient way such as through mutual funds with relatively low expenses email forum sunday wsj com
