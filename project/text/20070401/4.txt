in times of grief scam artists arrive families in mourning have yet another burden to contend with in the weeks and months following the death of a loved one avoiding a growing number of scams designed to take advantage of their grief con artists approach families by phone mail and personal visits typically claiming they are owed money after having sold a product or service to the decedent they can trip up victims with phony contracts or aggressive demands individuals who might react with suspicion under normal circumstances may be too exhausted or overwhelmed when grieving making them an easy mark "people will take advantage of you when youre at your most vulnerable " says shirley rooker president of call for action a nonprofit consumer organization in bethesda md "you have to be on your guard " lawyers and consumer advocates advise families to figure out how theyll handle claims on the estate before the obituary runs in the local paper legitimate debts need to be paid so its not practical to ignore every claim you dont recognize but experts say there are several ways people can lower the risk of falling victim to a scam ask for proof of the claim in writing call back the agency or company thats supposedly involved to verify the legitimacy of the person who approached family members above all dont act or agree to make payment immediately "predators prey on peoples desperation on not giving you time to think " says melanie lee an estate planning attorney in richmond va official looking papers ms lee says that at least once or twice a year clients complain about illegitimate claims following the death of a loved one she recalls one richmond widow in her late s who got a call from someone who said the womans late husband had signed up for a real estate investment service shortly afterward the widow got a package in the mail with official looking documents related to the service the scammer even visited the widow to demand payment three months after the initial call ms lee advised her client not to act until they could verify the claim no one found any evidence that the husband had signed up for the service and eventually the person stopped contacting the widow a variation of the "services" scam is to claim payment is still outstanding on a product such as a piece of jewelry or a fancy pen the product ploy is sometimes conducted by mail with the item and an inflated invoice sent to the decedents home ms rooker of call for action says her group got a call from a woman who was targeted three weeks after her husbands death a man claiming to be a jeweler said the womans late husband had bought a ring and still needed to make one more payment on it the caller grew more aggressive when the widow tried to put him off he said the ring was engraved so she had to buy it the widow told the caller to keep the ring and the money hed already received later she looked through credit card and bank records and found no record of the transaction when an unfamiliar request for payment comes in zan deery chief investigator at the better business bureau in spokane wash suggests asking for a name mailing address and callback number and replying with lots of follow up questions "dont let them take control of the situation and start pounding you with personal questions " ms deery says she also suggests families set up a protective wall around the person who is most vulnerable such as a surviving spouse obituaries tend to give a lot of personal information including the widow or widowers name and the length of the marriage making it easy to pinpoint potential victims consider having the surviving spouse and other family members direct all claims to an attorney or one selected member of the family that might be the executor named in the will whose role includes handling claims against the estate and distributing assets to heirs in another type of scam ms deery of the better business bureau remembers a man who got a call from someone claiming to be an insurance agent the "agent" told the widower that his wifes life insurance policy was delinquent and that he had to pay &# before the funds could be released to the funeral home a second person claiming to be from the funeral home was also on the line the "agent" asked the widower for his credit card number so he could take a partial payment and told him to wire the rest of the money to the company the widower who refused the requests later found that the insurance agent and funeral home employee were both frauds kansas insurance commissioner sandy praeger advises families that get a call about insurance to contact the insurance company or the state insurance commissioner before making any decision the state can tell you at the minimum if the company mentioned is actually a legitimate insurance provider "that doesnt take long " ms praeger says and it can be the difference between being scammed and staying safe you can find the web site for your states insurance commissioner by going to naic org and clicking on the "naic states and jurisdictions" link on the left side of the page also confirm a callers identity whenever anyone asks for personal information you dont want to be a victim of identity theft in which fraudsters sell that information or use it to obtain credit in a milwaukee man was sentenced to three years in prison after applying for credit in the names of two men one dead and posing as an agent with the wisconsin department of revenue gary r piehl found targets by scanning the obituaries and would get personal information from the surviving spouse under the pretext of looking into the decedents final income tax return according to the criminal complaint last summer at least two recent widows in montana
