love &amp money follow up a minivan and a new life its time to tie up some loose ends now and then i return to previous columns to close the loop on issues ive raised in the past that at that moment were still in flux this week they involve three columns one involves a friend of mine who quit her old life to start anew and two involve issues where my wife amy and i were on opposing sides we either had to find common ground or one of us would have to back down about a year ago i wrote about my san francisco friend debra who had decided to leave a successful corporate life in favor of working in retail fashion despite the dramatic differences in lifestyle such a change would usher in well she learned a lot this past year debra has been working for an upscale clothing boutique making far less than the six figures she pulled in as a public relations manager but sometime this week she will be resigning "i really enjoy dressing women " she says "and i iove that my reading list is the american and british versions of vogue rather than forbes fortune and businessweek but i have lost all the job flexibility i once had " two examples her employer wont allow her a day off to attend the th anniversary party her boyfriend is holding for his parents nor is she allowed a day off even without pay to attend her nephews birthday party in new york "ive sacrificed for years to pay my dues and ive reached a point where i cant be in a job that does not allow any flexibility in my schedule to live my life " she says shes also struggling with the dramatic financial chasm between her old life and her new one her first check was &# her previous paychecks were nearly five times that amount that has forced her to dig deep into the financial cushion she built up before taking off down this new path in short debra has found that she has picked the right career but the wrong job she says going back to the public relations career she left "would be a failure " moreover she doesnt envy the worker bees she sees on the train each morning buried in their laptops and their powerpoint presentations still she realizes that public relations is one of her strengths and that the pay and flexibility are better so shes thinking about perhaps going back into the business but in the fashion industry in the meantime she is out pounding the pavement again looking for a job at a high end fashion retailer and this time shes going to be upfront in the interviews about negotiating a more flexible schedule "when im and i look back on the time i left my career at i think i will see this experience as a highlight in my life " she says "i know lots of people cannot afford to do this or are too scared to do this and i have really appreciated this opportunity to change my life " of all the checks ive written in my life none was as unfulfilling as the one i wrote in a car showroom earlier this month i even noted to amy at the time that ive never felt so numb spending so much on something i so dont want she laughed said "yes i can tell" then drove off the lot minutes later in her new minivan amy as i wrote in july was looking to replace an aging suv with something more family friendly and in better repair she wanted a minivan her reasoning was hard to fault she needed a family friendly car i knew i had no right to tell amy what kind of car she could buy since she had let me buy the jeep i wanted but i was sick at the thought of a minivan which i knew id have to drive from time to time it was irrational but i just didnt want to be a minivan kind of guy at the end of the day however i lived up to my word to stay quiet and let her pick her car at least shes happy with her minivan a couple of years ago i wrote about the wisdom of extended warranties and insurance on everything from new cellphones to the possibility that a family vacation is canceled i tend to reject those sales pitches while amy has been much more inclined to consider them when she was planning our coming trip to disney world for instance she bought travel insurance which made me groan audibly when i saw the charge for several hundred dollars well we not only have a minivan we have an extended warranty on it too for slightly less than &# amy wanted coverage on the minivan to at least miles nearly triple the factory warranty in this instance i agreed with her rationale the fact is we keep vehicles for a long time her suv was pushing nine years old and i still have a miata from that while it doesnt run will be repaired one day when i can afford to fix it where we disagreed is on a pair of additional extended warranties she wanted that would cover the interior and exterior for five years basically they would replace any carpet or seat covering that is stained beyond repair and protect the body paint so that you never have to wax the vehicle or so the salesman told amy the cost &# her argument is that "for basically &# a year we dont have to worry about stains in the carpet from the kids and we dont have to worry about the paint fading " essentially she is very proud of her shiny new vehicle and wants to keep it that way however absurd that dream is with two kids my argument at the time was far less sophisticated "i dont want to spend more money right now " i told her its kind of a lame argument i know because it ignores whether its money well spent and it ignores the fact that im adding costs to our bathroom remodeling project costs that amy isnt crazy about it seems hypocritical then to say we dont have enough money for something thats important to her after ive spent all this money on something thats important to me so earlier this week over lunch i casually asked if she was going to take her minivan in to get the extended care warranties i also mentioned that i thought that protecting the interior was probably a pretty good idea given the history of our two little tornadoes but that i was less convinced of the value in the exterior protection she liked that compromise jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney wsj com
