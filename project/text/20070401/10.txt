real time stop the email madness forget spam its unnecessary email that makes our inboxes runneth over online edition its high time all of us agree to address a grave threat that imperils not only our great republic but possibly life itself no not global warming or the possibility of nanotech run amok im talking about the rising tide of unnecessary email that threatens to drown us in apathy and distraction and this particular scourge has nothing to do with anatomy enhancement sellers stock touts phishers or other spammers spam seems to be finally on the wane at least in my inbox but its been replaced by a threat from within one that begins with our colleagues underlings and bosses and of course with ourselves do me a favor and look through your inbox or your deleted items depending on your email habits never mind spam or personal email just focus on the portion coming from within your own organization how much of it did you really need to read how many of those emails are pointless paper trailing and butt covering conversations going on long after you stopped having something to contribute if you did in the first place arguments youre trapped witnessing recurring status notes that no longer concern you or havent registered in years or never to be read corporate rah rah my own unscientific survey of a weeks worth of my email yielded legitimate messages and ones that were delete finger exercises by making communicating so easy email enables lazy communication by giving us a way to exchange messages that arent important enough to require a phone call or a face to face meeting it breeds unimportant communications this isnt bad for our social lives periodic low level chatter between friends and loved ones lets us stay in touch and eases the stresses of the working day but its horrible for our professional lives allowing and even encouraging our inner bureaucrat to come out and play when that inner bureaucrat is unleashed the result is we all get buried in electronic yip yap our inboxes fill with junk and this junk eats away at our attention spans and efficiency struggling with the signal to noise ratio we get tired and when were tired genuinely important messages get accidentally deleted are examined too hastily or are tugged out of reach by the daily tide and followed up on tardily or not at all sending email is easy its reading email that gets hard enough here are five proposed rules to restore sanity and no none of them is completely serious  a numbers tax you get to send an internal email to four people thats it any more than that each recipient costs you a quarter organizations can write off bulk emails as business expenses subject to audits as part of sarbanes oxley cross a certain threshold and you must endure an occupation by management consultants who will fix your organizational structure "fix " in this case of course means "change to something different but not better for an enormous amount of money " yes there are times you really need to send organization wide emails if flushing the toilet in the middle stall guarantees it will overflow for minutes until maintenance arrives in a rowboat or someones locked a rabid raccoon in the coat closet all hands do really need to know that flooding johns or foaming vermin excepted most emails going out to five or more people are wastes of time have a quick meeting or a conference call preferably the latter since it allows for discreet muting of phones and actual work too busy for a bunch of short meetings maybe its because youre wading through all that email if thats too radical how about an indicator of how many people the email has been sent to this would let me route anything with more than recipients straight to my trash and if i was then the one standing astride the geysering toilet or being chased around by a raccoon id claim id never received the message and then bribe the it guy  would you say what you typed i stumbled across a blog entry from lynn gaertner johnston with a great test for whether you should be emailing something she imagines an employee stopping by a managers office a dozen times a day asking for approvals and saying things like "im telling you this so i know you are aware of it in case there is trouble ahead " not many people actually do that in person thank goodness but lots of us do it via email and most of those emails are pointless dysfunctional or both if you wouldnt stop by just to tell your boss "hey i was working on this with the rest of my team on the weekend " dont sneak his or her name onto an email just so your diligence is noticed if you wouldnt drop by and say "ok " when asked to perform some perfectly straightforward task dont email the same digital grade grubbing is still grade grubbing and while youre at it stop paper trailing thats what youre doing when you pepper your boss with buckshot messages about every little thing youre handling i know the objection youve got the kind of boss who forgets whats been agreed to and changes his or her mind later fine email yourself for proof by paper trailing youre really just overwhelming your boss and yourself he or she isnt going to remember your little butt cover later and youve sent out so much stupid email that you wont be able to dig the exoneration out of your sent items  cc reform once upon a time being ccd on something meant you needed to know it but didnt need to respond now it tends to mean youre about to be bored senseless by a long string of messages you didnt need to receive with the original reason for ccs in decline ccing has emerged as a black art one capable of conveying many different office politics signals besides grade grubbing and paper trailing a cc can mean "im telling you this but also indicating i dont think its any of your business " thats a message to the ccd daring them to join the conversation alternately a cc can mean "im telling you this and will call in death dealing artillery if you give me any lip " thats the inverse of the above said to those on the to line while you hope the high ranking person on the cc line doesnt respond but remains a silent threat at least those uses of the cc dont invite more email not so when youre ccd on good news which is the digital equivalent of having the birthday card farewell card birth announcement land on your desk so you can add a generally perfunctory note if youre ccd on glad tidings and dont respond youre a jerk  the are you sure button we need these added to at least two parts of the email experience the first one is the bcc field you havent lived until you bcc somebody for underhanded political reasons only to have that person reply all and immediately reveal that youre a conniving weasel theres no upside to such bccs and considerable downside forward the message instead bccs are chiefly useful for sending out invitations announcements to people in situations where you dont want to start a town meeting reveal a guest list or show everyones email address to everyone else which is good or at least acceptable email etiquette it also doesnt happen often enough that the need to navigate an "are you sure " button would be a burden the other place we need an "are you sure " button is when hitting reply all if youve ever been trapped in clueless reply alls to a list and the inevitable aftershock of people replying all to demand that people stop replying all enough said i can hear you complaining but wait if i have to reply to all the people on the to line and the cc line this will really slow me down youre right maybe itll also make you question whether all those people really need to be on all of these emails  the withdraw button the worst cc experience of all its being an underling trapped on the cc line while two people above your station fight via email this is useful if your therapist has been after you to unearth whatever it was you were feeling while mom and dad screamed at each other in the car heedless of you bawling in the backseat otherwise not so much youll wind up deleting each email as if it were a live grenade and counting the minutes until you can go home unfortunately theres no way to withdraw from this mess without making things worse unless we had a withdraw button that would excuse us from further exchanges without tipping off anyone involved this would also be a boon to luckless workers caught like dolphin in tuna nets in aggravating social emails that just keep on going for five years ive kept outlook from deleting one of my favorite office emails a june one that began with a picture of a friends new puppy and a request for suggested names i know i know that burst of overenthusiasm touched off an overload spiral of appreciations of the puppys cuteness suggested names and pet memories until one co worker struck a blow for all those suffering in silence "how about naming the puppy remove me from this list " we cant all be so blunt what we really need is a little technological help and some much needed reform cmon folks lets give it a try you remove me from this list and ill remove you and when we do talk well know its because we really have something to say tired of email overload got any suggested improvements if you can ignore the irony of emailing about having too much email write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
