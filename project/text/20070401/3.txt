getting going help your kids while youre still here planning to pass along money to your children sure you could wait until your death but theres a good argument for handing over some of your wealth a little earlier here is a look at the benefits and pitfalls of enriching your kids while you are still alive and some thoughts on how to do it should you decide to go ahead yes there are risks involved if you give money to your kids when theyre minors it could hurt their chances of college financial aid even if they are in their s they may not be mature enough to handle the money responsibly there is also the risk that half the money you give to your children could eventually be lost in a divorce and of course theres the biggest risk of all that you will give money to your children and then discover you need it for your own retirement still i believe the potential benefits more than outweigh the risks what benefits for starters it could be a financial bonanza if you invest money in your childrens names and then it is left to compound it should be a huge sum by the time they retire true you could have the money compound in your own name and then bequeath it but the odds are you will save on taxes by putting the money in your childrens names they may be in a lower tax bracket or you might be able to stash money in tax favored accounts getting money out of your name could also trim the federal or state estate tax bill that might be due upon your death suppose you and your spouse have three children in you could give them each &# without worrying about the gift tax and your spouse could do the same thus shrinking your estate by &# maybe more important if you can get money into your childrens names and they start to see it grow they will learn firsthand the value of saving and investing the money will provide them with a sense of financial security and helping them will likely give you a lot of pleasure how should you go about handing over your wealth as i see it the goal is to help your kids pay for major expenses such as a home retirement or the grandchildrens education and by specifying how you would like the money used you are also passing along your values my advice dont just hand over a fat check instead tell your kids why youre giving them the money and then emphasize that by stashing the cash in a separate account as an added bonus if the money you give stays in its own separate account in each childs name theres a good chance they will hang on to it in a divorce which special accounts should you use if you want to give your toddlers a head start on saving for retirement consider opening a low cost variable annuity variable annuities are typically a bum investment but your kids should fare just fine with the low expense offerings from fidelity investments and vanguard group a variable annuity will give them decades of tax deferred growth and the tax penalty on early withdrawals should discourage them from tapping the account before age better still if you have teenagers with earned income help them fund roth individual retirement accounts while a variable annuity provides tax deferred investment growth a roth goes one better offering tax free growth meanwhile if your goal is to assist your youngsters in one day purchasing a house consider buying them mutual funds in a custodial account set up under your states

will mean a modest tax bill dont however put money in your kids names if you expect them to qualify for college financial aid assets held in a childs name can count heavily against the student in the financial aid formulas got grandchildren you might help with college costs by opening college savings plans a plan grows tax free when used for college costs moreover if you as the grandparent control the accounts the money involved should do little or no damage to your grandchildrens aid eligibility once your children are out of college encourage them to stash money in their employers k plan you might for instance offer to subsidize their retirement account contributions giving them maybe cents for every &# they contribute lets say you do that for the first years that your adult children are in the work force so they sock away &# a year from age to age even if they never added another penny the money would be worth almost &# at age this &# which is figured in todays dollars assumes the money clocks a year while inflation runs at if your kids are investing outside a k plan getting them started can mean a hefty outlay because many mutual funds now demand a &# or &# initial investment

through an automatic investment plan first time investors might buy one of the t rowe price retirement funds these funds combine a broad array of market sectors in a single mutual fund thus offering
