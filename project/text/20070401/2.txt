eyes on the road gas prices rise and consumers shrug rhetoric in washington over fuel economy also heats up again online edition the car industry faces a conundrum as it braces for another season of gas price volatility what consumers say and what they do arent in sync when it comes to energy this greatly complicates auto makers struggle to build cars that people want to buy general motors corp s chevrolet aveo is a perky little subcompact rated at miles per gallon on the highway in the environmental protection agencys tests in the u s gm dealers are selling aveo ls hatchbacks which have a sticker price of &# for roughly &# after a &# rebate according to car shopping site edmunds com in germany however gm sells a version of the aveo with a smaller engine at a starting price of euros nearly &# gm doesnt disclose the profit or loss it recognizes on each model line but given that gm effectively broke even in its north american auto operations during the fourth quarter of on an average per vehicle revenue of &# its a reasonable guess that a car selling for &# doesnt do much for the companys bottom line the disparity in prices gm commands for a fuel efficient car in the u s versus europe helps to explain why car makers are cringing at the latest outburst of mileage mania in washington congress is pushing the industry to boost the average mileage of new cars to or miles per gallon while president bush says he wants to increase average fuel economy by a year over the next decade amid all this rhetoric is the reality that day to day most american consumers dont care much and arent willing to pay european prices for a car that today meets the fuel efficiency targets of the future even now gasoline prices are edging up averaging &# a gallon as of march about cents per gallon higher than a year ago according to the federal energy information administration does this mean american motorists are about to fume through another summer of &# a gallon gasoline anyone who knew that for sure would be opening up a swiss bank account the eias is forecasting gasoline prices will stay at around &# this summer higher in places like california thats about cents a gallon less than the april september period in paul ballew gms chief of market and industry analysis allows that theres always a risk of another sustained price spike above &# a gallon but says "its not in the mainstream forecast " george pipas ford motor co s sales analyst says guessing the near term direction of gas prices is a "fools errand " "i dont know that it makes much difference to consumers " he says "they have factored in that gas prices will be higher in the future than they were the last time they purchased a vehicle what they are today is neither here nor there " people say that &# a gallon gas makes them think twice about their energy consumption and what kind of vehicles they drive people say that global warming worries them and that they want to do something about the tons of co that burning fossil fuels pumps into the atmosphere so far however these concerns havent translated into a sustained meaningful decrease in americans gasoline consumption or significantly fewer miles traveled nor has there been a dramatic shift in the kinds of vehicles americans want to buy small cars small crossover wagons and compact trucks make up only about of total retail sales in the u s says gms mr ballew compared to for small vehicles in europe where gas prices are about double u s levels "small cars have underperformed out of the gate this year " as gas prices moderated during the winter months mr ballew says higher gas prices did speed the collapse in demand for so called mid sized sport utility vehicles such as the ford explorer or the chevy trailblazer which were marketed during the s as substitutes for large station wagons or minivans but its just as likely that demand for suv trucks like the explorer began shrinking because auto makers flooded the market with a better alternative five and seven passenger "crossovers" such as the ford edge or gms buick enclave and gmc acadia these crossovers handle and ride more smoothly than a truck and get somewhat better gas mileage still the emphasis is on "somewhat " as in mpg compared to car makers could work harder to influence consumers to choose more efficient vehicles selling high fuel economy the way they have sold a "need" for all wheel drive vehicles or premium sound systems gm for instance is hammering the message that its new large pickups have best in class mileage in part because the company sees that consumers care enough about fuel efficiency to look for the best performer in a given class of vehicles but so far a wholesale shift toward a european style fleet of vehicles which would match the targets coming out of washington d c isnt happening the difference between driving a vehicle that gets mpg and one that averages mpg comes down to about &# a day at current gas prices or less than it costs most people to get out of a starbucks a recent study of gasoline consumption and driving behavior by economists at the university of california davis concluded that consumers now seem to be less affected to changes in gasoline prices than they were in the late s put in unscientific terms consumers are resigning themselves to just sucking it up when pump prices rise with the temperature because that still seems to be the lower cost choice compared to the bother and expense of fundamentally altering their lifestyles send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj
