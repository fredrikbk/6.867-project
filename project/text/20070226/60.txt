real time a classical music mystery alleged hoax leaves classical music world exchanging internet conspiracy theories online edition monday morning update the hatto story has taken another twist see gramophone for the details given her poignant story its not surprising that a cult of sorts formed around the british pianist joyce hatto after being stricken with cancer she retired from playing in public in the s but she didnt stop playing in fact she recorded more than cds on a small british label called concert artists because that label was directed by her husband ms hatto had frequent access to a recording studio and the music she produced there amazed some critics and classic music fans to ms hattos champions her cds interpretations of nearly everything in the solo pianists canon showed her as an astonishing original sadly neglected in the boston globes richard dyer said she "must be the greatest living pianist that almost no one has ever heard of " and when she died last year the guardians jeremy nicholas called her "one of the greatest pianists britain has ever produced " it was an inspirational story but now the late ms hatto stands at the center of a scandal and the kind of internet borne conspiracy theories one wouldnt normally associate with the outwardly well mannered world of classical music the story as broken by the london publication gramophone earlier this month a classical music critic whod been one of ms hattos adherents got an curious email from a reader the reader said hed put ms hattos cd "liszts transcendental studies" into his pc to transfer it to the computer apples itunes software recognized the cd but said it was by another pianist laszlo simon gramophone sent the recordings to a sound engineer andrew rose of pristine audio mr rose said of the hatto tracks were indeed from a recording by mr simon and set up an online demonstration that lets you listen to the hatto track in one ear and the simon track slightly time shrunk in the other since then the deluge mr rose has charged that more and more hatto recordings are swiped from other sources sometimes with audio trickery involved time shrinking time stretching reversing channels and the like thats led classical music fans to put on their headphones and join the hunt another group the ahrc research centre for the history and analysis of recorded music has compared "timescapes" visual representations of playing styles of hatto recordings against those shes accused of lifting the groups conclusion her recordings are "virtually indistinguishable" from ones by eugen indjic ms hattos husband william barrington coupe insists the recordings are genuine telling the daily telegraph last week that "i was there at all the important sessions i was the engineer on the jobs" hes promised to carry out his own technical analysis an editorial written by classics today executive director david hurwitz identifies the man who got the ball rolling reached by telephone brian ventura recalled his surprise when itunes identified the hatto cd as mr simons work "at first i thought it was a misunderstanding " mr ventura a financial analyst from mount vernon n y told me "it doesnt seem unreasonable that two people would play the tracks in a similar length of time " the next morning mr ventura says he went to amazon com and found samples of the simon recordings which sounded very similar that left mr ventura wondering what was afoot had amazon somehow posted the wrong clips "i really didnt know what to do about it " he says "i wanted very much to believe that the joyce hatto story was true because its such an amazing story " he emailed jed distler a critic whos written reviews for both gramophone and classics today gramophone began its investigation soon after and mr ventura has followed along with the unfolding story ever since the furor on forums and internet newsgroups dedicated to classical music has been bracing depending on your perspective its either vaguely depressing or somewhat heartening to see classical music fans slugging it out like teenaged videogamers albeit ones who can spell better and offer wittier putdowns ms hattos champions among classical music reviewers are being lambasted and her online supporters are seeing their pre gramophone statements dragged out and thrown in their faces meanwhile all sorts of questions about ms hattos career are being aired and conspiracy theories are flying about how much she actually recorded and when technically minded readers including this columnist zeroed in on one aspect of the hatto tale something didnt seem right with the way itunes had plucked at the loose thread that would unravel ms hattos catalog the program had matter of factly identified her cd as mr simons despite the allegations that her cd was cobbled together from performances by mr simon minoru nojima and possibly another artist can itunes really do that like many digital music programs itunes recognizes a cd put in your computer by querying a database maintained by a san francisco bay area company called gracenote some digital music fans will remember gracenote by its old name cddb gracenote recognizes a cd by the number of tracks it has and the length of each of those tracks when combined the two form a mathematical fingerprint and with most cds that fingerprint is already in gracenotes database of nearly million cds i wrote about gracenote in this column this has nothing to do with the music itself just tracks and track lengths for instance "london calling" by the clash has a unique fingerprint a track listing of songs the first of which is minutes and seconds long the second of which is minutes and seconds long and so on in theory two completely different cds could have the same number of songs with each song corresponding to one in the same position and of the same length on the other cd but such a "collision" is very unlikely for cds with more than about five songs a key question just how close does the fingerprint need to be mr roses comparison of the hatto and simon cds notes that track times have been shrunk or stretched the fifth track on the hatto cd he says is seconds shorter than the fifth track on the simon cd no surprise as mr rose alleges the track is lifted from a nojima recording not from the simon cd from classical music newsgroups to blogs and slashdot such discrepancies led some to doubt that gracenote could automatically match the hatto cd with the simon cd unless someone had altered the hatto cds information in the gracenote database so that it came up as mr simons mr rose spoke for many such doubters with this hypothesis "someone somewhere used this as a means of bringing the possibility of a hoax to the attention of the likes of the gramophone critic its almost certain that someone deliberately submitted the hatto cd information to gracenote with laszlo simons name attached and did this for a reason " sounds like james bond stuff but it isnt gracenote began with information entered by cd listeners about their own music and still gets thousands of user submissions and edits a day so did the hatto investigators benefit from a planted clue leading them to compare ms hatto with mr simon keep in mind that the initial gracenote identification has no bearing on the subsequent audio analysis either way the idea seemed a delicious twist to a mystery that already had twists a plenty but sorry mystery fans this one looks like a red herring ty roberts gracenotes chief technology officer says gracenote does allow for a certain amount of "fuzziness" in identifications remastered cds or ones pressed at different plants can yield tracks that are slightly longer or shorter gracenote views fuzzy matchings exact parameters as a trade secret but steve scherf the companys chief architect was able to knock down the idea that a clue had been planted at least to my satisfaction while warning that he hadnt had a chance to examine originals of the cds mr scherf offers this "i can say with good assurance that our system would have matched the apparently very similar joyce hatto and laszlo simon discs with this many tracks it is a near mathematical certainty that two discs are indeed the same if all tracks but one are about the same length " in other words an outlier like that fifth track wouldnt be enough to change the mathematical conclusion that hatto simon in addition he says a wholesale change like changing the artist would have been flagged for scrutiny by gracenotes staff no surprise to some whove been following the twists and turns "im really not a fan of conspiracy theories " says classics todays mr hurwitz "they invariably in my view presume too much competence " mr hurwitz for his part is thoroughly enjoying the uproar and its ironies he notes that in some ways this is a scandal without victims people who bought ms hattos cds are now speculating about who the real artists are and some of those people will now want to buy those artists cds "these artists who have been victimized will actually benefit " he says adding wryly that "this being classical music the degree by which theyll benefit is minuscule " at least the hatto story already has enough mysteries to survive the loss of a minor one and to keep those who have followed it riveted until the truth of the matter is settled if the hoax allegations prove true and gracenote did indeed reveal the chicanery the hatto affair will stand as one more example of plagiarism undone by our ages still uncanny ability to pluck patterns out of a vast sea of digital data whether the mechanism of search is google or gracenote newspaper columnists bloggers authors and now perhaps a pianist have fallen prey to pattern recognition and that raises the unhappy question of whether we live in an era of rampant plagiarism or just in the first era given the tools to find plagiarism so easily any thoughts on the hatto affair considerations of how the digital age simultaneously helps fraudsters and those who expose them write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
