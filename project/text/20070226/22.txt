europe blunts the very growth needed to support social entitlements edmund phelps "entrepreneurial culture " editorial page feb astutely blames europes lack of entrepreneurial values for its economic malaise but too easily exonerates europes "plethora of social insurance entitlements and the taxes to pay for them" with a novel argument yes these taxes reduce private wealth but once peoples wealth has really taken a beating they will be motivated to "work as before " presumably to replenish their lost wealth besides the fact that this argument if true entails an initial loss of wealth that must be made whole and thus a loss in the time value of that wealth as well as lost opportunities has it occurred to prof phelps that this arrangement lots of social insurance high taxes to pay for it loss of wealth motivation to regain it might be blunting some of the very "dynamism" he correctly observes is essential for economic growth surely there is a connection between some of the institutions that engender anti competitive values and the social entitlements that often fund those institutions for instance mandating a less than hour work week is hard to imagine in the u s but in france various institutions and constituencies that live off of the social entitlement state pushed hard for just such a change ben orlanski los angeles the gravamen of prof phelpss commentary seems to be that in addition to france and germany having anti productivity growth institutions they also have individuals who have basic values that are anti ambition and anti entrepreneurial and glory seeking thus even if france and germany could rid themselves of the anti growth institutions such as pervasive and all powerful unions employment laws that limit layoffs of workers and anti trust policies that are geared to prevent worker displacement at the expense of tech change and productivity gains they would still lag behind us and this is because according to a university of michigan survey the people are not as interested as we are in taking the risks of failure inherent in undertaking ventures that lead to important productivity gains in the u s before the dramatic effects of welfare reform in it was said that there is a "culture of welfare" that cannot be overcome simply by radically changing the perverse incentives that were embedded in the old afdc program well all the evidence is in and the huge and permanent exodus from the program along with growing evidence of large increases in work and marriage and decreases in child poverty following the reforms strongly suggest that it was mainly incentives at work rather than in the culture similarly if somehow france and germany would rid themselves of the perverse economic institutions they might come to equal us in productivity growth the seemingly insurmountable problem is getting those institutions changed dave m oneill adjunct professor of economics baruch college cuny new york
