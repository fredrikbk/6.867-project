conspiracy weary in todays paranoid political climate any bow toward reality is welcome so we thought youd like to know that an independent team of computer scientists has absolved touch screen voting machines of stealing an election in floridas th congressional district last november republican vern buchanan won his seat by a mere votes over democratic challenger christine jennings who has nonetheless refused to concede and has sued to demand a new election ms jennings claims that faulty software was the cause of "undervotes " or incidences where voters cast ballots in other races but not in the congressional contest in what is a mainly gop district on the florida gulf coast south of tampa however eight computer experts from several universities looked at the ivotronic software and last week concluded unanimously that it "did not cause or contribute to the cd undervote " ms jennings and her allies at people for the american way arent giving up and are demanding to see the source code themselves naturally theyre also claiming that one of the scientists who conducted the audit is known to have voted for president bush some people will believe anything but ms jennings looks worse with each day she continues to rage against the machines
