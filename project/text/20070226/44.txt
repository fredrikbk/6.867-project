new predator in takeovers private equity firms increasingly go hostile in overseas buyouts for the past few years private equity firms have been cast as the friendly guys a refuge from hostile activist hedge funds however at least overseas that is becoming less and less the case last year private equity firms made takeover bids in europe that were either hostile or unsolicited according to dealogic deal lawyers say more such bids are likely this year such hostile approaches are nearly nonexistent in the u s because many limited partners that invest in buyout funds especially pension funds insist on investment agreements that ban the funds from being involved in hostile deals here indeed early this month three private equity firms said they were looking into making an unsolicited bid for j sainsbury plc a british grocery chain in what would be europes largest private equity deal moreover some private equity firms now have explicit mandates from investors to undertake such bids at the same time other private equity firms are seeking the flexibility to buy minority stakes as well as majority control of public companies in hopes of wringing out value these moves are another sign of the convergence of private equity and hedge funds it is also another indication that buyout funds which have raised billions of dollars in new cash are eager to put their money to work while financial conditions remain so favorable for leveraged buyouts no matter whether in a collaborative unsolicited or hostile approach cvc capital partners ltd permira and apax partners all with head offices in europe have terms in fund agreements with their investors to permit hostile or unsolicited takeovers of public companies at least in europe "you want the opportunity and the ability to communicate to shareholders directly and fairly and not blocked by technicalities from the board of directors " says the head of one private equity firm investors have allowed permira to launch hostile bids since "it is hard to define what a hostile bid is in many markets so the flexibility is important " says charles sherwood a senior partner at permira noting the firm has never launched such an offer in the past private equity funds waited for activist funds to take investment stakes and call for changes the besieged corporate prey would then turn to private equity firms as white knights that was the case for aleris international inc an aluminum processor that sold itself to texas pacific group last year for &# billion now though private equity firms are acting as their own "catalyst " rather than waiting on hedge funds often they lob letters voicing their interest in the company to corporate boards and force them to respond the wisdom of this approach is the subject of much debate in the private equity realm many buyout firms argue that after one unfriendly approach doors in other executive offices will slam shut "private equity firms are jeopardizing their franchise " says augustus oliver founder of oliver press partners llc a new york alternative investment firm but others say the specter of hostile action might open doors more quickly the implicit message being that if a friendly overture is resisted the recipient might not survive an unsolicited takeover also many principals at private equity firms talk about how blurred the line has become in what is friendly what is unsolicited and what is hostile while the distinctions are murky people generally define a hostile bid as one taken without board recommendation in some cases what is initially hostile ends up being friendly such was the case in with texas pacific groups &# billion bid for british vita which provides foam products to furniture and packaging companies or in the billion euros &# billion bid last year by apax and nordic capital for swedish health care company capio in other cases when target companies resisted unsolicited approaches the private equity firms went away for example blackstone group lp which has a no hostile credo refused to pursue an offer for itv plc in britain after itv said no so far though the revised mandates apply primarily to europe indeed big american investors in permiras funds insist it cant undertake hostile offers if the target is listed on any of the three major u s stock exchanges moreover in the u s takeover rules are less favorable to hostile or unsolicited bidders european takeover codes generally force management to be neutral and there is a much lower threshold to get access to nonpublic information also european takeover codes lack devices such as poison pills that discourage unwanted suitors in the u s "there is a level playing field for bidders in the u k and europe " says chris ashworth a partner at omelveny &amp myers llp in london "boards are much more constrained " he said boards cant take any major action without a shareholder vote as soon as a potential buyer has expressed interest that contrasts to the situation in the u s where boards are seen more as fiduciaries that can act on behalf of shareholders further the consent of management in europe is also far less critical "in many cases there is simply no management involvement " mr ashworth adds the buyers "dont even talk to management until after the bid " the freedom to take small stakes in public companies gives private equity firms another way to leverage the work they do on undervalued potential targets in the public arena if they dont succeed in gaining control for instance blackstone has the ability to take minority stakes as it did with deutsche telekom ag last year getting one board seat in the process now others are following its example london based i group plc has a new fund with as much as billion euros to take minority stakes in public companies in contrast to the control private equity firms usually seek "we are expanding the universe of what we can look at " says bruce carnegie brown a managing partner at i group "we are bringing the value add of private equity to the public markets without taking companies private that way public shareholders can remain invested and since we arent trying to control the company we dont have to pay a premium for our stake " with such flexibility if a takeover bid fails a private equity firm can not only pocket a breakup fee it can continue to hold the shares in the hope someone else might eventually succeed jason singer contributed to this article
