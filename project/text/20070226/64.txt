to &# at year end compared with &# for an investment that tracked the standard &amp poors stock index ices success was driven by the growing popularity of investing in commodities and the companys pioneer status in the rapidly expanding field of electronic trading jeffrey sprecher an engineer who developed power plants in california started ice in a few years after buying a small electricity transmission network his goal taking the informal network of energy traders to the internet which could make trading faster cheaper and more efficient ice needed the support of energy users who wanted to hedge their price risk and speculators who bet on price moves an early endorsement came when companies including royal dutch shell plc and morgan stanley invested in ice in ice bought the major london petroleum exchange expanding the new company to futures markets from the less regulated over the counter market where ice customers traded with each other privately last year ice started competing directly with the new york mercantile exchange the largest u s energy futures market when it launched an electronic version of nymexs flagship futures contract based on west texas crude oil ice gathered about a third of the total market share and floor based nymex launched its own electronic competitor with technology provided by the chicago mercantile exchange now both ice and nymex are
