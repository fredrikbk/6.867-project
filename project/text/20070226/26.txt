hedge fund realities if a group of regulators sit down and decide theres no need to regulate is it news the answer is yes especially if the target of non regulation is the hedge fund industry last weeks report on hedge funds from the heads of the federal reserve sec treasury and commodity futures trading commission was a welcome call to inaction while hedge funds themselves are lightly regulated the report noted that their counterparties banks brokerages etc and sometimes their investors such as pension funds are usually under the eye of some government agency this is worth bearing in mind as congress holds hearings on hedge funds in which we will no doubt be treated to warnings about systemic risk and blue collar pensioners with no idea that their retirement money may be invested in these funds that are typically for the very rich this latter point in particular has become a populist rallying cry for greater hedge fund oversight last weeks statement of principles offers a useful dose of sobriety regarding pension funds the regulators note that pension managers have a fiduciary duty not to put their beneficiaries at risk through reckless investment wed add that pension fund managers whether private or public are free to demand any disclosure they feel is necessary from hedge funds in which they are considering investing the hedge funds likewise are free to decline and see the business go elsewhere the bottom line is that if a pension fund finds itself caught by a hedge fund investment gone bad it is the pension manager who should be called on the carpet or take systemic risk no doubt there is some danger that a perfect storm of financial accidents could have broad repercussions especially because there are more hedge funds managing more money than ever before yet a number of hedge funds have blown up over the years without any financial contagion hedge funds go out of business with great frequency and most of the time no one even notices nearly closed in more than one a day but as with pension funds hedge fund problems can only spread if the regulated businesses on the other side of a transaction fail to do their jobs one can imagine that a bank without proper internal controls over its exposure to a hedge funds trading strategy could find itself in serious trouble but the solution here again is to make sure that the banks and brokerages know what their exposure is and manage it properly in this regard timothy geithner president of the federal reserve bank of new york has done good work in encouraging banks to know what their overall exposure is in over the counter derivatives eight years ago regulators in the clinton administration sat down after the implosion of the long term capital management and came to conclusions similar to those presented in last weeks report the feds have plenty of tools to control the risk so that problems at hedge funds dont spread at the same time hedge funds and other pools of private capital bring real benefits in economic efficiency and capital allocation the question now is whether a democratic congress will heed the advice of two successive administrations from two different parties or will decide to pursue increased regulation anyway
