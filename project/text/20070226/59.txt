power play bidders try to pre empt gridlock in txu deal long a tempting target utilities have proved elusive for buyout firms for years cash rich buyout firms have tried to break into the electricity business only to be rebuffed by wary regulators consumer groups and environmentalists now in what would be the biggest leveraged buyout ever an investor group is hoping it has cracked the code a total of six firms led by kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co texas pacific group and goldman sachs group have signed a deal to buy utility powerhouse txu corp for &# billion plus more than &# billion in txu debt according to people familiar with the matter txu directors last night voted to recommend that shareholders approve the deal in a creative twist the firms have moved quickly to pre empt opposition from powerful environmental groups while seeking support from various regulators and politicians already the potential buyers have promised to cancel plans to build all but three of the companys proposed coal fired plants and they are planning to placate consumers with rate reductions the deal marks a quantum leap in the political sophistication of the buyout world and may signal a broader remaking of private equitys image in the utility industry buyout firms have generally received a chilly reception from utility regulators because theyre seen as temporary profit driven caretakers not answerable to public shareholders or sensitive to consumers if the prospective txu buyers can overcome that perception they could potentially open the door for more private equity investors a successful deal will also create a chance to profit from a central predicament facing todays utility industry a public that hungers for more and more electricity to burn but has limited will to build new plants for providing it but its far from a sure thing regulators at all levels of government could trip up the deal it may also be subject to complaints from consumers who regard reasonably priced electrical service as a basic right the plant cancellations if they happen could have an interesting effect proposals by other builders which went dormant after txu made its big splash could be revived a hydralike effect could be the result with environmentalists trying to chop down coal proposals there are in the wings with many more foes if more plants arent built an equally troubling scenario may unfold power prices could spiral out of control in texas because there arent enough suppliers to meet the need and the state is so poorly connected to other states by high voltage wires that theres no ability to import power its possible that the texas scarcity could hit consumers at about the time that the state lifts price caps for wholesale power sales currently prices are capped at &# a megawatt hour but that will rise to &# by the end of the decade that could result in a windfall for generators like txu or its owners with its large fleet of plants if scarcity forces more marginal generators into the market where they would have the effect of lifting overall prices twice before two of the private equity investors involved in the deal kkr and texas pacific have tried to buy utilities and come up short after running into a buzz saw of criticism from state officials and consumers the firms are attempting to get out in front of txus many detractors and make concessions early so that dislike of txus operating practices does not taint the deal on saturday two big environmental organizations that had fought txus plans to build the new coal fired operations in texas agreed to support the deal on the assurance that the buyers would agree to withdraw permit applications killing the projects there is an element of stagecraft at work too txu already had plans to cut six of those plants said people familiar with the effort the plants that remain on the drawing board are responsible for the lions share of the profits of the entire plant project said another person close to the company private equity firms once shunned utilities as capital intensive regulated and low return businesses but now in a world of cheap debt their steady and predictable cash flows have made them desirable targets at least in deregulated states one reason the buyers have zeroed in on txu it possesses unrivaled power in a state that has removed nearly all price controls for the sale of electricity it owns the largest fleet of power plants in total and serves the most customers under the tenure of chief executive c john wilder txu became one of the nations most controversial utility companies known for turning off the service of late paying customers boosting rates rapidly and plans to build plants that produce huge amounts of harmful gases it also became one of the most profitable utilities in u s history in texas pacific announced its intention to buy enron corp s oregon utility portland general electric the deal attracted widespread opposition because texas pacific was seen as a short term investor that wouldnt have customers interests in mind texas pacific told investors in that its returns before taxes have averaged a year the oregon utilities commission eventually rejected the portland general deal on the recommendation of its staff also in kkr announced an agreement to buy unisource energy corp an arizona utility for &# billion in cash and debt that effort ended in late when the arizona commission on a to vote rejected kkrs bid in both cases rate concessions didnt look substantial enough to overcome fear of the risks to customers if service deteriorated amid cost cutting this time around it was clear that the buyers needed a more strategic approach at the heart of the potential new owners campaign for support lies texas pacific representative william reilly a former administrator of the environmental protection agency under president george h w bush mr reilly became the public face for the buyout group largely because of his reputation among environmentalists david bonderman co founder of texas pacific has a similar reputation he is touting his board membership of world wildlife fund as evidence that the group will behave responsibly the two men have a solid history together back in the late s mr reilly tapped mr bonderman then a washington d c lawyer to write a supporting brief for environmentalists before the supreme court later when mr reilly served as chairman of the board of world wildlife fund he asked mr bonderman to join the groups board mr bonderman in turn brought mr reilly to texas pacific still mr reilly was stunned five or six weeks ago when mr bonderman walked into his office at texas pacific and asked for his help in connection with the planned buyout of txu according to people familiar with the matter initial conversations with environmentalists quickly made the two realize that the campaign would not be easy the efforts to woo conservation groups quickly focused on the environmental defense fund along with public citizen and the natural resources defense council on wednesday jim marston an attorney with the environmental defense fund went to san francisco to listen to texas pacifics case in a meeting that went from a m to a m the following day many of the proposals that texas pacific and kkr came up with were developed in connection with green strategies a consulting firm based in washington state headed by roger ballentine a former clinton white house staffer under mr reilly the potential owners are also planning a sustainable energy advisory committee that would include mr marston and a representative from the natural resources defense council as well as a host of prominent texans about six days ago michael macdougall of texas pacific along with fred goltz and marc lipschultz from kkr reached out to james baker the veteran texas politician and former cabinet member to serve in an advisory capacity at txu one of the first things he asked was about environmentalists position on the deal according to people familiar with the matter on thursday the investors took their campaign to texas gov rick perry mr bonderman and henry kravis of kkr led the delegation which included mr macdougall and mr goltz in a minute meeting at the governors mansion "the governor gave them the message that texas is in dire need of new capacity " said robert black mr perrys press secretary mr black noted that the three plants still on the txu drawing board in addition to plants proposed by others should solve the states "immediate challenge " support of the governor and the legislature is critical both to approval and to the financial viability of the deal there are several bills before the texas legislature now which if enacted could have a negative impact on the potential profitability of the buyout the buyers will need all the goodwill they can get consumer resentment of txu runs high in texas where under deregulation the company has aggressively moved to raise power prices that are now among the highest in the nation in a bid to win over consumers the private equity buyers have put out the word to texas lawmakers that they plan a rate reduction already some lawmakers who have been briefed are unimpressed texas state rep sylvester turner of houston says he believes rates should drop at least mr turner said sunday the sale "is causing me to re evaluate the market we created in i have serious questions about the direction were headed and the impact on consumers who never wanted deregulation to begin with " under terms of the deal being contemplated mr wilder and other top executives would remain at the company while rolling over their ownership stakes into the new ownership plan they would then have access to options that could give them another stake over time private equity firms generally need the support of management when making a bid for a public company by giving management equity that support is usually forthcoming mr wilder appears to be entitled to change of control payments that could be worth &# million or more insiders have described mr wilder as brilliant but "tone deaf" to the niceties of the utility business erle nye the longtime chief executive whom mr wilder replaced typified the courtly utility chief mr wilder seemed brusque by comparison txu did not return calls seeking comment dallas mayor laura miller said txu has communicated poorly with elected officials shes never met mr wilder and said he has refused to meet with critics to discuss a long list of grievances that range from the coal plants which she opposes to nagging problems like perpetually burned out street lights in downtown dallas undermining a &# million redevelopment effort "large swaths of downtown have been dark and scary " she said "hows customer service going to get better with a bunch of outsiders running the company from new york or san francisco " the buyers have tried to show that the companys tone will change tom "smitty" smith director of public citizen an advocacy organization said he met with a kkr representative on friday who said "youve been a frequent critic of txu lets open a dialogue " mr smith said he found the overture "refreshing " particularly since hed been trying to get a meeting he says with mr wilder for more than a year to express concerns whether the new owners could come to terms with the management of txu was also a big question but at a long meeting days ago messrs macdougall and goltz met with mr wilder to review the specific commitments the two planned to make to reduce hostility to their bid among the several u turns txu was planning to introduce coal fired plants into virginia maryland and pennsylvania indeed david hawkins of the nrdc already had lawyers trying to derail the proposed move the new owners promised environmentalists that there would be no such expansion if their bid went through these people say once environmentalists get over the euphoria of getting eight coal fired plants off the table however some may wonder whether they got enough out of the bargain after all theyve garnered an agreement that the buyers wont build plants they never had permission to build in a legal victory last week challengers including a coalition of texas cities led by the dallas and houston mayors and the chickasaw indian nation in oklahoma were given four months to prepare cases to challenge the txu plan txu was advised by credit suisse and lazard with attorneys cravath swaine &amp moore and sullivan &amp cromwell the buyers were advised by citigroup goldman sachs j p morgan chase lehman brothers morgan stanley and attorneys simpson thacher &amp bartlett and vinson &amp elkins citigroup lehman and morgan stanley are also smaller investors in the deal
