the evening wrap gang green online edition giant utility txu and its band of private equity suitors have settled on a deal now comes the hard part convincing consumers regulators and other skeptics that their buyout plan wont end up costing everyone else a bundle txu formally agreed this morning to be bought by a group of investors led by two of the nations biggest private equity firms kohlberg kravis roberts and texas pacific group for &# billion plus the assumption of &# billion in debt should the deal close it will be the biggest leveraged buyout of all time bigger even than the famous rjr nabisco takeout of the late s against which all subsequent deals have been weighed both for dollars and for drama listening in to the conference call announcing the deal however investors might be forgiven for wondering whether txu had been snared by a greenpeace led tribe instead of some of those same barbarians who captured rjr eight of new coal fired plants that had drawn intense fire from environmentalists will be scratched by txu and ceo c john wilder said his company will spend &# million on energy efficiency measures that will reduce peak power demand on the texas markets by megawatts if thats not enough txu also pledged to slash electricity rates by and freeze them there until september so were the deals architects fishing for an invitation to go oscar party hopping with al gore not necessarily utility companies have proven a rather difficult meal for voracious private equity investors to swallow for a range of regulatory reasons among them regulators worry the heaps of debt involved in leveraged buyouts pose a real risk that consumers could get saddled with fatter bills as the acquirers look to pay off their notes with their eco friendly gestures and vows to keep a lid on power rates over the short run txu and its suitors appeared to be doing all they could to make the deal go down smoothly the private equity firms have seen efforts to acquire utilities in arizona and oregon run aground and may have learned from their failures of course those promises to both rein in dirty energy capacity and keep prices low could eventually put txu at cross purposes if keeping clean comes at a hefty cost and at least one texas lawmaker today vowed to soldier on with his campaign to tighten up the states regulation of the power industry but if the deal succeeds it seems certain to pave the way for more dealmaking in the power sector and companies such as constellation energy nrg energy mirant and reliant energy could all find themselves in the crosshairs analysts said nrg the second largest generator in texas after txu and a company that boasts toeholds in other unregulated markets is an especially appetizing target nrg shares surged by about while the dow jones utilities index jumped as investors dreamed up deal scenarios but the utilities business wasnt the only corner of the market being lit up by deal talk today dow chemical shares surged
