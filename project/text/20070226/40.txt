long division during president hu jintaos visit to the white house last spring george bush initiated a conversation over lunch about north korea and asked whether kim jong il might consider deng xiaopings pattern of reform the chinese president replied that he did not know but thought kim wanted to change he added that when deng took the risk of opening china in the late s he was reassured by a non threatening external environment kim said mr hu might find it easier to move if he received a positive signal mr bush replied "what if we offered him a peace treaty " not long thereafter japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi had his farewell stop at the white house when mr bush probed about chinas influence with north korea mr koizumi suggested that u s signals loomed large in pyongyangs calculations history had led the koreans to be suspicious of their neighbors including china and koreans sense the u s might be the most important guarantor for koreas future these exchanges illuminate strategic perspectives that underpin the u s approach to the recent six party accord first the administration views this initial step as the beginning of a course that extends far beyond north koreas nuclear program or even peace on the peninsula the u s wants to set a direction for security relations in northeast asia for decades to come left unchecked north koreas nuclear weapons and missiles might build a movement in south korea and japan for their own programs washington wants the six party process both to stymie north koreas programs and develop closer security relations among the participants china is already acting as a "responsible stakeholder" by urging north korea to step back from confrontation by proposing a peace treaty to replace the armistice the u s not only seeks to close out this vestige of the cold war but also to open the way to overcome the painful legacies on the peninsula and in the region dating back to world war ii the russo japanese war of and even the sino japanese war of the hard work ahead involves not only maintaining pressure to close down all nuclear weapons programs but steps to build confidence on the peninsula security assurances and transparency between the koreas as well as with the neighbors the koreans may fear more than one another this process will open the way for returning japanese abductees connecting energy and economic support to north korean reforms and enhancing cooperation between china and japan these conditions would improve the international environment in which the two koreas could someday end the cruel division of one people second the administration believes the best way to change north korean behavior and improve the lives of its people is to combine pressure with an opportunity for north korea to open to the world step by step the regime bases its terrible repression on a bizarre self image that combines superiority and a state of siege to end this and open eyes to a different world the other five parties are offering peace and the prospect of normal ties in line with mr hus suggestion mr bush is shaping an external environment that removes the rationalization for keeping the lid on north koreas stunted development third the u s government recognizes that the forces of history and economics are on its side not north koreas having lost a war in vietnam years ago the u s is winning the peace because of the magnet of its economic dynamism its central role in the institutions of the world economy the power of the private sector and its role as a counterweight in asia the trends in world economics information flows and technology give america a new type of "strategic depth" that enables it to confidently offer north korea a path away from isolation ironically as messrs hu and koizumi observed a reforming north korea is likely to perceive the u s as a resource and reassurance as should south korea of course this six party accord is only a portal north korea needs to fulfill its september commitment to abandon all nuclear weapons and programs north koreas steps are likely to be halting as it weighs the risks of opening with those of isolation yet even if pyongyang chooses belligerence u s cooperation with the other four parties will position it better to quarantine the dangers the five can best deter north korea they will be best able to prevent the selling of nuclear materials president bush does not view this move as another accord limited to nonproliferation objectives it opens the way for peace and reconciliation on the peninsula and a means to shape the future security arrangements in east asia it is a recognition that americas diplomatic toolkit for dangerous states involves more than threats of force and isolation the challenge for this administration and those to come will be to avoid letting the process slip into minimalist tactical tradeoffs and instead to maintain strategic vision guiding the diplomacy of opening north korea
