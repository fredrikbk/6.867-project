the italian job the capture of an alleged islamist terrorist recruiter in milan four years ago in an operation carried out by u s and italian intelligence could have been a model for transatlantic cooperation in counterterrorism instead it is becoming exhibit a in how european politicians are working against the u s undermining the fight against islamic terrorism and endangering the nato alliance an italian court days ago indicted cia agents and a u s air force lieutenant colonel on charges that they kidnapped osama mustafa hassan nasr and illegally took him back to his native egypt where he was imprisoned and he claims tortured five italians were also charged including the top two officials at the military intelligence agency at the time nasr a radical imam also known as abu omar is a terrorist suspect who had been under italian police surveillance since in the covert operation that took place in february italians and americans worked together to apprehend nasr before whisking him back to egypt against his will and without the permission of an italian court the milan prosecutor armando spataro contends that nasr was "kidnapped " such "extraordinary rendition " he tells us by phone is illegal under italian law and hes ensuring that the "rules are really followed without any political considerations " as in many such operations the particulars are in dispute but no one including the italian prosecutors doubts that nasr posed a security risk in a milan court at mr spataros behest issued an arrest warrant for nasr charging him with building a terrorist network in europe that actively recruited terrorists including for iraq eight of his accomplices have been sentenced to up to years in prison on similar charges and italian authorities believe more are at large why nasr was captured rather than arrested in isnt clear according to a july story in the new york times which cited unnamed current and former american officials the cia was concerned that nasr was plotting to attack the u s embassy in rome for whatever reason the u s wanted him off the streets while the italians werent ready to arrest him the cia wont comment the government of silvio berlusconi who was prime minister at the time denied any foreknowledge of the rendition no one seriously claims however that the cia agents were in italy without the explicit knowledge and participation of italys security services this is the crucial point and explains why the indictments are a hostile act against the u s by long established international legal practice the official agents of one country operating in another with that states permission are immune from prosecution the status of forces agreement that governs u s troops stationed in italy enshrines this principle at least for official conduct if the cia agents did anything wrong thats up to american authorities to decide mr spataro an independent prosecutor can indict as many italians as he wants his pursuit of u s government personnel however makes him a rogue aggravating the harm mr spataro cited the agents by name possibly putting their lives in danger the trial in june presumably in absentia would likely do further damage by exposing intelligence gathering techniques call it a tutorial for al qaeda on how to avoid detection the appropriate response by prime minister romano prodi would have been a swift announcement that he would reject any extradition request from the court instead mr prodi merely hinted that he might do so before his government collapsed on wednesday night if he wins the confidence vote hes likely to face this week to resume power hell get a second chance to finally fulfill his obligation to his u s treaty allies and reject extradition european politicians are more at fault here than any prosecutor since the attacks in the u s many european leaders have been playing a double game working with the u s to root out terrorist plots on the sly and saving countless lives while publicly condemning "american methods" in rhetoric that has fed rising anti americanism it doesnt help that many europeans embrace the preposterous legal notion of "universal jurisdiction " the idea that an ambitious prosecutor can indict and try anyone for an alleged crime committed anywhere in the world this is the climate in which for example a german court this month issued arrest warrants for cia agents allegedly involved in transferring a german lebanese terrorist suspect khaled al masri to afghanistan for questioning it made no difference that mr al masri had been arrested in macedonia also in germany prosecutors are considering whether to bring war crimes charges against former defense secretary donald rumsfeld attorney general alberto gonzales former cia director george tenet and other senior civilian and military officials mr rumsfeld colin powell and dick cheney were targeted by belgian courts until the law there was changed and so on european officials need to understand the risks theyre running if they keep this up italy and the u s are nato partners but such an alliance is meaningless if "allies" make a habit of prosecuting each other for cooperating against a common threat italys political grandstanding is endangering nato as well as the lives of millions on both sides of the atlantic see related letter "letters to the editor a thumb in the eye"
