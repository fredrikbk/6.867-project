the choice on iraq two months into the th congress washington has never been more bitterly divided over our mission in iraq the senate and house of representatives are bracing for parliamentary trench warfare trapped in an escalating dynamic of division and confrontation that will neither resolve the tough challenges we face in iraq nor strengthen our nation against its terrorist enemies around the world what is remarkable about this state of affairs in washington is just how removed it is from what is actually happening in iraq there the battle of baghdad is now under way a new commander gen david petraeus has taken command having been confirmed by the senate just a few weeks ago and a new strategy is being put into action with thousands of additional american soldiers streaming into the iraqi capital congress thus faces a choice in the weeks and months ahead will we allow our actions to be driven by the changing conditions on the ground in iraq or by the unchanging political and ideological positions long ago staked out in washington what ultimately matters more to us the real fight over there or the political fight over here if we stopped the legislative maneuvering and looked to baghdad we would see what the new security strategy actually entails and how dramatically it differs from previous efforts for the first time in the iraqi capital the focus of the u s military is not just training indigenous forces or chasing down insurgents but ensuring basic security meaning an end at last to the large scale sectarian slaughter and ethnic cleansing that has paralyzed iraq for the past year tamping down this violence is more than a moral imperative al qaedas stated strategy in iraq has been to provoke a sunni shiite civil war precisely because they recognize that it is their best chance to radicalize the countrys politics derail any hope of democracy in the middle east and drive the u s to despair and retreat it also takes advantage of what has been the single greatest american weakness in iraq the absence of sufficient troops to protect ordinary iraqis from violence and terrorism the new strategy at last begins to tackle these problems where previously there werent enough soldiers to hold key neighborhoods after they had been cleared of extremists and militias now more u s and iraqi forces are either in place or on the way where previously american forces were based on the outskirts of baghdad unable to help secure the city now they are living and working side by side with their iraqi counterparts on small bases being set up throughout the capital at least four of these new joint bases have already been established in the sunni neighborhoods in west baghdad the same neighborhoods where just a few weeks ago jihadists and death squads held sway in the shiite neighborhoods of east baghdad american troops are also moving in and moqtada al sadr and his mahdi army are moving out we of course will not know whether this new strategy in iraq will succeed for some time even under the most optimistic of scenarios there will be more attacks and casualties in the months ahead especially as our fanatical enemies react and attempt to thwart any perception of progress but the fact is that we are in a different place in iraq today from even just a month ago with a new strategy a new commander and more troops on the ground we are now in a stronger position to ensure basic security and with that we are in a stronger position to marginalize the extremists and strengthen the moderates a stronger position to foster the economic activity that will drain the insurgency and militias of public support and a stronger position to press the iraqi government to make the tough decisions that everyone acknowledges are necessary for progress unfortunately for many congressional opponents of the war none of this seems to matter as the battle of baghdad just gets underway they have already made up their minds about americas cause in iraq declaring their intention to put an end to the mission before we have had the time to see whether our new plan will work there is of course a direct and straightforward way that congress could end the war consistent with its authority under the constitution by cutting off funds yet this option is not being proposed critics of the war instead are planning to constrain and squeeze the current strategy and troops by a thousand cuts and conditions among the specific ideas under consideration are to tangle up the deployment of requested reinforcements by imposing certain "readiness" standards and to redraft the congressional authorization for the war apparently in such a way that congress will assume the role of commander in chief and dictate when where and against whom u s troops can fight i understand the frustration anger and exhaustion so many americans feel about iraq the desire to throw up our hands and simply say "enough " and i am painfully aware of the enormous toll of this war in human life and of the infuriating mistakes that have been made in the wars conduct but we must not make another terrible mistake now many of the worst errors in iraq arose precisely because the bush administration best cased what would happen after saddam was overthrown now many opponents of the war are making the very same best case mistake assuming we can pull back in the midst of a critical battle with impunity even arguing that our retreat will reduce the terrorism and sectarian violence in iraq in fact halting the current security operation at midpoint as virtually all of the congressional proposals seek to do would have devastating consequences it would put thousands of american troops already deployed in the heart of baghdad in even greater danger forced to choose between trying to hold their position without the required reinforcements or more likely abandoning them outright a precipitous pullout would leave a gaping security vacuum in its wake which terrorists insurgents militias and iran would rush to fill probably resulting in a spiral of ethnic cleansing and slaughter on a scale as yet unseen in iraq i appeal to my colleagues in congress to step back and think carefully about what to do next instead of undermining gen petraeus before he has been in iraq for even a month let us give him and his troops the time and support they need to succeed gen petraeus says he will be able to see whether progress is occurring by the end of the summer so let us declare a truce in the washington political war over iraq until then let us come together around a constructive legislative agenda for our security authorizing an increase in the size of the army and marines funding the equipment and protection our troops need monitoring progress on the ground in iraq with oversight hearings investigating contract procedures and guaranteeing iraq war veterans the first class treatment and care they deserve when they come home we are at a critical moment in iraq at the beginning of a key battle in the midst of a war that is irretrievably bound up in an even bigger global struggle against the totalitarian ideology of radical islamism however tired however frustrated however angry we may feel we must remember that our forces in iraq carry americas cause the cause of freedom which we abandon at our peril mr lieberman is an
