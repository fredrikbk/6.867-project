policy makers at fed rethink inflations roots low unemployment now is believed to play a less important role for decades a simple rule has governed how the federal reserve views the nations economy when unemployment falls too low inflation goes up and vice versa but fed officials have rethought that notion they believe it takes a far bigger change in unemployment to affect inflation today than it did years ago now when inflation fluctuates they are far more likely to blame temporary factors such as changes in oil prices or rents than a change in the jobless rate one explanation for why inflation is influenced less by changes in unemployment is that the american public has come to expect inflation to remain stable when inflation moves up or down it is less likely to get stuck at the new level because companies and workers dont factor the change into their expectations or their behavior another explanation is that the fed is better at adjusting interest rates in anticipation of swings in unemployment before those swings can affect inflation this new view of the economy formed in recent years helps explain why the fed stopped raising interest rates last summer while core inflation which excludes food and energy prices was rising and it helps explain why the fed is reluctant to cut rates now even though it sees inflation edging lower over the next two years the new view "has profound implications " says former fed economist brian sack now at macroeconomic advisers a st louis based forecasting firm that doesnt mean unemployment can be ignored but it does mean that in the short run a period of high or low joblessness would be less likely to alter the feds view of inflation and trigger an immediate change in interest rates a shift in public expectations of inflation however would carry more weight in the feds calculations in the late s economists discovered a tendency for inflation to rise when unemployment was low and to fall when unemployment was high at lower unemployment rates they concluded companies paid more to attract scarce workers and recouped the higher wage costs by raising prices this relationship was shown on a chart called the phillips curve after alban william phillips one of the first economists to identify it in the s american presidents and fed officials sought to exploit the phillips curve by letting inflation edge higher in exchange for lower unemployment but in the late s economists milton friedman who died last year and edmund phelps both of whom would later become nobel laureates independently deduced that the reduction in unemployment would be temporary once workers began to expect higher inflation they would want higher wages in the long run the economists argued unemployment would gravitate to some "natural" level no matter what inflation did although economists concluded there wasnt a long run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment they still believed there could be a short run tradeoff from to fed chairman paul volcker and his successor alan greenspan exploited this idea periodically using interest rates to push unemployment higher to achieve lasting reductions in inflation but even as they were doing so the short run impact of unemployment on inflation began to diminish though the trend has been under way for years only recently has intensive research by fed economists and others incorporated it into mainstream thinking the new thinking on inflation will be the subject of a march conference in washington that brings together wall street fed watchers academics and fed officials "among the feet on the ground fed inflation forecasters who do this for a living theres been a lot of concern for the last years about whether theres less of a relationship between output and future inflation " says harvard university economist james stock "the accumulation of evidence occurs at a snails pace the evidence now is a lot stronger " mr stock and fellow economist mark watson at princeton university presented evidence to a fed conference in late that inflations long term trend has varied little since and that most fluctuations were the result of temporary disturbances such as a change in energy prices indeed when core inflation rose last year the fed blamed higher rents and oil prices rather than an overheating economy it appears to have been right as energy prices have come down and rent increases moderated so has core inflation core inflation now running at a rate by the feds preferred measure remains higher than the ceiling most fed officials are comfortable with but janet yellen president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco noted earlier this year that over the past decade when inflation has drifted away from the to range it has later reverted to it for this reason it "may move down from its elevated level faster than many forecasters expect " fed chairman ben bernanke echoed that sentiment earlier this month saying the publics expectations will determine whether temporary factors like changes in rents and oil prices "leave a lasting imprint" on inflation "it is encouraging that inflation expectations appear to have remained contained " he said mr phelps says the new thinking on the phillips curve doesnt change the implications of his nobel winning work if the fed never responded to higher inflation consumers and businesses eventually would begin to expect higher inflation and "then the game is up " fed officials agree while a given drop in unemployment is less likely to spark inflation the potential is still there the feds staff estimates it takes up to twice as much additional unemployment to achieve a percentage drop in inflation as it did before "imbalances between demand and potential supply may be slow to show through convincingly to inflation but when they do they may be costly to correct " fed vice chairman donald kohn said in late thats one reason the fed though it expects core inflation to ease this year isnt relaxing with unemployment currently at or below the feds view of its natural rate inflation may edge up after the temporary impacts of energy and rent subside that could require the fed to raise interest rates enough to push unemployment up sharply and bring inflation down see related letter "letters to the editor the new sources of inflation" march
