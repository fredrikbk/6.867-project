radar returns for a third try in the buzz business blog and big backers help give latest launch shot at success editor is still a favorite target its one of the more unlikely revivals in recent magazine history radar a glossy magazine about pop culture and scandal that has been launched twice in the past four years is back for a third run at newsstands radars attempt at resurrection might seem quixotic at a time when magazines are losing advertisers firing workers and often scrambling to show the world they have an internet strategy but successful magazines still can be more profitable than their web counterparts radar will be closely watched for what it says about the properties of buzz that elusive word of mouth phenomenon the ad industry is increasingly trying to figure out and use to its advantages radar springs from the buzz intensive media hothouses of new york los angeles and other big cities its editor in chief maer roshan is a battle scarred veteran of these worlds when he first tried to get radar off the ground in he was fresh from tina browns talk magazine which was similar in themes and target readership talk itself was a victim of buzz gone wrong launched with such deep pockets and breathless hype including a celebrity studded party at the statue of liberty complete with fireworks that some in the magazine intelligentsia came to root for it to fail which it did this schadenfreude extended to mr roshan at first but now that hes been knocked down twice and keeps fighting the buzz seems to be moving back in his favor moreover he has used the web to jump start this third incarnation radar online was launched in september not just with routine editorial content but a team of reporters assigned to break news since then the site has inched up the web log rankings attracting readers with an irreverent take on american culture and celebrity and breaking stories on author james frey and the mark foley scandal helped by links from sites like the huffington post and tmz radar online in its first month drew more unique visitors than established blogs such as defamer according to nielsen netratings it now ranks th on technoratis list of most popular blogs after starting at to help back the print relaunch radar has attracted a group of high profile investors including yusef jackson jesse jacksons youngest son and at&amp t inc the telecommunications giant is committing more than &# million according to a person familiar with the situation as part of its strategy to morph from a landline phone company into an internet based company with new content the investors say they are confident they can expand the radar franchise online and take it into new areas such as internet television "the magazine and the web site are just the beginning the investment is designed to be multiplatform " mr jackson says mr roshan wants radar to be a forum for thoughtful long form articles and believes that magazines remain the best medium for that kind of journalism "there are things you can only do in magazines " he says his vision for a magazine about pop culture politics and scandal targeted at urban youth still makes him a favorite target in particular gawker the manhattan based gossip web site yet mr roshan has proved adept at convincing powerful businessmen that radar has potential as a magazine movie producer harvey weinstein and real estate and media heavyweight mort zuckerman backed radars previous incarnations fewer print magazines are launched these days and those that have appeared such as conde nasts recently killed cargo are narrowly focused and often the product of exhaustive focus group research skeptics question whether radars gossipy take no prisoners brand of celebrity and political journalism while popular on the web can draw enough advertising to sustain a mass circulation magazine "frankly i dont understand why everyone loves it so much and is willing to invest money in it it has failed two times in the past what is it really an adult gossip book if you think about it right " says martin walker chairman of walker communications a magazine consulting company so far advertiser reaction has been
