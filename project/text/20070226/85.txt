for the super bowl attended fashion week in new york and then flew to l a to attend the grammys after a year without visiting the gym mostly due to laziness and partly due to a hectic work schedule he decided to hire a personal trainer to get him motivated and back in shape mr fahey is single and lives and works in manhattan he is " and weighs pounds the workout when your job revolves around interviewing music stars and celebrities its easy to start living a rock star partying late into the night drinking too much and eating poorly says mr fahey he has found that sticking to a workout routine helps him keep his partying in check and motivates him to try to eat better and sleep more while providing him with more energy to perform better in his band and at work but he cant do it on his own during periods in high school and college mr fahey was devoted to protein shakes and the weight room "i started working out mainly because girls like strong men but if its strong men versus a guy on tv then the guy on tv wins " since starting work at mtv his exercise habits have been stop and go he recently went a whole year without going to the gym "when i went back everyone at the gym asked me what happened and i just told them i was lazy " explains mr fahey "but with the new year i planned to start over and want to keep it up " to stay motivated mr fahey now depends on his trainer who he started working with at the beginning of january he wakes up around a m and will text his personal trainer to schedule a session around noon after eating breakfast at home mr fahey meets his trainer at crunch gym about ten minutes from his apartment for an hour long session he starts with a ten minute warm up on the treadmill moving from a walk to a jog to a run to get his blood flowing mr fahey has a tall lanky frame so he concentrates on building muscle rather than losing weight "my trainer is helping me sculpt the perfect body " he jokes his strength program works opposing muscle groups like chest and back so hell spend about minutes doing exercises that work his back like a seated row or lateral pull down and then minutes doing exercises that work his chest like a bench press mr fahey stretches at the end of each session mr fahey used to have tendonitis in his hands and had to wear a brace a doctor prescribed stretching exercises which he does at the gym and at home religiously now mr fahey meets his trainer three days a week and goes to the gym on his own though he admits he does a lighter workout when hes not being pushed working out on a regular basis influences other aspects of mr faheys life he tries to get to bed by midnight "whats the point of going to the gym if youre going to be out parting and only sleep four hours " he asks he rarely gets to a hotel gym when he travels "thats hard for me " he says "im usually traveling for something fun like the grammys so i dont really want to work out i want to have fun " sometimes he will do push ups in his hotel room if hes feeling motivated the diet for the most part mr fahey eats three meals a day and generally makes healthy well balanced choices "if i dont eat i get cranky " he says "its like dr jekyll and mr hyde " breakfast might be a toasted cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese or toast with cinnamon or oatmeal hell have coffee cream and sugar with breakfast and usually two more cups throughout the day if he works out he has a protein shake after the gym mr fahey doesnt count calories but he has become more concerned about the quality of the food he puts in his body especially since he started working out again rather than buy lunch every day he orders groceries from fresh direct a food delivery service in new york city and will prepare meals like tacos or grilled chicken at home he is adamant about purchasing organic meat vegetables and fruit mr fahey credits his youthful metabolism and good genes for letting him get away with some of his favorite splurges he was able to rattle off the location of nearly every pizzeria unos in manhattan from memory "the deep dish pizza from unos probably has grams of fat but that followed by a brownie bowl is so good " says mr fahey an individual sized cheese and tomato deep dish pizza from pizzeria unos has grams of fat and calories and a brownie bowl an ice cream sundae has calories and grams of fat "im lucky i dont have to worry about not eating dessert today because i had it yesterday and it may make my thighs fat " he says "not yet eventually i will " the cost mr fahey spends about &# per month for his gym membership at crunch plus about &# for a session package with his personal trainer "if my trainer doesnt hear from me hell text me threatening messages or call me and say thanks for the donations " says mr fahey "since im paying him he jokes that if i dont use my sessions im basically just giving him my money " he keeps his workout gear simple and causal sweatpants and a t shirt he admits he should probably invest in a better pair of shoes right now he wears his converse to the gym the effort the biggest obstacle for mr fahey is getting himself to the gym "once im there and start working out i feel great " he says "but i need someone to hold me accountable and keep me in line " he says he works out harder and pushes himself more when his trainer is with him "hell say do six more reps and i am thinking there is no way i can do that but i do i think theres no way that would have happened if he wasnt behind me he really helps me explore the limits of my body " the benefit "two years ago i was not fitting into my body " says mr fahey "but i already notice that im filling out a little more since ive started lifting weights again " mr fahey has also noticed that he feels more energetic and also more stamina during band rehearsals "ive noticed i can play the drums for three hours and its not a big deal at all " he says "it also motivates me to center my eating and activities around a healthy lifestyle " says mr fahey "if i dont then i fell like its an hour of my day that ive wasted i still go out and party im not perfect but i definitely have fewer whoo hoo party nights when im in a routine of exercising and eating well " write to jen murphy at workout wsj com
