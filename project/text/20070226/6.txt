boeing is offering jamming protection to satellite customers facing escalating concerns about the potential vulnerability of u s space assets to terrorists and hostile governments boeing co for the first time is offering to install advanced antijamming technology on some future commercial satellites military and spy satellites use such hardware and other techniques to help prevent disruption of their signals now efforts are under way to expand at least some of the same protective devices to commercial space which includes more than large satellites in high earth orbits boeings effort to provide sophisticated antennas designed to counteract jamming is part of a broader push supported by both industry and the pentagon to safeguard commercial fleets in orbit "some of our customers are looking for technology to potentially reduce the threat" of jamming said craig cooning deputy general manager of boeings space and intelligence systems unit which builds commercial and government satellites mr cooning said down the road such safeguards "could become a differentiator" in the commercial marketplace he said boeing is actively discussing the matter with at least one commercial customer whom he declined to identify boeing declined to disclose the cost the move follows a string of high profile chinese moves demonstrating that countrys advances in space within the past year china has laid out details of an aggressive manned space program and tested a ground based laser system by targeting a u s government satellite it also used a rocket to demonstrate its ability to shoot down one of its own weather satellites from low earth orbit boeings impetus is coming from two different directions commercial operators increasingly worry that hundreds of millions of dollars invested in one or two large satellites could be jeopardized if individuals or groups manage to jam video data or voice signals such worries go way beyond "idle speculation about future challenges to our space assets " u s air force lt gen robert kehler said last year jamming of government navigation satellites "has occurred " he said "as has jamming of commercial telecommunications satellites " chinas focus on space combined with separate moves by iran india and other countries pursuing space endeavors has prompted strong words from the bush administration two months ago the state department warned about rising national security threats from the "hostile use of space " including terrorist groups that could jam blind or disable satellites commercial satellites carry more than of the u s militarys satellite traffic around the world given that exposure pentagon officials are prodding operators to come up with additional defenses intelsat ltd which has the largest global telecommunications fleet in orbit is under pressure to include enhanced encryption capabilities on newly built satellites according to people familiar with the details while boeings latest strategy targets a limited group of satellites a number of satellite operators have expressed general interest and stepped up discussions could result in a broader trend adding to the cost and complexity of next generation commercial spacecraft according to industry officials boeing initially developed the jam resistant antennas solely for pentagon applications and the u s government would have to give its blessing before they can migrate to commercial satellites owned by foreign companies during an industry conference last week in washington d c mr cooning a retired air force general said "inevitably were going to see more jamming in the future " he added "congress may be willing to subsidize" extra protections for commercial satellites
