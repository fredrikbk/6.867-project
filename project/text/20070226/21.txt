deal some private equity firms now have explicit mandates from investors to undertake such bids as henny sender reports other private equity firms meanwhile are seeking the flexibility to buy minority stakes as well as majority control of public companies in hopes of wringing out value its all another indication that buyout funds which have raised billions of dollars in new cash are eager to put their money to work while financial conditions remain highly favorable for leveraged buyouts whether in a collaborative unsolicited or even hostile approaches in the past private equity funds waited for activist funds to take investment stakes and call for changes the besieged corporate prey would then turn to private equity firms as white knights now though private equity firms are acting as their own "catalyst" rather than waiting on the hedge funds often they lob letters voicing their interest in the company to corporate boards and force them to respond read henny senders report http

lured a few new allies to his side to bolster his narrow majority in parliament where in the senatem he had previously commanded only a one vote majority among his new supporters are the members of a small centrist party founded by a former ally of center right opposition leader silvio berlusconi mr prodi has also forced the members of his coalition to sign off on a point document aimed at guaranteeing greater cohesion within the group which now numbers parties ranging from catholics to hard core communists with his new coalition tentatively in place he must address parliament later

s stopped its legislative maneuvering over the iraq war and looked to baghdad it would see what its new security strategy actually entails and how dramatically it differs from previous efforts writes joe lieberman in a commentary on our opinion pages the independent democratic senator from connecticut who holds a critical vote in the u s senate says that for the first time in the iraqi capital the focus of the u s military is not just training indigenous forces or chasing down insurgents but ensuring basic security meaning an end at last to the sectarian slaughter and ethnic cleansing that has paralyzed iraq for the past year he says tamping down this violence is more than a moral imperative al qaedas stated strategy in iraq has been to provoke a sunni shia civil war precisely because they recognize that it is their best chance to radicalize the countrys politics derail any hope of democracy in the middle east and drive the u s to despair and retreat it also takes advantage of what has been the single greatest american weakness in iraq the absence of sufficient troops to protect ordinary iraqis from violence and terrorism the new strategy at last begins to tackle these problems read

prodigiously they have been discovering that while a certain amount of reserves provide a useful cushion against financial crises a plenitude can soon turn into a problem its costly to soak up the liquidity created by inflows and prevent it from generating domestic inflation as eswar s prasad and raghuram g rajan argue in a commentary on our opinion pages though politicians want to spend the reserves to fill holes in their budgets foreign exchange reserves arent free unencumbered assets in many cases central banks issue domestic bonds to soak up the foreign exchange so the reserves are pledged against the bonds spending reserves is then akin to non transparent off budget financing in addition unless they are spent in buying foreign assets as china is doing buying oil reserves the foreign exchange will simply return to the central bank kitty however there is a practical way for countries to reduce the build up of reserves even while limiting risk and allowing their financial sector to develop countries could authorize some closed end mutual funds to issue shares in domestic currency use the proceeds to purchase foreign exchange from the central bank and then invest the proceeds abroad read the commentary on our opinion pages by eswar s prasad and raghuram g rajan http online wsj com article sb html write to michael connolly at michael connolly wsj com
