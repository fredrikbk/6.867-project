ahead of the tape wrong way street signs point to speed investors are trading so quickly they may not see the risks in the market for the speed in the stock market the idea of holding on to an investment for the long term doesnt seem to hold much allure any more according to sanford c bernstein chief investment officer vadim zlotnikov the average holding period for stocks on the new york stock exchange and american stock exchange last year was less than seven months in stereotyped as a time of rapid fire day trading the average holding period was more than a year in fact the last time stocks were being held for as short a period as they are now was when students of history may recall something happened to the market mr zlotnikovs analysis doesnt include the increasingly popular and complex derivative strategies that investors use to gain exposure to stocks without actually holding shares on the chicago board options exchange for example the trading volume on individual stock options was higher last year than it was in technology has a lot to do with the increase in turnover increased computing power means strategies that years ago existed only in theoreticians notebooks now can be put into everyday use lower trading costs and the switch to decimalization the pricing of stocks in dollars and cents rather than dollars and fractions have let investors profit from price anomalies that used to be too expensive to exploit also driving the increase the rising prominence of hedge funds because they tend to be judged by each years performance few professional fund managers have the luxury to ignore short term price swings and invest for the long haul losing your job and then having history prove your investing acumen right is nobodys idea of fun for hedge fund managers the short term performance pressures can be intense first because the high fees they charge make their investors intolerant of losses second because some of the trading strategies they use mean the losses they face if a position goes wrong can be steep the result is a constant trading in and out of positions to capture returns in todays marketspeak hedge funds are emphatically working to "generate short term alpha " what it boils down to is the age old practice of stop loss trading automatically buying and selling stocks when they rise or fall to specified levels despite all the moving in and out of stocks stock price movements have been remarkably quiescent stock market volatility as measured by actual price movements rather than the options price generated "implied" volatility measured by cboes market volatility index is at its lowest level in years implied volatility is near a decade low it may be that the combined effect of all the sophisticated trading strategies in place today have put the stock market into a state of dynamic tension where all the tugging and pulling effectively cancels each other out muffling price movements at the same time investors intolerance of short term losses could mean that if the stock market seriously stumbles the droves of fund managers engaging in stop loss selling could overwhelm the market when volatility comes back it could do it in a grand fashion send comments to justin lahart wsj com
