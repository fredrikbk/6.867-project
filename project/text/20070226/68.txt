shareholders push for vote on executive pay some shareholders are angry about soaring executive pay soon they may get a voice ahead of this years annual meetings activist investors have submitted shareholder proposals at roughly companies seeking an advisory vote on executive pay according to institutional shareholder services targets include citigroup inc wells fargo &amp co wellpoint inc and northrop grumman corp the vote would be nonbinding but activists hope that public censure or the threat of it would prompt directors to curb outsized awards and better link pay with performance the proposals come as new securities and exchange commission rules requiring greater disclosure promise to cast a brighter spotlight on compensation one company facing a shareholder proposal insurer aflac inc agreed earlier this month to give investors a nonbinding vote on executive compensation beginning in others including pfizer inc and schering plough corp are discussing the possibility of similar moves this week u s rep barney frank d mass the new chairman of the house financial services committee plans to introduce a revised version of his bill that aimed to give shareholders power to veto executive pay deals he will hold a hearing next week on his latest measure which instead would require advisory votes the activists are taking a page from the british since united kingdom shareholders have cast advisory votes on corporate compensation policies and how much they pay executives investors and companies say the practice which began after the british government passed a law requiring it for all public companies has generated more discussion between shareholders and boards but it hasnt necessarily curbed compensation "we have better disclosure and better accountability " says ian jones head of responsible investment at co operative insurance society ltd an insurance company with about &# billion under management but "i dont think its had much effect on the amount of remuneration " british ceos have long made less on average than their u s counterparts but pay in both markets has risen at roughly comparable rates in recent years with some indications pay may have risen faster in the u k than in the u s the median salary and bonus for ceos at large and mid size u k companies totaled gbp &# million in the latest year for which data are available according to the u k arm of iss thats up from and from gbp in in the u s median ceo salary and bonus hit &# million in up from and up from &# million in at large companies studied by mercer human resource consulting the companies in the and samples varied somewhat stephen davis a fellow at yale universitys millstein center for corporate governance and performance who has studied the u k experience says the advisory vote has strengthened the link between pay and performance for example pay consultants say the practice has pushed british companies to shift executive compensation toward bonuses and away from big salary increases but mr davis says "investors still feel that pay is not yet fully aligned with performance in the way that they would like " mr davis says companies and investors are on a learning curve but he says the vote appears to have helped curb severance packages at the start of the decade a three year payout was standard today a one year payout is "virtually universal " mr davis says but he says directors worry that investors reviewing dozens of pay plans are issuing "cookie cutter" judgments rather than evaluating packages individually big u k shareholders applaud the increased discussion talks often held in advance of annual meetings are "more meaningful" than the occasional formal presentations managers used to offer shareholders says colin melvin head of corporate governance at london based hermes pension management ltd which manages &# billion in assets for instance in of votes cast by shareholders opposed a pay package for glaxosmithkline plc chief executive jean pierre garnier the pharmaceutical maker later agreed to overhaul its pay policies and end "what might be deemed payment for failure " according to its letter to shareholders dr garniers total pay package fell slightly in to &# million from &# million the year before ahead of the shareholder meeting glaxo sent draft copies of its compensation report to large shareholders according to richard singleton the director of corporate governance at f&amp c asset management mr singleton emailed glaxos then chairman sir christopher hogg suggesting tougher performance targets for executives to earn bonuses the company added a clause stating performance targets would consider analysts forecasts "i was delighted " mr singleton says the clause remains part of glaxos compensation policy a glaxo spokesman confirmed the clause was inserted in the report but he declined to comment on the process sir christopher couldnt be reached tlk doesnt always translate into action early last year london based investment manager amvescap plc decided to pay its departing chairman charles w brady a &# million bonus isss british arm believed the payment was unjustified according to director of research david paterson and considered opposing the compensation report amvescaps company secretary michael perman told an iss analyst that executives considered the bonus reasonable because mr brady had shepherded amvescap through a tough period and had hired a new chief executive the analyst wasnt convinced and iss recommended that investors oppose the compensation report at the annual meeting of votes cast did mr brady did get the bonus an amvescap spokesman declined to comment beyond a written statement from amvescap chairman rex adams on the day of the vote "over the last weeks amvescap has initiated direct discussions with many of our companys major shareholders and we believe we have a good understanding of their views " despite the shortcomings u k investors are among those pushing u s companies to adopt the advisory vote in january a group of institutional investors nine british wrote sec chairman christopher cox to endorse the practice the group which collectively has &# trillion under management said the votes would bolster communication between shareholders and directors better link pay with performance and "provide a counter weight" to rising executive pay companies in australia sweden and the netherlands also grant shareholders a vote on pay in the u s the american federation of state county and municipal employees union sponsored "say on pay" resolutions at seven companies last year and so far this year says richard ferlauto director of pension and benefit policy for afscme iss says the resolutions last year won an average of support which is high for new issues this year afscme is co leading a group of companies and shareholders to discuss the idea the group includes pfizer intel corp schering plough and american international group inc as well as the california public employees retirement system and other funds some corporate participants in the group think the concept has merit but they worry about the mechanics one sticking point how to give shareholders a voice on elements of a pay package that companies are legally bound to pay such as an executives deferred compensation "you create an expectation that you can do something about it" if investors reject the package says one person close to the situation alex kelly head of investor relations at schering plough says the company is willing to consider letting shareholders vote on pay "were willing to listen " he says other companies oppose the notion in a statement to be included in its proxy wells fargo argues that an advisory pay vote "would provide no clear or meaningful guidance" because directors wouldnt know which portion of compensation investors objected to shareholders already have plenty of ways to tell directors what they think the company states wells fargo also contends that the u s and u k corporate systems have "significant differences in regulatory and corporate governance policies and practices " other companies aim to keep the proposal off the proxy wellpoint contended to the sec staff that the proposal could be kept off the ballot sec rules allow companies to exclude proposals in some circumstances including if its "misleading " on friday wellpoint was notified that the sec staff agreed "there appears to be some basis for your view " so wellpoint will now keep it off the proxy a spokesman says a spokeswoman for proposal submitter connecticut retirement plans and trust funds said it wont try to appeal to the sec instead it will support the say on pay idea in other ways such as by supporting legislation mr frank plans to introduce another company northrop grumman has also argued to the sec that the proposal should be kept off the proxy as of friday the company had not heard back a spokesman said joann s
