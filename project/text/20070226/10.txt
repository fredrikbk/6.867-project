boss talk global trade galvanizes caterpillar maker of heavy equipment thrives under ceo owens fervent free trade advocate since becoming chairman and chief executive of caterpillar inc three years ago jim owens has seen the peoria ill maker of heavy equipment nearly double in size to &# billion in revenue last year as it rode a global boom in construction and mining the growth had its pains as caterpillar struggled with production bottlenecks lengthy delivery times and capacity expansion missteps that occasionally disappointed wall street now mr owens years old says he is more concerned with fattening the companys bottom line by making manufacturing more efficient slimming dealer inventories and continuing to press for free trade the ph d from north carolina state university who joined caterpillar years ago as an economist oversees a global behemoth of factories and employees in naples fla attending a recent meeting of the business council mr owens discussed world class manufacturing free trade sen barack obama federal reserve chairman ben bernanke and the ncaa basketball tournament excerpts wsj caterpillar just announced a &# billion share buyback why mr owens sitting on a big wad of cash doesnt make any sense whatsoever for shareholders it also tends to promote bad practice among management almost all good companies make their worst mistakes in the best of times thats when you get into overreaching youve got more cash than you know what to do with and you think youre so damned good you can buy anything and make it better wsj how is it that cat added nearly &# billion in revenue in the last three years " mr owens weve done it on the strength of the global economy in through we experienced a prolonged recession in our key markets in the through period the global economy experienced its best three years of growth since world war ii that drove strong commodity prices and the combination of those and the strong economy led to a significant increase in investment for natural resource development and global infrastructure when this surge in demand started in we were well positioned in terms of market leadership and some excess capacity to realize significant organic growth in a very short period of time wsj looks like youre going to easily hit your goal of &# billion plus in annual revenue by is it time to set the bar higher mr owens what were really about in this near term is just a relentless focus on execution were very focused on introducing a caterpillar production system thats universal across all of our manufacturing operations world wide weve had a propensity to do things at least slightly differently all over the world weve benchmarked many different industries and then our own best in class facilities and created our own recipe book whether our top line sales are &# billion or &# billion is going to be a lot less important than pulling off that operational excellence the holy grail is not top line sales growth its bottom line profit growth wsj youve also said you want to get away from the automotive model of stuffing dealers inventories with products mr owens we want to keep some dealer inventory out there so they can see it and buy it and try it but we want to get away from having them carry significant amounts of inventory if you look back dealer inventory swings have in every case aggravated the business cycle for caterpillar we work overtime to build inventory in the up cycles and then in down cycles help them get it moved by price discounting or other bad practices weve got to convince them that they dont need to hold the inventory this is a huge cultural change wsj are you concerned about the new political climate for trade in washington mr owens i have been very worried about a turn inward a feeling that we can sustain our standard of living by building walls around the country and blocking trade that would just be a grievous mistake bad for the united states and bad for the global economy ive been traveling in asia for years and ive seen hundreds of millions of people lifted out of abject poverty from the benefit of exporting to the united states i would say the republicans made a terrible mistake in partisanizing trade it needs to be a bipartisan national policy to be a free trading country its easy to bash free trade because if somebody loses a job you can personalize it the fact that tens of thousands are benefiting by buying very high quality very low price goods imported from china is one of the great realities of the american standard of living wsj what about the democrats mr owens im encouraged that democrats who as a party were bashing trade now have more thoughtful people stepping forward to say this shouldnt be about partisanship barack obama is a senator from our state and ive had the chance to talk to him about it i quite frankly was very disappointed he voted against the central america free trade agreement how can you not want free trade with countries that have done most of the things wed like them to do in terms of democratizing their countries but he seems to be a guy who can move off of extreme partisan positions and try to find win win positions we need to win him over wsj how do you make the argument that free trade is a win win situation to someone who fears his &# a year job will be outsourced to china mr owens its a very difficult sell its like the guy whos making horse carriages when the car comes along how do you make the case to him that the cars going to make the world a better place we try to educate our employees on the importance of exports to us we exported &# billion worth of product last year and many jobs in our u s facilities are very much geared to export markets many small manufacturing companies that supply materials to us probably dont consider themselves as exporters but they are if we dont export we dont buy from them so they lose jobs wsj will caterpillars u s work force shrink as it expands abroad mr owens were going to have a lot more employment growth outside than inside the us we americans are of the worlds population and today were more than of global gross domestic product so it shouldnt shock americans or even worry us too much that or years from now were going to have a smaller percentage of gdp because our countrys not growing as fast as emerging countries it doesnt mean that our standard of livings going to go down it just means that theirs is going to grow much faster wsj whats the best country to do business in mr owens brazil in some respects is challenging but weve got one of the best operations we have in the world due to the leadership we have in that facility and the espirit de corps i was in china recently and i heard people there say they wanted to be the brazil of asia some of our large midwestern facilities have kind of a challenge of mixed allegiance to the company or the union a we they ism that we havent successfully purged were trying to have people understand that if we pay you youre on our team and we want your heart and soul we want you to help us be cost effective we want you to help us improve quality wsj what was the buzz at business council mr owens the buzz is always about the economy the key issue right now is do we see some easing of interest rates over maybe the latter half of the year and reacceleration of the u s economy and a soft landing here that creates a soft landing in the global economy or do we end up tightening again and having slow growth become slower growth or recession in weve got to drive some liquidity im certainly feeling that inflation is a minimal risk and i worry that we may overcorrect wsj what does ben bernanke do mr owens i think hes going to sit on a pat hand for a while i think were going to see inflation be very well behaved and i expect hell be in a position to be comfortable easing interest rates in the latter half of the year wsj did executive compensation come up at the business council mr owens its amazing how much more time boards are spending looking at proxy statements and compensation write ups and dotting is and crossing ts how does this help us compete in the global marketplace for ceos if you make over &# million thats "excessive pay " if you participate in financial services or in sports thats ok wsj youre a big college hoops fan whos going to win the ncaa basketball tournament mr owens if i had to pick one team and put money on the table right now id pick florida  tips for managing a global giant  act with integrity value your people  complacency is incompatible with success  stay focused on bottom line growth  dont shy away from tough debates  embrace globalization
