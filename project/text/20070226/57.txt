politics &amp economics fcc may try to scrub kids tv big univision fine suggests new focus on programming washington federal regulators appear to be turning more attention to a perennial concern making sure television is safer for kids last week spanish language broadcaster univision communications inc agreed in principle to pay an unusually steep &# million fine for violating the childrens television act which requires broadcasters to show three hours of educational programming a week federal communications commission officials said in exchange the fcc will approve univisions sale to a consortium of private equity groups for &# billion univision declined to comment on the proposed consent decree its the largest fine assessed by the fcc against a company far exceeding the &# million fine slapped on qwest communications in for violating fcc rules and the &# million indecency fine proposed against cbs and its affiliates last year for an episode of the crime drama "without a trace " broadcasters have long considered republican fcc chairman kevin martin an ally since becoming an fcc commissioner in hes been an advocate for some of their biggest priorities including a requirement that cable companies carry more local channels once the u s shifts to digital only broadcasts in the national association of broadcasters hope hell torpedo a proposed merger of terrestrial radios rivals xm satellite radio holdings inc and sirius satellite radio inc but broadcasters are also increasingly finding themselves on the wrong side of mr martins fcc last year the networks and affiliates took the unusual step of challenging several proposed indecency fines in federal court more recently the fcc has drafted a report suggesting congress can expand the agencys reach to regulate violence on tv now the fccs unusually large fine against univision appears to be part of a larger effort by the agency to make sure broadcasters are offering kid friendly programming the &# million fine was negotiated by mr martins staff not the five member fcc board several senior fcc officials including at least one fcc commissioner said they learned of the fine by reading the new york times on saturday despite some discomfort about the unusually high amount of the fine the full fcc board is likely to vote for it it would be politically difficult for fcc members to vote against enforcing childrens programming standards and the company has apparently agreed to pay the fine to clear the way for its sale mr martin said the severity of the violation and the long time period in which children watching univision the largest spanish language broadcaster in the u s had no appropriate shows led him to propose the historic fine providence equity partners inc one of the firms buying univision employs michael powell a republican and mr martins predecessor as fcc chairman as a senior adviser the two had a rocky relationship prompting speculation it played a role in the stringent fine "it wasnt a factor at all " mr martin said he said he didnt know mr powell was involved in the deal "across the board were trying to protect consumers " said mr martin who pointed out the univision fine follows previous efforts to ensure service is available from all phones and newly proposed rules to protect the privacy of cellphone users "i dont think im trying to send any particular message the commission takes all of its rules seriously " he said but the fine also may go a long way toward placating latino groups whove complained the fcc has ignored violations on spanish language stations and some conservative christians whove grumbled that mr martin hasnt done enough to clean up the airwaves "it boggles the mind that univision would even attempt to present a soap opera as educational programming for children " said janice shaw crouse a former speechwriter for president george h w bush referring to company claims that figured in the fine she currently is a senior fellow for the concerned women for america a think tank devoted to bringing "biblical principles into all levels of public policy " according to its web site the new politics of capitol hill may also play a role with democrats controlling congress mr martin is expected to begin making regular trips to capitol hill to explain his agencys actions a greater emphasis by the fcc on trying to regulate violent television shows could help mr martin with some leading democrats such as west virginia sen jay rockefeller an outspoken critic about the issue the fccs crackdown on univision has already been applauded by massachusetts rep edward markey a democrat whos often been critical of mr martin mr markey helped write the federal requirements on childrens television broadcasts years ago univision was accused by watchdog groups of violating childrens broadcast standards on stations between and by claiming that "complices al rescate " a soap opera about year old identical twin girls was educational several groups complained it wasnt childrens television advocates expressed shock at the size of the &# million fine since several complaints about inappropriate childrens shows including the univision soap opera had sat without action for upward of two years the united church of christ representing million members and very active on educational broadcasting issues became so frustrated it sent a letter to the fcc last september to complain "we hope very much this is a sign that childrens television will now be taken seriously by the agency " said cheryl leanza a church spokeswoman according to people familiar with the fcc consent decree the company will offer a voluntary one time payment of &# million but wont admit wrong doing additionally univision will establish an advisory committee and appoint a compliance officer to ensure the network is meeting the fccs childrens programming requirements miriam jordan in los angeles contributed to this article
