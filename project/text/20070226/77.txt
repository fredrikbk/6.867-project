steering mill towns closer to tech boom riches the technology boom has been kind to the boston area but downright hostile to the historic mill towns of massachusetts which have been rendered almost irrelevant by the knowledge economy but now those once thriving manufacturing centers are being touted as an answer to the dark side of bostons success congested highways and workers who can no longer afford to live there in a report to be released today the brookings institution and boston think tank massinc suggest that the old mill towns could provide the boston areas high tech employers with needed workers affordable housing and a model for growth that doesnt involve suburban sprawl more broadly their findings make a case for directing more of the nations high tech investments beyond hot spots like silicon valley to lower cost locales including older manufacturing centers like detroit and cleveland which offer the potential for more sustainable growth consider haverhill mass an industrial town on the merrimack river miles north of boston the median home price is &# less than in greater boston rezoning in haverhill has allowed for the redevelopment of shuttered factories into residential loft space as well as the citys first big box retail development which features a target store the town has good rail and road connections to greater boston and is positioning itself to attract biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies "were hoping well be next in line " says mayor james fiorentini that the mill towns havent shared in the tech boom defies the notion that in the knowledge economy location doesnt matter in fact much as the film industry is centered around hollywood technology companies tend to spring up near research universities and suppliers clustering in places like silicon valley san diego and boston "its all about how to bring the best people in the world together to turn ideas into business " says joseph cortright an economist at impresa consulting in portland ore massachusetts shows how unevenly distributed a high tech boom can be according to the brookings and massinc report the boston areas share of the states technology companies has grown to from in the area added jobs between and today it is home to of the states population and of its private sector jobs and generates of the states payroll during the same period massachusetts mill towns brockton fall river fitchburg haverhill holyoke lawrence lowell new bedford pittsfield springfield and worcester lost more than jobs today they account for of the states population of its private jobs and less than of its public payroll the wealth gap is correspondingly large the mill towns with sizable groups of immigrants and minorities account for of the states residents living in poverty according to the report between and real median home prices in boston more than doubled to &# complicating the areas effort to recruit workers residential development in boston consumed nearly acres of undeveloped land between and contributing to road congestion taken together the report says these trends represent "a serious threat to the overall economic competitiveness of massachusetts " brookings and massinc acknowledge transforming the mill towns into realistic alternatives for high tech employers will be a challenge many of the towns have spotty track records for delivery of basic services and are plagued by troubled school systems and fiscal uncertainty several years ago massachusetts bailed out springfield miles west of boston with a &# million loan and imposed a finance control board to oversee city operations mr cortright the economist wonders whether such towns will ever share in the spoils of the states technology boom given the cluster phenomenon none are closer than a minute drive from boston "once youre beyond minutes it doesnt matter if youre a mill town or india " he says but the report suggests the state needs to try to make the mill towns more economically attractive among its recommendations linking state aid to local governments cost control efforts establishing data systems to track local spending and making city budgets more transparent the report also urges private public partnerships to expand investment in education and offer more school choices as well as closer ties between english language classes and work force development efforts in addition it proposes a push to provide the southeastern massachusetts cities of fall river and new bedford with commuter rail connections to boston develop the mill towns broadband and wireless infrastructure and strengthen their collaboration with local colleges while admitting there is "no silver bullet " mark muro director of policy for the brookings metropolitan policy program says the towns offer "potential solutions to some of the toughest problems facing massachusetts "
