americas one year after cafta as the central american free trade agreement marks its one year anniversary friday its a good time to remind capitol hill protectionists how wrong they were when they tried to kill the deal in every country that entered into cafta is enjoying new benefits including the u s the u s and el salvador were the first two countries to begin trading under cafta last march in the months that followed guatemala nicaragua and honduras made it official the dominican republic and costa rica have yet to join both have signed onto the negotiated agreement but without implementing legislation before feb they could end up shut out of the free trade area costa rica hasnt even ratified the deal yet the early results from caftas first year are promising central americans are importing more than ever from the u s and the region is also attracting new capital both developments are helping participants grow more competitive and improving the quality of life for consumers to appreciate caftas potential for the region some historical perspective is in order much of central americas misery can be traced to extreme protectionism in the th century the u s imposition of the smoot hawley tariffs in was one important catalyst in closing latin american markets to imports since most countries slapped on retaliatory tariffs world war ii provided another excuse for protectionism in an economic zone heavily dependent on northern markets for its commodities then along came raul prebisch an economist at the united nations economic commission on latin america and the caribbean who famously argued in that for the region to develop it had to close its markets and let infant industries develop free of foreign competition "import substitution industrialization" became a religion by central america had the worlds highest level of import protection quality choice and competitiveness had plummeted after the soviet and cuban inspired civil wars of the s a slow transformation began today dollarized el salvador is the most economically liberal cafta country and may be in a position to benefit the most from the trade accord its total exports to the u s actually went down in the past year but that seems to be explained largely by the end of the wto multifiber agreement without cafta the contraction could have been worse offsetting the pain is an increase in imports which are helping diversify the economy according to the economy ministry of non maquiladora imports from the u s last year were in six sectors and accounted for of the growth in imports over most were intermediate and capital goods for manufacturing and services this includes yellow corn and wheat for the agroindustry polyethylene for plastics electronic equipment such as telephones and computers fuels and paper and cardboard for packaging el salvador is also shifting away from traditional low wage garment assembly operations toward the delivery of value added high end apparel that includes all services bundled in the production process according to ricardo sagrera president of the textile group hilasal enhanced two way trade is helping el salvador capitalize on its comparative advantages notably its legendary work force and its proximity to the u s and compete with china imports of electronics are critical components in el salvadors growing service sector call centers now support an estimated jobs another profitable new service industry handles foreign shipping to the region from asia and europe cutting out a stop in the u s investment levels would probably be higher if el salvador had a better record on personal security it is one of the most dangerous countries in latin america which surely discourages investors nevertheless investments such as citibanks &# billion purchase of central americas second largest financial group grupo cuscatlan suggest confidence in guatemala which joined cafta in july the government says total trade grew by in the second half of last year compared with in the first half it also says that foreign direct investment tripled last year a guatemalan official i talked to said that the agreement has been good for his country because it has made doing business easier for example customs and photosanitary regulations have to be standardized and streamlined in order to comply with cafta this is leading to more efficient trading within the region thats important for companies like wal mart which has a substantial presence in central america and is driving competitiveness in the retail sector the retail giant taps suppliers in central america for the perishables it sells greens come from guatemala el salvador and honduras meat and pork from el salvador with cafta the distribution process has become more efficient wal marts need for perishables has also helped small and medium sized farms in the region because the company has a program to develop suppliers "they get a reliable marketplace and we get reliable suppliers " says a company representative wal marts requirement that suppliers must be part of the formal economy could partly explain why business startups jumped by last year the company says that cafta has been important also because the region is its largest supplier of apparel for its western hemisphere operations nicaragua also is enjoying cafta benefits total trade with the u s between last april when it joined cafta and december was up by more than over the same period in we agree with free traders who criticized cafta as inferior to unilateral market opening guatemala already had some of the lowest tariffs in the region but in order to reach consensus with protectionist strongholds such as costa rica it had to agree to tariff increases on some products cafta also unfortunately carves out protections for a small but important number of sectors sugar is one in the u s and in central america for a decade or more nicaragua one of the poorest countries in the region gets a quota for apparel made from fabric originating in non cafta countries this has diverted investment in the assembly business away from its neighbors yet in the absence of unilateral trade liberalization cafta may be the best alternative on its first anniversary el salvador guatemala nicaragua honduras and the u s are already reaping the benefits of cafta if costa rica and the dr which have already lost thousands of textile jobs reject the deal they will be approving a model of economic isolation that could cost their people dearly write to ogrady wsj
