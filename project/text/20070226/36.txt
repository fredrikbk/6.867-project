administration worried about rising shiite power has changed its approach to violent sunni groups who until recently made up some of its defining enemies al qaeda and saddam husseins supporters among them writes investigative reporter seymour hersh in iraq the u s has played down its fight against sunni groups aligned with saddam husseins regime and played up irans support to shiite insurgents mr hersh says this stance is meant to pressure the shiite controlled government in baghdad to distance itself from shiite controlled iran the u s also hopes the stance might force shiites to make harder compromises with the sunnis to avoid civil war the u s has also found common cause with violent sunni groups in its fight against shiite forces in lebanon and syria the lebanese government which the u s supports gives violent sunni groups in the north room to fight shiite radical group hezbollah and shiite controlled syria these sunni groups serve as a convenient buffer between two threatening shiite forces but they are also tied to al qaeda this means the u s has essentially adopted saudi arabias approach says mr hersh the sunni state has for decades funded radical sunni groups as a way to contain shiite power gambling these groups wont grow strong enough to act on their animosity toward the u s or saudi arabia mr hersh says this support for the sunnis has led to a split within the diplomatic and intelligence communities as to whether it gives the u s less room to deal with shiite leaders such as hezbollahs leader hassan nasrallah who may have become too strong a force in politics for the u s to ignore by increasingly allying itself with sunni forces mr hersh says the u s might be closing off important avenues for diplomacy the new yorker march workplace a tricky test could reveal job applicants work ethic there appears to be a test that accurately gauges how hard job candidates will work if they are hired the problem the test works only if the applicant thinks it serves no purpose yale law school prof ian ayres and yale school of management prof barry nalebuff writing in forbes suggest a way past that stumbling block the insight originates in when the bureau of labor statistics paid young people &# to take a range of tests one of which required a simple code to be deciphered the bls has since surveyed the test takers regularly going through the data carmit segal a postdoctoral fellow at harvard business school found a strong relationship between someones score in the coding test and his or her income over years later even taking into account differences in iq ms segal argues those who did well on the test were driven entirely by an innate conscientiousness because candidates had nothing to gain from doing well on it but if an employer told a candidate the tests purpose its predictive effect would vanish and if an employer said the test served no purpose and then used it to hire or dismiss the candidate that would be unethical and illegal prof ayres and prof nalebuff suggest a way out of this bind employers might say only half the answers in the coding test would be used without saying which reducing the incentive of less conscientious people to work hard the employer could in good faith ignore half of the questions while using the other half to tell who works hard when the stakes are low forbes march politics its fitting when candidates shift to match the party line when politicians switch positions in presidential primaries they arent necessarily pandering or being hypocritical rather writes fred barnes in the conservative weekly the switches show the party system working as it is meant to ensuring an election in which a pro life candidate stands for the pro life party and a pro choice candidate stands for the pro choice one over the past years most major presidential candidates in both parties have changed their positions on social issues to fit the party line and been rewarded for it having made the switch they have also generally stuck to those new positions on the side of the democrats a host of candidates who dropped their opposition to abortion in a primary never took it up again mr barnes writes mr barnes therefore urges social conservatives in the republican party to embrace the frontrunners in the republican primaries for altering their positions john mccain has said he favors overturning roe v wade the opposite of his position in former massachusetts governor mitt romney has only recently adopted socially conservative positions on abortion gay rights and embryonic stem
