incentives for utility stir debate dominion resources wins generous terms as virginia ends open power market virginias legislature formally pulled the plug on deregulation last week eight years after it restructured the states electricity market but the effort to undo the deregulation plan has sparked a dustup between regulators and dominion resources inc over a plan that critics say gives too much away to the states biggest utility virginias move is the latest among states that are retrenching from deregulation in the face of potentially soaring electricity bills setting new terms in a post deregulated era can have a major impact on power customers as well as on investors as proven by the political complications in a potential &# billion buyout of utility txu corp by private equity firms disclosed over the weekend the news virginia is likely to re regulate its power market amid fears of soaring electric bills the dispute critics say the new system would give too much to utility dominion resources which says financial guarantees are needed to draw investment the bottom line a new generation of regulatory agreements between states and utilities could have major effects on consumers and utility investors critics say virginias effort could set a precedent that allows for overly generous terms for utilities in other states had legislators not acted dominion would have been able to charge market prices for electricity after possibly causing rate shock the legislation phases in modest rate increases and ties some future charges to utilities underlying costs the virginia bill now goes to gov timothy kaine for his signature he has indicated general support for re regulation tossing aside the law that froze electric rates and let utilities off the hook for building power plants the legislation nevertheless is controversial because it is packed with incentives not typically offered to utilities and dominion has enjoyed a strong financial performance hullihen moore a former state utility regulator said the law is "grossly unfair to consumers" and "abandons basic concepts like just and reasonable that are fundamental to proper ratemaking " dominion executives say special incentives are needed to attract investors to build power facilities to meet growing demand previous investment by the industry didnt pay off they argue beginning in the s states moved to deregulate their retail electricity markets convinced consumers would be better off if they could pick their suppliers and if competing firms built power plants six states delayed or withdrew their plans after californias market meltdown in until recently dominion defended the virginia restructuring law even though little worked out as expected competition didnt develop and new plants didnt get built rate freezes originally set to expire this year were extended to to buy more time instead of waiting for to come "and then dealing with the political backlash" experienced elsewhere said timothy winter a utility analyst at a g edwards dominion abruptly rolled out its own legislative proposals in january to re regulate the electricity business the "hybrid" regulation proposed is similar to what once existed but has important differences the law returns dominion "to monopoly status but without the same degree of oversight of rates and service that existed in the past " said theodore morrison chairman of the virginia corporation commission the state utility regulator critics say the hybrid model especially benefits dominion which still controls three quarters of virginias electricity market dominion is a heavyweight in the state capital as the leading corporate campaign contributor from to dominion gave &# million to candidates and party committees according to virginia public access project a nonpartisan political research group in richmond the bill prohibits utilities from charging market prices for power from utility owned plants instead it gives them incentive pay for doing things that prior to deregulation were their basic duty for example utilities that build new power plants will get a guaranteed return on equity plus a boost for as long as years that could mean an initial return on equity of about above current yields on utility bonds of about a profit sharing arrangement also is being introduced that lets utilities keep of excess earnings or profits above a range set by state regulators in certain situations as well as other monies that would normally be returned to customers in the form of lower power bills or rebates in an interview chief financial officer tom chewning said richmond based dominion would like to build additional coal and nuclear power plants but wants more shareholder protections a plant building spree in the s went awry and a planned nuclear plant got canceled regulators let the company collect about &# million from ratepayers to cover the expense of a plant which was canceled and never built still dominion executives said they didnt get any return on the effort "we got a return of capital but not a return on it " mr chewning said the question of who will build plants worries legislators more than regulators virginia has enough power for now but if utilities arent coaxed back into the construction business consumers could be faced with higher prices if utilities came to rely on power purchased from the open market harvey morgan a republican member of the virginia house of delegates said dominion was given too much say in what went in the legislation unlike in other states where utilities divested their plants the states two biggest utilities dominion and american electric power co kept theirs mr morgan said that would have given legislators the ability to restore utilities to more traditional regulation at lower cost to consumers because the virginia state corporation commission still regulated the plants output dominion executives say that times have changed since the state dropped traditional regulation and that better terms are needed to get dominion to invest in the current market mr morrison the commission chairman said he and others urged the legislature to defer action but the legislature turned a deaf ear to the commission as it has done previously in the commission opposed deregulation because virginias rates already were low dominion favored deregulation and a law was passed
