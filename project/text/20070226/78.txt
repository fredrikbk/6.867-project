tech giants to unveil power usage plan amd ibm rivals to focus on efficiency of servers data centers the rising cost of energy to operate computer rooms is forcing high tech competitors to work together and maybe even agree on ways to measure the problem the green grid an tech industry group launched in april today is revealing its plans to address the increasing power consumption of server systems and the data centers that use them advanced micro devices inc which helped organize the effort initially enlisted computer makers hewlett packard co international business machines corp and sun microsystems inc dell inc the fourth big server maker soon joined the group now the green grid is disclosing that it has companies represented on its board with the additions of software giant microsoft corp as well as intel corp amds archrival in selling chips for servers and personal computers "at the end of the day we knew we couldnt solve the problem alone " said bruce shaw amds director of world wide enterprise and commercial marketing the problem of data center power has spurred several other industry collaborations as well as the attention of the white house in december andy karsner an assistant secretary of the department of energy led a silicon valley roundtable on the topic and this week is scheduled to meet with executives of amd and dell at their offices in the austin texas area global electricity consumption by servers and ancillary equipment doubled between and estimated jonathan koomey a staff scientist at lawrence berkeley national laboratory and consulting professor at stanford university in an amd funded study released this month the total annual electricity bill rose to &# billion during that period he found one of green grids primary goals is to come up with more accurate data to measure power efficiency in computer rooms the lack of standard measure of computing performance has posed a big obstacle in coming up with ways to improve the energy efficiency of computer equipment and consumption practices "its the most absurd thing " mr koomey said "once people agree on a way to measure performance things will change very quickly " more than a decade ago hardware makers stopped quoting a figure called mips millions of instructions per second in favor of an array of specialized benchmark tests that reflect how machines handle specific jobs as a result computer managers cant easily compare how much work is getting done in exchange for their rising utility bills an industry group called spec the standard performance evaluation corp is working on new performance tests to be used in combination with power consumption figures being developed by the environmental protection agency larry gray an intel executive involved in the spec effort noted that servers come in many sizes and combinations of memory and other accessories to handle different chores making it impossible to have just one server performance number but he expressed optimism that new benchmark measures will be delivered this year likely starting with figures for low end servers besides servers one focus for improving efficiency is the power supply itself including the devices that convert alternating current into the direct current used by most computing equipment many such devices convert less than of the voltage they receive into usable energy industry executives say an effort called plus managed by electric utilities and ecos consulting inc operates a certification program to encourage pc power supply makers to boost efficiency to or more and it is planning to shift its attention to server power supplies meanwhile a company called coldwatt inc today is announcing a line of server power supplies that it says generate less heat than other products on the market and can cut total server power consumption by the austin texas company says initial customers include server maker open source systems corp the green grid hopes to attract such technology suppliers as well as data center managers to become paid members companies on its board include computer maker rackable systems inc a maker of server cooling technology called spraycool inc and american power conversion corp which makes a variety of data center equipment
