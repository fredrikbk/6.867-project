shareholder scoreboard a special report performance of major u s companies compared with their peers in industry groups finding tomorrows winners today try firms with fresh perspectives companies that depart from the conventional wisdom in defining their markets may deliver strong returns heres something to consider when reading this section most of the five year winners for the shareholder scoreboard are hiding somewhere in this years listings the challenge is to identify where that value is lurking and unlock its potential in other words which sectors merit attention and how should investors select individual stocks within those industries in the long run the second question is likely to be more important than the first companies are more important than industry sectors while industries can be either hot or cold in the short term returns tend to even out over time its the variations caused by individual companies within these sectors that can yield astounding returns the first of the two accompanying charts see accompanying illustration wsj february shows that long term annual returns for most sectors tend to fall within a range of only about percentage points in most industries though the top performing company is not just or percentage points better than the worst performer it is or even points better but spotting patterns to help predict these variations between companies can be extremely difficult market leadership and competitive advantage are two familiar ideas scale is how big companies such as general electric co wal mart stores inc and exxon mobil corp sometimes achieve higher levels of operating performance than their smaller competitors but from an investor perspective bigger isnt always better the second chart in column shows a breakdown based on market capitalization of companies in the shareholder scoreboard and their average shareholder returns over the past five years the first quartile consists of the smallest of companies by market cap within each industry group while the fourth quartile comprises the biggest companies on average the largest companies have performed worse than their smaller counterparts over the past five years there are several possible reasons for this often big companies arent managed to their full potential also established market leaders often have such high shareholder expectations built into their stock prices that it is hard for them to outperform and for companies that are already as big as ge and wal mart maintaining a high rate of growth can be next to impossible if it makes sense to focus your search on companies that arent among the biggest in their industries what should you look for the key can be identifying strategic segments overlooked by larger corporations that smaller companies have moved into spotting these segments often means the difference between investing in a midsize company with a strong strategic market position that is likely to surprise wall street by achieving consistent strong performance and buying stock in a company of similar size but with weak market position that is likely to collapse under the pressure of larger competitors with lower costs and broader product offerings this years scoreboard provides a number of examples of companies that have delivered exceptional returns in part because of the way they have successfully defined their strategic segments in the late s industry consolidators were wall street darlings as their stocks soared it wasnt uncommon for them to issue releases announcing the simultaneous acquisition of a dozen companies when most consolidators failed to deliver promised benefits from increased scale they quickly fell out of favor with investors but pool corp a consolidator that targets the wholesale distribution of swimming pool supplies has thrived the company ranked among the top year performers in last years scoreboard and would have done so again this year with shareholder returns averaging a year over the past decade if not for a &# million share buyback that caused it to miss the scoreboards market cap cutoff pool has thrived because it has an excellent sense of who and where its market is the company realized that pool contractors were not well served by larger scale plumbing or generic building product distributors pool also recognized that its clients value local service and availability rather than pursuing random acquisitions anywhere in the country like so many consolidators pool strengthened its market position city by city over the past decade through organic growth focused acquisitions and effective integration of its service centers in the company had just eight service centers that number grew to in about in and today as pool grew its scale gave it added purchasing power but the real key to its success has been its strong market share in each of the local markets where it operates this dominance gives the company superior pricing power as it operates multiple branches within a given metropolitan area on the other hand it sometimes pays to recognize the need for a national strategy if youve ever played an instant lottery scratch ticket odds are it was from scientific games corp a company that has posted average shareholder returns of and over the past five and years respectively many companies recognized early on the potential from government sponsored gambling but scientific games was among the first to realize that this business was quite different from the majority of business services sold to governments and corporations which are usually awarded based on local relationships although lottery contracts are controlled state by state lottery officials operate in a virtual national network spending a lot of time understanding what works across states so unlike the pool supplies example this business is best thought of as a single national market scientific games centered its strategy on winning as many state contracts as possible by leveraging referrals and relationships between lottery officials in different states and in doing so positioned itself as the clear leader in instant lottery tickets building on this success the company expanded into online lottery systems the terminals and technology for states to manage lotto type games today of the states that currently sell instant lottery tickets are scientific games customers the company is now trying to replicate its success internationally where scratch tickets are not as prevalent as in the u s other companies have thrived by recognizing that products are sometimes best sold hand in hand apple inc s comeback and recent excellent stock performance average shareholder returns over the past five years is a familiar story due to the popularity of the ipod and itunes but lets examine the apple story through the lens of strategic market position apple wasnt the first company to introduce a digital music player to the market in fact the demand for ipods after the products initial launch in late was not overly impressive only about devices were sold in its first full year aside from its sleek design there wasnt much to differentiate the ipod from other music players like creative and rio which pioneered the market in the same way the launch of the itunes online store in april seemed at first blush to be a nonevent there were other services competing in the market for music downloads not to mention the vast illegal music sharing networks ubiquitous on college campuses across the country from the perspective of industry observers in ipod and itunes were both competing in a crowded segment for music players and downloads however no one company had a foot in both markets viewed in this light apple had a clear head start against all other competitors approximately million ipod sales and two billion itunes downloads later apple dominates this market because it was the first to recognize the consumer need for an all in one integrated music player download and music management system apple now controls about of the combined market for digital music players and legal music downloads as with pool and scientific games anytime one company has a share of a strategic segment the chances are that competitors will have a hard time catching up investors who recognized this opportunity in apple soon after the ipod was launched have been rewarded very nicely it has yet to be seen whether apples newly announced iphone will capitalize on a similar untapped consumer need for an integrated handheld media player and data voice communications device but if it does apple could once again find itself with a head start in a newly defined and rapidly growing market as an investor if you can form opinions about the boundaries of the strategic segments in the industries where you invest you can identify companies that have strong strategic market positions in segments with less intense competition these are companies that can be expected to outperform their peers when large established companies run into difficulties you can decide whether this is an operational problem or a more fundamental strategic problem an operational problem is when a company has strong strategic market positions but is prevented from achieving its full potential because of mistakes in how the business is operated when these mistakes are fixed it can lead to strong performance this has been the case with mcdonalds corp over the past five years the company was losing share to rivals with weaker strategic market positions until it decided to focus on improving existing restaurants through more menu choices and better service rather than continuing to build lots of new locations looking forward there are a number of market leading companies that are likely to have similar untapped potential for example despite dell inc s struggles in the consumer market i like the companys prospects because it has an exceptional position in business pcs and its consumer channel has substantial opportunities for operating improvements occasionally you can also spot companies that have found a new way to define their markets that is different from the conventional wisdom if they are targeting an untapped customer need that competitors cant easily serve then those are the companies best positioned to surprise wall street
