alaska politicians have publicly distanced themselves from veco and refused to take any donations from it the new governor republican sarah palin made a refusal to accept any veco donations part of her platform when she challenged former gov tony knowles a democrat who had made a similar pledge no veco executives have been charged in the probe fbi officials and mr allen declined requests for comment amy menard an anchorage attorney representing veco said "there is no question that veco and some veco executives have always from day one had an interest in politics but to suggest that there

accepted campaign contributions from mr allen and other veco executives faces up to years and fines of up to &# million he has pleaded not guilty it isnt clear whether his case was related to veco nor

legislators fbi agents were authorized to seize documents relating to veco mr allen and several other veco officials for years regulators paid relatively little attention to the industry here as the

candidates who promised to hold down taxes on the oil industry veco and some of its subsidiaries then set up a payroll deduction plan through which employees donated about &# to the candidates according to state documents two years later the alaska public offices commission fined veco &# saying the employee contributions werent properly disclosed the fine later was reduced to &# on appeal by veco the candidates mr allen recommended all went on to win and later helped vote down a proposal by democrats to increase taxes on the industry in mr allen spent so much time personally lobbying for legislation in juneau that state regulators ordered him to register as a professional lobbyist mr allen complained saying he considered contacts with legislators his right as a businessman soon afterward the legislature passed a law that critics dubbed "the bill allen bill " the law increased the time someone could spend pushing for legislation before being considered a lobbyist to hours each month from four hours effectively exempting mr allen from registering as a lobbyist in early then gov frank murkowski presented a proposal to give oil producers a tax break as an incentive to build a natural gas pipeline that would ship an estimated &# billion of natural gas from the states north slope field democrats argued that alaska would be giving away millions in potential revenue mr

business according to a justice department news release the consultant was working as a confidential informant for the fbi federal officials wont discuss the case nor say whether it ties into veco but mr allen and veco did lobby for a private prison in alaska in though much of vecos business is with the oil industry the company does other work including building prisons mike chenault a republican state legislator who co chairs the house finance committee said he has voted for oil industry bills backed by mr allen but not because he received money from him or anyone else he professed an
