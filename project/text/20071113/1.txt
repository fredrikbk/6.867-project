a cultural conversation with charles rosen a reputation in music built as much on writing as playing the musical america annual directory the classical music industrys bible and award giver has just named pianist charles rosen "instrumentalist of the year " at age mr rosen might well wonder why it took so long but the honor is unusual for another reason it is being given to a man who is universally recognized as one of our most esteemed writers on music and culture if asked hell tell you that his great ambition from the start had been simply to play the piano and recent concerts in new york and london of some of beethovens most difficult piano music drew reveries from the critics who called his interpretations "poetic " "masterly " and "a lava flow of invention " nevertheless his formidable reputation rests as much on a lifetime of scholarly musings artfully displayed in such books as "the romantic generation " "critical entertainments " "sonata forms " "romantic poets critics and other madmen " "arnold schoenberg " "piano notes " "romanticism and realism " and "the classical style" the last a recipient of the national book award in a show of typical rosenesque modesty mention of the award elicits the proviso that one of the jury members resigned in protest over the decision "ill tell you why i started writing " he confides when we get together at his apartment on the upper west side of manhattan where he has resided since childhood "it began with a recording i had made on the record jacket the record company printed an unfortunate quote about chopins nocturne in f sharp major which said the music staggers drunken with the odor of flowers and for this chopin nocturne in b major in which the contrapuntal work is extraordinary " he says with a chuckle rushing to the piano to demonstrate the complexity of the composition by spinning out musical lines like partners in a multitiered conversation "they quoted critic james huneker who called it faint with a rich sick odor i thought that was all too silly so i began writing my own liner notes then a publisher who was told they were good took me out to lunch and offered to publish anything i wanted to write so we signed a contract " mr rosens life story in his telling has been occasioned by other similar moments of serendipity his decision to pursue a ph d in french literature at princeton university is a prime example "i always wanted to be a pianist but i went to college because thats what a lot of my friends were doing after all i cant practice more than four hours a day anyway i didnt really care what i got a degree in i was too proud to get it in music because i knew more music than most of the graduate students by that time and i was a bit snotty in those days it turned out that the most intelligent man in school was the head of the romance languages department so i took a degree in french "then came a graduate fellowship " he reports matter of factly "i could live on that at princeton and since i had a piano i was also able to practice every day once i got my doctorate though they threw me out " though he may make light of it that rich background in language as well as in art and history frames the prose that has been critically hailed as in a recent review by the financial times for its "luxury of insight and cultural allusion " any serious conversation with mr rosen will find him running to the piano time and again to demonstrate a point and any of his essays will likely be peppered with references not only to musicians but also to poets painters and literary figures what other music expert writing about th century romanticism would reference literary critic friedrich schlegel who first defined the term in schlegels definition which includes an embrace of everything in life animated by humor a transcendence of easy categories and a sense of sailing on the wings of poetic reflection seems i suggest during our conversation to fit perfectly the output of that eminent classicist mozart "well then " he responds "you are in agreement with the greatest music critic who ever lived e t a hoffmann who called haydn and mozart romantics " that kind of intellectual arsenal puts any potential adversary on shaky ground indeed in person his weathered face piercing eyes and husky bearing seem to signal two things at once this is a man of experience and knowledge and it would be best not to challenge him frivolously consequently mr rosens minor dustups such as the one he had with pianist alfred brendel in the pages of the new york review of books can hold the same kind of guilty allure for observers as that experienced by drivers passing a pileup on the highway the argument with mr brendel involved a highly technical issue about beethovens intentions in the final fugue of his late sonata op "i can show you the music " he says as once again were off to the piano and he deconstructs and reasons through various interpretive possibilities with impeccable logic "i didnt want to argue " mr rosen explains "but i got annoyed because instead of saying there are different ways of looking at it he said mr rosen has misinterpreted " so the pianist responded with a scholarly analysis and capped it off with a quote from prousts grandmother "who said there were three things she knew how to receive guests how to play a beethoven sonata and how to cook a steak with potatoes the criteria were the same for each a certain sobriety modesty lack of ostentation " mr rosen plays down the incident but the judgment of most musicians was that as pianist andras schiff has put it he won with a knockout mr rosens sights are not always trained on the historical past however he is an avid champion of contemporary music especially that of elliott carter who will be celebrating his th birthday next year indeed he is participating in a carter festival in torino italy this coming january despite the risks involved i pose a challenge mozart wrote of composing music that would appeal both to sophisticated musicians and to ordinary concertgoers simultaneously arent contemporary composers like carter who produce incredibly thorny complicated works failing to live up to their responsibilities to general audiences a small smile forms as mr rosen listens to my question "you have to remember to whom mozart was writing " he responds "it was his father who was afraid that mozart would write avant garde music that no one would like but i understand what you are saying the whole of what we call modernism is unfortunately and i do say unfortunately the best of the art we have in the th century and its very difficult for the amateur to appreciate how many people actually read joyces ulysses let alone finnegans wake all the way through the reason i have written about mallarme is that everyone agrees that he is one of the two or three greatest poets of the th century yet his poetry is unintelligible to of most college students in france "the problem is that with painting if you dont like it you go on to the next painting with music you have to sit there for or minutes listening to something you dont understand and you resent it " however this situation has precedents he explains "there is a letter of by zelter who became mendelssohns teacher to goethe about a strange composer named beethoven people who heard his music for the first time wrote zelter were horrified then they heard it again and they became passionate advocates like advocates of greek love he compared liking beethoven to a sexual perversion but the point is that they changed their minds and they kept hearing it because the musicians kept playing it the same was true of mozarts music in paris " this would seem to offer a ray of hope for the lasting impact of modernist works "but i dont know what will happen in the future " he concludes "i never predict i take things as they come " mr isacoff is editor of piano today magazine and author of "temperament how music became a battleground for the great minds of western civilization "
