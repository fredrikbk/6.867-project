day sign up for the e mail here is the ascension of oil prices finally affecting demand enough to reduce global consumption the international energy agencys monthly update on oil markets reports some nascent but only nascent signs this could be happening and the public conception of oil may be as influential as cost while oil topped &# a barrel last week thanks to lower crude stocks supply worries and geopolitical tension there are "strong indications that high prices are depressing demand which together with signs of higher output from saudi arabia iraq and nigeria have capped further price gains " according to the iea the energy think tank for the worlds biggest economies by nearing the &# mark and approaching inflation adjusted highs of oil prices have stoked media attention increasing public awareness of the high costs the iea says at the same time "consumers feeling their pockets squeezed have even resorted to protests in some" countries of the organization of economic cooperation and development the ieas de facto parent with gasoline prices starting to catch up and expected to rise in the u s by an additional cents by next month as the wall street journal reports government officials have increasingly highlighted the need to conserve oil the iea notes and u s lawmakers who failed to pass an energy bill earlier this year when oil was about &# a barrel cheaper are again preparing to act the new york times adds oil prices were down about &# a barrel in european trading today at about &# a barrel in electronic trading on the new york mercantile exchange after saudi arabian oil minister ali naimi said opec wont discuss changes to output levels at the groups upcoming summit in riyadh but could consider the matter at a meeting next month it isnt the recent surge in prices that deserves so much notice the iea says but rather the cumulative rise of &# a barrel since that could change the dynamic while oecd countries stocks were down in september and the iea predicts strong growth in global demand for next year an agency breakdown in demand forecasts suggests something may be happening "the majority of our forecast growth is due to the assumption of a return to normal weather i e a rebound in heating fuel demand " it says "indeed transportation demand growth in the oecd is minimal reflecting the effect of high prices and stands in stark contrast to the steady growth seen in the past two years " still while the iea says higher prices have affected consumer behavior in oecd countries like the u s japan and those of western europe this change might not be permanent moreover "the mature economies are only supporting actors in our global demand growth projections " and it expects growth in consumption and price in china and other developing countries to continue "strong latent demand growth from developing countries is likely to meet supply side constraints over the medium term in other words there would have to be a particularly strong downturn in the economic cycle to overwhelm the ongoing upswing in the commodity cycle " ultimately the iea concludes "whether &# oil proves a turning point in consumer and government thinking towards energy efficiency is more significant than its direct impact on oil demand growth " thats where the story gets interesting because on top of the hit to consumers pocketbooks oil these days is yet again seen as the cause of disastrous environmental problems caused by tanker leaks in the black sea and san francisco bay and it is a rogue commodity in the increasingly voluble debates about climate

opposition leader and former prime minister called on gen musharraf to resign and ruled out any possibility of serving under him in a future government the latter position may seem obvious but it wasnt that long ago that ms bhutto cut a deal with gen musharraf that dropped corruption charges against her and allowed her return from exile with many observers and critics in her own party assuming they would work out a power sharing agreement ms bhutto also said her pakistan peoples party would probably boycott parliamentary elections gen musharraf has set for january and she returned to an
