writing the book on self help a publishers cautionary tale new albany ohio the self publishing business has come a long way in the internet era literary do it yourselfers now have many online resources to tap and even a growing number of role models best selling authors including e lynn harris "i say a little prayer" and the pseudonymous zane "addicted" have emerged from the self published ranks and then there is the cautionary tale of c ben bosah an environmental engineer who lives in this leafy village in central ohio mr bosah was convinced that a nonfiction book about womens health written by his wife was a sure fire hit so instead of sending "letters to my sisters plain truths and straightforward advice from a gynecologist" to a literary agent or to a new york publishing house he decided to publish it himself his view was why share the profits mr bosahs lack of familiarity with the publishing world didnt worry him but it should have despite his determination and hard work he made a succession of mistakes from failing to line up a distributor before publication to selecting a title for the book that limited the potential readership for mr bosah the problems began the moment the order landed on his doorstep after the truck dropped off his books mr bosah dented the front of his camry pushing the heavy pallets into his garage "we didnt have a motorized pallet jack " he says for aspiring self publishers the internet has made transforming grandmas recipes into a glossy paperback look deceptively easy there are scores of services online that writers can hire to edit market and print their books and many thousands of people use these services each year beyond that national book chains are often willing to put a couple of copies in an authors neighborhood store which can be another confidence booster but actually selling a decent number of books is another matter altogether as mr bosah and his wife ngozi osuagwu a gynecologist discovered today pallets of books clutter the three car garage at mr bosahs expansive modern home the boxes each holding books fill virtually an entire bay more than half of his original order remains unsold the year old mr bosah who was born and college educated in nigeria and arrived in the u s in says that editing publishing and shipping the book has consumed at least hours of his time "im a tough minded optimist " he says after arriving in the u s mr bosah drove a cab while earning a second college degree this one from the city college of new york since he has operated ben bosah &amp co an environmental management consulting firm which he says "gives me the resources to engage in my other endeavors " he is widely read citing books such as malcolm gladwells "the tipping point" in casual conversation his large home is filled with art and his family owns three vehicles including an acura mdx and a bmw i to launch their careers most fledgling authors these days turn to internet businesses that offer print on demand services the appeal is that authors only have to print the number of copies they actually need they can even order just a single copy rather than having to store cartons of unsold books such publishers include authorhouse a unit of bertram capital management llc amazon coms createspace and booksurge units and lulu com a unit of lulu enterprises inc mr bosah rejected this option because he wanted to offer the books more cheaply than this method would have allowed and because he thought the quality would be better if he hired a commercial manufacturer he saw a book designed by lesley ehlers and then located her on the web "i actually discouraged him from doing the book because i know the market and i know how hard it is but he really believed in it " says ms ehlers who primarily works with major publishing houses ms ehlers who designed the book dust jacket and created the illustrations suggested he use maple vail book manufacturing co in york pa a firm she had worked with but she says she suggested he limit his initial print run to copies "you could always reprint " she says a sales representative at maple vail urged a similar strategy but mr bosah placed an order for books he now says he knew this was a lot of books but printing that many allowed him to set a retail hardcover price of only &# just slightly more than the &# or so that bertelsmann ags random house inc and other top publishers charge for quality paperbacks "i like a discount and the fact that we made a quality hardcover book " he says the price might have been right but for shoppers the books were nowhere to be found because mr bosah didnt strike a deal with a distributor before publishing his wifes book in april most bookstores declined to stock copies instead he found himself selling the book to sororities at hair salons hospital gift shops churches and workshops even today he and his wife keep a box of books in the trunk of their cars for impromptu sales and promotions mr bosah also overlooked some other fundamentals of the publishing business he neglected for example to send galleys of the book several months before publication to the key magazines that do early reviews such as publishers weekly kirkus reviews and library journal that would have been another way to let retailers know the book was coming although mr bosah was able to land a feature in his hometown newspaper the columbus dispatch on oct there werent any copies for sale in the citys local bookstores when the paper hit the newsstands "only a miniscule percentage of people will buy a book without first thumbing through it " says mr bosah instead readers had to borrow the book from the local libraries in columbus even the title mr bosah picked for the book ultimately limited its appeal he now believes the word "sisters" was meant to convey the universality of the books subject material however many potential readers associated it solely with black women a more basic title "letters plain truths and straightforward advice from a gynecologist" might have attracted a larger audience he says it also didnt help that the book lacked blurbs from any well known people in the medical field "we tried to get some blurbs from famous people but it didnt work out " he says "im still trying to get some for my fliers " although the book is for sale on amazon coms web site it is available in only a handful of independent stores nationwide but mr bosah says things are starting to look up he finally found a distributor for the book which has gotten the title into stores owned by borders group inc he also says he has recouped the &# or so he has invested in the books production his wifes book was a finalist for a benjamin franklin award offered by the independent book publishers association and far from being chastened mr bosah is plowing ahead with other publishing projects hes about to begin marketing an audiobook edition of "letters to my sisters" a variety of women read the letters and next year he hopes to publish two new titles "im staying in this business " he says "i like being a publisher im in for the long haul "
