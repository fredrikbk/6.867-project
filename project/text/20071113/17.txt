blacks trail in growth of income study finds parents gains may not protect children as whites seem to benefit blacks born into the middle class in the late s are far more likely than whites to earn less than their parents a new study of economic mobility has found the study examined how children born in the late s fared in the late s and early s overall it found that two thirds of the adult children earned more adjusted for inflation than their parents did at the same age in the late s but when the study examined families by race and their rank by income they found stark differences between black and white families children of black parents earning in the middle of all families in the late s had a chance of earning less than their parents the study found for white children that chance was just "economic success in the parental generation does not appear to protect black children from future economic adversity the same way it protects white children " the studys author julia isaacs a scholar at the brookings institution writes in the report to be released today the study doesnt develop its own explanations for the disparity but ms isaacs says other research has raised several possibilities one is that black parents have less wealth in the form of homes or other assets than white parents of the same income which might affect the economic prospects of their children another is that marriage rates are lower for blacks than for whites so black children may be more likely to grow up to be single parents yet another theory is that in the s black women were more likely to work than white women and thus black incomes received less of a boost as womens overall participation in the labor force rose in subsequent years the report is part of a continuing examination of economic mobility conducted under the auspices of the pew charitable trusts with contributions from brookings the american enterprise institute the heritage foundation and the urban institute the study used data from the panel study of income dynamics run by academics with federal funding which has been following several thousand sets of parents and children since the s the studys sample comprised individuals between the ages of birth and in their median family income in was &# up after inflation adjustment from the median income of their parents generation its findings may both contradict and reinforce americans image of their society as highly mobile on the one hand it found that parents income ranking was a strong determinant of their childs for parents born into the bottom of children were also in the bottom four decades later for parents born into the top of their children were also there four decades later on the other hand that means the majority of children ended up in a different income quintile than their parents moreover the poorest children were the likeliest to do better than their parents of the children of parents in the bottom quintile earned more as adults than their parents did that was true of just of children of parents in the middle quintile and of children of parents in the top quintile ms isaacs says it is easier to move up from the bottom than the top but ms isaacs says the experience is quite different depending on race for white families of children born to parents in the bottom earned more by adulthood for black families it was in the middle quintile commonly referred to as the middle class of white children grew up to earn more than their parents but just of black children did "black children and white children do not have equal chances of moving up the income ladder " ms isaacs writes
