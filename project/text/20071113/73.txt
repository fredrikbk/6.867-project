in china stock boom saps the system brokerage infrastructure is strained by demand glitches prevent trades wuhan china inside a crowded brokerage in this central chinese city zhang wanlong was getting anxious as chinas stock market ticked to a new high recently the problem he couldnt find an unoccupied trading terminal to buy shares mr zhangs difficulty in placing an order illustrates how the demand to invest in chinas stock markets has pushed the countrys financial system infrastructure relatively advanced though it is to the limit for much of this year chinas financial industry has struggled to process an inflow of money from as many as new trading accounts a day a surge in demand that broke local trading records and made the shanghai and shenzhen stock exchanges among the worlds busiest when the number of brokerage and mutual fund accounts soared to more than million in recent months regulators warned industry officials to beef up their trading systems in one sign of the risks a scramble to buy mutual funds crippled computers nationwide at the countrys biggest bank in august even as markets rose "the task of further promoting the markets operating security and efficiency remains arduous " shang fulin chairman of china securities regulatory commission which oversees stock markets warned when markets were at their most active in august in recent days the benchmark shanghai composite index has pulled back from last months record including a drop yesterday but unlike the aggressive buying that propelled stocks to successive records on heavy volume and strained computer systems the recent swoon has occurred amid some of the lowest trading volumes of the year this suggests most investors see the slide as a hiccup they can afford to ignore rather than a reversal of the markets upward trend if sentiment deteriorates and investors have a sudden urge to cash out some may find the exits blocked which could spark panic chinas exchanges have spent heavily in upgrading their trading systems but the weak spot appears to be individual brokerage firms specifically their often far flung offices the difference between the capacity of the two exchanges and chinas brokerages is important since most activity in china is from individuals rather than institutions and since chinese investors are responsible for executing their own trades rather than leaving orders with a broker physical access to a trading device can mean elbowing through a crowded facility much of the problem lies in the sheer difficulties of handling demand from so many bottlenecks are common in the worlds most populous nation whether people are logging on to the internet or hopping on the bus for stock market investors a worrying parallel of what could happen if too many people try to do the same thing at once played out last month when tickets for next years olympics went on sale computer systems crashed under a deluge of orders in the first hour organizers managed to sell tickets before the system collapsed only of the million tickets up for grabs on the internet telephone hot lines and at bank of china outlets when sales resume next month a lottery system will be used in the stock market and banking system there are signs that already crowded locations could quickly get out of control if there is a rush to sell because a special bank account is needed to trade stocks or buy funds banks have been flooded with customers too this year the countrys largest financial institution industrial &amp commercial bank of china ltd has pledged to cut by half to minutes the average waiting time to see a teller the crush has produced more than long lines on aug icbc blamed a crash of its computer systems on unexpectedly high demand for two new mutual funds a glitch that closed basic services at many of its branches for hours until the sudden rise in stock prices and trading levels over the past year chinas brokerage houses had been struggling in the half decade that preceded the current rally weakening stock prices and falling volumes drove many of chinas or so brokerages to the brink of bankruptcy and left some without enough capital to upgrade computers to process orders in many ways chinas year old markets are quite advanced and continue to modernize the shanghai stock exchange chinas busiest has spent tens of millions of dollars making its own computer trading systems among the worlds fastest for three months this year it traded more shares than any other market according to the world federation of exchanges a regulatory commission spokesman said this years record volumes show chinas market infrastructure is strong he said in addition to brokerage halls individual investors have the option to trade online or by cellphone elsewhere computer systems have been the achilles heel of volatile markets in the february nasdaq meltdown investors around the u s were hamstrung by jammed brokerage telephone lines and internet trading sites in late and early trading weighed so heavily on the tokyo stock exchange that it shortened sessions for three months and undertook expensive emergency repairs and last week trading was temporarily stopped on the london stock exchange after a technical snag caused the price reporting system to go awry in january as new investors were flooding into chinas markets the shanghai exchange warned that brokerages are a weak link that risked destabilizing the market the exchanges chief technology officer bai shuo said steps were taken to encourage brokerages to strengthen their systems even so the shanghai exchange runs parallel trading platforms one for brokerages that use modern equipment that is compatible with the powerful new exchange systems the other for firms using outmoded technology an indication of how out of date some brokerage systems are with the stock market vaulting to another record recently mr zhang was determined to capitalize minutes before the closing bell he was zigzagging through a cloud of cigarette smoke searching for a terminal after jostling with other investors the year old craftsman located an unoccupied machine in a back corner then a software glitch booted him off says mr zhang "sometimes you know when one stock is going to rise or fall but you just cant get it "
