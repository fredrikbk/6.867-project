global economy governments are urged to make lenders bear some risk on securitized loans london governments should consider requiring financial houses that make loans and then sell them off as securities to retain some of the risk on their books to prevent a repeat of the current problems sparked by mortgage backed securities a group of prominent economists and current and former policy makers said the retained debt should be "enough to make it hurt if their product turns out to be of a much lower value than the initial assessment suggests " said richard portes president of the centre for economic policy research think tank and one of the authors of a report on international financial stability released yesterday such a policy would give institutions an incentive to monitor the quality of assets underlying securitized loans the advice follows the financial market turmoil that began this summer as rising credit risk set off a market scramble to determine just who was exposed to soured mortgage related loans the trouble has stemmed from growing defaults on mostly low quality or subprime u s mortgage loans that were packaged into securities and sold to financial institutions world wide the subprime woes hit as debt securities were becoming hard to value amid uncertainty about which bundles of mortgage linked bonds included bad debt banks hoarded their funds to avoid potential losses triggering a liquidity crisis the new report published by the cepr and the geneva based international center for monetary and banking studies was co written by roger ferguson a former vice chairman of the federal reserve and now an executive at swiss re philipp hartmann head of financial research at the european central bank and fabio panetta a top staffer at the bank of italy "the regulators as a class missed the accumulation of these highly complex financial instruments that were probably mispriced " mr portes said at a news conference "at the same time one could say that all the fuss about the hedge funds meant that hedge funds were actually ok " he added the think tanks recommendation coincides with growing calls from european policy makers to use the credit crunch that swept over from the u s as a catalyst for speedier and broader overhauls of their market structures gertrude tumpel gugerell board member at the european central bank said at a conference in frankfurt that standards for providers of clearing and settlement services in the over the counter derivatives markets could be improved she said european central banks should allow commercial banks to use a wide range of collateral on a cross border basis against their money market operations to create the maximum amount of market liquidity the availability of eligible collateral "becomes the ultimate liquidity issue for banks " and its absence can have serious consequences she said in a separate report the international monetary fund called for a catalog of overhauls to the european banking system to add transparency and guard against future credit shocks "the effectiveness of crisis management by the regulators and central banks may need to be reviewed in particular in dealing with individual problem institutions and systemwide liquidity strains " it said the originate to distribute model of banking activity was "a perfectly reasonable model" and the market for such products ought to reopen in time ceprs mr portes said the distribution of risk to those willing to bear it was on the whole a good thing but it needed to be done properly he added the think tanks report a summary of a conference held earlier this year recommended that financial transactions that dont definitively transfer risk for example in the case of off balance sheet entities shouldnt be treated as if they do and that regulators should maintain a clearer picture of that situation "the recent experience with assets and liabilities of off balance sheet entities structured investment vehicles and conduits returning to bank balance sheets by virtue of liquidity backstops and other contingent commitments exemplifies this problem and represents a significant liability that was not fully disclosed and understood " the report said while the global financial system is showing "signs of stress" and risks remain including global imbalances the carry trade and the rise in household indebtedness mr portes said that in many ways markets are better regulated and more stable now than years ago "this is financial turmoil but not a systemic financial crisis there has been no failure of a large complex financial institution nor a widespread decline of asset prices " he added the think tanks said that industry bodies and authorities should promote the standardization of originate to distribute products such as collateralized debt obligations and accurate pricing by discouraging exclusive reliance on rating agencies and encouraging the involvement of accounting firms in checking valuations when working with firms on financial statements "market driven but regulatory and supervisory authority guided approaches are necessary for successful financial risk management " the report said "as new instruments are designed regulation must keep pace to ensure that markets remain under control " it said "this regulation must be governed by principles and focused on maintaining levels of capital commensurate with the risks undertaken it shouldnt be based on a rigid set of rules that would stifle innovation " among the imfs recommendations european governments should speed the public sectors withdrawal from bank ownership introducing greater market scrutiny and disclosure requirements restrictions on bank consolidation should be loosened to create greater economies of scale and improve the competitiveness of the broader banking sector state run preferential deposit schemes should be abolished and ceilings on interest rates and fees charged on financial services should be made more flexible creating a wider range of investment vehicles european financial integration should be accelerated by harmonizing regulatory and tax regimes standardizing clearing and settlements systems and relaxing government restrictions on cross border mergers the rules governing new financial instruments such as collateralized debt obligations and asset back securities should be modified these bundled credit derivatives draw from various debt sources not all of them subprime nina koeppen in frankfurt contributed to this article
