amgen spends big protesting curbs on anemia drug nearly a million cancer and dialysis patients turn to amgen inc for essential medicines every year now amgen is turning to its patients for some medicine of its own amgen is pouring millions of dollars into a lobbying campaign to get congress to change a medicare rule that dealt a big blow to the companys lucrative anemia drugs amgens argument federal guidelines limiting payments for anemia fighting drugs could hurt cancer patients its rare for a company to focus an entire lobbying campaign on a single regulatory rule and this one would appear to be a long shot congress has repealed only one of such rules in the past decade according to a congressional research service report the push underscores amgens dependence on epogen and aranesp which together accounted for of its revenue last year and the fact that the federal government pays for the biggest share of epogen since the summer the company has run an internet centered campaign protect cancer patients that tries to capture the feel of a grass roots effort by encouraging cancer patients survivors and family members to send in their stories and to upload video and audio testimonials the web site also encourages individuals to phone members of congress "we were very interested in making sure that the medicare beneficiaries had a vehicle to make their voices heard " says josh ofman amgens vice president of global reimbursement and payment policy the company says it has already generated hundreds of emails and phone calls to lawmakers but on friday amgen said it had suspended the site as part of a re evaluation of its online campaign the company said the decision was unrelated to a report in the cancer letter an influential newsletter suggesting that testimonials on the site advocating off label uses of the drug could violate food and drug administration marketing rules last week johnson &amp johnson launched a similar effort for its anemia fighting drug procrit with a web site www voiceforcancerpatients com that allows individuals to send emails to the center for medicare and medicaid services and contact their representatives in washington the site doesnt include patient testimonials the lobbying is showing some results majorities in both the house and senate signed letters to the medicare center warning against the new rule earlier this year and legislation to reverse the decision has been introduced in both chambers but prospects for passage are unclear because of new budget rules that would require congress to offset the increased cost of paying for more of the drug even if the resolution fails lobbyists could push for language in the annual appropriations bill that would delay the new rules for one year anemia fighting drugs treat nearly a million cancer and dialysis patients annually and sales totaled &# billion last year making them the biotech industrys most lucrative medications cancer patients often become anemic during treatment and the drugs are designed to prevent the need for blood transfusions which can be uncomfortable at best and risky at worst last week the fda ordered that the drugs carry a new "black box" label the agencys strictest warning against the increased risk of death and accelerated tumor growth that could result from higher doses of the drug the fda approved a less serious warning in march urging doctors to use the lowest dose possible and warning against raising levels of hemoglobin a measure of red blood cells above grams per deciliter of blood several medical journal studies had previously warned that overuse of the drug increased risk of hypertension blood clots and accelerated tumor growth medicare officials issued rules this past summer that would reduce the dosages of the drugs that the government covers for medicare patients it wont pay to start cancer patients on the drugs unless their hemoglobin has fallen below grams per deciliter though dialysis and other noncancer patients arent affected sales of epogen and aranesp declined last quarter by and respectively helping to drive down amgens earnings by amgen and johnson &amp johnson appealed the medicare payment rules last week seizing on the fdas new ruling which they say gives doctors greater latitude in determining the proper drug dose amgen has also argued that the payment regimen would create a "two tiered" health care system one for privately insured individuals and one for medicare beneficiaries but the fda defended the decision as consistent with medicares payment decision amgens fight on this front is only the latest evidence of its increasing presence in washington the company doubled its lobbyist spending to &# million last year and has already spent &# million in the first half of pushing amgen ahead of pfizer inc among pharmaceutical companies this year according to the center for responsive politics the thousand oaks calif biologic drug maker has a dozen in house lobbyists and retains more than external lobbyists including former aides to democratic house speaker nancy pelosi of california and former republican senate majority leader bill frist in addition to reimbursement policies amgen has boosted lobbying on patent legislation and attempts to introduce generic biologic drugs "lobbying is becoming a better investment than researching new drugs " says william vaughan a senior analyst at consumers union which has encouraged congress to support the federal rule change amgen says its lobbying spending is no different from other drug makers "we operate in a very highly regulated industry and with that recognition we have established a presence in washington d c " says amgens dr ofman indirect grass roots campaigns have become a popular tactic among lobbyists because they focus the issue away from a powerful entity and toward ordinary people who would ostensibly suffer if the government fails to respond in this case the front group is especially sympathetic "how many people dont have a relative whos a cancer patient " says melanie sloan executive director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington a lobbyist watchdog group "the public is much more likely to support legislation that benefits cancer patients than a company like amgen " cancer doctors who benefit from medicares unusually high reimbursement rate for anemia drugs are also in amgens corner the influential american society of clinical oncology and the american society of hematology have called on the government to review its decision and last month released their own guidelines for members that reflect the fdas new warning samuel silver a physician who heads the subcommittee on reimbursement for the american society of hematology says the governments revised payment policy sets a threshold for treatment that would force doctors "to draw blood on cancer patients up to times a month just to see if were eligible for reimbursement " because the drugs are medicares greatest medication expense the government estimates that limiting their use would save &# billion over the next five years that has led a handful of independent patient advocacy organizations to characterize the guidelines in a letter sent last month to members of congress as "high risk cost cutting tourniquets" that ask patients "to pay for medicare budget cuts with their life blood " government officials reject those charges "we have been exceedingly careful to not even get into the discussion of cost we made this decision specifically because of the fda black box warning " says barry m straube chief medical officer for the center for medicare and medicaid services and not all patient groups are on amgens side "i am astounded that this has been reduced to we want to protect patients " says frances m visco president of the national breast cancer coalition and a year cancer survivor ms visco says the campaign has confused cancer patients who "feel used by this " and she has urged congress to reject what she calls amgens "abusive" efforts "amgen is primarily interested in protecting amgen " she says rep pete stark a california democrat who is a leading amgen critic warns that the integrity of medicare rules decisions are at stake if congress overturns the new guidelines the effect would be to tell "industry they can spend millions of dollars and hire lobbyists all over town to push congress to overrule sound science "
