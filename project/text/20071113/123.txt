the middle seat flying the ultra no frills airline skybus passengers pay to check bags some seats for &# passengers departing on skybus airlines from columbus ohio walk out of a brand new terminal and traipse across the tarmac to board their planes in some cities travelers fetch their own luggage off luggage carts the airline has no telephone number that customers can call with fares starting at &# one way do you expect more skybus airlines inc now six months old brings a new level of bare bones service and very affordable prices to the u s skies the carrier also raises the question of just how cheap u s travelers will go to travel so far many seem to be willing to go very cheap at a time when bus companies and amtrak struggle to attract customers and many travelers still gripe about the loss of in flight meals and the addition of so many airline fees skybus filled more than of its seats all summer "its great for families " said carolyn lindell on her fourth skybus trip in just a few months mrs lindell and her husband mike flew to fort lauderdale fla for a total of &# round trip for a weekend in key west last month he had a business trip and it was cheap enough on skybus to take along his wife and make a weekend out of it and instead of long car rides the columbus couple has taken the kids to see relatives in richmond va several times on skybus sometimes on &# one way tickets &# after taxes "you dont care about a lot of things if the fare is &# " she said to strip as many costs out as it can skybus mimics many of the cheapskate travel tactics that ryanair holdings plc pioneered in europe dublin based ryanair is famous for its frugality down to ordering planes without window shades to save money and charging customers to check in at the airport online check in is free complaints are often numerous and yet ryanair has grown rapidly doubling its passenger count in the past four years to about million people this year like ryanair which sometimes gives away tickets customers pay the taxes and fees skybus offers eye catching promotions every skybus flight has seats for sale for &# each and captains often ask customers to raise their hands if they got the &# seats to show other customers the promotion is real the carriers average one way ticket is less than &# skybus chief executive bill diffenderffer a former continental airlines inc executive says demand for air travel jumps sharply if ticket prices are under &# one way and it increases sharply again if prices are under &# the key to offering the cheap prices is low costs so skybus tried to rethink airline operations and customer service to be as spartan as possible the carrier doesnt book connecting flights it doesnt even put pockets in the seatbacks of its seats it takes too long to clean them "there are hidden costs throughout an airline take out one and its not that big take out all then youre looking at a big difference in terms of pricing tickets " he said once hooked on cheap fares skybus travelers do often end up paying more if they want priority boarding its &# per flight check a bag that costs &# for each of the first two bags under pounds then &# for the third bag about of passengers end up paying to check bags and like ryanair skybus looks at passengers as captive shoppers sitting on credit cards willing to buy because they are on vacation or dont have time to go to the mall skybus flight attendants often hired from retail stores and restaurants for their sales skills hawk everything from coffee and pillows to perfume watches and jewelry travelers arent allowed to carry food on board that might hurt sandwich sales employees announce the policy but dont check bags for edible contraband passengers receive a glossy catalog of items for sale and flight attendants who get a commission push a cart down the aisle at least twice during a flight along with &# cinnamon rolls and &# grilled caesar lunches skybus offers items such as &# cubic zirconium tennis bracelets &# bottles of vera wang princess perfume and &# tommy hilfiger mens watches the catalog says the watch sells for &# in stores and indeed an internet search finds it priced at &# or higher and skybus collects no sales tax in the air a point flight attendants push hard along with sales tactics like "we only have two of these on board and ive already sold the first in the back " "i was not a believer in the beginning i didnt think people would buy but they do " said skybus chief financial officer michael hodge skybus started with strong financial backing &# million including &# million in state and local support in ohio columbus business leaders backed the start up because they wanted better air service america west airlines closed its columbus hub in but the new airline has a long way to go to prove it can be profitable at these prices and service levels and it has plenty of skeptics aviation consultant michael boyd says several low cost airlines are making inroads by offering better service than competitors not lower quality "skybus eliminating frills is going the wrong way and is a recipe for failure this aint europe " he said mr diffenderffer thinks many in the airline industry dont understand skybuss model the carrier has airbus a jets on order and nine more lined up to lease while that would seem like overload for a city the size of columbus he plans to copy ryanairs model of basing a dozen or so jets in various cities around the country just as ryanair does all over europe skybus recently announced that greensboro n c will be its next base hoping to draw customers from as far as raleigh durham and charlotte skybus believes u s consumers are willing to drive a long way to distant airports just to get cheap fares as far as miles to save &# mr diffenderffer figures to keep costs low skybus flies to remote fields like stewart airport in newburgh n y about miles north of manhattan and pease international airport in portsmouth n h an hour from boston in florida it has shunned several traditional airports and opted for fields not served by any airline like st augustine south of jacksonville and punta gorda near fort myers st augustine for example paved over a grassy area and erected a small terminal for skybus with a self service baggage area under a tent mr diffenderffer says it costs skybus about &# a passenger to use st augustine compared with about &# a passenger at jacksonvilles airport another advantage rental car firms are growing rapidly since theres not much other transportation at the airport and skybus gets a cut of what its passengers spend on rentals "we get a little bite of that apple too " mr diffenderffer said
