global economy chinas big trade surplus to loom large at summits beijing chinas latest record monthly trade surplus probably ensures continued debate over trade and currency policies at economic summits with its two biggest trading partners the u s and europe the record came despite slowing growth in exports and an unexpected pickup in imports from a year earlier merchandise exports from china rose to &# billion in october the general administration of customs said it was the third straight month that growth has been slower than the first halfs pace economists attributed the slowdown to the cumulative impact of currency appreciation the yuan has risen more than against the u s dollar this year and chinese tax changes that have disadvantaged exports in industries such as paper and metal processing "the effect of the nations macro control measures in the area of foreign trade has become more apparent " customs wrote in a release chinas imports of goods in october were up from a year earlier to &# billion a bigger jump than septembers in part because high global commodities prices boosted the bill for imported raw materials that left a surplus for the month of &# billion smaller than many economists had expected but still a record beating the previous monthly high of &# billion set in june political pressure on china to address its huge trade surplus has been rising steadily this year and is likely to figure prominently at beijings meetings with european leaders this month and with u s trade and economic officials in early december most of chinas trade surplus is with the u s and the european union in october it ran surpluses with the two trading partners of &# billion and &# billion respectively the rise in the yuan against the dollar tends to make chinese goods more expensive for u s consumers while making it cheaper for china to buy goods priced in dollars that should be helping reduce chinas surplus but because the dollar has also been falling against currencies such as the euro and the british pound and often more quickly than against the yuan chinas exports to other markets arent feeling the same pressure european officials have complained that chinas policy is keeping the yuans value artificially low against the euro europe became chinas biggest export market this year and chinese exporters have been gaining in emerging nations in asia africa and the middle east that has helped keep chinas exports expanding quickly also many of chinas export products are assembled from imported parts and components that means any falloff in export orders is usually accompanied by a drop in demand for imports that is one reason why economists expect china to continue to run a large trade surplus even if global demand for its products slows chinese officials expect the trade surplus for all of to be about &# billion around larger than the &# billion recorded in the large surplus has other economic consequences for china including the influx of huge quantities of money into the banking system which is a concern for regulators charged with ensuring credit growth doesnt get out of hand separate figures issued yesterday show that commercial banks extended new local currency loans of billion yuan &# billion last month that is more than usual for october which usually is a slow month for business in china for the first months of the year total new bank lending is up compared with the first months of partly to address concerns about lending growth the central bank raised the proportion of deposits banks must keep on reserve to from on saturday reducing the amount available to lend out
