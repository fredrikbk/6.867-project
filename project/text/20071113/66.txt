hot properties geothermal projects to tap underground steam send scrubland values soaring in mid august the bureau of land management held an auction for some of the most worthless looking land in the u s parched stretches of nevada where tumbleweeds are the tallest plants and rugged acreage in california suitable for goat herding yet in two hours the auction raked in &# million often attracting &# an acre and in one case &# an acre for tracts that might have once fetched only a few dollars an acre the frenzied bidding reflected the fact that the blm wasnt selling the land itself but was offering leases for what lies beneath heat a rush to lock up these rights is evidence of exploding interest in geothermal energy one of the greenest of green power sources the little utilized energy source involves drilling holes with rigs like those used by the oil and gas industry and drawing water and steam from deep within the earth the heat from the hot fluids or steam is used for power generation or heating purposes cooled fluids are piped back to injection wells where theyre returned to the earth for another round of heat extraction this type of power generation has been around a long time prince piero ginori conti put the first geothermal plant into operation in northern italy in while it gains momentum during periods when conventional fuels are costly interest typically fades when prices retreat now rising costs for conventional power plants and pressure to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions have once again stoked the appetite for geothermal projects in the u s twenty five states have ordered utilities within their boundaries to add more renewable energy to their portfolios and this demand backed by a federal tax credit has spawned plans for projects most in western states that could double the installed geothermal capacity in the u s in coming years that explains the land rush mentality that has developed among power generators in addition to the august auction the blm collected &# million for geothermal leases in idaho and utah earlier this year if most current projects pan out geothermal electricity production could double to of power generation in california and perhaps in nevada like solar panels and wind turbines geothermal plants harness a natural energy source to obtain heat as an alternative to making heat by burning fossil fuels it has been developed in many nations especially those lying within the "ring of fire" of active volcanoes that circles the pacific ocean where hot rock is close to the surface people once looked for surface manifestations like steam vents and geysers but now use geologic heat flow maps since there are many good areas with no tell tale signs the best natural resource in the u s is in the west for example where tectonic plates rub but there are promising pockets in the east where heat is found at drillable depths heat fields can be productive for decades if properly managed typically the best sites for geothermal energy are where hot rocks are relatively close to the surface and laced with cracks through which water can flow calpine corp san jose calif the nations largest producer of geothermal power has seen the value of its holdings nearly triple since by some estimates at "the geysers" in northern california a site that has proved to be the most fertile steam source in the continental u s other companies are speculating on projects that could target specific needs like a pair of nevada real estate developers who want to generate geothermal energy to warm warehouses and housing developments they are planning in the nevada desert by some estimates the u s has the worlds greatest geothermal potential a recent study by the massachusetts institute of technology concluded that as much as megawatts of power generation equivalent to the entire u s nuclear fleet could be culled from geothermal resources by of course even if all the currently planned projects get built geothermal would amount to only about of total power generation in the u s versus in and it remains a tricky resource since geothermal plants are small it takes lots of them to make a dent in energy demand it also requires expensive drilling expertise in geology and hydrology and specialized equipment maintaining wells is expensive and steam cant be transported long distances because the heat dissipates still the environmental impact is modest compared with other forms of power generation and geothermal plants produce steady electricity part of the increased interest in geothermal energy is being spurred by an agency that formerly was seen as an impediment the blm is in a pivotal position because the federal government is the biggest landowner in the west in the past it mostly leased land for nominal sums to those that sought leases and collected royalty payments following development but under the energy policy act of the blm must conduct regular auctions the u s geological survey is doing a resource assessment the first since due out next year congress is mulling legislation that would encourage more geothermal research and energy production encouraged by new processes that allow lower temperature resources to be developed profitably "its a real shake up and its bringing lots of new people into the industry " says karl gawell executive director of the geothermal energy association in washington he says his trade group held an investor conference in may that was so well attended "we had to move the meeting room to larger spaces three times " the biggest buyer at the reno auction was ormat technologies inc founded years ago by a husband and wife team dita and lucien bronicki which has built enough capacity in nevada to meet the needs of reno homes ormat which already had leased acres in the u s added an additional acres at the most recent reno auction spending about &# million industry growth is "the most aggressive weve seen in years " says louis capuano jr chief executive of thermasource llc a santa rosa calif geothermal services firm thats drilling wells in california and nevada hes negotiating to buy his sixth drilling rig the bottle rock plant that was built by the state of california in gives a sense of the ups and downs of geothermal development toward the end of the last boom although the department of water resources built the plant it relied on private companies for steam at first the plant ran like gangbusters but by it no longer could get enough steam and it was mothballed thermasources mr capuano says the state approached him in to see what hed charge to tear it down mr capuano says "i would have cried to destroy it " instead he and some partners bought it for &# million and later sold a majority stake to u s renewables group llc a firm backed by private equity interests carlyle group and riverstone holdings llc in march the plant started up again though without as much steam as needed so when the blm announced that one of the parcels it intended to auction in august was a acre tract nearby u s renewables jumped on the auction day u s renewables slugged it out with calpine there was a collective gasp when the price shot past &# an acre and stunned silence when bidding crested at &# an acre a blm record "sure i paid more than &# million for it but i can be generating power from new wells there within two years " said thomas p king a partner in u s renewables group "what were after is sustainability for bottle rock expanding the lease is incredibly valuable to us " some geothermal veterans think the blm must move faster ron barr president of earth power resources a geothermal development firm in tulsa okla says at the reno auction "i didnt know whether to bid or picket "
