abts rewards this season were in the past new york american ballet theatres recent season at city center started out rewardingly with two invaluable revivals of dances from the s first came george balanchines glorious "ballo della regina " set to the ballet music from verdis "don carlos " the showcase with a commanding ballerina as its queen and an impetuously ardent male dancer as her attendant partner takes its audiences into a light splashed grotto this world suggested simply by the play of streaked light on a pale blue background is all aquamarine in color sea breeze fresh in tone and inhabited by dancing women as shimmering as water nymphs by contrast "the leaves are fading " antony tudors meditation on verdant love and longing as inspired by antonin dvorak string compositions presents its dancers as lovers blissfully secluded within ming cho lees misty and sweeping surround of light dappled foliage ballet schoolings keen geometrics and athletic energies underpin the dancers activity presenting them as individual personalities most pointedly when they are joined in variously enraptured duets soon after these revivals however the wonders big and small bright and resonant as revealed by these decades old works were all but obliterated by the seasons world premieres in the wake of the two artful older creations benjamin millepieds "from here on out" and especially jorma elos "c to c " subtitled "close to chuck " made it seem as if ballets inherent longstanding and rigorous virtues remained lost in some cave or within some deep forest mr millepieds effort set to nico mulhys moody fully orchestrated score based on the "passacaglia " a stately baroque era musical form rooted in court dance from spain or italy is a mostly monotonous unisex affair the eccentrically but not interestingly cut unitard costumes in wine and plum hues are by mr millepied himself "from here on out" starts intriguingly with a silhouetted cluster of the six men and six women in the cast slowing stirring into animation the grouping seems worthy of jerome robbins the masterly choreographer for whom mr millepied danced during the late s from here on out however the theatricality of the memorable image fails to evolve into anything significant while at new york city ballet where mr millepied still dances and where he worked with the aging robbins the young choreographer has also performed in the works of nycbs director peter martins and unfortunately it is the pernicious influence of the hollow mr martins that seems to guide the textureless activity of mr millepieds ballet little of the manipulation and coupling hes arranged for his female dancers and their male counterparts yields much more than busy squirming around mr millepieds overall structuring of his ballet starting with his notable initial image reveals a certain originality as do his transitions from group to duet and back again but the meat of his choreographic excursions amounts to dross as theater mr elos philip glass inspired homage to the contemporary painter chuck close known for his large scale portraits is typical of the finnish choreographers foolish movement doodles the most distinguished aspect of "c to c " is the striking costuming by fashion designer ralph rucci especially when mr ruccis beautiful black creations present the ballets cast of three women and three men in similarly cut stiffly shaped floor length skirts the costumes artfully abet mr elos now familiar neglect of ballets traditional stress on the work of the legs and feet even providing a kind of dramatic logic for it by the end of "c to c " the skirts are eventually removed with mr closes modular extreme close up self portraiture looming in the background the dancers are reduced to virtual afterthoughts the vividly colored backdrop looks something like a wall of glowing charcoal briquettes while the pale dwarfed dancers in their intensely black outfits fidget and pass aimlessly in the foreground the result suggests so many charred cinders vanishing in thin air once the runs second week kicked into gear abt presented a detail filled revival of further choreographic riches from the s twyla tharps creamy "bakers dozen" to the jazz of willie "the lion" smith here abts cast of ballet dancers mined the witty and satin smooth if sometimes topsy turvy inventions that ms tharp originally made in for her own modern dance based troupe this restaging proved to be as much a treat for the audiences eyes as it appeared to be for the bodies of the abt dancers involved meanwhile elsewhere in manhattan ice theatre of new york offered another s wonder ms tharps "after all" to tomaso albinoni this ice "dance" dates from when it was created for the great figure skating champion john curry "after all" was revived here by the skating troupe for the first time since curry who died in stopped doing it when curry first performed the three movement solo work it was a beacon of hope for the art of skating the ever scrupulous ms tharp had arranged a work of real choreographic finesse that honors the integrity for skatings fine edge schooling it was something quite beyond what curry used to call the "bunny suit" acts of "ice capades " currys impassioned work with ice theater helped turn the tide but seeing "after all" in this current welcome reappearance on a program where nothing else even barely compared to its depth and coherence proved that much remains to be done the raised standards that were set on ice during the same decade that gave ballet the s works that abt recently brought back to glory have yet to be consistently met or respected ice theatres co artistic director david liu gave an honorable performance of ms tharps alternately playful and serene creation the occasion marked another good start for an art that still has a way to go if it hopes to become compelling theater one hopes that todays artistic directors on stage and on ice will realize where the gold is and not settle for the flim flam flash now posing as the real thing mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
