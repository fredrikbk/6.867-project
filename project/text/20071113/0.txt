beowulf saved from the fire when the heirs of sir robert cotton selected a spot to stash the rare book collectors priceless library they probably should have known better than to pick a place called ashburnham house in a fire swept through that ill named residence in london and forever impoverished our literary heritage one manuscript that escaped the blaze just barely contained an untitled poem of more than lines the flames actually singed its pages and destroyed bits of its unique content in the centuries to follow gradual deterioration consumed even more its a small miracle that "beowulf " as the poem came to be called survived at all nowadays "beowulf" has caught fire in a completely different way high school english teachers routinely assign the anglo saxon epic to their students bookstores carry multiple translations in the irish poet seamus heaneys version was a surprise best seller a new illustrated edition of his modern classic has just come out from w w norton &amp co several childrens publishers have recently issued their own adaptations of this monster fighting tale theres even "beowulf for business " in which author e l risden claims that by reading the millennium old story "you can both become a better person and find more success in the working world " this latest flurry of activity probably owes much to the film that reaches theaters this friday directed by robert zemeckis it features cutting edge animation and a cast of stars anthony hopkins as hrothgar crispin glover as grendel and most improbably angelina jolie as grendels mother the producers are clearly looking to capture the same market that made "" a sword swinging spear thrusting smash hit this spring the movie already has made waves for its "red band" trailer available only on the internet ms jolie doesnt appear as "that swamp thing from hell the tarn hag" of heaneys rendering but rather as a naked femme fatale thats a radical departure from the poems actual text and a racy one that most likely eliminates the prospect of classroom screenings as a reward for ninth graders who battle their way through the tale its not the first time "beowulf" has undergone a reimagining the tongue of the anglo saxons sometimes called "old english " is a positively foreign language whenever translators try to tackle it they must make choices about how to interpret a dead language for modern readers they also have to make up for deficiencies in the charred original manuscript as fate would have it several of the lost passages involve a fire breathing dragon many writers have mined "beowulf" as a source of material for their own creativity john gardners novel "grendel " told from the perspective of the poems ogre like antagonist is a prominent example so is the work of j r r tolkien he plucked the word "orc " for the sinister race of goblins in "the lord of the rings " directly from the original language of "beowulf " the poem probably was written down by monks around and it almost certainly grew out of an older oral tradition since scholars rediscovered this masterpiece of alliterative unrhymed verse in the th and th centuries it has flourished in part because it has no rival in the literature of england before the norman invasion of at the same time "beowulf" is a familiar story of heroic ideals the title character is to our anglo saxon forebears as gilgamesh is to the sumerians odysseus to the ancient greeks and aeneas to the romans the poem is both a saga of adventure and a repository of cultural wisdom anglo saxon style "behavior thats admired is the path to power among people everywhere" "whichever one death fells must deem it a just judgment by god" and "it is always better to avenge dear ones than to indulge in mourning " a few critics have tried to interpret beowulf as a christ figure because he dies so that others might live this reading can be pushed too far beowulf is the kind of guy who prefers ripping arms from sockets to turning the other cheek yet theres an obvious tension in the poem between the christian belief of the author and the pagan society he describes with fascination and sympathy the tug of war over which faith or people might lay claim to "beowulf " however isnt what gives the poem its magnificence instead its enduring power comes from the way it addresses subjects of universal importance most notably the timeless question of what makes a good leader eskimos are said to have a pile of words for "snow " the scholar howell d chickering jr has noted that "beowulf" includes more than synonyms for "king " over and over the poem dwells on the duties of rulership praising qualities such as courage and generosity and condemning cowardice and selfishness the moral center of the work comes after beowulf as a young warrior has defended his danish brethren from the terrorist rampages of grendel and his mother hrothgar the king whose home beowulf has just saved delivers a short sermon on the secrets of successful mead hall management he urges beowulf never to forget his own mortality thats the most essential ingredient of how a good leader "a protector of his people" may secure "eternal rewards " then the narrative leaps half a century to a time when beowulf is a wise old man who has led his people well and who must confront a final fatal challenge when all is done the poem offers its verdict "they said that of all the kings upon the earth he was the man most gracious and fair minded kindest to his people and keenest to win fame " through the force of his legend beowulf becomes the ultimate survivor a paradoxical lesson from a crumbling manuscript that nearly didnt make it mr miller writes for national review
