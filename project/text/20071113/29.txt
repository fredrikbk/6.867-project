business technology start ups mine database field nimble software helps make sense of information tide most databases are based on technology that originated years ago but change is in the air a mob of start ups have been developing variants of the software which provides the equivalent of filing cabinets for corporate information customers say the offerings are generating faster answers to questions that require sifting through huge volumes of business information established suppliers arent conceding much to the newcomers but industry executives agree the pace of progress is accelerating "the database market is going to be an exciting place to be in the next decade " said michael stonebraker an adjunct professor at the massachusetts institute of technology and chief technology officer of a new entrant called vertica systems inc his opinions carry some weight mr stonebraker during a year stint at the university of california berkeley was a major force in the s behind relational databases the strain of technology in products from companies such as oracle corp international business machines corp microsoft corp and sybase inc besides his initial product called ingres he helped develop another database called postgres that many companies use today one reason for the latest activity is the need to make sense of a flood of business information web services for example generate a stream of information about the activities of visitors to the sites companies use "business intelligence" software to analyze such data a reason for a takeover wave that includes ibms deal yesterday to buy cognos inc for &# billion corporate transaction data is typically transferred to software repositories called data warehouses where it can be studied using business intelligence programs a buyer for wal mart stores inc for example might want to plan for storm season by sifting through cash register records of what people in florida bought just before and after a major hurricane mr stonebraker said depending on their complexity such queries can take many hours using standard databases so companies have developed a range of techniques to speed up the job teradata corp a pioneer in data warehouses that recently was spun off from ncr corp developed technology to pass information quickly between server systems that come packaged with its software netezza corp a start up in framingham mass that went public this year helped popularize the idea of "analytic appliances" a combination of software and servers that are accelerated with the aid of certain chips other start ups such as greenplum of san mateo calif and dataupia corp of cambridge mass have developed their own hardware ideas one of their techniques is to divide up data warehouse jobs over many inexpensive servers so that adding more computers gets answers more quickly one user is icrossing inc of scottsdale ariz which provides analytical services to companies that operate web sites analyzing a days worth of some types of data once took to hours said tony wasson the companys vice president of engineering with greenplums technology and some modifications to its own software the job now takes about an hour he said others are using a different style of software relational databases typically store records in rows with multiple columns of transaction informatio sifting through all those columns can create delays in getting answers another approach pioneered by sybase accelerates the process by searching only through specific columns that are the focus of a query some users of these "columnar" databases rave about them investment technology group inc a new york firm that provides brokerage and technology services to institutional investors said its data warehouse has swelled with the heavy volume of electronic trades and associated message traffic one standard query which analyzes transaction data over days once took about five hours said michael dearinger an itg senior vice president using the columnar software sybase iq the firm gets answers in about minutes he said the columnar approach also is used by vertica the andover mass company co founded in by mr stonebraker its executive chairman is jerry held an oracle veteran who worked with mr stonebraker at uc berkeley another start up that uses a similar technique to narrow searches is paraccel inc of san diego "with columnar databases you are searching only through the relevant haystack " said barry zane a former netezza executive who is paraccels chief technology officer some predict specialized products will find a niche "one kind of database is not going to suit all of the different applications we are coming up with " said donald feinberg an analyst at market researcher gartner inc
