business technology best of the business tech blog excerpts from recent entries at wsj coms tech blog venting anger on the web is all the rage literally we received this email the other day in response to a post about google inc s mobile phone operating system "you are a moron hopefully you have not and will not procreate it would be a shame to have your genes pollute the gene pool ps youre a expletive deleted " weve never met talked with or written to the sender and while it may seem a tad over the top its an example of something you and your business need to prepare for web rage web rage is what happens when you combine unfamiliarity with the ability to easily communicate with someone "that combination is relatively new " says clay shirky an adjunct professor at new york university "it leads to a pretty unfettered expression of the id " it used to be difficult to reach the people who make us angry a journalist who wrote something we disagreed with a businessperson who made a decision we thought was wrong but because of email and the internet its possible to get in touch with these people in a matter of minutes and in a way that doesnt require human to human interaction that encourages vitriol mr shirky says largely because it frees people from the societal bonds that keep us civil mr shirky has good news for the businesses that have been on the receiving end of web rage either in emails or web sites "dont sweat it " he says "almost all of those kind of vitriolic im going to take my business elsewhere messages are meaningless " companies should be much more worried about moderate discontent from a large number of customers than extreme discontent from a small number of customers the bigger risk is that one of your companys employees will commit web rage especially as companies empower workers to solve problems on their own the easy answer says mr shirky is just to not send angry emails but its obviously more complicated than that he suggests companies make dealing with and resisting web rage a part of employee training programs as for all those who have sent web rage emails to the business technology blog we say bring it on morons cyber crime pays each credit card number a hacker steals from a company is worth between cents and &# on the black market just stumbling upon a spreadsheet with a couple of thousand records can mean a big payday for a hacker hit the right target and a breach is like winning the lottery those numbers frighten lloyd hession chief security officer at bt group plcs global financial services division but the number that really scares him the chance a hacker will get caught its really small "theres no other crime with this low a risk rate " mr hession says mr hession has tried to quantify just how low risk cyber crime is his best guess one out of every cyber criminals gets convicted although it could be as few as one out of every the problem is that so many things have to go right to catch a hacker and odds are most of those things wont go right victims detect only to of cyber crimes mr hession says there arent many public studies about cyber crime most of mr hessions data points come from sources in law enforcement hence the broad ranges of the victims who do detect an attack very few between and report it to law enforcement officials who in turn investigate less than half of all reports many hackers live overseas leading to jurisdiction problems and other issues that can complicate an investigation mr hession says its possible that as few as of the cases that get investigated lead to an arrest of those only half ever get prosecuted and only of those lead to conviction as long as the risk of getting caught it so low and the reward so great the number of attacks is bound to keep climbing he calls this "the mathematics of toast " as in companies who arent prepared for an influx of attacks are pretty much toast "electronic crime is the place to be " mr hession says "it really does pay " high tech staff small businesses say that finding and retaining staff members is the biggest challenge they face now theyre turning to technology for help a new survey by vistage international inc an organization for chief executive officers of small and midsize businesses found that of the more than ceos surveyed listed staffing as their greatest challenge economic uncertainty was second at later in the survey of the ceos say theyve installed technology that lets employees work remotely whats the connection when asked why theyve invested in this technology the most popular answer was that it helped retain staff "you have to use technology to attract and retain the best workers " vistage ceo rafael pastor says thats partly because the generation now entering the work force is so technically inclined if a small company is going to be in the running for the best and the brightest young workers it has to be supportive of the way they want to work which includes using the latest tech
