global economy why japans political scene weighs on economy premier is slow to enact crucial steps for growth hurdles in parliament tokyo yasuo fukuda has succeeded in outfoxing his political opponents since taking office in september as japans prime minister but he has made little progress on his biggest challenge perking up the sluggish japanese economy when the year old mr fukuda visits washington friday he will be under pressure to persuade u s leaders that he can keep japan a reliable ally and also push through the difficult steps needed to make his countrys economy more efficient and competitive last month in his first policy speech mr fukuda promised to promote economic reforms to avoid passing on debt to future generations and pledged to balance government spending with revenue by the fiscal year that begins in april but only one bill has been passed by parliament since mr fukuda became prime minister and that was a modest measure to provide assistance grants to rebuild homes damaged in natural disasters the lack of any substantial achievement by mr fukudas government is a problem because japan is at a critical juncture the worlds second largest economy faces persistent head winds as its population shrinks and a growing percentage of its citizens retire that means the countrys output and living standards will decline unless workers on average produce more japans economy returned to growth in the july through september quarter after contracting in the previous quarter but its long term outlook remains clouded yesterday the nations benchmark stock index closed at its lowest level all year even the bright spot in japans economy its powerful exporters including auto makers is threatened by the yens recent rise to around yen to the dollar from in june a stronger yen makes japanese exports less competitive in overseas markets and reduces the value of foreign currency earnings when converted into yen and repatriated "theres concern that the government is not being very constructive in addressing the concern the market has in terms of sustainability" of economic growth says kathy matsui strategist in tokyo for goldman sachs "you need somebody in a position of leadership not just willing but able to take control " mr fukuda however has said little so far on how to remedy these problems government committees have over the past year drafted ideas to inject life into the economys underperforming sectors deregulation of the kind pursued by former prime minister junichiro koizumi who governed from to and is credited with having helped japan emerge from a long period of economic stagnation their proposals have included deregulating financial services to help tokyo compete with other financial centers but analysts say the main political parties probably will pull back from koizumi style deregulation and spending cuts which were popular with pro business voters in thriving cities like tokyo but alienated japans struggling countryside under its previous leader shinzo abe mr fukudas liberal democratic party was heavily defeated in elections for parliaments upper house in july after the opposition democratic party of japan promised measures such as income subsidies for farmers the dpj a disparate collection of political forces united mainly by opposition to the ldp gained control of the upper house enabling it to veto or delay certain appointments and legislation the ldp still has a big majority in the lower house giving it the right to choose the prime minister but the upper house loss made it hard to govern and mr abe resigned a month later in exasperation since then the ldp has appeared loath to continue mr koizumis small government policies mr fukuda has said he wont simply use government handouts to woo rural voters but analysts say some backtracking from the koizumi years is inevitable "the koizumi policy is going to be changed in the next few years " says ikuo kabashima a professor in the university of tokyos law department "there will be less attention to urban districts and more attention to rural districts " the most visible sign of mr fukudas weak position has been his inability to extend a law enabling japan to carry out a naval mission in support of u s led combat operations in afghanistan which had represented japans greater willingness to assist the u s militarily he held a series of closed door meetings with the dpj leader ichiro ozawa in the hope of persuading him to back the bills or at least some kind of compromise however mr ozawa refused and the law expired nov since then mr fukuda has staged a qualified comeback two weeks ago he said he proposed to mr ozawa a kind of power sharing arrangement with the dpj which might have been seen as the quickest way for the dpj to gain power but instead the meeting led to the dpjs implosion the very discussion of power sharing angered other dpj leaders mr ozawa said he would resign to take responsibility but then reversed his decision just two days later after other party members begged him to stay on the episode which was embarrassing for the dpj left mr fukuda appearing calm and professional
