seniors weigh new options on drug benefit with most medicare plans raising costs enrollees need to shop around this year as the open enrollment period for medicare approaches seniors may have more reason than ever this year to revisit their prescription drug coverage and consider a change most of the private insurers that provide the drug benefit are raising premiums for with the average premium from the top three plans set to rise from levels according to a new analysis of data from the federal government and private insurers many plans will require beneficiaries to shoulder a larger share of the costs of drugs that are covered and many people will see significant cutbacks on coverage of their medications during the "doughnut hole" gap in coverage the changes may make some previously more expensive plans look more attractive at the same time a few insurers do plan to lower premiums some of beneficiaries will have access to at least one plan with lower premiums than what they pay in says herb kuhn deputy administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services the federal agency that manages medicare to help beneficiaries weigh options during the six week enrollment period that begins thursday cms is offering some new online tools medicare this week will offer new tools on the plan finder page of its web site findable at www mymedicare gov or www medicare gov the tools will include report cards that rate plans based on a range of factors such as customer service drug pricing and how easy it is to get prescriptions filled plan finder also lets beneficiaries compare out of pocket costs and pharmacy networks in their areas beneficiaries who prefer not to use the web can call medicare or ask for help from state assistance groups and advocacy programs about million seniors and other eligible medicare beneficiaries are signed up for the medicare drug benefit which was begun in to provide subsidized coverage of prescription drugs through private insurers each year during the fall open enrollment period beneficiaries may elect to change plans though they dont have to last year only a small percentage of them switched plans despite a flurry of new offerings especially in medicare advantage which provides an alternative to government run medicare health benefits through managed care companies the market is still highly concentrated with unitedhealth group and humana inc holding of the drug benefit market with premiums rising insurers are testing the loyalty of their enrollees some of the steepest hikes are coming from some big plans that lured early enrollees with low monthly premiums in according to avalere health a washington consulting firm that analyzed recently released data from cms for example the basic stand alone plan from humana will carry an average premium of &# in compared with &# in and &# in unitedhealths rx basic plan will carry an average premium of &# next year compared with &# for and &# in "if you went to the market to look for the least expensive plan you need to look again " says dan mendelson avaleres president nearly one in five of those enrolled in stand alone drug plans if they dont switch will see increases of more than &# a month in according to the kaiser family foundation about of all enrollees who have stayed with the same plan since will face a minimum increase in those original premiums the premium increases are the most striking at humana which aggressively competed for market share with low premiums tom noland a senior vice president at humana blamed the increases mainly on the new formula cms used to determine bid prices as well as increased drug costs and high usage "its not that we are intentionally increasing premiums " he says still mr noland doesnt expect a mass exodus among his consumers humana premiums especially for its enhanced plan are still low in many areas in he says humana will also require no co payment for eligible enrollees ordering preferred generics from its mail order service seniors many on fixed incomes have shown that when it comes to drug plans they like to look for bargains that could benefit some of the few top plans that are bucking the trend by lowering premiums the average monthly premium for silverscript offered by cvs caremark corp will be lower in or &# according to avalere universal american financial corp s community care rx basic plan will decrease its average premium to &# in gary jacobs senior vice president of corporate development says the companys strategy will help keep current beneficiaries and attract new ones "we feel like we had appropriate pricing this year " he says when comparing plans beneficiaries should also consider other factors such as the list of drugs a plan covers and the cost sharing requirement the class of drugs most severely affected is "nonpreferred" brand name drugs these drugs cost more than generics and dont enjoy the discounts each insurer negotiated for the brand name drugs on their "preferred" list the nonpreferred lists vary some carriers have negotiated discounts on drugs such as the statin zocor or the arthritis drug celebrex while others may list such drugs as nonpreferred but the category often includes medications that patients with chronic illnesses rely on for example wellcare signature from wellcare health plans inc will increase its co payment on nonpreferred drugs to &# an increase of up to &# from according to avalere unitedhealth meanwhile will increase the nonpreferred co payment on its medicarerx aarp plan by &# the community care rx basic plan will also increase patients share of costs on nonpreferred brand name drugs to from in cvs caremarks silverscript will switch from requiring enrollees to pay a share of nonpreferred drug costs so called co insurance to requiring a flat co payment of up to &# in in another shift many insurers are limiting the number of generics they cover in the plans that provide some benefits during the doughnut hole coverage gap the gap begins after beneficiaries and their plans pay &# in drug costs at which point plans arent required to pay benefits until the enrollee has spent &# out of pocket then benefits kick in again nearly one third of stand alone plans and roughly half of plans in medicare advantage offer some coverage during the gap according to kaiser family foundation in most plans that had gap coverage included all generic drugs in their benefit but in about half of the plans will reduce their benefits and cover only some generics the average premium for stand alone plans with gap coverage will be more than twice that of the basic plans raising the question of whether the coverage now with reduced benefits is worth the money in says tricia neuman the kaiser foundations director of medicare policy project new deal some changes enrollees can expect for in the medicare drug benefit average monthly premiums in the top three plans by enrollment will rise  in to &# eight of the top plans will reflect some increases in patients share of the cost of nonpreferred brand name drugs source avalere health
