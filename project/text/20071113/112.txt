study redefines window for early birth risks babies born even three weeks before their due date are more likely to die in their first week of life compared with infants born full term according to a new study published in the journal of pediatrics these "late preterm" infants account for the vast majority of early births and are rising in number due in part to increased use of caesarean deliveries and labor induction according to data from the national center for health statistics delivery between weeks of pregnancy is considered normal researchers found that among babies born in the week window the mortality rate was six times higher in the first week of life than that of full term babies though the risk drops to three times as likely over the first year the overall mortality rate for the week group is per compared with per live births the new research which studied million births in the national center for health statistics database from is the first to quantify death rates among late preterm infants and adds to previous research showing that such newborns are more likely to have respiratory problems jaundice and higher rates of rehospitalization after discharge compared with full term babies "what the data are showing is not just that these kids die more often even if they survive they have a lot more morbidity than people think " says gabriel escobar research scientist at the kaiser permenante division of research in oakland calif who wasnt involved in this study but conducted research on rehospitalization rates in preemies there are no standard guidelines for how to treat late preterm babies once they are born most babies born before weeks end up in the neonatal intensive care unit but late preterm babies who are more commonly born at normal weight are much less likely to babies born in the to week window who dont go to the intensive care unit are more likely to get rehospitalized says dr escobar with feeding problems a leading cause many eat normally for a day or two then falter because they lack energy and become dehydrated experts speculate that the rise in late preterm births is due to more complicated pregnancies that require these techniques but also more frequent requests by mothers to have the baby after a threshold of around weeks that ends the pregnancy "sooner than it otherwise would have ended " says cande ananth professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the university of medicine and dentistry of new jerseys robert wood johnson medical school a researcher of preterm births who wasnt involved in the study how these babies should be cared for isnt yet clear joann petrini a study author and director of the perinatal data center at the march of dimes says parents and doctors should "try to prevent whats preventable " this includes being as healthy as possible prior to pregnancy avoiding an unnecessary early delivery and asking whether an induction or c section is necessary dr ananth also recommends "more intense monitoring" as pregnancies approach the end of term
