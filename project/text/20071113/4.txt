ags gone wild district attorneys have "national prosecution standards " u s attorneys have their own ethics manual but what about state attorneys general they get to make everything up as they go as their increasingly aggressive prosecutions are showing the problem is laid out in a new report by the institute for legal reform an affiliate of the u s chamber of commerce that deserves more publicity state ags have no uniform rules governing their conduct and whatever procedures are in place for initiating investigations and litigating are largely hidden from public view this includes guidelines on the use of outside trial lawyers the use of settlement funds multistate litigation and public statements regarding an investigation or ongoing trial when the institute commissioned a blind survey of the nations ags only responded among those who did a majority had no standard in place for determining whether to launch an investigation and none "were able to cite state laws regulations office policies or ethical rules that require notice be provided to a defendant company prior to bringing criminal charges " this lack of transparency is all the more troubling given that state ags are increasingly assailing long standing business practices often driven by a political agenda as much as by a duty to enforce the law as the old joke goes "ag" stands for "aspiring governor " and no one epitomized this better than new yorks current governor eliot spitzer in his previous job as ag mr spitzer regularly threatened criminal prosecution in order to extract settlements in civil suits and win headlines think aig and hank greenberg but hes hardly alone rhode island attorney general patrick lynch dropped the dupont corporation from a lead paint lawsuit in after the company agreed to donate &# million to charity most of the money went to charities based outside of the state including a hospital in boston the settlement money is being used to satisfy a pledge to the hospital made previously by motley rice which happens to be the plaintiffs firm hired by the state to pursue the case on a contingency fee basis motley rice counsel john mcconnell is a campaign contributor to mr lynch whos been sanctioned twice for comments to the press about the paint litigation west virginia taxpayers already finance an in house legal staff of nearly yet last year darrell mcgraw the state attorney general deputized two personal injury attorneys to file lawsuits on behalf of the state the lawyers had donated to mr mcgraws political campaign and were hired to subpoena records from a company they were already suing in private civil litigation in effect two mcgraw campaign contributors were given the power of the state to conduct discovery for their private litigation in mr mcgraw extracted a &# million settlement from purdue pharma in a lawsuit filed on behalf of state agencies a third of the settlement went to lawyers who worked on the case and aside from a &# payment to the state health department little of the money has been returned to the agencies named in the initial suit instead mr mcgraw has doled out the money in grants to his own favorite institutions and projects however unrelated to the case the university of charleston received &# from the ag for a new pharmacy school in mississippi attorney general jim hood has made a habit of hiring profit seeking private lawyers whove supported him politically as outside counsel to represent the state in california former ag bill lockyer concealed more than a hundred million dollars worth of contracts with lobbyists and private law firms labeling them confidential to block public oversight many were no bid contracts that went to firms with ties to mr lockyer we could go on but you get the idea because most state ags are elected they are ultimately accountable to voters but it wouldnt hurt to have some common legal parameters that also protect the due process rights of their targets to that end the institute for legal reform has proposed a code of conduct for state ags the code includes nothing that shouldnt already be legal ethics such as refraining from public comments that could prejudice a case and not threatening companies with criminal action to gain advantage in a civil suit if bringing in outside lawyers is necessary because an ags office lacks the expertise or manpower to try a case then paying them hourly instead of on a contingency basis would minimize a gross conflict of interests these guidelines ought to be more than acceptable to public servants who wield great power and claim to be ethical watchdogs themselves that they are consistently ignored from coast to coast suggests that the political system needs to start imposing some accountability on ags gone wild see related letter "letters to the editor ags need code of conduct" wsj nov
