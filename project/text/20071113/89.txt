on wall street a gold bug goes straight to the source rick sherlund gets to play with his own bulldozer alaskan family vacations central alaska like a lot of other professional investors rick sherlund this year has loaded up on gold as the dollar dipped and stocks sank unlike his wall street peers mr sherlund gets his gold while sitting atop a ton bulldozer with a pistol strapped to his side the pistol a caliber smith &amp wesson is protection from grizzly bears the bulldozer a caterpillar dt with a foot blade is for moving the tons of rock and dirt separating mr sherlund from the gold tiny flakes and bigger nuggets buried feet below the surface at his own gold mine if you strike gold on wall street you can do pretty much whatever you want for fun and fun for mr sherlund is grubbing for gold deep in the alaskan wilderness with gold prices hitting record levels its a pursuit that eventually might be profitable for him it isnt yet but that isnt the point "some people have a passion for running big equipment and looking for gold " he explains in finance and technology circles mr sherlund is known as the former dean of wall streets microsoft analysts a market mover with the reports he wrote in two decades at goldman sachs group early this year he quit to become a managing director investing in technology stocks at galleon group a &# billion hedge fund in new york mr sherlund made millions at goldman and he stands to make more money if galleon does well but his career kept him chained to his desk on conference calls and staring at statistics six years ago he took a trip to alaska acting on an urge for something different and a longtime interest in gold mining soon he says "it sort of took on a life of its own " now every summer mr sherlund heads north moves into a thin walled bunkhouse stops shaving and gathers a motley crew of relatives friends and locals to work a mine tucked in the hills near the rustic town of central its an annual ritual that this year started in july when mr sherlund packed his bags for fairbanks a few days later after a three hour drive on a gravel road into the wilderness he turned right at a bullet riddled sign that once read "ketchem creek " soon mr sherlund stood with gnats swirling around his head scanning his gold mine and an assortment of heavy equipment scraping and piling a vast field of dirt and rocks his extended family including his father stepmother brother and nephews had joined flying and driving in from around the country to dig for gold his wife and two sons relaxed at the familys vacation home in nantucket mr sherlund wore a soiled carhartt baseball cap muddy jeans and a belt with inlaid indian head nickels the eight acre mine which he works under an agreement with the mines claim holder is surrounded by mountains of white birch and green shrubs the land is grizzly bear territory he hedges that risk with the revolver holstered at his hip but he has never had to shoot a bear mr sherlunds brother mick up from utah where he works at a diesel engine maker was in the cockpit of the bulldozer scraping earth into a pile nearby mr sherlunds nephew shane manipulated the long arm of a caterpillar excavator to feed the dirt from the pile into a trommel a big rotating barrel with water flowing through it that spits out large rocks on one end and directs silt and small stones into a sluice a long bed of metal louvers that trap the gold later that day mr sherlund found a bit of what he came looking for washed out of the dirt "theres a little nugget right there " he said picking up a small piece of gold and displaying it in his palm mr sherlund is following a well worn path of prospectors who first came in the klondike gold rush and then spread through alaska some struck it rich while most retreated or died empty handed these days high fuel costs depleted stream beds and tougher regulations make it increasingly difficult for small time mines like mr sherlunds "they go broke sooner or later " said fred wilkinson a year old miner whom mr sherlund calls his mentor "unless youve got wall street backing you " he jokes mr sherlunds miner origins are rooted in gold panning trips he took as a kid with his father in the foothills of northern california but it was a cruise with his own son that brought the analyst to alaska intrigued by the size of the nuggets in alaskan gift shops mr sherlund asked a nugget dealer for an introduction to a miner who later guided him to ketchem creek about five miles from central mr sherlund and a friend panned the area but the effort yielded little more than bug bites and back pain he did find some gold and soon upgraded his equipment in buying the excavator followed by the bulldozer last year and the front loader this year he says he has sunk about &# million altogether into the operation the equipment boosted his take he scraped up &# in gold in and &# last year but since he digs just a few weeks a year mr sherlund realizes hell likely be losing money for a while thats ok this summer mr sherlund spent hours each day in the excavators air conditioned cab loading dirt into the plant as national public radio played in his ears he would occasionally check on his crew at the final stage of separating the gold from sand and pebbles or take off into the woods with a pan and trowel to look for new spots to dig taking a break one day he and his crew shot off a few rounds with pistols and rifles into a block of wood climbing a nearby peak on foot he looked out over the alaska wilderness "this is about as far away as you can get from wall street " after nine days in alaska mr sherlund headed home and prepared for his first day back at the office up at a m he shaved his beard put on a pressed shirt and brown italian loafers at the office he couldnt at first access his computer system for checking stock quotes it uses a fingerprint reader for security and mr sherlunds hands were so chafed from mining that it didnt recognize him a duffel bag on the floor held the fruits of his alaska trip a pound brick some loose flakes and nuggets in small glass vials the value of that gold has risen quickly as investors buy the precious metal as a haven from the turmoil hitting financial markets gold futures last week broke &# an ounce their highest level since the s while the stock market took a beating the tech stocks mr sherlund is paid to buy and sell havent escaped the drubbing the lure of gold mining notwithstanding "right now im keeping my day job " he says
