business technology honeywell tests brain wave system honeywell international inc seeking to speed up how fast humans can analyze intelligence data such as aerial photographs is testing a system that monitors analysts brains for early signs of electrical activity when they see something interesting with funding from the defense department the three year old project instantaneously keys on certain faint neural signals before analysts themselves can consciously react to them as a way to identify and flag images worthy of further assessment supported by the defense advanced research projects agency tests so far have allowed human analysts to process images five to seven times faster than current computer based methods said bob smith head of the advanced technology group for honeywells aerospace unit officials of the morris township n j aerospace and industrial company are expected to release information about the project later this week the project uses head mounted sensors to detect brain signals associated with the recognition of targets analysts are looking for initially images are flashed in front of them in bursts of to a second that high speed scan is followed by slower and systematic analysis of the portion of images deemed by the brain wave monitor as most likely to contain the desired data by eliminating the need for analysts to thoroughly assess all parts of each satellite image for example the system is intended to significantly increase productivity compared with current computer based techniques the result has been "remarkable speed improvements" in analysis because of the systems "capability to filter out the background " mr smith said in a recent interview he compared the principle to seeing "something out of the corner of your eye" before being able to describe or realize exactly what it is the system has potentially broad commercial applications in future years including evaluating medical images and assisting researchers conducting long term studies requiring frequent comparison of medical scans mr smith said honeywell has contracted with university researchers in oregon to study the applicability of the technology dubbed the honeywell image triage system honeywells push in the intelligence analysis arena comes as congress and intelligence officials debate the future mix of human and technological spying "the real challenge of the intelligence community today is how to keep up with the proliferation of data sources " mr smith said the honeywell system is designed to get high priority data including battlefield threats back to commanders faster than they currently can receive it
