politics &amp economics next test for blackwater can firm get new pentagon work after iraq incident a defense department contract involving antidrug training missions may test the durability of the political controversy over blackwater worldwides security work in iraq the moyock n c company which was involved in a september shooting in baghdad that left iraqis dead is one of five military contractors competing for as much as &# billion over five years to help fight a narcotics trade that the government says finances terrorist groups also competing for contracts from the pentagons counter narcoterrorism technology program office are military industry giants raytheon co lockheed martin corp and northrop grumman corp as well as arinc inc a smaller aerospace and technology contractor the contracts are expected to be awarded as the need arises so the pentagons level of concern about employing blackwater will likely be measured over time and by whether the company wins leading roles or is shut out companies competing for the work might be called on to develop detection or surveillance technology train u s and foreign forces or provide logistics communications and information technology systems among other areas blackwater faces the question of whether it is too tainted to be tapped for such work even though the contract doesnt involve the kind of security detail that it performs in iraq the sept shooting in baghdad strained relations between washington and the iraqi government which alleged that the shooting was unnecessary the company formerly known as blackwater usa maintains that its ability to win additional government business hasnt been affected by scrutiny from congress the state department and the justice department blackwater spokeswoman anne tyrrell said customers have "confidence in our ability to perform in a capable and professional manner " peter singer a senior fellow at the brookings institution in washington said blackwaters troubles are not a "death knell " for the company but said "this extremely public kind of controversy certainly isnt of much help in winning contracts " last week sen bernie sanders a vermont independent who caucuses with democrats and democratic rep jan schakowsky of illinois introduced the "stop outsourcing security act " which would halt the governments practice of using companies such as blackwater to provide private security for u s diplomats in iraq rep henry waxman of california chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee continues to pursue inquiries into blackwaters operations in iraq and its business practices the federal bureau of investigation which is probing the sept shooting is expected to report its findings in the coming weeks tensions with iraq over the u s employment of private contractors are likely to persist saturday a dyncorp international guard shot and killed an iraqi taxi driver in baghdad as a convoy passed a traffic jam iraqs interior ministry alleged that the shooting was unprovoked u s embassy spokesman philip reeker said dyncorp is working with the interior ministry to investigate the shooting dyncorp spokesman greg lagana said that the company is investigating "we left the scene believing no one was injured " mr lagana said although the pentagons contracts represent a potential windfall to the companies they likely wouldnt come close to providing blackwater the same kind of cash flow that has come from the governments spending for security work in iraq since closely held blackwater is estimated to have been paid over &# billion for its government services instead of giving all of the business to a single firm the pentagon plans to award the antidrug work on a task by task basis requiring blackwater and its rivals to compete constantly in august the defense department gave each of the five companies a &# contract to look at intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions in saharan africa four more contracts have since been awarded but the government has classified the details for bigger companies such as lockheed and northrop the value of the antidrug contracts are miniscule when compared with building fighter jets and naval ships yet work such as this is increasingly important as they seek to expand into new markets that could grow over time for blackwater which started in as a small company that trained law enforcement officers and others at its compound in north carolina such contracts are crucial to growth since blackwaters roster of military veterans and former law enforcement officers has swelled to more than and it has built a fleet of airplanes and helicopters larger than those of some of the countries where it does business blackwater hopes to sell its own surveillance airship and a custom built armored vehicle for dangerous missions under the defense department contract blackwater might end up as a subcontractor to a rival lockheed lists blackwater as one of companies it might use to supply nonsecurity services such as training personnel blackwater received &# million in contracts from lockheed between and for work as a subcontractor on antidrug training and border related work in afghanistan according to the defense department richard douglas deputy assistant defense secretary for counternarcotics counterproliferation and global threats said blackwaters training of afghan antidrug forces has made them more effective "weve been very happy with the results of our association with them in afghanistan " he said gina chon in baghdad
