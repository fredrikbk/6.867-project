home builders opt for mothballing some bet projects put on hold will hurt less than losses on discounts as the glut of unsold home remains stubbornly high and housing demand slides home builders face a dilemma to sell or not to sell lennar corp for one has joined the "not to sell" camp at its development in orange county calif the miami company plans to finish building homes the first phase of a unit development in irvine but it has decided not to sell any of them until the constrained mortgage market and swollen housing inventory improves "we are better off holding off on sales at this asset and not discounting as steeply as the market is discounting right now " says emile haddad lennars chief investment officer who oversees the companys large west coast projects "it doesnt make sense for us to sell it in an environment that as strained as it is right now " mr haddad says lennar will monitor the orange county market on a monthly basis but "this might be put on hold for the whole year of " lennar also is halting development of a large community planned near angel stadium of anaheim despite preparing the land to support the project analysts expect more builders to mothball projects in the coming months as they decide that the losses from selling homes at huge discounts are greater than the costs of carrying properties on their books but its not an easy decision builders are facing increasing pressure from lenders to service their debt and also have overhead expenses to support "its the next natural step in the evolution" of the housing downturn says nishu sood a home builder analyst at deutsche bank "this normally happens during a recession when you just dont have a base of demand but its like that now in some of these locations you just cant give a house away " some builders dont have the luxury of waiting for a brighter day the more highly leveraged companies are slashing prices to move inventory to generate cash and pay down debt this fall builder hovnanian enterprises inc based in red bank n j offered discounts on homes of as much as while standard pacific corp of irvine calif has been offering discounts and other incentives of as much as on certain homes both companies say their recent heavily marketed discounts have sparked sales in the difficult market lennar chief executive stuart miller recently called some price cuts "unrealistic and maybe even ridiculous " "the market has just deteriorated more and more we dont want to go below a certain floor and that is the floor of reasonableness " mr miller told analysts on a conference call in late september outside some of its orange county developments lennar continues to discount homes in many markets to make sales under increasingly tough conditions in the third quarter lennar delivered homes at an average price &# including discounts or amenities of &# per home that compares with an average price of &# including &# in discounts and amenities in the year earlier period lennars move in orange county is unusual in that the company is mothballing homes builders typically mothball partially developed or undeveloped land because vacant homes require watching one alternative would be for builders to sell their land instead but that market is even more dismal than the one for housing recent land transactions in california phoenix and southeast florida while few in number have fetched discounts of and on finished lots according to zelman &amp associates an independent housing research firm "they have all this land that they need to turn over so they keep building " says paul puryear an analyst at raymond james &amp associates "we would recover so much quicker if you could just turn it off but you cant turn it off " lennar may be in a better position than others to mothball certain developments and land the company was one of the first large builders to discount homes through much of burning through its unsold inventory and generating cash at the time the company was criticized for softening prices but "it ended up being the right move given the subsequent deterioration in the market " says ubs analyst david goldberg although it posted a &# million third quarter loss the company ended the period with a net debt to capital ratio of compared with an industry average of mr goldberg says luxury builder toll brothers inc based in horsham pa said last week that it is willing to hold prices even if that means generating few sales mr sood says such a strategy amounts to the "effective mothballing" of certain developments "they might have a salesperson in these communities but its effectively fallow " mr sood says "they are selling less than one home a month" in some communities chief executive robert toll said builders with cash problems may need to reduce prices more aggressively "but fortunately for the time being thats not us " mr toll told analysts on a conference call last week builders continue to put up new homes though in far fewer numbers than during the housing boom according to the census bureau builders started construction on single family and multifamily homes in september which was down and respectively from the same month a year earlier housing starts are off by about from a peak in january considering there are too many houses already looking for buyers it might seem surprising that builders are building at all but unlike auto manufacturers that can ramp production up or down in a matter of weeks it can take years for a housing development to makes its way through the development pipeline by the time the builder has spent money putting in roads and sidewalks the housing market may have turned "many builders are stuck between a rock and hard place " says jonathan dienhart director of published research at hanley wood market intelligence a housing research firm in costa mesa calif "they cant make money by building and they cant make money by not building they have to choose the lesser of two evils " lennars mr haddad says the builder had to finish constructing the first phase of its irvine project called central park west where the mix of condos and town homes had an average price of &# "you create a stigma for a community if its only half built " mr haddad says the buyers who signed contracts for the homes got their deposits back a spokesman for lennars partner in the project san francisco based stockbridge real estate fund said "we are under no pressure to sell strong assets into a weak market especially where the markets long term prospects remain favorable " mr haddad says stockbridge has a larger equity stake in the project than lennar but he declined to elaborate mr haddad says the lender on the project britains barclays plc is "fully aware of what we are doing " barclays declined to comment corrections &amp amplifications buyers who signed contracts for of the homes that are being built by lennar corp in an orange county calif development got their deposits back a corporate focus article tuesday about home builders mothballing projects incorrectly implied that buyers had signed contracts to purchase all homes wsj nov
