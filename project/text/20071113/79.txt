mortgage crisis extends its reach fannie freddie regain dominance as investors shrink from housing capitalism isnt perfect ever since the great depression the american home loan business has included a dollop of socialism it was sometimes lost from view amid the frenzy of the housing boom when wall street eagerly provided capital for lending but with that game over the governments role is expanding again in a growing percentage of cases government linked bodies are the ones putting up the cash for home loans and taking the risk that a borrower wont pay the money back private enterprises role is narrowing in many instances to the job of arranging loans providing the initial funding until the loans can be sold and handling the monthly paper work for home buyers the renewed dominance of government related entities means the end of the era of endless choice and easy approvals on mortgages borrowers now generally must meet tighter standards familiar from earlier years such as proving their income and making a down payment of to the expanding government role isnt the result of initiatives from washington as investors have fled from housing exposure lenders wanting to sell loans they make have had no choice but to rely more on existing agencies that will still buy mortgages like government sponsored fannie mae and freddie mac to raise funds to lend in the first place lenders are leaning more heavily on the regional federal home loan banks which are cooperatives chartered by congress but owned by commercial banks and other financial institutions the home loan banks loans to financial institutions which are known as "advances" and typically secured by mortgage loans grew in the first nine months of to &# billion fannie mae freddie mac and the home loan banks arent government agencies but because of their federal charters its widely assumed the government would bail them out if they ever got into a crisis in addition some mortgage lenders among them the largest countrywide financial corp are growing more reliant on deposits insured by another government agency the federal deposit insurance corp "capitalism isnt perfect " says ceo angelo mozilo of countrywide which had a &# billion loss in the third quarter as investors suddenly grew allergic to mortgages they had eagerly bought before mr mozilo says the u s needs fannie and freddie as "shock absorbers" between people seeking home loans and unpredictable credit markets that can seize up overnight when investors take fright the new reliance on the government sponsored mortgage buyers has prompted some congressmen and senators to call for giving them even more scope to purchase or guarantee mortgages the companies package loans made by mortgage lenders into securities they keep some of these securities as investments and others are sold to investors world wide for mortgage securities sold to other investors fannie and freddie collect fees for guaranteeing that payments will be made on the loans the political sentiment to expand the companies powers while growing out of the plight of borrowers facing foreclosure plays into the hands of the two shareholder owned companies until a few months ago the debate in washington centered on whether regulators should be able to force the two which were both recently involved in accounting scandals to reduce their holdings of mortgages among u s mortgage securities offered to investors the portion guaranteed by fannie and freddie has rebounded to around in october from as low as about in at the height of the housing boom when wall street gobbled up loans with no federal backing according to trade publication inside mortgage finance the shift isnt just because fannie and freddie are guaranteeing more loans although they are at the end of september fannie either owned or guaranteed &# trillion of mortgages or around a quarter of the total outstanding up from &# trillion a year earlier at least as important is that mortgage lending is falling both because of weak demand for housing and because lenders have had to become much more cautious in the wake of surging defaults new home mortgages are expected to total &# trillion this year down about from according to the mortgage bankers association fannie and freddie require borrowers to pay for mortgage insurance if they dont make sizable down payments and they generally require more documentation of income than some private sector lenders did in recent years fannie and freddie also havent gone as far as wall street did in accepting large amounts of loans that allow borrowers to make minimal payments in the early years an arrangement that can result in a growing loan balance because investors dont want to buy these permissive loans either few are currently being made countrywide says more than of the loans it is making now are eligible for sale to fannie or freddie up from about one third last year before this summers credit squeeze hit countrywide raised money to fund its lending through short term borrowings such as selling commercial paper with that spigot largely closed countrywide also is leaning on the federal home loan bank system for credit the companys borrowings from the atlanta home loan bank soared to &# billion on sept from &# billion nine months earlier at the same time countrywide is relying more on the fdic by heavily promoting certificates of deposits with above market rates insured by that federal agency the company recently said deposits were growing at a rate of &# million a day at its savings bank unit those deposits are providing more of the funding for countrywides home loans now fannie and freddie are permitted to buy and guarantee repayment of mortgages only up to &# in the continental u s at a senate committee hearing last week federal reserve chairman ben bernanke floated the idea of expanding the governments role even further by providing guarantees against defaults on "jumbo" loans those above the &# limit on mortgages that can be backed by fannie or freddie under that suggestion fannie and freddie would package the loans into securities but the federal government would provide the guarantee sen charles schumer a new york democrat immediately said he might offer legislation allowing such guarantees theres a distinct irony in the rush to expand their role because until recently concern was widespread that fannie and freddie were too big they grew explosively in the s and first few years of the new century expanding their combined holdings of mortgages and related securities to nearly &# trillion in from &# billion in the concern was threefold their success raised fears that these quasigovernment entities were performing functions that could be handled by the private sector critics complained that they were using the low borrowing costs that result from their government link to enrich shareholders while giving short shrift to their public mission of making housing affordable for low income people and alan greenspan then chairman of the federal reserve went public several years ago with warnings that fannie and freddie had grown so large that if they ever faltered in their risk management the resulting losses could disrupt the entire financial system amid this debate freddie and fannie both stumbled each had to pay a fine to federal regulators over accounting violations involving efforts to make their earnings growth appear smoother than it was their main regulator the office of federal housing enterprise oversight has put a ceiling on their holdings of mortgages and related securities until they can finish cleaning up the mess so not everyone is rejoicing over the renewed reliance on the government sponsored entities if one of them ever got in deep financial trouble says lawrence white a professor of economics at new york university "the great likelihood is that the congress would step up" and spend taxpayers money to prop it up mr white favors taking away fannie and freddies congressional charters and letting them operate as purely private sector companies in addition to fannie and freddie the federal housing administration has recently resumed a bigger role in providing insurance against mortgage defaults its share of the market for home loans packaged into securities had fallen to less than last year but that figure is likely to rebound to more than some bankers say assuming congress passes legislation giving the agency more flexibility and the ability to insure larger loans as the government and related bodies make more loan guarantees u s taxpayers exposure to the risk of default rises so far default rates on loans backed by the three bodies appear manageable because they steered clear of most of the riskiest sorts of loans even during the boom years loans insured by the fha have performed better in recent years than subprime loans those to borrowers with no credit history or a blemished one in this years second quarter of fha loans were in foreclosure or at least days overdue compared with for subprime loans according to the mortgage bankers association to be insured by the fha loans must go to people who can document their income and plan to occupy the home theyre buying among other requirements an fha spokesman says the agency has never had a full year loss but mortgage lending is a volatile business for a brief period in the early s soaring interest rates caused fannie mae to suffer losses of about &# million a day the cleanup of the savings and loan mess of the late s when more than thrift institutions collapsed cost u s taxpayers an estimated &# billion in that bailout congress authorized government agencies to compensate people who had federally insured deposits at the failed thrifts fannie freddie and mortgage lenders are facing the challenge of deciding how much credit to extend when prices of homes the collateral backing the loans are falling in much of the country regulators and politicians are prodding fannie freddie and the fha to help subprime borrowers refinance into fixed rate loans with payments they can afford the risk is that these borrowers given their poor credit histories would run into trouble again some analysts fear fannie and freddie would need to raise additional capital if defaults soared well beyond current expectations their stocks have started to wobble though they are still holding up far better than shares of purely private sector mortgage companies fannie last week reported that its earnings in the first nine months were down from a year earlier to &# billion on the new york stock exchange fannies shares closed at &# yesterday down so far this year despite americas market system politicians have long behaved as if housing were too important to be left exposed to the full blast of market forces congress has always given overwhelming backing to the fha fannie mae and the home loan banks all created during the depression when banks were failing and mortgage credit evaporated freddie mac was created in to supplement fannies role then the post tech bubble post housing boom arrived and fannie and freddie seemed destined to recede into a smaller perhaps even marginal role wall street investment banks started dominating the lucrative business of bundling home loans into securities for sale to investors world wide total u s residential mortgage debt outstanding swelled to &# trillion at the end of nearly double the level of six years before fannie ceo daniel mudd recalls that some wondered "are these guys relevant anymore " now the debate in washington has shifted degrees "if these government related entities were not in place this mortgage default crisis would be a disaster of far greater dimensions " says susan wachter a finance professor at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school who was a senior housing official in the clinton administration and has done consulting work for freddie she notes that the companies kept money flowing into mortgages even at the height of investors panic in august fannie and freddie bring uniform standards to the mortgage securities they back making the securities easier to trade and value ms wachter says the trillions of dollars of mortgage securities that were sold without their involvement during the housing boom didnt have uniform quality and have proven illiquid because investors find it hard to assess the risks doug duncan chief economist at the mortgage bankers association says the market for these "nonagency" mortgage securities eventually will recover but only once investors feel they have better information about what kind of loans back the securities long after the current mortgage crisis is over fannie and freddie are likely to keep reminding congress of the turmoil of mid when other investors retreated but the two government sponsored companies kept buying mortgages freddie recently posted on its web site a note entitled "shelter in a storm " declaring "even when other lenders stop lending we continue to provide a steady source of home funding " alex pollock a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute agrees government linked entities can help markets through a panic but believes they shouldnt dominate the home loan business in other times the trick is to withdraw the government support when its no longer needed and let the free market take over again says mr pollock a former chief executive of the federal home loan bank of chicago damian paletta contributed to this article see
