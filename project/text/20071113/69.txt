call to discuss the funds potential exposure to losses in siv holdings both funds are managed for sei by columbia management the money management arm of bank of america corp other mutual funds including some from sti classic funds from suntrust banks inc have run plans by the securities and exchange commission on how to handle siv related holdings in their own portfolios triggering the latest concern are securities from a siv named cheyne finance llc which were downgraded to default status last month by standard &amp poors corp after going into receivership while it is highly unlikely that such mutual funds are at risk of significant losses their rapid response to one troubled siv signals the level of concern over holdings like these one reason money market funds are scrambling s&amp p has said in recent weeks that such exposure to cheyne isnt consistent with its criteria for receiving its highest ratings for money market funds money market funds are restricted from investing in low grade securities so when any of their holdings become ineligible for purchase it raises concerns among investors and regulators that any losses on those riskier holdings could

commercial paper in their money market funds in their latest quarterly earnings s&amp p has talked to a "handful" of fund companies that hold cheyne backed debt according to s&amp p analyst peter rizzo according to a person familiar with the matter some fund companies are approaching sec regulators to float plans on how to handle troubled siv issued paper in their money market funds in some cases regulators are offering oral consent on such plans given the need for rapid handling of the investments in light of recent downgrades this person says sti classic funds wrote a letter to the sec late last month regarding a plan for its roughly &# billion sti classic prime quality money market fund and &# billion sti classic institutional cash management fund the two funds had invested in notes issued by cheyne to "fully protect the funds" if cheyne failed to pay principal and credit due under the notes a plan was developed for suntrust banks the parent of the funds adviser to provide "an irrevocable standby letter of credit " according to the letter a suntrust spokesman said such steps were "appropriate given recent market developments " the sec responded with a so called no action letter in effect saying that the plan as outlined wouldnt warrant an enforcement action the sec also sent a similar no action letter to sei regarding its own plan the only time a money market fund previously "broke the buck" was in after a fund had losses in investments tied to interest rate movements the current turmoil suggests that " is beginning to rival s derivative crisis as the most dangerous event" in money funds history says this months money fund intelligence an industry newsletter about of prime money market mutual fund assets have siv related investments according to estimates last week from bank of america analyst michael hecht a key challenge for the funds in recent months has been pricing siv issued commercial paper given tight trading conditions and diminished

some of these funds it "could have a ratings implication " says moodys managing director gus harris according to a filing on oct s&amp p told sei that it would consider downgrading any aaa rated money market funds the highest rating the company provides if that fund owned securities issued by cheyne unless the funds are backed by a guarantee equal to of the amount of cheyne securities held in a

indicated in a conference call yesterday that columbia had valued cheynes debt at a price that was north of of its cost sei said it was too early to tell what if any cost the firm would ultimately have to bear sei noted that moodys meanwhile has taken a different approach moodys said it would allow sei to guarantee against losses equal to of the funds cheyne holdings because the underlying
