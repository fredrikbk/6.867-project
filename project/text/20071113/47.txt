eyes on the road tis the season not to discount maybe you dont feel it just yet but it is that magical time of year when kids of all ages dare to dream the leaders of big car companies have visions dancing in their heads too but not of sugarplums they are dreaming of higher prices sales are sluggish and consumers are worried about the impact of high energy prices on their bank accounts or their businesses but strangely enough the auto industry sees this as a good time to try to end a multiyear slide in real prices adjusted for inflation and new equipment what detroit and rivals in tokyo and frankfurt want to do is persuade consumers that the sticker price is the price or at least closer to a fair price than in the recent past surprisingly the auto companies appear to be having some success at least in the short run after years of declines new vehicle prices have been flattening out since december said ford motor co chief economist ellen hughes cromwick eight of the nine biggest car makers in the u s market managed to push up their average transaction prices for vehicles during the third quarter from the same period a year ago the power information network reported in its pin insights newsletter friday both general motors corp and ford reported losses last week in their north american auto businesses but the losses would have been far worse if the two companies hadnt succeeded in pushing up prices largely by reining in discounts for most of this decade detroits auto makers did a poor job of balancing production with actual consumer demand the reasons are many and resulted in endless rounds of distressed merchandise discounting there is a reason why industry executives talk about discounts using the language of addiction as in "we have to get off incentives " as with booze or cigarettes it sometimes takes a crisis to persuade the addict that change will be less painful than muddling through on the sauce in detroits case the crisis came with financial losses that among the big three total more than &# billion since there also is the downward spiral in market share but equally bad is the dwindling share of mind detroit brands have among influential and affluent consumers when your vehicles are synonymous with rental cars you are in a bad place now that a new uaw contract makes it less costly to idle assembly lines the detroit companies are curbing production and whittling down the volume of vehicles they sell at big discounts to rental car fleets there are signs the discipline and some improved designs are paying off gms cadillac division has just days supply of its new cts model a direct competitor of the bmw series gm has just days worth of its buick enclave crossovers to sell and gm is offering almost nothing in the way of discounts as a result ford doesnt have anything quite as hot as the enclave but the company is managing to stabilize and even raise prices for its midsize fusion according to data from the power information network ford is limiting bulk sales to fleets which sacrifices market share in favor of bolstering resale values for new cars sold to consumers what all this means for consumers is that the game of cat and mouse between manufacturers and shoppers could get more challenging if what you want is a big rebate or a no interest loan december is traditionally a good month for deals on luxury models and leftovers from last year the wild card is how much the soaring value of the euro against the dollar will damp the holiday spirit at the german brands even if you hate lexus you should thank them for keeping your bmw more affordable
