sell the petroleum reserve for quite a while now the spot price of oil that is the price at which you can buy or sell oil for delivery today has been well above the futures price the futures price is the price at which you can buy or sell oil for delivery at a specified time in the future for example on friday nov the price on the new york mercantile exchange of light sweet crude oil for december delivery was &# a barrel and the futures price for delivery in december was &# &# a barrel lower this relatively unusual time structure of oil prices is called "backwardation " the more normal pattern of oil prices is the reverse in which the spot price now is below the futures price by an amount that is just enough to cover interest insurance and storage if the difference were any more than that arbitrageurs would quickly bring the difference down by buying on the spot market and simultaneously selling in the futures market competition among arbitrageurs assures this result its too bad that we cant reverse arbitrage buying oil from the future and selling it today because by definition oil in the future is not available today or can we you cant i cant and oil companies cant but there is one entity that in a sense can reverse arbitrage that entity is the u s government why because the u s government is sitting on a large reserve of oil the strategic petroleum reserve spr which now holds about million barrels of oil this is enough oil to provide about of daily u s oil consumption for a year and if the u s government got smart about selling the oil a big if it would make money for the treasury and help consumers by bringing oil prices down moreover the government could make even more money with minimal risk to the economy by selling the spr oil altogether imagine for example that the u s government began today to sell two million barrels a day and make up for the loss by buying today the same amount in the december futures market at &# if it earned the spot price of &# on each barrel and had a &# per barrel transactions cost it would make &# a barrel the government would make daily profits of &# million if the differential in prices persisted the feds would make &# billion a year this is chicken feed to the federal government but it would allow the feds to cut some tax that yields &# billion if the hated alternative minimum tax is not reformed this calendar year for example it will capture about million new victims reverse arbitrage would give these new victims an average relief of &# of course if the government did sell two million barrels a day that would bring down the world price of oil so the u s government would not benefit as much as i have estimated but americans as a whole would benefit we import approximately million barrels of our million barrel a day consumption a two million barrel per day increase in the world oil supply on top of the current world supply of million barrels is a increase assuming as seems reasonable a highly inelastic world demand for oil of about this increase would bring oil prices down by or about &# a barrel essentially wiping out the backwardation in oil prices and wiping out the gain to the u s treasury while oil producers would lose &# a barrel oil consumers would gain &# a barrel but it would not be a wash for americans because the loss to u s oil producers would be only on their production which is only of u s consumption so the net gain to the u s from a &# per barrel price drop would be &# million a day million of imports at &# a barrel less or &# billion a year now thats real money spr oil has been sold before in when the spot price exceeded the futures price the clinton administration sold oil from the spr much too little but still a step in the right direction theres an even more radical step the u s government should take that would benefit consumers also while benefiting the government the government should sell the spr oil and not replace it if the government made even &# a barrel on its million barrels it would make &# billion which is serious money even to the feds many will argue that selling the reserve is a bad idea because then we would be unprotected from the vagaries of world oil markets this is false speculators who anticipate future shortfalls would act in oil markets the way they do in wheat markets buying oil in anticipation of higher future prices this would dampen future price increases in oil markets doing a big favor for future consumers thats better than the federal government does which even as you read this is stupidly buying &# oil to fill the spr mr henderson is a research fellow with the hoover institution and an economics professor at the naval postgraduate school in monterey calif his latest book is "making great decisions in business and life" chicago park press
