energy african nations pin power hopes on nuclear energy western interests help spur the push to develop plants cape town south africa africa gripped in a power squeeze is considering nuclear power as a solution western nations and companies interested in the continents resources and market potential are offering to help africas early stage nuclear efforts face hurdles including doubts that the needed money will materialize they also come amid concerns over the availability of nuclear equipment and know how in frequently unstable nations throughout the world a consortium that includes the south african government and the westinghouse electric co unit of japans toshiba corp is investing &# billion in a new type of nuclear power plant that proponents said will lead to cheaper plants down the road south africa which accounts for of africas total electricity generation and runs a grid system that also supplies neighbors such as namibia botswana and zimbabwe plans to spend &# billion to upgrade its power sector including spending on at least five new large scale nuclear reactors south africa home to of the worlds recoverable uranium reserves also has revealed plans to enrich and export uranium fuel "it would be very strange for any country of south africas uranium capacity and weve done enrichment before not to beneficiate its uranium deposits " south african minister of public enterprises alec erwin said in an interview though he stressed the country would strictly comply with the rules of the international atomic energy agency the worlds nuclear watchdog the developments coincide with growing interest from african countries home to about of the worlds recoverable uranium deposits in developing their own nuclear energy programs the leaders of nigeria senegal uganda and egypt have all this year expressed a desire to develop nuclear power programs either to meet power deficits or to diversify their countries energy sources africa was the second largest recipient of funds from the iaea for nuclear energy capacity building last year after europe receiving &# africas uranium offers a draw for western companies willing to help nations build their nuclear capabilities french president nicolas sarkozy has offered to sell a nuclear reactor to libya to desalinate sea water and build up moroccos civilian nuclear energy industry during recent visits connected to the visit french nuclear reactor maker areva sa signed a uranium extraction deal with a moroccan conglomerate and is helping libya to explore for uranium russia which has been seeking to find markets for its nuclear technology and expand uranium mining resources has proposed helping namibia a major uranium producer develop a domestic nuclear industry tunisia has said it aims to build its first nuclear power reactor by meanwhile burundi the republic of congo and cape verde are the latest african countries to gain approval for membership in the iaea and guinea is seeking to discuss the possibility of developing a nuclear power industry with the u n affiliated nuclear watchdog africas electricity demand is expected to increase at an average annual rate of more than doubling between now and according to the international energy agency the energy watchdog group for the worlds industrialized countries sub saharan africa requires &# billion in investment in its electricity sector in the next years according to jeannot boussougouth an analyst with frost &amp sullivan consulting and research company africa accounts for about of the globes total energy consumption not for a lack of demand but because increasingly there isnt enough electricity to go around underinvestment in energy is reducing economic growth in some countries by as much as annually the world bank said in a report on investment for clean energy and development nuclear power requires considerable upfront capital and vast technical skills the iea projects african nuclear power to rise to terawatt hours in from in but would still account for a slim percentage of africas energy said hans holger rogner head of the iaeas planning and economic studies section for nuclear energy "a potential nuclear renaissance has begun in peoples minds but it hasnt reached the wallet yet " safety also is a rising concern critics point out it doesnt take much to fashion a crude "dirty bomb" once even trace amounts of radioactive fuel become more widely available "nuclear power is a long term commitment a political and economic commitment you cant just switch it on or off " mr rogner said the u s in principle supports south africas effort to become a nuclear fuel provider and sees promise in its new reactor said u s assistant secretary for nuclear energy dennis spurgeon its efforts highlight washingtons calls for an international agreement to limit enrichment and reprocessing technologies to a select group of nations in return for help in developing nuclear power elsewhere he said he added the u s expects south africa which has been plagued by rolling blackouts plans to add megawatts of capacity in the next years and half of that is expected to come from nuclear power plants south africas state owned power utility eskom holdings ltd at present has two aging nuclear generators the only such commercial facilities in africa much of south africas effort is focused on a tiny low cost reactor being developed on the coastline just north of cape town the design has drawn the attention of the u s department of energy which has awarded a &# million grant to study its potential in other areas mr spurgeon said the technology is one of a dozen designs being considered by a &# million u s initiative that aims to bring small scale nuclear reactors to developing countries the technology is being developed by pebble bed modular reactor ltd which is owned by westinghouse and the remainder by the south african government and state owned eskom it uses thousands of tennis ball size graphite spheres that inside contain a uranium kernel only a little larger than a grain of salt developers said those layers can keep the fuel safe to temperatures beyond the maximum reachable in the chain reaction they also said the balls are slowly depleted of all but a minute quantity of usable uranium so trying to recover the uranium grains would be impractical proponents said the pebble bed once commercialized can be built more quickly and inexpensively in two years for about &# million others are more dubious about its prospects critics cite significant delays and a run up in costs since plans for the pilot reactor were first made in "its the concorde syndrome " said steve thomas a professor of energy policy at the university of greenwich in the united kingdom referring to the supersonic passenger jet "the government invests a lot of prestige in a project and its very difficult to give it up when its clear its not going to work "
