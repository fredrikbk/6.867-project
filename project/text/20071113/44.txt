econ one on one a market for kidneys online edition the wall street journal online u s federal law has long banned any compensation for human organs but with the demand for kidney transplants far outstripping the number of donors some economists are urging the adoption of market based innovations to increase supply one of these is the university of buffalos julio elias who argues that distasteful or not monetary incentives are the most efficient way to boost the number of organs available for transplant and should be introduced on the other side harvard universitys alvin roth argues that cultural mores repugnance preclude buying and selling of organs instead he says alternative arrangements such as so called organ exchanges might be a better solution what do you think join the discussion in our online reader forum julio elias writes the only feasible way to eliminate the large queues in the market for kidney transplants is by significantly increasing the supply of kidneys the introduction of monetary incentives could increase the supply of organs sufficiently to eliminate the large queues and it would do so without increasing the total cost of kidney transplant surgery by a large percent as gary becker and i show in a paper on the potential of markets for organs even though the benefits of eliminating the organ shortage are significant many people have opposed proposals to pay for organs a practice prohibited under present law in almost every country some critics argue that payment is "immoral" because it involves the "commodification" of body parts or that the poor will be "coerced " others are opposed because they simply do not like the idea of the existence of a market for organs however conclusions about the morality of using prices to encourage supply or ration demand have changed in the past when they were shown to be effective one example is a carbon tax to cut pollution another is the use of willingness to pay to reduce the risk of death to measure the statistical value of life attitudes about using prices to help eliminate the shortage of organs would also change i am confident when it is shown how efficiently prices would solve this problem alvin roth writes selling organs is illegal in most countries legalizing kidney sales faces substantial perhaps insuperable obstacles just as you cant sell yourself into indentured servitude anymore some transactions are illegal because enough people find them repugnant but many people are in urgent need of kidney transplants so its helpful to think about steps to relieve the shortage now kidneys for transplantation come from either deceased or living donors a healthy person has two kidneys and can remain healthy with one some ways to increase the number of deceased donor kidneys include changing how donations are solicited e g introducing opt out rather than opt in donor decisions changing when kidneys are "harvested" after heart death as well as brain death and changing which organs are selected e g older patients might profit from organs from donors older than are now considered there would be more live donor transplants if everyone who wanted to donate a kidney to someone could do so but a healthy persons kidney is often incompatible with his or her intended donor so one way economists have helped is in helping organize kidney exchanges which allow incompatible patient donor pairs to exchange with other such pairs ill talk more about this work with my economist colleagues tayfun soenmez and m utku unver and many medical colleagues in my next post julio elias writes in an attempt to increase cadaveric organ donations some nations have tried to overcome the objections of heirs by enacting into law the principle of "implied consent " however even with the capture of all potential deceased donor organs the gap will not be closed most organ procurements efforts in the u s have been concentrated on increasing the pool of altruistic donors such as expanding living donor inclusion criteria and organ donor awareness campaigns however all these efforts have failed to increase the pool of donors significantly to alleviate the growing shortage of kidneys and prevent large numbers of people from dying while waiting for a transplant i agree with al many people will be horrified by any proposal that allows for monetary compensations for organs and this represents a cost to society but this does not mean that these costs overwhelm the benefits of eliminating the organ shortage to my knowledge there are no good estimates of these "repugnancy costs " even so i believe they are relatively small when weighted against the number of lives that can be saved this is a strong force that will push towards a market based system alvin roth writes i agree with julio that there probably arent enough potential deceased donors to supply all needed kidneys there are already more live donors than deceased donors in the u s kidney exchange is a way to increase live donor transplants a chain could start with a prospective donor who decides to donate a kidney to a specific patient say a friend or a relative but cant because his or her organ isnt a good match instead an altruistic donor whose kidney matches the first patient donates then the prospective donor from the first pair follows through with their donation plans offering a kidney to someone on a donor waiting list or to another patient who has found a would be donor without a good match the donor from the second pair in turn donates to someone else on the waiting list or yet another donor patient pair without a match and so on chains can be more flexible too for instance allowing a patient donor pair without a match to donate to another patient donor pair in a similar situation the second pair in turn donates to someone on the waiting list in this case the patient from the original pair would receive priority for the next suitable donor kidney before in just a few cases an incompatible patient donor pair and their surgeon were able to locate another such pair and arrange an exchange in which the donor in each pair could give a kidney to the patient in the other in unver soenmez and i published an article exploring how a centralized kidney exchange could permit transplantation of many more kidneys in subsequent work we discovered that when the market is thick enough when a large number of patient donor pairs has been assembled almost all feasible transplants can be accomplished through exchanges among just two or three patient donor pairs at a time and through chains of exchange weve helped surgeons frank delmonico and mike rees organize regional kidney exchanges nepke and apd which now unite dozens of transplant centers and there is movement towards a national exchange dr bob montgomery in baltimore and steve woodle in ohio and their colleagues have also been pioneers some description and history are here read more about paired donations in a recent wall street journal article julio elias writes the current system of live organ transplants resembles an autarkic economy in which patients in need of an organ transplant are constrained to the organs available in the pool of friends and relatives the kidney exchange system developed by al and others is a barter system and clearly will provide an improvement over the current system but a general conclusion of economics is that barter is an inferior system when compared to a money system since barter requires the coincidence of wants with the use of computers and a national registry multilateral barter is a good possibility but still less efficient than using general purchasing power i e a market the main disadvantages of the kidney exchange system are the limitations that only kidneys from relatives and friends can be used and that the exchange must happen at the same time a market based exchange does not have such serious limitations alvin roth writes no economist could disagree with julio that in general unrestricted monetary markets have enormous ability to meet human wants as he points out with kidney exchange were trying to achieve many of the benefits of a market without using money were able to make progress because kidney exchange thus avoids the repugnance that kidney sales arouse were slowly relaxing some constraints like the simultaneity of all transplants in every exchange the alliance for paired donation has recently begun a "never ending" altruistic donor chain that is still going on as market designers my colleagues and i are often faced with constraints we have helped design non monetary but market like allocation procedures that assign children to schools in nyc and boston and operate similarly to labor market clearinghouses weve helped design for new doctors and older ones sometimes constraints can be removed sometimes it looks more promising to work around them if julio and his colleagues want to remove the legal constraint on buying kidneys my guess is that they will want to understand better the sources of repugnance that have led to laws against such sales in so many countries julio elias writes the potential benefits of a market system may have seemed low compared to the costs of implementing a new system when the legal constraints were implemented since the shortage was not so severe currently the kidney waiting list is over persons and in the last years it has grown at an annual rate of additionally improvements in the safety and effectiveness in kidney transplantation have significantly increased the potential benefits programs of financial compensation for living organ donors can take many forms however there are certain features that are likely to be common across any compensation system of organ procurement more importantly many of those features are in effect in the current system like the role of the physician and transplant centers in the proper screening and selection of donors in post transplant care and in other steps of the process of organ procurement a national registry of potential donors is also likely to be assembled with all the relevant information of potential and excluded donors in a decentralized system the price of a kidney would be set at the levels that would eliminate the excess demand building on the value of life literature with gary becker we estimate that the price for a kidney would be about &# the present system imposes an intolerable burden on many very ill individuals some of whom will die while waiting for a donor it is time to reconsider the law alvin roth writes it is illegal to sell horsemeat for human consumption in california not because a persuasive case was made that the costs exceed the benefits but because people voted to make it illegal in a referendum this and many other examples persuade me there is something about repugnance that we economists need to understand whenever i help design a market i learn a lot from existing practices even as i set out to modify them explaining what economists already know doesnt inevitably win the day although such explanations are certainly useful so it doesnt seem to me inevitable that julio and his colleagues arguments will lead surely or soon to a change in the laws banning kidney sales and if kidney sales remain banned for a long time other developments such as cures for kidney diseases or breakthroughs in using pig kidneys for transplantation may arrive in time to make kidney sales and human transplants themselves unnecessary this is one reason i have been putting my energy into developing kidney exchange its a way to combine economics with surgical know how to achieve real gains soon ill be glad if something even better eventually becomes possible its good to attack big problems from all angles thanks julio for the discussion should the u s allow people to sell their kidneys vote and share your views in
