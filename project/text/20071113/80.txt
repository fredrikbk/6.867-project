movin on up if youve been listening to mike huckabee or john edwards on the presidential trail you may have heard that the u s is becoming a nation of rising inequality and shrinking opportunity wed refer those campaigns to a new study of income mobility by the treasury department that exposes those claims as so much populist hokum ok "hokum" is our word the study to be released today is a careful detailed piece of research by professional economists that avoids political judgments but what it does do is show beyond doubt that the u s remains a dynamic society marked by rapid and mostly upward income mobility much as they always have americans on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder continue to climb into the middle and sometimes upper classes in remarkably short periods of time the treasury study examined a huge sample of income tax returns from and for americans over the age of the study tracks what happened to these tax filers over this year period one of the notable and reassuring findings is that nearly of filers who were in the poorest income group in had moved into a higher income category by nearly jumped into the middle or upper middle income groups and made it all the way to the highest quintile of those in the second lowest income quintile nearly moved into the middle quintile or higher and only moved down this is a stunning show of upward mobility meaning that more than half of all lower income americans in had moved up the income scale in only years also encouraging is the fact that the after inflation median income of all tax filers increased by an impressive over the same period two of every three workers had a real income gain which contradicts the huckabee edwards lou dobbs spin about stagnant incomes this is even more impressive when you consider that "median" income and wage numbers are often skewed downward because the u s has had a huge influx of young workers and immigrants in the last years they start their work years with low wages dragging down the averages those who start at the bottom but hold full time jobs nonetheless enjoyed steady income gains the treasury study found that those tax filers who were in the poorest income quintile in saw a near doubling of their incomes over the subsequent decade those in the highest quintile on the other hand saw only modest income gains the nearby table tells the story which is that the poorer an individual or household was in the greater the percentage income gain after years only one income group experienced an absolute decline in real income the richest in those households lost of their income moreover more than half of the richest in had dropped to a lower income group by some of these people might have been "rich" merely for one year or perhaps for several as they hit their peak earning years or had some capital gains windfall others may simply have not been able to keep up with new entrepreneurs and wealth creators the key point is that the study shows that income mobility in the u s works down as well as up another sign that opportunity and merit continue to drive american success not accidents of birth the "rich" are not the same people over time the study is also valuable because it shows that income mobility remains little changed from what similar studies found in the s and s some journalists and academics have cited selective evidence to claim that income mobility has declined in recent years but the of lowest income earners who moved to a higher income quintile in this study is roughly comparable to the percentages that did so in several similar studies going back to the late s "the basic finding of this analysis " says the treasury report "is that relative income mobility is approximately the same in the last years as it was in the previous decade " all of this certainly helps to illuminate the current election year debate about income "inequality" in the u s the political left and its media echoes are promoting the inequality story as a way to justify a huge tax increase but inequality is only a problem if it reflects stagnant opportunity and a society stratified by more or less permanent income differences that kind of society can breed class resentments and unrest america isnt remotely such a society thanks in large part to the incentives that exist for risk taking and wealth creation the great irony is that in the name of reducing inequality some of our politicians want to raise taxes and other government obstacles to the kind of risk taking and hard work that allow americans to climb the income ladder so rapidly as the treasury data show we shouldnt worry about inequality we should worry about the people who use inequality as a political club to promote policies that reduce opportunity
