managers struggle to locate cheap stocks bargains arent easy to find in the stock market these days with prices surging upward just last week the standard &amp poors stock index came close to topping its record closing level of seven years ago the dow jones industrial average has set numerous records this year and the technology heavy nasdaq composite index has been at its highest levels in six years the advances have made things tough for "value" mutual fund managers who look to grab stocks on the cheap "its very difficult to find truly bargain priced issues in the large cap u s markets " says ty nutt a senior portfolio manager and leader of the large cap value team at delaware investments in philadelphia still most value managers are managing to keep their cash busy while its hard for them to find stocks they consider "deep value " or trading deeply below the value of their assets or operations they say there are "relative values" to be found meaning stocks that appear cheap relative to the overall universe of stocks heres a look at what theyve been finding mr nutt says that with no "screamingly inexpensive sector " the value hunt is more of a "bottom up" stock by stock search than its been in years among the stocks he considers "great relative value" are semiconductor maker intel intc which he purchased last year and global communications company motorola mot which he bought in march intel is financially strong with low debt relative to its capital mr nutt notes at motorola price competition battered profit margins of the firms popular razr cellphones clobbering the stock but mr nutt is betting on "an intermediate to longer term recovery" in that core handset business some stock market sectors traditionally seen as value fare because of their relatively slow growth are now trading at fairly expensive price earnings ratios says jeff tjornehoj senior research analyst at research firm lipper "were finding energy sector stocks with higher p es and its similar with utilities and anything related to natural resources " he says in this environment lord abbett americas value fund based in jersey city n j has about of its assets in at&amp t t the communications firms long term growth rate is better than that of most utilities says fund co manager edward k von der linde at&amp t is trading at about times expected earnings while the dividend is at he says in contrast many electric utilities have multiples in the high teens and have dividend yields well below he says some value managers are buying technology stocks and other shares that traditionally would have been seen as fare for "growth" managers who emphasize fast expanding businesses "were looking for companies that are cheap currently on a price to forward earnings basis " that is based on earnings the company is expected to generate in the next three to five years says adriana posada who oversees the multiple sub advisors of american beacon large cap value fund "if you define value that way you might run into some traditional growth stocks that are cheap enough right now " the fund based in fort worth texas has more exposure than it usually does to technology one holding is software giant microsoft msft trading at an estimated eight to times forward earnings while the s&amp p is at about times to times although the american beacon fund doesnt have a large overall exposure to energy its single largest holding is conocophillips cop thats the cheapest of the oil companies and the most diversified in terms of business lines and geography and it also pays a good yield ms posada says the funds largest sector exposure is to financials and insurer american international group aig is among its top holdings curtis jensen co chief investment officer of third avenue management in new york says he is managing to find value in industries others hate "i suppose you could say our friends today are pessimism scorn and adversity " he says the key is finding companies that are well financed and have staying power and also being willing to be more patient than other investors mr jensen says he says one example of a "well hated industry" is the paper and forest products industry particularly in canada the strong canadian dollar and high fiber and energy costs have decimated the industry and prompted what he expects to be a period of more cost cutting and possible merger activity third avenues holdings currently include vancouver paper companies canfor cfp t and catalyst paper ctl t another unloved industry is homebuilding and related areas third avenue holds usg usg a construction materials holding company "this is probably dead money for a time " mr jensen says but has a fairly bright longer term outlook bob olstein of olstein all cap value fund in purchase n y seeks out companies which may be misunderstood by the market or have short term problems but are basically sound financially one stock he likes is apparel retailer gap gps where sales have languished and bungled efforts to turn things around have made wall street impatient the shares could reach &# a share from fridays close of &# if management "gets it right " mr olstein says for investors buying mutual funds many financial advisers suggest always holding a mix of growth oriented and value oriented funds value funds have outperformed growth funds for years now and some fund managers are now predicting a resurgence in growth stocks theres no doubt that value managers have to look harder now than they did a few years ago says mr tjornehoj of lipper "i think there are so many value managers turning over rocks on that same path that all the big ones have been flipped over and now theyre looking for smaller or less intriguing value plays than they did years ago as well theyre holding on to their winners because they have to " nevertheless investors should have exposure to the area mr tjornehoj says at some point he says the market will weaken and "the private equity or hedge funds or whoever is adding a great deal of value to the market is not going to feel that way and people are going to seek safety in firms with steady dividends and low debt on the balance sheet the typical characteristics that make a value play attractive "
