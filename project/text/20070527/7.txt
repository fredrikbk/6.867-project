options to help pay grandkids tuition this season of college graduations is a reminder to grandparents that there are many ways to help another generation afford tuition and related expenses but whats the best way to accumulate dollars for college thats what jennifer grebenschikoff and her husband david kirschman of tampa fla have been wondering their first grandchild a girl is due later this year theyve read about a popular way to put money away for college known as savings plans but arent certain its the best solution for them or how to proceed "i keep thinking how are we going to assist this grandchild to become educated " says ms grebenschikoff among the couples questions can they start putting money away for their granddaughter even before shes born where can they go for more information the good news is that theres a wealth of information and resources out there the challenge is sifting through it all it used to be that choices for college savings werent particularly palatable you could sock money away in a bank account but with the cost of a college education rising far faster than inflation the interest might not get you close to the goal there was always investing in stocks or bonds as a way to pull in bigger returns but that required a certain amount of financial savvy those routes also came with the headache of paying taxes over the years on investment income which would cut into the money available for education costs for many people the solution has been a college savings plan created by federal legislation in and named after a section of the tax code plans allow you to invest free from federal tax and usually state tax as well when the money is used for higher education expenses such as tuition books room and board fueling the popularity of plans is that nearly all come with one stop investment options known as age based funds which relieve savers of having to be experts on stock and bond investing age based funds are prepackaged mixes of stock and bond mutual funds they shift gradually over the years from aggressive stock dominated portfolios that can earn bigger returns to more conservative portfolios as it grows closer to the time that the money is needed however in a quirk that complicates matters significantly plans are state sponsored programs on the plus side most states offer special incentives for residents who invest in their home state program such as tax deductions a few now offer deductions even when you invest in another states plan but different states have different rules and offerings and for that matter most states offer more than one plan many have a version that can be purchased directly and a completely separate plan that needs to be bought through a broker as a result there are roughly plans to chose from and plans arent the only option for grandparents looking to help pay for a grandkids education for example there are coverdell education savings accounts which have a dual attraction they can be used for k education costs as well as college and they allow greater control of investment choices much like an individual retirement account but there are drawbacks to putting money in a coverdell including that many of the benefits will expire in unless extended by congress so where to go to figure all this out one place to learn more is www collegesavings org the web site of the college savings plans network this year old organization is an offshoot of a national group of state treasurers the web site provides answers to commonly asked questions links to state plans and a way to compare the different offerings but as an industry related site it wont provide you advice on which plans to choose morningstar best known for its mutual fund research makes it easy to compare plans on its web site morningstar com its analysts also rate the best and worst plans based on factors including fees and the quality of the underlying investments in the most recent survey morningstar rated plans from colorado maryland nebraska utah and virgina as having the best options search the web site for " " another comprehensive web site is savingforcollege com overseen by joe hurley an accountant who has become an expert on plans mr hurleys site provides a comprehensive plain english overview of plans as well as other choices for socking away money for college or even k education the web site also provides a section just for grandparents with a lengthy list of questions and answers it also has an active discussion board can ms grebenschikoff and her husband open an account for their grandchild before shes born technically mr hurley says accounts are supposed to be opened in the name of the person who will use the money however its a fairly common practice for grandparents or even parents to open an account in their own names and later change the beneficiary on the account mr hurley cautions however that that strategy could cause tax reporting complications because tax rules generally limit the amount of gifts that an individual can give to another person without filing a gift tax return to &# a year or &# over five years if the gift is above those amounts that doesnt automatically mean youll have to pay tax on the gift it just can mean additional work filing a return ms grebenschikoff is also debating whether to put money for her granddaughter in a regular investment account or another variation known as a prepaid tuition account offered by the state of florida in a prepaid plan rather than invest money in securities you purchase future tuition at eligible in state colleges at rates that are much lower than they will likely be in the future in that case "you are protected against any tuition increases at florida institutions " says mr hurley if the grandchild decides to go to a school outside florida that money isnt lost "youll get an increased value on money based on floridas tuitions you just have to understand the formula "
