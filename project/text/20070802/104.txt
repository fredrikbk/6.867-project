subprime detectives search in dark for next victim wall street can bury mistakes in fine print shoot first that is what investors have been doing to financial stocks lately and they have some good reasons the crisis in the subprime mortgage market for instance has led to the collapse of several hedge funds including some run by bear stearns cos at the same time stalled corporate bond deals and the collapse of hedge fund sowood capital management show cracks widening fast in the credit markets but investors in banks and brokerage houses also have been spooked by what they cant see namely potential losses that many fear have been hidden in the books of financial firms or stuffed in off balance sheet vehicles that has made it difficult for investors to gauge exactly who has lost money on subprime wagers and how much has gone up in smoke the uncertainty has hit stocks of financial houses that so far have said they dont have any major subprime problems deutsche bank ag was one of yesterdays casualties the german bank reported upbeat profit and said it wasnt exposed to the subprime crisis but investors drove its stock down more than on the frankfurt stock exchange merrill lynch &amp co has fallen about since the start of the year citigroup inc is off since january and lehman brothers holdings inc is down about the mystery of "where are the losses " has confounded hedge funds searching for opportunities to bet against banks whose day of reckoning has yet to come "weve been looking for financials that show losses from these securities on their books and theyve been very difficult to find " says keith long president of otter creek management a hedge fund in palm beach fla with &# million in assets "its very opaque " investors have long complained about the lack of transparency when it comes to huge financial firms whose balance sheets are so big that they can easily mask multimillion dollar gains or losses analysts and investors currently cite several potential factors that could help hide subprime wounds corporate executives and fund managers may still be relying on inflated values for mortgage related securities the widespread use of off balance sheet vehicles by banks and other financial institutions may also enable them to shift losses elsewhere and a menu of choices offered to companies by accounting rules allows management to decide whether to recognize certain losses or push bad news into the future some coming accounting rule changes may help investors get a clearer picture but those likely wont offer help for another year in the meantime markets are going to have to keep guessing about where losses are and how bad they could be while serious problems have yet to emerge for many larger financial players it is "likely that institutions have large embedded losses" that are so far being hidden says josh rosner managing director of graham fisher &amp co an independent research firm many securities that have taken a bath mightnt be showing up as a result of the use of "false marks " mr rosner adds in wall street parlance a mark is the current market price of a security companies valuing their holdings say they are marking them to market it is tough to get an accurate value or mark for some securities such as those issued by investment vehicles known as collateralized debt obligations these vehicles pool various debt instruments in many case mortgage backed securities underpinned by subprime loans and then sell slices that vary in terms of the risk of default there isnt an active market for many cdos and they dont have observable prices instead to value such securities companies and investment funds often rely on quotes from dealers which may be unrealistic out of date or based on their own internal investment models that often results in what is called "marking to model " a practice that can allow a firm to take an unrealistically optimistic view that overlooks potential losses some firms engage in "very aggressive marking " said otter creeks mr long "until people are forced to liquidate because of redemptions the marks will hold up " a looming accounting rule change might help though it wont formally kick in until companies file financial results for the new rule requires companies and auditors to determine how much a security would be worth if it were sold to an unrelated third party in an arms length transaction that would require a company to think about market risk which could result in a discount being applied to a securitys value when times are tough it also may force companies to look beyond a dealer "quote" and consider what actually would be a market clearing price for a security during times of market stress there can be a wide difference between a quote and a clearing price the new accounting rule wont radically change the way companies price hard to value securities but it will "require a more realistic way of choosing value and the auditors will have to enforce that " says edward ketz an accounting professor at pennsylvania state university a potentially bigger plus is that the rule will require beefed up disclosures from companies as to how they are valuing different types of instruments prof ketz says of course this mightnt help if a bank has sold risky securities into off balance sheet vehicles in theory investors shouldnt have to worry once such a sale occurs but in practice banks can still bear some risk associated with them another way companies and banks might hide losses on securities backed by risky mortgages is to classify them for accounting purposes as being "held to maturity " this effectively precludes a company or bank from selling the security but also means that it doesnt have to mark the security to market on its books instead the security stays on the books at its historical cost investors wont know if companies tried this maneuver until they file annual results for in which case they would have to disclose the amount of securities classified this way during the year prof ketz says
