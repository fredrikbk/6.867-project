mack the nice whole foods ceo john mackey is facing another barrage of organic tomatoes this week already the subject of a securities and exchange commission probe surrounding his anonymous posts about his company on a yahoo message board on tuesday he saw the federal trade commission officially begin its antitrust case against his merger with retailer wild oats a few investors are calling for his hide last week ctw investment group penned a letter to the whole foods board to demand mr mackey be replaced with someone who could smooth the waters with federal regulators mr mackey may not have broken any laws or violated his companys code of conduct the group wrote nonetheless "his poor judgment has already damaged his credibility and put his leadership in question " sure ctw acts as pension adviser and shareholder advocate to the labor union umbrella group "change to win " for years mr mackey has been a bete noire of unions for his no holds barred battles to keep them out of his stores in one of his more expansive moments he explained that "the union is like having herpes it doesnt kill you but its unpleasant and inconvenient " he even penned a position paper against letting them into whole foods stores around the country "the choice is not work for wfm on our terms or starve " he wrote "but rather work for us on the terms we offer or work for other employers on the terms they offer " unions have fought battles with whole foods all over the country and its not over one organizer wrote complaining that whole foods success "stems from commodifying progressive values for profit " trouble is whole foods does not play to type as an evil corporate adversary the store has given health care to its employees whom it calls "team members " and mandated a pay scale where no executive can be paid more than times the average wage of &# last year mr mackey reduced his own annual salary to &# and indicated he would swear off future options awards as well the question of his fate is now in the hands of a special committee of the wholefoods board which will determine just punishment for the animal spirits of a vegan zillionaire the offense of participating anonymously in message board discussions of whole foods and its prospects was admittedly eccentric behavior but suggestions that he had any potential to profit financially from his postings are hard to take seriously information on chat boards is considered inherently untrustworthy by anyone who reads them especially because so much is posted anonymously the whole foods board would do well to follow the example set by apple last year after ceo steve jobs was accused of backdating stock options and improperly accounting for them apples stock price was briefly destabilized by the possibility that mr jobs on whom his companys success is believed to disproportionately depend might be fired and even prosecuted but while some wanted to flay mr jobs for the transgression the board including former vice president al gore produced a report that acknowledged the problems with backdating but basically gave mr jobs a pass the market understood exactly what they were doing saving apples primary asset whole foods finds itself in a similar situation the stock price has been jittery of late thanks to the twin shadows of the ftc and sec but removing mr mackey over his extracurricular interest in chat boards would be unlikely to reassure anyone the market may not view mr mackey as quite as iconic to whole foods as mr jobs is to apple but hes still the heart and soul of the company having founded it and built it from nothing since his college days and his role has arguably become even more important since the regulatory troubles began when the ftc began making noises mr mackey posted a word rebuttal to the antitrust charges on the whole foods web site the kind of vigorous defense that crusading regulators face far too rarely the case that began this week is a fools errand together whole foods and wild oats only make up of the organic food market and every supermarket chain in suburbia is redecorating and restocking to compete the legions of customers who flood whole foods around the country shopped somewhere else at some point and it probably wasnt the local provider of echinacea and wheatgrass this is how mr mackey intended it when he started his first organic grocery and called it "saferway " to present an alternative to the better known mainstream grocery preserving the slightly off kilter zeal that built the company is precisely what shareholders should expect from a board acting in their best interests the current troubles at whole foods are best seen as an example of how regulators market "safeguards" often benefit neither shareholders nor consumers but do make work for legions of year old federal lawyers john mackey once noted that whole foods rising stock price was a result of the fact that he put customers first and shareholders second thereby delivering the best value to both preserving that model is certainly now the top priority of the whole foods board of directors and the best way they can protect it is to protect mr mackeys job after all he works
