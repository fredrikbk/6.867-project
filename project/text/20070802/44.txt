have private equity etfs soured a private equity etf seemed like such a good idea last year the powershares listed private equity etf which invests in stocks of private equity companies won plaudits when it was launched in october the exchange traded fund received lavish coverage in major business outlets and etf related web sites as a way for small investors to bet on private equity the new etf helped powershares win recent industry honors for product innovation the private equity etf started off strong despite some bumps during a rocky stock market in february the fund was up more than from its inception through the first week of june according to factset research but today with credit markets in turmoil and the market for leveraged buyouts drying up investors have lost their reason to cheer through july the private equity etf has tumbled since june according to morningstar inc investors who bought the fund the day it launched would essentially have broken even through july although the private equity etfs fortunes could still turn around it is looking increasingly like an example of how investors susceptible to fund company and media hype invest in hot but narrowly focused etfs at their peril some other new and high profile etfs have had poor returns lately the spdr dj wilshire international real estate etf which hit the market in december has declined in the past three months according to morningstar powershares lux nanotech etf which hit the market in late is down in that period powershares says the private equity fund through diversification has probably cushioned the blow for many investors "i have trouble going along with the notion that the etf created additional risk for anyone " says powershares chief executive bruce bond recent initial public offerings by private equity firms like blackstone group lp and fortress investment group llc got plenty of hype and raised far more money than the powershares etf mr bond says buying the private equity etf could be less risky than investing in any single company he says shares of both blackstone and fortress have declined more dramatically than the powershares fund moreover the powershares fund owns a range of stocks besides those that would be considered purely private equity such as business development companies american capital strategies ltd and apollo investment corp business development companies are specially chartered management companies that buy stakes and loan money to small and middle sized businesses exchange traded funds resemble index oriented mutual funds but trade on an exchange like a stock etfs were a remote corner of the investment world just a few years ago but there are now more than etfs with &# billion plus in assets with etfs in some cases several already replicating broad stock market indexes the industry has sought to grow by offering investments in areas that are sometimes difficult for retail investors to access such as commodities emerging markets and private equity still many consider this recent trend risky for investors narrowly focused etfs are more volatile than broad market indexes in both rising and falling markets they also tend to reflect the hottest investment ideas of the moment raising the prospect that recently launched funds will beckon investors into market strategies that have all but run their course
