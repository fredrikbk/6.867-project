ways to teach your children to find the work they love i like to think i can talk to my two teenagers about anything but one topic at our house leaves me feeling as if were shouting from separate mountaintops picking a career although im glad my son and my daughter are thinking about jobs their deliberations hold none of the curiosity or sense of exploration that i recall feeling at their age instead they seem rushed and grim my daughter is anxious about building the right resume to get into med school and my son talks mostly about finding any job that will enable him to support a family my career path was no model if anyone bothered to draw it it would look more like an etch a sketch doodle than the no exit superhighway my kids seem to envision but i do recall choosing my lifes work with a sense of adventure that seems to be missing in them blame it on career anxiety college counselors say for a variety of reasons many young adults are more anxious about career preparation than previous generations not all young adults share this of course many parents wish their kids had a little more career anxiety to propel them out of the house in my family however the evidence suggests i need some new parenting strategies the apprehension often begins with the college admissions race after striving to win acceptance to competitive colleges many think they should have "an equally strategic approach to their post graduate plans " says karen levin coburn assistant vice chancellor at washington university of st louis job competition looms earlier employers place far more emphasis on internships than in the past says the national association of colleges and employers bethlehem pa of new college hires have completed at least one based on its survey of employers campus competition for internships is starting as early as freshman year and the entry bar has risen in many professions architects for example need a formal internship today and must pass a more comprehensive exam to be licensed compared with years ago even auto mechanics who used to train on the job often need a two year degree such rigor leaves less room for career flip flops of the kind i did between ages and i set out at various times to be a teacher an editor for a publishing house a horse trainer and a long distance trucker seriously i still remember the look on the loan officers face when i offered him my vw beetle as collateral for a loan on an wheeler after a couple of aimless years working different jobs i entered journalism grad school intending to teach writing it was there that a professors inspiring lecture about the principles that underlie good journalism public service integrity and truthfulness won my heart decades later though ive managed to pass on to my kids only the conventional wisdom attend career fairs do volunteer work and so on the result is what jaye roseborough executive director career services for middlebury college in vermont calls the "doctor lawyer teacher banker syndrome" students try to fit themselves into one of a series of career choices as defined by others rather than using their interests to guide them in exploring the outer world how to recoup "talk about whats of interest to them and how important it is to be happy in what you do " dr roseborough advises ask how they envision spending their time the activities required by a job "must be a way you really like to behave " she adds what kind of problems do they like to solve explain that many people change careers multiple times and tell stories about how you fell in love with your own work so at my house at least im shelving the experts lists of the hottest careers and the best ways for teens to spend the summer instead ill encourage my daughter not to foreclose on exploring her love of design and her interest in business before settling on any profession even one as worthy as medicine for my son ill stress that finding work you love can benefit your family too perhaps ill tell a few old stories about my own missteps come to think of it this could be fun email sue shellenbarger wsj com the journey when talking about career choices be sure to stress to kids start with your interests and values changing your mind is ok work should be enjoyable at least sometimes exposure to various kinds of workplaces can help
