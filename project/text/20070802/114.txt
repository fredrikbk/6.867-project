of stores tweeter home entertainment group inc sought bankruptcy protection and best buy and circuit city stores sacrificed profit margins to keep up with wal marts price slashing on the defensive best buys chief executive brad anderson told investors in april that best buy would win more customers by offering a wide selection and matching customers with products that best fit their needs contrasting its approach with competitors selling a few hot products such as flat panel tv sets to as many customers as possible "its a stark difference in whom we serve and how we serve them " mr anderson said he didnt specifically name wal mart in his comments wal mart signaled its intent to play hardball the day after last thanksgiving when it offered customers a panasonic high definition tv for less than &# forcing competitors to scramble to match the sharp discount this was a more significant step than the ballyhooed &# dvd players of yesteryear because it marked a new three digit level

sales to grow about this year from &# billion last year wal mart says it will abstain from stocking the highest end electronics in most supercenters such as inch tvs preferring to offer items requiring as little setup and installation as possible and pricing them lower than specialty stores do "were not trying to tech it up " says gary severson wal marts senior vice president of entertainment wal mart wants to concentrate on what they see as the bulk of electronics buyers "they want it to be fun cool and functional " he said along with price the company is stressing convenience and selection in remodeling the electronics sections in hundreds of its stores wal mart built wide tv walls adorned with rows of flat panel tvs to alert customers to necessary add ons the displays also include tv mounts and cables for transmitting high definition signals wal mart added signs throughout the department outlining three step instructions for choosing the correct model and size tv and ordering a high definition signal but the centerpiece of wal marts strategy is adding trusted brand names wal mart two years ago targeted six brands that it wanted on its shelves so far it has added five toshiba corp laptops dell inc computers apple inc ipods verizon communications inc wireless phones and samsung tvs mr severson declined to identify the sixth brand he still covets the changes have caught the attention of shoppers such as juan rodriguez a year old federal prosecutor in dallas who has purchased electronics from wal mart and circuit city in the past year even though he believes that wal mart cant match the variety of a consumer electronics big box "i think their selection is good " mr rodriguez says technical assistance remains an issue both best buy and circuit city offer delivery and installation services and both have tech support services geek squad at best buy and firedog at circuit city that will come to a customers home to troubleshoot and fix problems other than an experiment wal marts sams club division is conducting with delivery and installation wal marts involvement in an electronics sale largely ends at its front door wal mart workers dont normally engage in the hand holding often sought by purchasers of high end electronics the retailer has begun basic in store training for employees in some markets wal mart managers instruct some salespeople in the walk method welcome customers ask questions learn their needs and know when to close the sale wal mart also has recruited help from outside experimenting in a few dozen stores with experts from anderson merchandising a firm that distributes most of wal marts cds and dvds to answer customers questions about high definition tvs the relative lack of product knowledge among wal mart employees will limit its electronics push according to stephen baker vice president at market research firm npd group "theres just no way you can explain some things through signs " he says wal mart "just doesnt have the sales help and theyre not going to invest in that type of training " that point is echoed by john boncek a year old math professor in montgomery ala and frequent electronics shopper "i probably would not buy a high end electronic product at wal mart unless the price was absolutely irresistible " mr boncek said "wal marts electronics sales staff doesnt seem to know much about what they sell " mr severson says wal mart is addressing such issues "im not here to tell you that we have completely trained sales associates " he says "but were working toward having a knowledgeable associate that can help the customers with the basics "
