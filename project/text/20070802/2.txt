a cultural conversation with joan allen she doesnt know how to act the diva shortly after the release of "the bourne supremacy " joan allen who starred as a cia operative in the hit movie ran into jason bourne himself matt damon just before curtain time at an off broadway theater "i was in the lobby and matt was there with his mother " said ms allen who reprises her role as pamela landy in "the bourne ultimatum " due out tomorrow there was an exchange of hugs and how ya doings "then matt introduced me to his mom and she said now what do you do and matt was like uh mom she was in the bourne supremacy " ms allen who won the leading actress tony award in for "burn this " was nominated again a decade later for her starring role in wendy wasserstein "the heidi chronicles " and has collected three oscar nominations for "nixon " "the crucible" and "the contender" could certainly have reacted to mother damons words like any normal self respecting actress that is to say she could have sulked pouted fired her press agent and abused a controlled substance but in addition to being very tall and blond and willowy and pretty ms allen has a recessive diva gene "i actually felt very complimented " she said "because when we hooked up again at intermission matts mother said i have to tell you you exude such a different persona in person than you do on film its just like youre someone else altogether " exactly ms allen has built a substantial career on her chameleon like skills and on her willingness perhaps even eagerness to hide her star quality somewhere in the folds of the characters shes so cannily and carefully fashioned "joan has a great presence and always brings layering and texture to her roles " said frank marshall producer of the "bourne" movies after paul greengrass the director of "supremacy" and "ultimatum " interviewed ms allen over lunch he "came back and said thats our landy " continued mr marshall "the character is strong and tough but she also has principles and ideals joans such a wonderful actress she can embody all those things " ethics and principles are all well and good but "i was really excited because they gave me a gun at one point and taught me how to use it they showed me how to check the barrel or whatever and the cartridge " said ms allen while the scene didnt survive the editing room "i like that this was a gal who could pull a trigger if she had to "i think pam landy is one of the most difficult characters ive approached " she added "who knows who these people really are " ms allen who prepped for her role as a blind woman in the movie "manhunter" by spending time at a school for the blind and wearing a kerchief over her eyes was determined to get a sense of life at the agency with the help of her assistant who knew someone who knew someone she made contact with a senior female cia operative "it was great to be in a room with her and see how she talked and reacted she told me that the most important quality is self confidence you have to exude it you have to believe in yourself and though you may be doing things that feel sort of manipulative you have to believe its for the greater good of protecting democracy and america these are very very patriotic people which i didnt really understand before " the double dealing and pistol packing have certainly been a nice change for years ms allen had to deal both with the tedium of playing dutiful wives and mothers in "nixon " "the crucible " "the ice storm " "searching for bobby fischer" and with one lubricious twist "pleasantville" and the tedium of being endlessly quizzed by interviewers about that pattern "ive played a lot of characters whove made the right choices or have been the moral center been some sort of barometer for other characters ive been goodness and strength " she conceded "but i think ive played the best of those roles they werent ciphers you can say pat nixon was the wife but she was also the first lady "i think maybe catherine deneuve once said she made her choices about roles based on knowing the story couldnt function without her character it doesnt mean youre a lead but that youre an integral part of the story and that you cant end up on the cutting room floor " the youngest of four ms allen grew up in rochelle ill where her father owned a gas station and her mother was a homemaker she turned to performing when she failed to make the high school cheerleading squad and after college moved to chicago and joined the nascent steppenwolf theatre company it was invaluable training according to ms allen who first came to the attention of new york audiences in with the steppenwolf import "and a nightingale sang " "everyone pitched in sometimes you were acting and sometimes you were taking care of costumes or cleaning the bathroom " she said "that engendered a strong work ethic which i think goes a long way in any profession it also taught me the importance of team work ive seen some really good performances that happen in a vacuum with the actor not really taking in his fellow actors at steppenwolf the most important aspect of any play was the story itself keeping that in mind has served me very well " indeed laura linney once described ms allen as "just one of the best actors ive ever seen " while gary oldman her co star in "the contender " observed that "when you act with joan you either get better or get embarrassed " but ms allens passion for ensemble work may be at the expense of a higher profile and a position above the fold on casting directors a list no complaints are forthcoming "i think bitterness and negativity are a waste of time " she said evenly "im not at all dissatisfied with what ive done or what im getting to do " added ms allen whos working with hbo on a project about georgia okeeffe and would love to do a comedy with steve carell jack black and most particularly adam sandler "i never had that oh i want to be so and so and i want to see my name in lights i love to work but i dont need to work to be happy particularly the older i get having become a mother " said ms allen whos divorced with a year old daughter "i need the time between roles to live a regular life " ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal
