burden of proof cancer drug fails so maker tries new pitch biotechs challenge fda approval process mr creels tumor new york garo armen froze as colleagues broke the bad news last year about a kidney cancer vaccine he had championed for over years at a cost of &# million the clinical trial had failed shares of his tiny biotechnology firm antigenics inc plunged his ambition and patients hopes were dashed now mr armen years old is on the move traveling the world on a quest to persuade regulators to approve the vaccine despite the initial results his argument the vaccine worked well in a subgroup of less sick patients yet the u s food and drug administration has never approved a drug based on efficacy in a subgroup of patients defined after a trial with results in hand the agency believes companies theoretically could examine many subgroups before finding one in which their drug appears to work "its like shooting an arrow at a target and after the arrow hits the target declaring thats a bulls eye " says robert t oneill director of biostatistics at an fda center "but you dont look at the arrows on the ground that didnt make it " at root is the question of how much proof is enough and whether standards should be less rigid to allow quicker approval if medicines have few apparent side effects and would treat deadly diseases in people with limited or no treatment options underlying mr armens challenge is the broader frustration between the fast pace of biological breakthroughs in understanding cancer and the relative trickle of novel medicines coming to market to treat it critics argue that standards of proof should be relaxed in some cases they say traditional ways of assessing efficacy could block or delay treatments that bring incremental benefit but may collectively contain cancer "we have to find creative ways of getting cancer drugs to patients even if we end up being wrong a few times " says david kessler dean of the school of medicine at the university of california san francisco he was fda commissioner during the aids epidemic when he amended the approval process to speed new treatments to market fda officials defend the current approval standards saying it is better to delay a new drug until there is definitive proof it works "i dont think you want the fda to approve a drug saying theres a chance this works i think you need to know the therapy works " says robert temple director of the office of medical policy at the fda "if somebody uses a vaccine that doesnt work they will be forgoing something else " dr temple says while he recognizes that some patients have "no options left " he says the best route for them is to appeal to the fda and to drug manufacturers for permission to use experimental medicines for years companies have been hesitant to publicly tangle with the fda but some are now openly challenging its standards pharmacyclics inc a california biotech firm refiled an application in april for approval of a cancer drug despite the agencys refusal to review it in february cell therapeutics inc a seattle biotech firm argues its lung cancer drug is being delayed by the fdas insistence it conduct another trial prostate cancer patients and shareholders have protested the fdas refusal in may to approve a cancer vaccine from dendreon corp another seattle biotech firm recently buying a half page ad in the washington post entitled "dysfunction at the fda " "when were near death and when theres little in the medicine cabinet dont send these companies back to do another trial " says laurie fenton ambrose president of the washington d c based lung cancer alliance she says many lung cancer patients "would be willing to take greater risk that a treatment doesnt work " the fda says it cant comment on specific companies data in the agency announced a plan to develop ways to approve drugs more quickly it has held hearings and launched studies but has yet to adopt significant new guidelines meantime the fda has been on the defensive on a different front caught in the cross hairs of patient lawsuits against drug companies whose approved medicines most notably the painkiller vioxx turned out to have serious side effects in rare cases mr armens journey into drug development began when he was manager of a small health care investment fund in mr armen had been obsessed with cancer research since losing his mother to breast cancer soon after emigrating from turkey years earlier the two shared a one room brooklyn apartment where mr armen administered her morphine shots until she died a young researcher from mount sinai school of medicine showed up in mr armens office pitching his research as the basis for a cancer vaccine unlike traditional vaccines that prepare the immune system to head off a disease cancer vaccines aim to induce the body to fight a disease already attacking the body the researcher indian born pramod srivastava believed "heat shock" proteins which help cells recover from heat damage and other stresses could work as cancer vaccines these proteins cling to tumor cell parts and he says help show the bodys immune system what to fight "the idea grabbed me " mr armen says he invested &# and co founded a biotech company with the scientist and two friends others were dubious any therapy made from dr srivastavas invention would require purifying the heat shock proteins out of each patients tumor and making personalized vaccines that then would be injected back into the patient large pharmaceutical companies found the prospect to be a logistical nightmare most preferred to bet on one size fits all vaccines that would be vastly easier to produce and distribute yet early data looked promising in experiments the vaccine cured of the mice that had early stage cancers dr srivastava says in mice with large tumors however the effect was far less pronounced the progression of the disease slowed but didnt disappear in most mice with the stock market sky high in mr armen took antigenics public raising more than &# million in an initial public offering of stock investor demand was strong antigenics still was many years away from having a product in the market but the stock priced at &# rose to &# within two days mr armen says he didnt sell any of his stock then and hasnt since as required by drug development rules the company performed early trials of the vaccine in patients whose cancer had spread and who stood little chance of surviving the good news was the drug had few side effects the bad news was that in most trials fewer than of the patients showed any clinical improvement such as seeing their tumors shrink or vanish the fda has in rare cases approved drugs with efficacy rates around but typically it requires much more evidence of benefit company scientists postulated that these very sick patients were too weak to mount an immune response sufficient to fight vast amounts of cancer cells in antigenics began recruiting for a large trial the one on which it hoped to base fda approval in patients whose kidney cancer tumors had been removed and who showed no sign of disease these earlier stage patients have a to chance of the disease recurring by hundreds of patients around the world were participating roughly half receiving the drug and half being observed the patients tumors were shipped to antigenicss plant in massachusetts where heat shock proteins were extracted and turned into a vaccine the vaccine was sent back to be injected into patients each week or every other week until the supply ran out stephen creel a software salesman in austin texas heard about the vaccine in when he saw christopher wood an urologist at houstons m d anderson cancer center who was the trials lead investigator mr creel then had a wife pregnant with their first child and he says he was willing to do anything to reduce the chances of his tumor recurring a surgeon removed the tumor which was the size of his wrist and antigenics used it to make vaccine that was injected into him every week or every other week for a year "this treatment was a walk in the park " says mr creel whose cancer hasnt recurred he says patients on other cancer treatments at the hospital lost hair and had other side effects "i had absolutely none " in november an antigenics steering committee concluded that the cancer of enough patients had recurred to analyze the data in early march the results were in of eligible patients in the trial cancer had recurred in of them on the vaccine as opposed to who werent treated this represented a slight trend in favor of the vaccine but not nearly enough of a difference to prove efficacy to the fdas standard a one in chance or less that the benefit is a fluke on march the steering committee delivered the bad news to mr armen two days later when the results were announced antigenicss shares plunged to &# on the nasdaq stock market dr srivastava says he began analyzing the data a few weeks later and noticed that patients whose tumors were less advanced seemed to have a better prognosis on the vaccine "i think i know what happened " he recalls writing to mr armen in an email exchange he suggested that patients whose tumors hadnt yet penetrated their veins might benefit more from the vaccine "if thats true it will be very exciting " mr armen replied by the next morning a biostatistician had followed up on the hunch in the patients whose tumors hadnt penetrated their veins fewer patients on the vaccine had cancer recur in this group the company says patients who received no treatment had their cancer recur compared with patients on the vaccine armed with this subset analysis mr armens team presented the results to fda officials on may agency officials said the data was encouraging and suggested the company continue to follow the patients but they also told antigenics it needed to run a "confirmatory trial" in the subgroup according to messrs armen and srivastava both men say their drug development team told fda officials the company didnt have the money for another trial that would cost tens of millions of dollars and take five years fda officials say they cant confirm any details of conversations with companies because of confidentiality rules mr oneill the director of biostatistics at an fda center says the reason for the taboo against approving drugs based on efficacy in a subgroup is that "if its after the fact its impossible to conclude the results are not due to chance " dr srivastava says he didnt fish around to find a group that showed efficacy he says he only divided the data one way looking at the patients whose cancer hadnt penetrated the veins and found the striking difference in the ensuing months dr srivastava says he pushed for antigenics to try to raise more money to run another large trial in earlier stage patients biostatisticians that he and mr armen consulted re enforced the need for another study both men say "there is no other way " dr srivastava says "im confident the drug works but i cant say just because its not a question for me it shouldnt be a question for someone else i must do the work to convince others it works thats what science is all about " but mr armen refused to commission another study arguing that antigenics with no products on the market and a stock price below &# couldnt afford to spend &# million on another trial besides he says investigators told him it would be difficult to recruit patients for another trial with so many new therapies now in testing mr armen asked his team to follow patients in the existing trial and collect data over an additional months "if the results hold up over time well find a place somewhere in the world that will accept this drug " he said the disagreement over conducting another trial and other issues led dr srivastava now a professor at the university of connecticut school of medicine to withdraw from day to day involvement in the company he remains a consultant in march the new analysis was complete the vaccinated patients in the subgroup continued to do better compared with those who received no therapy mr armen says he says patients on the vaccine had recurrences of cancer compared with in the untreated group a statistically significant benefit if only the subgroup is considered among this subgroup of people those on the vaccine lived an average of years without a recurrence of cancer compared with years in untreated patients the company says ebullient mr armen phoned dr wood the lead investigator in the trial dr wood agreed to present the new data at the american urological association in may "i believe it has benefit to patients " dr wood says "it has shown zero toxicity i dont think theres any chance it hurts patients " mr armen has been traveling the world in recent months presenting his subset analysis in june he submitted an application for approval of the vaccine in russia where physicians had enrolled the largest number patients in his vaccine trial andrey gorelov a urologist and professor at st petersburg medical university who participated in the trial says "i would like very much to get this drug registered in russia because i really feel it helps patients a lot " bob pinedo an oncologist who is chairman of hollands national research center says he encouraged mr armen to file for approval of the drug in europe based on the subgroup data "if you ask me if i think the drug works my answer is yes " says dr pinedo this summer mr armen plans to send his latest data to the fda hoping to get advice on how to proceed the fdas dr temple says he cant discuss antigenicss application but he says companies ought to spend more time before starting trials trying to find the population most likely to benefit if it isnt possible to know the population most likely to benefit before the trial begins "companies ought to be able to find investors to pay to repeat trials if the subgroup is really positive " dr temple says the agency is flexible "where the effect is dramatic " the fda never has approved a drug based on a subgroup analysis he says but adds "i would never say never " joel nowak who had a kidney with a large tumor removed last year says patients with life threatening illnesses want to take greater risks than current standards allow having lost his mother father in law and sister in law to cancer in the past two years hes cognizant of what will happen if his disease recurs "the fda standards dont reflect the seriousness of the situation terminally ill patients are in " says mr nowak "its not a headache im talking about im talking about how long im going to be breathing "
