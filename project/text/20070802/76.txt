mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q how can i move a gigabyte file from a mac to a pc a if the two computers are on the same network you could simply transfer the file over the network or you could establish an ad hoc network using whats called a "crossover" network cable though that might require some technical expertise you might also try uploading the file from the mac to one of the online backup and storage services and then downloading it to the pc for instance a service called mediamax at mediamax com offers gigabytes of storage free and claims to work with both macs and pcs for the best combination of simplicity and speed i suggest you purchase an external usb hard drive formatted for windows the mac should be able to instantly recognize it since macs can read windows disks and can write to them as well as long as they use a standard windows format called fat you would just plug the drive into the mac copy the file to it then remove it from the mac plug it into the pc and copy the file from the external drive to the pcs internal hard disk a gigabyte or larger apple ipod can also be used as an external hard disk and thus would do the trick provided it is formatted for windows is set to work in disk mode and has enough room to hold the file q is it possible to switch the iphone into horizontal mode when typing emails which would allow for wider spacing on the onscreen keyboard when typing thus helping to eliminate typing errors a no while the iphones web browser built in ipod and photo program can operate in landscape or horizontal mode its email program works only in vertical or portrait mode however in my daily experience with the iphone i have actually found the horizontal version of the keyboard which appears in the browser clumsier to use than the narrower vertical version q my grandmother age recently stopped our weekly emails and when i asked why she said the " screen has become difficult to use i considered a " lcd but the bigger screens seem to shrink the font and the magnifier option under accessibility isnt agreeable to her what other options are there a i assume from your question that she is running windows xp if so you can enlarge the fonts she uses in several ways to offset the shrinkage you noted on the higher resolution monitor first in windows itself go to the display control panel click on the appearance tab and in the font size menu select "extra large fonts " most email programs and web browsers also offer options to enlarge the size of text for instance in outlook express go to tools then options then click on the read tab and the fonts button change the font size setting to "largest " in the compose tab click the "font settings" button and select a large font size while reading an email she can increase the font size by clicking on the view menu selecting "text size " and then selecting "largest " there is a similar "text size" setting in internet explorer under either the view or page menu depending on which version she is using finally if she is reading her email inside internet explorer you might try a very good &# utility called webeyes which enlarges the type on any web page i tested it in and liked it you can get it at www ionwebeyes com you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com corrections &amp amplifications due to technical limitations an individual cant copy a file larger than gigabytes in size to a disk drive formatted using the windows file system called fat mossbergs mailbox column on thursday incorrectly advised that a gigabyte file could be copied to such a disk drive wsj aug
