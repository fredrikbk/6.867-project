politics &amp economics the wall street journal nbc news poll americas economic mood gloomy broad public pessimism spurs democratic candidates to target business interests washington americans are feeling decidedly sour about the economy and those in charge of it fueling democratic efforts to target business interests in the election campaign more than two thirds of americans believe the u s economy is either in recession now or will be in the next year a new wall street journal nbc news poll shows that assessment comes despite the fact the economy has experienced sustained growth with low inflation and unemployment and generally rising stock values ever since the recession that ended early in president bushs tenure in addition the poll shows a lack of confidence in economic leaders that includes not just mr bush and congress both of whom have the approval of fewer than one third of all americans but the financial industry large corporations in general and energy drug and insurance companies in particular some other measures of americans economic attitudes such as the conference boards consumer confidence measure have risen lately and the journal nbc poll reflected some mixed feelings about the economy yet growth in consumer spending has slowed and concerns about health costs job security and the gap between the rich and poor have left americans downbeat about the road ahead "theyre ambivalent about the current economy but pessimistic about the future " said republican pollster neil newhouse who conducts the journal nbc survey with democratic counterpart peter hart one consequence is anger at leading economic actors who respondents believe are failing to protect ordinary americans interests "theres a combination of anxiety and loathing " mr hart said "theres a sense that every single one of these institutions is totally out for their own betterment versus the public they serve " democratic politicians are reflecting those sentiments in the presidential campaign and in legislative proposals in congress populist lawmakers in the house and senate have targeted oil industry tax breaks and challenged pharmaceutical companies on issues from drug prices to generic substitutes to imports from foreign companies the chairmen of the house ways and means and senate finance committees and all three leading democratic presidential candidates have endorsed higher taxes on hedge fund and private equity managers or firms efforts by republicans and the business community to raise fears about democratic tax increases spending excesses or economic mismanagement have proved unsuccessful in what mr newhouse called a "world turned upside down " democrats enjoy an edge in public approval that extends beyond such party strengths as health care and education where republicans trail by more than percentage points democrats lead by percentage points on handling gas prices by percentage points on energy policy and points on dealing with immigration even more notably republicans lag by percentage points on controlling government spending percentage points on dealing with the economy and nine percentage points on dealing with taxes both top democratic presidential candidates sens hillary clinton of new york and barack obama of illinois lead republican front runner rudy giuliani in a prospective november matchup by six and five percentage points respectively mr giuliani has strengthened his position in the republican nomination race the former new york mayor leads with up from in june compared with former tennessee sen fred thompsons which is unchanged notwithstanding his struggles with campaign staff and fund raising sen john mccain of arizona ticked up to from in june while former gov mitt romney of massachusetts fell to from the telephone survey of adults conducted july carried a margin for error of percentage points "these are sobering numbers for the republican brand " mr newhouse noted with republicans weighed down by mr bushs approval rating he said "these party comparisons arent going to change anytime soon until we get a nominee " the biggest drag on republican fortunes remains the iraq war which has depressed the nations mood across the board just of americans say things in the nation are headed in the right direction while say the country is off on the wrong track when those who expressed pessimism were asked to identify a reason the iraq war was cited by the highest proportion for the first time since the sept terrorist attacks a plurality of americans say the u s is less safe than before the attacks failures in the health care system are next on the list at as americans continue to struggle with rising costs and coverage gaps democratic gov jon corzine of new jersey in washington yesterday to lobby for higher federal health care spending argues that the two concerns feed on each other since americans "think the war is pre empting our ability to deal with health care and other issues " "the macroeconomy is reasonably healthy " said mr corzine former chief executive of goldman sachs group inc "but the reality for the majority of america is theyre lucky if they hold on the numbers are different from what the feel is on wall street " poll respondents expressed limited anxiety about the effects of either the housing market decline or stock market turbulence on their personal circumstances just said shifting stock values lately have had a negative impact on their finances while said the same about home price declines the poll shows wall street itself is a target of public ire just expressed substantial confidence in the financial industry slightly below those expressing confidence in the energy industry or the pharmaceutical industry large corporations and health insurance companies in particular fared even worse one bright spot for the world of commerce of americans expressed high confidence in small businesses which tied with law enforcement agencies for the second ranking behind the u s military among institutions rated by respondents about of americans expressed high confidence in the military by comparison local governments drew expressions of high confidence from public schools religious leaders the national news media and the federal government the wall street journal nbc news poll was based on nationwide telephone
