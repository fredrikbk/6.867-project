a backpay bonanza for some of us each new paycheck is a fresh reminder that were underpaid or believe we are the latter clause was inserted by boss editor but is each new check also a potential violation of our rights back in may the supreme court said no but this week the house passed a bill that would overrule the high court and change the answer to yes a similar bill is pending in the senate in its decision in ledbetter v goodyear tire &amp rubber earlier this year the supreme court rejected a claim by lilly ledbetter who worked for goodyear tire &amp rubber for almost years before retiring and then in filed a pay discrimination suit against her former employer the alleged discrimination went all the way back to the early s the supervisor who had allegedly stiffed her on raises for refusing sexual advances is now dead and so cant defend himself but ms ledbetter had argued that decisions about her pay back then affected every paycheck up until the last one she ever received and so each new check "renewed" the decades old discrimination this matters because under current law pay discrimination complaints must be filed with the government within days or in some cases days of the discrimination the deadlines are tight but they were written into the law for good reasons for one thing its in everyones interest for these things to be sorted out quickly for another businesses have a right to know they dont face potentially unlimited liability for discrete acts of alleged discrimination by some middle manager decades earlier especially if that manager has since passed on to the great beyond finally it can be pretty difficult to gather evidence or defend against such charges after too much time has passed given the clear meaning of this law its astonishing that ms ledbetter got four supreme court votes all of this sound reasoning would come to naught however if each paycheck reset the clock on the strict timetables for filing a pay discrimination claim which is exactly what congress would like to do in a mostly party line vote tuesday the house passed the "lilly ledbetter fair pay act " its purpose is to establish that each paycheck is a fresh act of discrimination and so to gut the time limits built into u s anti discrimination laws speaker nancy pelosi crowed about scoring a crucial victory for "justice and equality " but a "crucial victory for the tort bar" is a more accurate description if it became law the ledbetter bill would lead to the discovery by trial lawyers of all manner of ancient slights many of which compounded over decades would add up to tidy sums for the plaintiffs and their lawyers moreover those sums are impossible to plan for since there is no telling when some long serving employee will decide that the raise he got in was reduced due to discrimination and that raise in turn shaved a hair off every future raise so before you know it your liabilities have ballooned heck even if youre not sure you were ever discriminated against theres bound to be a trial lawyer somewhere willing to make the case after youve safely retired that your employer owes you hundreds of thousands in backpay the law already makes exceptions to the timeline for cases in which the discrimination is hidden or unknown until after the fact but most of us know what we take home on payday which makes pay discrimination a particularly poor category for an open ended right to file a complaint last week president bush threatened to veto the bill should it arrive on his desk were glad hes paying attention because despite the sweep of this dangerous "reform " its received far too little attention as it has breezed through congress see related letter "letters to the editor underplaying a bill that undercuts underpaying" wsj aug
