breaking down the walls of phones web gardens chuck halverson a banker in minneapolis pays at&amp t inc &# a month on top of his calling fee so that he can surf the internet from his cellphone but he doesnt use the browser that came loaded on the at&amp t phone because it limits the sites he can visit instead he downloaded another program opera mini that lets him easily go to almost any web site he wants "the experience should be the same no matter if youre on a mobile phone a laptop or a desktop " he says "you want it to be universal " ever since wireless companies began offering internet services on cellphones users have shared a similar complaint largely because the companies want to control which sites their customers visit phones come with browsers designed to go mainly to the web sites the carriers chose usually the ones they have revenue sharing deals with it is possible to go to sites outside this "walled garden " but the experience is so slow and cumbersome that most users dont try and some of those outside web sites wont work with the carrier approved browsers but now those walls are beginning to break down in a development that harkens back to america onlines failed attempt to limit its internet subscribers surfing in the s "having a web browser and the ability to browse the open internet on your mobile phone will be a given in the future " says tony cripps an analyst at research firm ovum in london "its a capability that eventually people would expect to be there just like text messaging and camera " many new browsers to ease surfing on the web are being developed and some wireless carriers have begun opening up internet use for customers since it was launched in january more than million cellphone users around the world have downloaded the opera mini browser which is available for free and usable on most cellphones early versions of the opera mini developed by opera software asa in norway display web pages in a single column which works well on cellphones with small screens the latest version shows web sites in full page views that are even more similar to the look on a pc deutsche telekom ags t mobile international has preloaded opera mini into cellphones that are available in nine european markets t mobile expects that by providing its customers better browsing experience more people will pay to access the internet on their cellphones the walled garden approach "didnt work with aol " says ingo schneider vice president at t mobile international "its not going to work in mobile either " apple inc s iphone sold by at&amp t displays web pages the way they appear on the wired internet with a zoom in zoom out feature that allows users to read text and enlarge photos a tv ad for the iphone says the safari browser provides "not a watered down version of the internet or the mobile version of the internet its just the internet on your phone " other forces are also opening the wireless internet rules approved tuesday by the federal communications commission for its coming auction of radio spectrum set aside a portion of those airwaves for wireless networks that allow customers to use any mobile device not just those approved by the network owner that is expected to encourage the spread of devices that are able to surf the entire internet as well as other innovations but these new networks will take years to build and require billions of dollars of investment for now advanced browsers are the best route to the wide open internet however these browsers on their own cant mimic the pc experience completely on cellphones while the new browsers can take users to any site handsets cant download music and video unless those features are supported by the wireless carriers and they dont work on all cellphones for instance opera mini cant be used on verizon communications inc cellphones among the technology companies developing products similar to the opera mini microsoft corp is working on a browser called "deep fish " which its web site says can display content in a view that is closer to the desktop experience deep fish like many of the browsers in development by various companies isnt yet available to consumers the browser is being tested on smartphones supported by the windows mobile operating system microsoft says the software is not tied to windows mobile and could possibly be used on other phones the company hasnt disclosed when the browser will be available to the market and if it will be free for download the growing sophistication of these browsers marks the latest step in the evolution of wireless web surfing technology initially carriers and media companies hired software engineers to reconfigure web pages to fit into the small screen of cellphones with few photos and images a special domain name " mobi" was created last year in hopes that a parallel world wide web will be built just for cellphones but the focus is shifting to developing browsers that can bring the regular internet experience to cellphones without the need to upgrade to expensive handsets or recreate web pages just for cellphones smaller companies also have gotten into the game novarra inc is working directly with carriers to improve the limited browsers that have been preloaded into handsets the more advanced browsers also reduce the time it takes for wireless devices to load web pages this is possible because the new generation of mobile browsers rely on servers rather than the device itself the opera mini for example is able to display a web page on a wireless device with only to of the bits needed to display the same page on a pc consumers using it can surf faster than with a dial up internet connection on a pc "my browsing tends to be on my phone " says ryan octianus a year old college student in bandung indonesia he says it takes about three to six seconds to load a photo laden web page from social networking site friendster on his nokia cellphone using the opera mini much faster than the seconds it takes on his pc at home opera software which also develops web browsers for pcs and the nintendo wii game console makes money on opera mini by licensing it to handset makers and wireless carriers and sharing advertising revenue with yahoo inc which has a search box on the minis homepage the company is focusing for now on getting as many users as possible says chief executive jon s von tetzchner analysts believe opera is hoping that its browsers popularity will eventually persuade more operators and handset makers to license its product mr von tetzchner says technology advancement in mobile internet will have a particularly big impact in developing countries where many peoples only option to go online is through their cellphones for example roughly people in bangladesh use opera mini for web browsing according to the countrys largest cellphone operator grameenphone ltd in contrast only bangladeshi had wired internet service as of june according to internet world stats a site that tracks global internet usage corrections &amp amplifications ryan octavianus is a college student in bandung indonesia who uses an opera mini browser on his cellphone a marketplace article yesterday misspelled his last name as octianus wsj aug
