politics &amp economics interim wiretap plan proposed washington a democratic proposal that would expand federal surveillance powers for six months avoids the sensitive question of whether telecommunications companies should be absolved of legal liabilities for aiding the governments intelligence activities the interim legislation proposed yesterday by sen jay rockefeller d w va chairman of the senate intelligence committee would give the bush administration expanded powers to monitor telecommunications traffic as part of its counterterrorism efforts the proposal which still is being negotiated with the administration and doesnt yet have the full support of some key democrats such as sen russell feingold of wisconsin would need to gain sweeping approval from the senate and house this week to be approved before congress leaves for its august recess last night senior republicans led by mitch mcconnell of kentucky and kit bond of missouri offered their own interim fix to the foreign intelligence surveillance act on behalf of the administration their plan differed from the democratic plan in key elements including how much say attorney general alberto gonzales would have in devising rules for surveillance the american civil liberties union and other groups have pursued civil cases against telephone companies including at&amp t inc and verizon communications inc alleging that the companies violated privacy laws by turning over customer information to federal investigators at least one company qwest communications international inc resisted the surveillance requests because they came without court orders the bush administration has proposed that telecom companies be protected from liability for aiding government surveillance including the national security agencys controversial warrantless wiretap program the rockefeller plan doesnt address the question of liability the proposed interim law would let a secret court that administers the fisa law not the attorney general alone as the bush administration would prefer approve procedures governing surveillance of telecommunications between people abroad and in the u s democrats say they will update fisa later this year with a more permanent solution the bush administration says the update is needed to fix the unforeseen applications of a law written almost three decades ago with the advent of cellphones and the internet communications overseas may be routed through the u s where they would be subject to much stricter privacy rules mr rockefeller said he was acting with urgency in pushing the interim legislation after receiving a letter from michael mcconnell director of national intelligence warning that the current "threat environment" required an immediate fix to the fisa law to ensure investigators didnt miss anything telecom executives meanwhile have kept a low profile on capitol hill letting the administration push for liability protections and declining to take a public position on the bill a spokesman for at&amp t issued the companys standard statement saying "at&amp t is fully committed to protecting our customers privacy at&amp t does not comment on matters of national security " a verizon spokesman declined to comment congressional aides say they expect the telecom liability provisions to resurface later this year on capitol hill which could land the telecom providers in a political minefield as the presidential campaign season heats up the administrations effort to update fisa has also become bogged down in a series of controversies surrounding mr gonzales members of congress have accused him of lying to them about the separate bush administration program that authorized surveillance by the nsa without the fisa court approval the republican proposal last night allows the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to produce guidelines for surveillance but allows for review by the secret fisa court some key republicans notably sen arlen specter of pennsylvania joined with democrats in objecting to giving mr gonzales more power saying "i am concerned by provisions of the proposed legislation which would give extensive authority to the attorney general regrettably attorney general gonzales does not enjoy the confidence of many if not most members of congress " telecom companies have been in the crosshairs of privacy advocates and members of congress as more information has been revealed about the nsa program some members of congress have pushed for wider investigations of telephone companies that cooperated with the government arguing that they had a legal responsibility to protect their customers privacy and should have resisted requests unless the government obtained court orders for the information earlier this month a u s district court in california refused the administrations request to stop lawsuits filed by several states against telecom providers seeking information on what they provided to the nsa several states including missouri maine new jersey connecticut and vermont have launched investigations of telecom companies under their public utilities laws tim sparapani counsel for the american civil liberties union says the aclu "will fight to the bitter end any giveaway to companies that willfully break the law "
