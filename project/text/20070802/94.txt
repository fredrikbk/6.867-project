reworking the classics two of this years lincoln center festival events reinterpreted classical art forms while a third took a new approach to an old fairy tale the choreographer and designer shen weis production of the beijing opera "second visit to the empress" at the new york state theater was an amalgam of historical performance four traditional singers in elaborate costumes and makeup a member orchestra playing chinese instruments and modern choreography a troupe of dancers who served as a kind of greek chorus but the two aesthetics seemed to operate in isolation the dancers wearing shroud like costumes and white clay makeup swooped and turned often in unison reflecting the rhythms of the music the smooth rather generic quality of their movement paled in contrast to the tangy expressive vocal and instrumental sounds of the traditional chinese performers there was more emotion to be had from the weeping of empress li zhang jing imprisoned by her treacherous father and the comedy and heroism of the two elderly counselors general yang he wei and duke xu deng mu wei who arrive to rescue her shen wei who also designed the set and costumes kept the dancers and the singers in separate stage areas making the dancing seem all the more superfluous earlier in the festival fans of chinese opera could skip the dancing and enjoy tour de force performances by wei hai ming and wu hsing kuo in a double bill of "the tipsy concubine" and "farewell my concubine " presented by the contemporary legend theatre of taiwan "the full monteverdi " conceived and directed by john la bouchardiere and performed by the british vocal ensemble i fagiolini was an elaborate party trick though also a tour de force of a kind claudio monteverdis madrigals in this case book four are hard enough when the six singers are standing together it is much more complicated to perform the pieces which explore love in all its joyous and painful manifestations when the singers are scattered throughout the audience acting out little psychodramas of love anger reconciliation and desertion the kaplan penthouse was set up like a cafe with small tables drinks and food and the singers each paired with an actor of the opposite sex were seated at tables along with unsuspecting audience members we only knew who was who when they started to sing and move around the excellent singers who often could not look at one another for entrances and cut offs managed the musical aspect of the evening with remarkable polish if not much subtlety experiencing the madrigals antiphonally certainly made a listener appreciate how each vocal strand plays its part at the wednesday performance countertenor robert hollingworth i fagiolinis music director sang in place of mezzo clare wilkinson in some of the madrigals one couldnt miss the change of timbre but with the translations distributed only at the end of the performance non italian speakers had only the music for reference along with much emoting intense gazing the occasional bit of physical violence a slap a grab at an arm wraps and bags were snatched from the backs of chairs as a singer or an actor stormed out of the room by the end of the hour all the actors had left leaving the singers despondent and alone at their tables the whole thing finally made me grateful for the usual "fourth wall" between the performers and the audience it was like being unable to escape from someone elses argument when one of the singers approached my table i wanted to head for the door myself "into the little hill" the british composer george benjamins minute "lyric tale " is billed as an opera but it is more of a story told with music scored for players a contralto and a soprano it reimagines the brothers grimm tale of the pied piper of hamelin a mysterious figure who uses music to rid a city of its plague of rats and when he is cheated out of his fee takes its children away in martin crimps libretto there are two main characters the minister sung by the contralto hilary summers who makes the bargain and the stranger the soprano anu komsi both singers also take other roles and serve as narrators in daniel jeanneteaus production at the gerald w lynch theater the players ensemble modern conducted by franck ollu sat on a darkened stage strewn with dead leaves each singer had her own lighted catwalk the point of the piece was the creation of an eerie musical environment with the text carefully set for maximum intelligibility though a quick read through the libretto beforehand helped instrumental textures were spare never competing with the voices and strange with compelling sonorities from instruments like the basset horn a kind of clarinet and the cimbalom a type of large dulcimer both ms summers and ms komsi are impressive singers ms komsi can pop out effortless high ds and ms summerss lush timbre made the unctuous minister repellent some of the word painting was also gripping such as the evocation of rats "feeding on electricity" and "digesting concrete " but other than the opening in which both singers as "the crowd " let loose with a creepy dissonant cry of "kill them " the music had little dramatic or rhythmic energy it was intriguing to listen to but lacked direction relying on the text to give information and the text had its own confusions what are we supposed to think of the rats the libretto implies that the people want the rodents killed because of their own selfishness and greed the ministers child sung by the soprano the symbol of innocence offers a sentimental fantasy of the rats running off in coats carrying their suitcases dropping their babies who get trampled have they actually been taken to a better place along with the children through the power of music or has everyone lured off by the stranger been killed like so many fairy tales the story actually has a savage undertone but mr crimp and mr benjamin only suggested it and so missed an opportunity ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
