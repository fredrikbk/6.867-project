leahy flaw judicial warfare in colombia please allow me the opportunity to comment on sen patrick leahys letter "what leahy law means to human rights issues " july specifically where he differentiates between aid to a combat unit and aid to the country the senator clarifies the distinction in the law that bears his name so that it appears that curtailing assistance is limited to the unit where a service member belongs when "credible evidence" surfaces that an individual is involved in human rights violations yet in practice the law lends itself to abuse that can impact the entire colombian armed forces a recent example involves an article published earlier this year in a leading u s daily in which gen mario montoya commander of the colombian army was accused of links by innuendo to human rights abuses while he was bringing law and order to a terrible area of medellin this information was leaked to the press by u s officials but gen montoya never had such links and while the u s embassy in bogota formally apologized to the general for the inconvenience of such an unsubstantiated charge ever being published the u s suspended &# million in aid to the army in mid april ergo to the colombian nation today the aid remains suspended it was in fact sen leahy who ignoring the very spirit of his law suspended the aid until such time as his staff could ascertain if there were sufficient reasons to release the funds this just two weeks after the state department had certified as the law requires that what colombia is doing in regard to respect for human rights is appropriate if the law calls for the certification of state in order to release funding and that certification is ignored by the senate what law rules enrique gomez hurtado former president senate of the republic of colombia bogota colombia mary ogrady hits the nail right on the head when she says that colombias marxist rebels use false accusations as a weapon of war revolutionary war manuals commonly recommend that rebels should use "every form of struggle " and judicial warfare is one of those forms fabricated accusations are routinely made by ngos sympathetic to the rebels against officers of all grades the allegations are then fed to ngos in the u s and to the state department false testimony is unfortunately common because colombias overburdened judiciary seldom if ever prosecutes perjury for example these techniques were used to press for the ouster of gens millan del rio ramirez yanine and quinonez they were eventually cleared of charges but the damage was already done the armed forces were deprived of emblematic officers and morale throughout the ranks was affected in many other cases accusations failed to produce dismissals because investigations were relatively prompt and were finished before any scheduled command rotation but the attempt was made this is the case with gen freddy padilla for example the present commander of the armed forces there is no doubt that the leahy law however laudable the intentions behind it fosters judicial warfare the key flaw in the wording of the law is the use of the phrase "credible evidence " one may ask "credible to whom " no provision is made for the accused officer to tell his version of the case wouldnt it be better to wait for the accused to have his day in court occasionally the u s embassy has checked accusations a difficult and hazardous undertaking in a war torn country and has found evidence of fabricated cases and gross manipulation of figures it seems unwise to pass judgment lightly under such circumstances miguel posada president verdad colombia federation of ngos bogota colombia
