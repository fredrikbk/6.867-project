chiquita under the gun after disclosing payments to colombian terrorists company officials face legal jeopardy in april roderick m hills then head of chiquita brands international inc s audit committee went to the department of justice with other chiquita representatives with a stunning admission the company had been making illegal payments to a violent colombian group that the u s branded as terrorists in years past the admission might have been enough to get chiquita off the hook companies and their executives who reported wrongdoing and agreed to cooperate often have enjoyed lenient treatment many received a "deferred prosecution" in which no charges were filed unless they committed additional crimes but things didnt work out that way for chiquita or for mr hills and some colleagues in march of this year chiquita pled guilty to engaging in transactions with a terrorist group and agreed to pay &# million in fines the first time a major u s company was charged with having financial dealings with terrorists now mr hills a former chairman of the securities and exchange commission faces the possibility of personal criminal charges a federal grand jury is looking at his role and that of other high company officials in continuing the company payments for almost another year after the meeting with the justice department the investigation illustrates the recent posture taken by u s authorities to prosecute aggressively even when companies turn themselves in for breaking the law critics say that strategy could cause difficulties if companies decide they suffer no worse by waiting to get caught "this case will make companies think twice about self reporting " says stetson university law professor ellen podgor mr hillss lawyer reid weingarten and lawyers for four other individuals including former chiquita chief executive cyrus freidheim jr and former general counsel robert olson submitted legal memos to federal prosecutors last month arguing why their clients shouldnt be charged with terrorism related crimes "that rod hills would find himself under investigation for a crime he himself reported is absurd " says mr weingarten mr hills declined to comment the case may turn partly on how friendly a treatment chiquita officials thought they were getting from u s authorities a paramilitary organization had threatened to kidnap or kill employees on the banana farms of chiquitas colombian subsidiary banadex and chiquita was concerned that its employees could be harmed if it cut the payments immediately lawyers familiar with the case say mr hills and mr olson believed senior justice department officials understood this and were deferring any demand to stop the payments to the united self defense forces known by its spanish abbreviation auc chiquita ultimately paid &# million over seven years the justice department denies it gave chiquita any leeway to keep paying meanwhile the case has become something of a political football with congressional democrats pledging further investigation into u s companies underwriting violence abroad and the toughness of u s enforcement lawyers for messrs freidheim and olson said their clients had acted properly in the circumstances eric holder jr a washington d c attorney representing chiquita says the company faced "a moral dilemma of the highest order " he says the calculus was "horrific" and that "under the circumstances the company did what it had to do to save the lives of its employees while disclosing fully its actions to u s authorities and appealing for their reason and guidance " u s prosecutors took a dim view of chiquitas dilemma and its delay in stopping the payments "i regarded this as a murder investigation " from the start says roscoe howard jr former u s attorney for washington d c who helped lead the chiquita prosecution before he left his position in "even though chiquita didnt murder anyone thats what the money was used for to buy weapons " the justice department says it hasnt changed tack on companies who turn themselves in but alice fisher head of justice departments criminal division since last october put companies on notice of the departments stance in a speech to white collar lawyers she warned that self reporting wouldnt guarantee "a complete pass" for companies the same month a schnitzer steel industries unit pleaded guilty and paid &# million in fines for giving cash and gifts to the portland ore steelmakers chinese customers after turning itself in this spring a unit of baker hughes inc paid &# million in fines to settle a nigerian bribery scandal the houston oil field services company had reported to the justice department in dean body a justice department spokesman called the chiquita case a "very serious matter" involving conduct spanning several years and added "if the only way for a company to conduct business in a particular location is to do so illegally then the company probably shouldnt be doing business there " in june the company ended the quandary by selling off its colombian subsidiary while still receiving its bananas last month rep bill delahunt d mass led a joint congressional hearing on whether u s companies beyond chiquita were financing groups such as auc that kidnapped or killed union leaders and civilians congressional democrats have promised more hearings on whether enforcement is strong enough assistant u s attorney jonathan malis who now leads the chiquita case and other prosecutors are under pressure to make a decision on whether to seek further charges u s district judge royce lamberth has asked prosecutors to notify him before october whether individuals will be indicted according to lawyers familiar with the case in the meantime judge lamberth has agreed to postpone chiquitas sentencing because of its cooperation mr malis declined to comment mr hills a year old lawyer for years has made his living helping companies get out of trouble and helping third world governments create corporate law as sec chairman mr hills unveiled a program that encouraged companies to investigate themselves when problems were found and to provide independent reports to the sec and full disclosure to shareholders with adequate company disclosure he said at the time the sec wouldnt pursue enforcement remedies unless there was fraudulent behavior both mr hills and his wife attorney carla hills have a long history of public service a patrician and well connected republican he began his government career as counsel to president ford she served as both a cabinet member and as the u s trade representative since his departure from the sec mr hills has served on the boards of companies many of them scandal plagued assisting in the ouster of several chief executives including at federal mogul corp waste management inc and oak industries inc "no one can question his diligence or integrity " says charles elson who runs the university of delaware business schools weinberg center for corporate governance mr hills joined chiquitas board in march when the company emerged from bankruptcy law protection mr hills took charge of selecting a new chief auditor for the company in place of one chosen by management saying he didnt feel comfortable with how chiquita had accounted for its banana purchases mr hills learned about the payments to auc in april a month after he joined the board according to people with knowledge of the matter morten arntzen a director who served with mr hills on chiquitas audit committee says the auc payments werent secretive they were disclosed to ernst &amp young and to company directors on the audit committee "when i joined the board i knew the company was making payments to paramilitary groups in colombia " he says "if you didnt do it your people were going to get killed " chiquita recorded the payments which were approved by many of its highest ranking officers as "security payments " chiquita had previously paid another violent group until it was declared a terrorist organization in on sept the state department designated auc a terrorist organization media reports the next day were far overshadowed by news of terrorist attacks in new york and washington but the aucs terror designation also was reported in colombian media and got media attention weeks later in cincinnati where chiquita is based the justice department says according to the company officials remained unaware of the terrorist designation until an in house lawyer happened across the information while searching the internet on feb late that afternoon chiquitas then general counsel mr olson contacted laurence urgenson a partner at the companys longtime outside law firm kirkland &amp ellis to report the finding he also contacted mr hills the head of the companys audit committee and a series of conference calls ensued chiquita "should stop payments immediately " read one of five memos detailed in the criminal complaint the memos were written by kirkland associate audrey harris based on conversations she had with mr urgenson and notes on his talks with mr hills and other chiquita officers and directors lawyers familiar with the case say mr olson and mr hills argued that suddenly stopping the payments could put workers at risk mr urgenson a well respected white collar attorney in the firms washington d c office didnt believe it was a matter of choice they were illegal he counseled and should end still chiquita made two additional payments totaling nearly &# in february and march according to the criminal complaint on april mr hills and mr olson reported the history of auc payments to the full board the payments "came as a surprise" to directors who werent on the audit committee says jeffrey benjamin who resigned from the chiquita board this year for unrelated reasons he says the board quickly determined "the right thing to do was self report " though mr hills agreed with that consensus prosecutors have suggested he balked the next day a lawyers notes from an april meeting detailed in the criminal complaint say three unidentified individuals opined "just let them doj sue us come after us " lawyers on both sides have said the three are messrs hills olson and freidheim on april mr hills nevertheless went to the justice department with messrs olson and urgenson and ms harris to report the payments among those attending was mr hills longtime acquaintance michael chertoff then in charge of the justice departments criminal division and now chief of the homeland security department mr hills and mr chertoff were colleagues at the law firm of latham &amp watkins llp in the early s when mr hills already had been a white house counsel and sec chair and mr chertoff was still a junior attorney the chiquita lawyers believed that self reporting would enable chiquita to avoid criminal penalties according to people familiar with the companys meetings mr hills took the lead for the company spelling out the companys dilemma prosecutors note in their chiquita complaint that the company was in a "complicated situation " mr hills and mr olson left the meeting confident that mr chertoff had deferred a decision about whether payments could continue according to lawyers familiar with the case ten additional payments were made between may and september totaling about &# according to court filings mr urgenson followed up with the justice department seeking clarification about the continuing payments in september michael taxay a justice department trial lawyer said he could only repeat mr chertoffs earlier words "the payments are a violation " he said according to an account of the meeting written by a company lawyer that prosecutors dont dispute by that time mr chertoff had already left the justice department and didnt attend mr taxay declined to comment as did mr chertoff through a spokesman mr urgenson told chiquita officials he still wasnt certain whether the justice department would take action against chiquita for continuing payments but he did note in a sept memo that department of justice officials "have been unwilling to give assurances or guarantees of non prosecution in fact officials have repeatedly stated that they view the circumstances presented as a technical violation and cannot endorse current or future payments " yet chiquita made half a dozen more payments totaling more than &# through february according to the criminal complaint mr howard the former u s attorney whose office handled the case says the continuation persuaded him that chiquita "shouldnt be treated any differently than year old drug dealers " in december mr taxay the justice department lawyer told an attorney representing a chiquita employee that the company could face charges for the continued payments on dec mr hills emailed fellow directors about the justice departments concerns that the company wasnt being as cooperative as it should be mr hills told them "we cannot delegate this issue to management " and that his audit committee was going to look into the continuing payments because "we appear to be committing a felony " even as chiquita began turning over documents relating to the payments to the justice department it kept making payments they stopped only after a new ceo fernando aguirre arrived and ordered them ended in january mr hills took on an unusual operational role for a director associates say which contributed to his current legal jeopardy he spoke with prosecutors ensured that chiquita complied with document subpoenas and helped negotiate the sale of the banadex subsidiary shortly after a m on march agents of the federal bureau of investigation armed with subpoenas paid a surprise visit to chiquitas cincinnati headquarters later that day fbi agents in fort lauderdale fla descended on a company board meeting and delivered subpoenas including to then ceo mr friedheim the fbis arrival at the board meeting stunned company officials when a company cooperates with federal prosecutors agents typically allow defense lawyers to quietly accept subpoenas mr freidheim now ceo of sun times media group testified twice before a grand jury investigating chiquitas payments and was informed that he was a "subject" of the probe sun times disclosed in an sec filing earlier this year in an unusual move prosecutors also have made mr urgenson the lawyer for chiquita a prosecution witness against chiquita and mr hills say people familiar with the case mr urgenson declined to be interviewed saying "its not appropriate for me to chat with you given my status as a witness " late last year mr holder the washington lawyer took over chiquitas representation from mr urgenson during plea negotiations he tried unsuccessfully to spare mr hills and others from further investigation
