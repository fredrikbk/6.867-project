lenders tighten standards pare loans in face of debt banks and securities firms are trimming loans especially to companies tied to the mortgage market but it is a balancing act cutting back too far could make matters worse by accelerating corporate bankruptcies and causing more turmoil in financial markets banks facing the prospect of taking on billions of dollars in buyout related debt are starting to trim lending to companies that need to refinance loans or restructure their balance sheets as banks rein in riskier lending companies could find themselves unable to refinance loans coming due or to overhaul their businesses some companies may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection a development that would exacerbate bond market turbulence last week beazer homes usa inc disclosed that banks reduced the companys credit line to &# million from &# billion the company said it negotiated a smaller credit line because it didnt need a line as large as the previous one but analysts said the move likely reflects the banks concern that beazers income will be hurt by both the housing downturn and the federal investigation into its mortgage unit yesterday in a sign of investors jittery view of home builders the stock price of beazer fell as much as at one point before closing down amid rumors the atlanta company would file for bankruptcy protection the company strongly denied the rumors beazers problems are somewhat unique due to the investigation of its mortgage unit by the federal bureau of investigation the securities and exchange commission also is probing the builder but the stocks drop in part reflects investors belief that banks are getting tougher on home builders and they are fleeing stocks of companies that are dependent on bank financing "we dont think the banks will be that forgiving this time around " said joseph snider a senior credit officer at moodys specifically banks are worried some builders may come close to tripping contractual agreements that limit the levels of debt in relationship to their corporate net worth which is typically a builders assets minus liabilities goodwill and intangibles such as trademarks and copyrights many builders havent been boosting debt to a great extent but their net worth is eroding because of a decline in home prices triggering write downs of their assets that makes the ratio of debt to net worth rise the vast majority of a builders net worth is tied up in the value of its land and home inventory banks were typically comfortable with builders debt levels because land provided safe collateral but that collateral is eroding "clearly this is such a cyclical sector " said sue berliner a credit analyst at bear stearns "but whats disturbing is that some of these guys have written off of their net value " if banks get skittish mr snider said they could reduce the size of the credit lines as they did with beazer or require the credit lines to be secured most of them are unsecured analysts are watching what happens when two other big home builders los angeles based kb home and standard pacific corp of irvine calif approach their banks to renegotiate their credit lines in the coming weeks banks also
