capital productivity questions blur economic picture the stock market often steals the attention with its dramatic charts and photos of glum usually balding floor traders gyrating subprime mortgage and corporate bond markets are giving it some competition these days but look beyond the markets and the consensus is still for "moderate growth" in the u s thats plausible particularly if the job market holds up and overseas economies continue to rebound yet the worry list is growing tentative signs that the housing market was stabilizing have dissipated the s&amp p case shiller home price index which covers major cities shows no signs of a turnaround the government estimates itll take months to work off the inventory of newly built unsold homes at current depressed sales levels the national association of realtors counts million previously occupied homes on the market in june up from a year earlier that means home building will continue to be a drag on the economy and renews concerns that consumer spending which has held up surprisingly well despite the housing bust might soften now theres another troubling cloud on the horizon productivity growth may be slowing and with it the economys safe speed limit the pace at which it can grow without generating inflation growth in productivity the goods and services americans produce for each hour of work is key to improving living standards wages dont automatically track productivity as workers have learned lately but slow productivity growth makes higher wages impossible productivity growth picked up smartly around as business and consumers figured out how to harness the internet to do old chores more efficiently and do new things theyd never before imagined and productivity continued to grow at a remarkably rapid pace through the trauma of a stock market bust a recession and the terror of sept the latest published labor department numbers show u s productivity growth slowed to last year outside of farms and government well below the pace of the preceding two years and the pace earlier in the decade a little noted detail in last weeks government report on second quarter economic growth foreshadows unpleasant revisions are coming the commerce department marked down its earlier estimates of economic output for each of the past three years less output for the same amount of work translates into slower productivity growth goldman sachs economists estimate that this means productivity grew at a annual rate in the past three years down from the previously disappointing these small differences add up over time at average living standards double in years nearly two generations at they double in years closer to one generation these revisions will fuel a debate among experts about whether the current downturn in productivity is a lull or an end to the productivity boom of the late s and early s northwestern universitys robert gordon has argued that the economy enjoyed a one time spurt from the internet but that effect has faded and productivity is likely to be disappointing in the next several years federal reserve economists stephen oliner daniel sichel and kevin stiroh have been slightly more upbeat they argue that information and communication technology produced the productivity surge and persisted after when business spending on computers and software waned most likely because of industry restructuring in response to profit pressures and a reshuffling among industry sectors but its hard to keep doing that over and over again the likely revisions tell us the recent past wasnt as good as had been believed and support the pessimistic case that productivity growth is unlikely to exceed in the next few years although productivity numbers can be an unreliable contemporaneous gauge this is undeniably troubling but the outlook for productivity ultimately depends on whether the u s keeps innovating whether it keeps applying those innovations in new ways and in industries think health care and education that have yet to fully exploit technology whether less productive organizations catch up or are shoved aside by more productive ones and whether american politicians and the public understand the importance of repairing the education system to better equip workers in that light the future looks a bit brighter than the recent numbers imply
