politics &amp economics pay as you go is put to the test efforts to insure children shaped by spending rule washington behind the raging debate over a popular health insurance program for children which came to a head yesterday as the house passed legislation expanding the program are three broader issues likely to bedevil lawmakers heading into the elections and beyond the legislation represents the biggest test yet of democrats pledge to pay for new spending with higher taxes or offsetting spending cuts a politically difficult exercise that pits lawmakers against the powerful industries forced to shoulder the costs the debate also highlights the sharp differences between republicans and democrats over how big a role the government should play in covering the uninsured presaging future battles in attempting a broader overhaul of the health care system moreover the issue underscores how even politically appealing bills can be ensnared in pre posturing between the democratic congress and president bush the house voted to increase spending on the childrens health insurance program or chip by &# billion over five years the bill also would spend &# billion more on medicare payments to physicians and beef up mental health and other medicare benefits the increased spending would be paid for mainly by raising cigarette taxes by cents a pack and cutting payments to medicare advantage plans private managed care plans that are an alternative to the traditional government run medicare program by &# billion over five years the senate defeated several republican amendments to scale back spending or limit eligibility under the senates chip bill which calls for &# billion over five years in new spending but doesnt touch medicare a vote is expected by the end of the week and lawmakers on both sides predicted the bill would get the votes needed to pass that bill would raise the cigarette tax by cents a pack mr bush has threatened to veto both bills he has proposed raising chip funding by &# billion over five years short of the &# billion congressional budget analysts said would be needed to maintain current enrollment politicians on both sides of the aisle relish the debate as a way to score points and lay out their positions before next years elections democrats welcome the chance to spar with mr bush and his allies over a childrens program that has broad public support many republicans hope to block democrats from a signature victory on the house floor yesterday republicans derided the bill as a step toward "hillarycare " their nickname for the clinton administrations failed early s health care overhaul democrats shot back that they are promoting a widely shared goal of insuring low income children who arent eligible for medicaid the rancor points up the challenge in reaching agreement in coming years on broader health care changes including how to cover the million uninsured americans "most people would assume this would be the easy part coverage for kids building on an existing program and financed in a way thats popular with the general public " said john rother director of legislation and public policy for the seniors group aarp "it seems like this would be a slam dunk compared with what needs to follow and thats not the case at all " not everyone is gloomy about the outlook in the senate where the chip debate has been less vitriolic sen ron wyden has written bipartisan legislation that would overhaul the nations health care system by changing the tax treatment of insurance "ive been trying to tell conservative folks im with you the tax rules are a mess lets see if we can get through this without a bloodbath " the oregon democrat says in the house some of the sharpest clashes over the democrats chip bill were sparked by the financing provisions as required under the democrats"pay as you go" budget rules many democrats have long opposed the policy that the government pays the private plans servicing medicare enrollees more on average than is spent per person in the traditional program where most seniors are covered but house minority leader john boehner an ohio republican said cutting payments to medicare advantage plans would require seniors in the program to "sacrifice their freedom and security " and urged aarp to withdraw its support for the bill because of these cuts aarps mr rother said the organization wouldnt change its position republicans also complain that the increased tobacco tax is regressive and would hurt low income smokers the most the political heat over these funding sources will be a continuing theme if democrats stick to the pay as you go rules some democrats also joined in the carping about the tobacco tax and the medicare advantage cuts at least behind closed doors amid aggressive lobbying by the tobacco industry and health insurance companies lawmakers with substantial numbers of tobacco farmers smokers and medicare advantage beneficiaries in their districts grew nervous about the initial package to help assuage their concerns democratic leaders cut overall pending in the bill and included money and additional provisions to help rural low income and minority beneficiaries when asked about the pay as you go budget rules new york rep charles rangel the house ways and means chairman said "i hate it "
