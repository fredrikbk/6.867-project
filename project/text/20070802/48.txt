fed keeps its focus on inflation rate cut seems unlikely despite data suggesting increased risks to economy washington federal reserve officials have scaled back their economic outlook a bit amid some weak economic data and market turmoil but they appear unlikely to drop their focus on inflation for now when officials meet tuesday they are likely to keep the short term interest rate target at as expected despite the recently increased risks to economic growth there appears to be little sentiment for shifting from their assessment that the risk of higher inflation poses a greater concern that judgment would imply little support for a near term rate cut however developments in markets and key data including tomorrows july employment report could shift officials inclinations in coming days william poole president of the federal reserve bank of st louis said tuesday "most of these market upsets stabilize on their own but some do not im not saying that the fed should ignore what happened last week we need to understand what is happening " two weeks ago federal reserve chairman ben bernanke presented congress with a forecast of moderate growth this year and next it was slightly weaker than the february forecast mainly due to a longer than expected housing slump but mr bernanke reiterated that "upside risks to inflation" are the feds "predominant concern " saying a recent drop in underlying inflation could be partly "transitory " then last week a series of economic reports showed housing sales falling faster than expected and weaker business and consumer spending in june at the same time stocks fell and interest rate spreads between treasury bonds and riskier debt such as leveraged corporate loans widened sharply as lenders demanded more compensation for the risk of default some portions of the high yield debt market have shut down those events appear to have had only a small impact on the feds views so far officials acknowledge that lower stock prices and wider credit spreads represent a "tightening" of financial conditions that could hamper investment and growth later this year that along with some weaker than expected data implies a slight downgrade to their growth forecast not a fundamental change assuming financial conditions dont tighten a lot more meanwhile inflation risks havent changed much last weeks downward revisions to growth in prior years will likely prompt many officials to lower their estimates of the economys long term noninflationary growth rate and erase some doubts about whether labor markets really are tight also oil prices have hit new highs the fed faces the challenge of recognizing the negative consequences of market turmoil without appearing ready to cut rates simply to restore stability the drop in markets caused futures markets to increase the odds the fed would cut rates by a quarter percentage point by the end of january to more than from in mid july lou crandall chief economist at wrightson associates said that mostly reflects investors rush to the safety of short term bonds rather than an explicit expectation the fed would ease mr poole said "the market understands i believe the fed will act in due time if and when evidence accumulates that action would be appropriate the fed should respond to market upsets only when they threaten to undermine price stability and high employment or market processes themselves " earlier this year markets had priced in two quarter point rate cuts by next january but those expectations receded as the fed stuck to its inflation risks message and the job market remained tight expectations of easing may be more justified now because the economic backdrop has changed housing demand after stabilizing has begun falling again and core inflation has slipped to from more than for most of the previous three years the housing market is where the fed and wall street are most at odds "im more concerned than the median fed policy maker mainly because i think the consumption and housing link is more important than they do " said jan hatzius chief u s economist at goldman sachs "i think they probably will change their view " so far they havent last week philadelphia fed president charles plosser said he would worry that the housing slump is hurting the broader economy if delinquencies on prime mortgages jump or if declining home prices appear to crimp consumer spending but "we dont see that much " local bankers he added dont seem worried about mortgage defaults or a credit crunch "theyve got money to lend "
