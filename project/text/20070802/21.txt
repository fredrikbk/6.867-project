coming to america congress is doing something right at the border for a change making it easier for allies from estonia to south korea to visit america the move is an economic boon and a foreign policy success story homeland security legislation passed last week on capitol hill expands eligibility for americas visa waiver program the program allows nationals of designated countries to enter the u s for up to days without applying for a visa before leaving home twenty seven countries currently participate including most of western europe australia and japan now citizens of more will be able to apply immediately and it will be easier for other countries to join in the future the u s currently does a terrible job of welcoming the many citizens of friendly nations who want to pay brief visits they must pay an average of &# for a visa submit a mountain of paperwork and often take time off work to travel long distances to a u s consulate for the mandatory in person interview the biggest stumbling block is the so called "refusal rate " the annual percentage of visa applications from a countrys nationals that are denied for any reason current law requires a refusal rate of less than before a country can win visa waiver status the new legislation increases the limit to while giving the secretary of homeland security greater flexibility to weigh a countrys application based on its law enforcement and antiterror cooperation with the u s applicants need to meet criteria ranging from airport screening to secure storage of blank passports newly eligible countries are argentina brazil cyprus the czech republic estonia greece israel malta slovakia south korea taiwan and uruguay as more countries join the program the u s will enjoy economic benefits consider that last year south koreans logged visits to the u s a number that could hit this year other koreans still may be deterred by the visa hassle when canada waived visas for koreans in visits shot up in the first year each unique visit from a korean pours an average of &# into the u s economy for airfare hotel rooms shopping and all the taxes added to those expenditures according to the commerce department the text of the bill makes clear that congress is using the visa waiver program as a reward to some of americas "partners in the war on terror " president bush endorsed the provision as a benefit to "our closest partners " border policy is fertile terrain for this kind of public diplomacy because it is typically the first run in with "official" america that foreigners have the u s stands to gain from rolling out a red carpet for guests of goodwill see related letter "letters to the editor allowing brazilian visa wavers would be nuts" wsj august
