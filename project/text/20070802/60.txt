inequality more than just an obsession arthur c brooks identifies a key problem regarding economic mobility in america today "the lefts inequality obsession " july most policy solutions being offered particularly those tackling income inequality offer short term fixes that will do little to help more americans climb and secure a higher station on the economic ladder in the long term but mr brookss contention that economic mobility "exists" in america today and the facts he offers to support it tell an incomplete story short term swings within a year indicate economic volatility not enduring mobility and are as likely to be cause for public concern as celebration recent analysis of census data conducted as part of pews economic mobility project finds that men in their s today earn less cash income than men in the previous generation suggesting that the traditional up escalator may not be working very well for at least some americans more project research will explore who in america has a real opportunity to climb the steps we concur with mr brookss call for a more constructive policy dialogue focusing on "enhancing economic opportunity " we aim to move past the political divide that mr brooks highlights and provoke discussion about strengthening the american dream for future generations by working with leading thinkers from the american enterprise institute brookings institution heritage foundation and urban institute to identify the factors that promote mobility in america john e morton managing director economic policy the pew charitable trusts washington if only the liberals among us especially those who see the tax code as an efficient instrument of forced equality through mandated government redistribution would parse the experimental data from the national opinion research centers survey like mr brooks his conclusion that americans real concern is with equal opportunity not enforced income equality is not only consonant with the data but also puts to bed the lefts mantra that income inequality is a prime cause of worker discontent liberals appear wedded to class envy electoral politics reasoning that an appeal to the base instinct of envy trumps an argument that engages voters intellect this is consistent with the elitism of mainstream liberalism namely that they know better about what is good for the voter yet inconsistent with how americans vote paul bloustein cincinnati mr brooks is correct when he notes that people are not outraged at the "enormous incomes of software moguls and ceos " but neglects a basic truth about the kind of inequality that eats at the psyche of most people indeed the lives of those at the very top are not what most people think about except at odd moments such as when buying lottery tickets which provide them with a few hours of pleasure imagining purchasing a mansion they have seen featured on some television show devoted to the lives of the rich and famous instead when it comes to income sociological studies repeatedly conclude that it is relative income rather than absolute income that determines the happiness of individuals people feel pain and resentment about inequality when they see firsthand what they dont have and dont think they can get no matter how hard they work what causes pain are the huge well maintained homes with large yards that they pass during their long commutes that remind them that their homes are too small for their families and in need of major repairs they find those comparisons even more hurtful because they know that many of the children in the houses go to the same large high school as their children but do better than theirs because they learned more in their elementary schools have private tutors and learn a lot in summer camp none of which they can afford beverly goldberg senior fellow the century foundation new york see related letter "letters to the editor under equality the american dream thrives" wsj august
