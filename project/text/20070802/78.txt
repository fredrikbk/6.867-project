expected to be hard to get the merger is expected to close in three months dow jones chief executive richard zannino told employees yesterday news corp executives are expected to spend that time pondering strategies for dow joness businesses and the makeup of management there has been speculation mr murdoch may want to name times of london editor robert thomson to a senior role helping to oversee the journal a person close to news corp said mr thomson is likely to "play a part" at the journal but it wasnt clear exactly how at the same time there are questions about the future of existing dow jones executives particularly publisher gordon crovitz mr murdoch has the flexibility to appoint his own publisher the post isnt covered by an editorial independence agreement negotiated by dow jones which prevents mr murdoch from unilaterally replacing certain other top executives such as the managing editor a person close to the situation said mr murdoch has no intention of replacing any of the senior management "id certainly like to stay " mr crovitz said also in the spotlight is mr zannino who told staff yesterday he hopes to stay at dow jones under its new owner a person familiar with the matter said mr murdoch likes mr zannino and wants him to stay as ceo of dow jones once the deal closes mr murdoch is expected to spend much of his time dealing with dow jones reflecting his habit of focusing intently on new businesses for a period of time before shifting his attention elsewhere while the editorial independence agreement is aimed at stopping mr murdoch from interfering with the journals coverage the news corp chairman is free to voice his opinion about the newspaper mr zannino told employees yesterday numerous journalists both at the journal and elsewhere have raised concerns about mr murdochs history of interfering in his newspapers but mr zannino emphasized that the editorial agreement had enforcement provisions that blocked mr murdoch from making changes at the paper unilaterally "nobody can make us do what we dont want to do " mr zannino said mr murdoch has promised to invest in dow jones particularly its digital properties as well as expanding its editorial presence overseas but in the short term news corp is likely to look for ways of bolstering dow jones newswires a business mr murdoch wants to "aggressively" develop he said in an interview tuesday the unit which employs more than journalists and publishes business news and data on about english language terminals world wide is one of dow joness most profitable but its outlook has been clouded by the reuters thomson deal dow jones newswires doesnt distribute its product directly to institutions but instead uses other companies led by reuters and thomson a combined thomson reuters could make thomson less likely to distribute dow joness content as for potential synergies between the journal and news corp s new business news channel mr zannino hinted that the cnbc agreement may not block other tv channels from access to dow joness "brands and content" when it is related to "nonbusiness journalism " journal opinion page editors appear on news corp s fox news channel and it is possible news corp could expand those kinds of appearances mr murdoch said earlier this week in an interview cnbc says it expects its contract "to be honored " meanwhile some readers voiced their displeasure with the deal in emails and by late yesterday afternoon about of them had canceled their subscriptions citing news corp as the reason the journal has about million print
