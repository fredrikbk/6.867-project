a special counsel for spitzer new york gov eliot spitzer is now traveling the state trying to put a scandal behind him that risks enveloping his administration its going to be a hard task heres what we know thanks to some enterprising reporting by the new york post and an investigation by new york attorney general andrew cuomo two close advisers to the governor apparently used the new york state police to carry out a political smear campaign against me by creating documents designed to generate negative press reports about me and it nearly worked now with an outline of what really happened made public there is only one way forward for mr spitzer he needs to support a full airing of the truth that support must include publicly testifying under oath and making advisers available to publicly testify under oath as part of an independent investigation that should not be limited to a panel of his appointees it would be best to appoint an independent counsel to look into the issue the abuse of power now being alleged is a very serious matter that has placed a cloud over state government it is especially damaging because the scandal involves misusing state troopers and alleged misconduct by the governors top aides including the state assistant secretary for homeland security new yorkers have made it clear in several polls that they believe the governor knew about the smear campaign and should publicly testify about what he knew and when he knew it it is troubling that a governor who campaigned on ethics openness and accountability is now trying to sweep the "troopergate" matter under the rug but it is not surprising this is not an isolated incident it is just the most serious example of a pattern of behavior that raises very serious questions about the governors judgment temperament and ability to govern new york state when mr spitzer took office earlier this year the republican senate majority and i as majority leader pledged to work with him on critical issues such as strengthening our economy creating jobs keeping communities safe and cutting taxes but we quickly found that we did not have a willing partner we found a man who did not respect opposing viewpoints and who verbally threatened those who disagreed with him in his public statements and behind the scenes the governor has refused to work in a bipartisan manner instead he has politicized his office like no other governor in history rather than negotiating and compromising with people who challenged him mr spitzer tried to eliminate them that is dangerous for democracy and this governor does need to be challenged heres a partial list of his unfulfilled campaign promises and misplaced priorities mr spitzer promised to provide tax relief but he proposed a budget that included more than &# billion in new taxes and fees the republicans in the senate stopped these tax hikes and were successful in getting new tax cuts for businesses mr spitzer promised to promote greater economic opportunity but instead worked to block the senates efforts to make new capital investments in key projects to strengthen new yorks economy particularly upstate mr spitzer promised to be tough on crime but he hasnt done anything to help the senates efforts to impose the death penalty for criminals who kill police officers mr spitzer promised property tax relief but has tried to thwart every effort by the senate republicans to provide relief to people paying the highest property taxes in the country mr spitzer promised to work cooperatively with the state legislature but then announced that he would run the government without the legislature by using his state agencies this type of autocratic rule is not what the founding fathers had in mind mr spitzer promised to enact sweeping campaign finance reforms but instead launched one the most hypocritical and aggressive fundraising campaigns ever complete with massive "bundling" of million dollar contributions and promises of access depending on the size of a donation the senate which recently opened a probe of the governors past fundraising practices has been the only institution willing to point out the governors hypocrisy mr spitzer is not shy about using threats and verbal abuse against those who oppose him wall street journal readers will remember that john whitehead formerly chairman of the world trade center memorial foundation detailed on theses pages a bizarre and threatening phone call from then new york attorney general eliot spitzer in the call came after mr whitehead wrote an article for this newspaper critical of mr spitzer there have been profane and abusive phone calls to members of the senate and assembly and of course the governor also admitted that he lied to michael goodwin of the daily news about whether his father helped bankroll his campaign for attorney general in in light of these incidents new yorkers are beginning to raise serious questions about the governors temperament and all of this helps place the "troopergate" scandal in context this most recent abuse of power represents an intentional effort to damage me politically and by extension to destroy the republican majority in the state senate apparently with the state assembly and every statewide office controlled by democrats mr spitzer came to view senate republicans as the only thing standing in his way on this particular point the governor is absolutely correct mr bruno a republican is majority leader of the new york state senate
