design it before you buy it online d tool lets consumers tinker with the product companies are always asking consumers to tell them what they want now consumers can show them that is the idea at least behind a new online marketing tool developed by french software maker dassault systemes sa and french advertising company publicis sa the new so called dswym tool allows consumers to help companies that make everything from yogurt to cars to design their latest products dswym which stands for d see what you mean creates a three dimensional image of a particular product that is still in the design stage then it allows people to go online spin the product around alter it and place it in different contexts such as on a supermarket shelf or in a kitchen cabinet if consumers dont like what the company has proposed they can change it as many times as they like the information is then fed back to the company designing the product the dswym venture which is owned by publicis and owned by dassault is part of a wider effort by advertisers to sink their teeth into the growing market for online ads the european internet advertising market is currently valued at billion euros &# billion and is set to increase to more than billion euros by according to forrester research inc technology and the explosion of internet advertising have blown away the traditional way companies market their products and advertisers and advertising companies are increasingly trying to use them to advantage to gauge consumer interest before it launched its fiat italian car maker fiat spa allowed potential buyers to go online and offer design suggestions the best ideas were made available to clients looking to customize their car online similarly sportswear giant nike inc created nikeid a web site that

internet users to create and share realistic d images online work on dvia started after dassault bought french d software specialist virtools which makes dvias interactive technology in companies that pay to use dswym see their product go through three stages first is the dswym "lab " where consumers see a d image of a package such as a tin can or toothpaste tube and are asked to play around with the color size and shape this is followed by the "fab" stage where the product is viewed at a point of sale such as on a supermarket shelf or in a shop window here too consumers can change the display to their liking finally there is the "on" stage where the finished product is displayed in a virtual d reconstruction of the consumers home or office the consumer can then pick up the object virtually walk around the room and interact with it for example by placing it on a table or in the fridge to ensure enough potential customers log on to dswym publicis plans to lure people online using a mixture of emails and customer lists depending on which type of buyer the manufacturer hopes to attract according to a publicis spokeswoman analysts say getting online customer consensus has advantages people can participate in what are essentially web based focus groups from the comfort of their own homes or offices that makes it easier to test out products on people who have jobs that might not normally allow them to take time out of the day to participate in live focus groups customers are also more likely to be honest online because they arent swayed by other peoples views as they might be during public focus groups consumers should never dictate companies choices however warns patti freeman evans a senior analyst for the retail industry at internet research and advisory firm jupiter research llc "you dont want your customers to be drivers you want them to be navigators " she said moreover some analysts question whether online focus groups are actually effective in terms of gut reactions by consumers sorcha proctor research manager at the internet advertising bureau a u k internet marketing association points out that of a customers response to a particular product is measured in body language "online focus groups will never replace the face to face equivalent it does make a difference to see a good in reality " she says another weakness of the publicis dassault venture analysts say is related to demographics it currently is harder to recruit older people online "as people get comfortable with the internet this is likely to change " responds dassault president and chief executive officer bernard charles "when this happens the imagination is the limit " publicis estimates that companies that use the product can shave about one third off the time it takes to bring a packaged good to market by using a virtual image they can avoid having to create physical samples of the item gather a focus group and then try it out in a test supermarket with the online method customers will feel that they have contributed to the creation of a particular product helping foster brand loyalty "people are working and are interested " says maurice levy publicis chairman and ceo "they want to be creative and they want to participate " publicis whose roster of clients includes car maker renault sa and diesel jeans says it has a number of clients already signed on to the online marketing tool but wont disclose names the reaction of procter &amp gamble co which is a client of publicis but hasnt committed to dswym is mixed doug shelton a p&amp g spokesman said that online marketing methods such as dswym could save the company time and money but only on certain products he also said online customer consultation lacked the depth of face to face meetings "it is attractive from a certain perspective " mr shelton said "as long as it is quick simple and people dont get bored it could work "
