do green appliances live up to their billing energy efficient devices flood market but some owners find results fall short of promises jeanine van voorhees wanted to do her part for the environment when she bought a &# energy saving washing machine but her clothes came out covered in cat hair and her whites were dingy she resorted to washing some loads twice "i curse that machine every time " says ms van voorhees a retired nurse practitioner from north tonawanda n y amid concerns about energy consumption americans are increasingly encouraged to buy energy efficient appliances but while some of the latest products can offer significant energy and water savings they can be double the price or have kinks that can result in clothes and dishes needing to be washed twice still water and energy bills are on the rise in many areas and appliance makers are increasing their offerings of low energy use products a few months ago sears holdings corp unveiled a new line of high efficient appliances including the kenmore elite ultra wash dishwasher that promises to use about half the water of a standard one general electric co this year rolled out several new energy efficient refrigerators such as the profile french door bottom freezer refrigerator that uses at least less energy companies such as bosch and siemens home appliances group and lg group have stepped up their offerings of front load washing machines which have doors in the front and can accommodate bigger loads but save on water an efficient refrigerator wont command much of a premium but energy saving dishwashers and clothes washers can go for double the price of standard models according to the npd group a market research firm in port washington n y the demand for energy star products has fallen slightly in the past year approximately of all dishwashers refrigerators and washing machines sold in the months ended in may were energy star qualified compared with in the year earlier period energy star is the government labeling program for products that meet energy efficient criteria sales of major appliances were &# billion in flat compared with according to npd but environmental advocates point out that the biggest energy sucks arent washing machines and dishwashers many consumers dont realize that an energy guzzling plasma tv can off set the energy savings of kitchen appliances a conventional tv consumes about watts of power per hour while a inch plasma consumes more than twice as much or around watts per hour according to tom reddoch manager of energy use for the electric power research institute a palo alto calif nonprofit organization that promotes the adoption of energy efficient practices and one of the largest energy savings measures is replacing light bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs which use about less energy than standard bulbs still government and local utilities are stepping up incentives to get consumers to shell out more for energy efficient appliances in an effort to ease the burden on regional grids and water supplies pacific gas &amp electric co which serves million people in california this year raised its rebates to &# for clothes washers and &# for dishwashers that meet certain efficiency standards the federal government offers up a &# tax credit for those who install energy efficient air conditioning and heating systems but before buyers hit the showroom floor consumer advocates point out there a few things they should consider while most energy saving appliances perform well some can pose problems for example many consumers dont know they need to use high efficiency soap or half the amount of regular detergent with front loading clothes washers these can use as much as less water than top loaders but regular detergent creates extra suds in this type of washer and is tougher to rinse also the machine senses the suds and uses extra water offsetting savings also some people who bought front loaders have complained of drainage problems that cause mold build up around the edge of the opening and a foul smell several years ago owners of a maytag front loader the neptune filed a lawsuit due to issues with the machines including mold growth and door latch problems the company settled the suit in and agreed to cover repair and replacement costs according jonathan shub a lead counsel on the case whirlpool corp which now owns maytag and sears said mold build up in front loaders is minor and urge consumers to take preventive steps such as cleaning the drum and door seal periodically or leaving the door open when the washer isnt in use front load machines use less water because they cycle the clothes through water at the bottom whereas top load machines fill the entire drum with water front loaders also save energy because they dry clothes better in the spin cycle so clothes need less time in the dryer it isnt just some water saving front loaders that have problems researchers at consumer reports recently found that some traditional top loader washers including the sears kenmore the whirlpool wtwsw and the frigidaire gallery glwsec fail to get clothes clean in the wake of new government mandated energy saving standards for all washers that went into affect in january "consumers cant take it for granted any more that any old washing machine will clean their clothes " says mark connelly senior director of appliance testing for consumer reports whirlpool and sears said the washers were tested on a regular wash cycle when they should have been run on a heavy duty cycle officials for ab electroluxs frigidaire said no one at the company was available to comment the department of energy says complaints about front load and low water washers are limited and said the issues seem to be model specific rather than a problem with the energy saving technology water saving dishwashers too can have drawbacks energy efficient dishwashers often dont use hot air to dry the dishes though they may have a "heat dry" option no heat can make the cycle longer or leave glasses spotty say consumer advocates and retailers appliance experts suggest adding a rinse agent such as jet dry which prevents water from beading and causing marks this however adds another step and additional chemicals to the process owners also shouldnt rinse their dishes before putting them in a water efficient dishwasher that is because most of the new products are equipped to handle bits of food and rinsing dishes beforehand can negate the water savings but some stubborn foods like eggs or oatmeal can still get stuck on dishes some of latest dishwasher models like searss ultra wash aim to address that problem by using better water coverage and putting in more finely tuned sensors to determine dishes dirtiness and adjust water flow accordingly energy efficient builders and energy saving advocates advise that if people want to upgrade to energy efficient appliances they should focus first on refrigerators because unlike a dishwasher or clothes washer they run all the time air conditioning units too tend to be big energy hogs cooling accounts for of total energy use in the average home and refrigerators and freezers account for according to government data compiled by the american council for an energy efficient economy a nonprofit group in washington d c the energy used doing laundry and dishes combined accounts for just according to the council however in areas where water is a big cost a water saving washer or dishwasher may be a preferable investment
