erasing un from unemployable walgreen program trains the disabled to take on regular wage paying jobs anderson s c like many people with autism harrison mullinax a pale redheaded year old with a serious expression speaks in a monotonous halting voice and sometimes struggles to concentrate on tasks unlike most who are autistic he now has a real job mr mullinax works eight hours a day at a new walgreen co distribution center where he wields a bar code scanner checking in boxes of merchandise bound for the companys drugstores from his paycheck he tithes to his church and sometimes treats his mother to dinner at kennys a local buffet restaurant an innovative program at the distribution center is offering jobs to people with mental and physical disabilities of a nature that has frequently deemed them "unemployable " while saving walgreen money through automation "it answered a prayer " says mr mullinaxs mother vikki who gets him up for work at each morning before sending him off to the bus for work "its given us the hope that at some point harrison can live with minimal assistance " a number of large employers such as mcdonalds corp and wal mart stores inc recruit people with disabilities to be cashiers maintenance workers or store greeters at home depot inc developmentally disabled workers stock shelves clean displays and help customers find items home depot has been working with a nonprofit organization called kens kids which was formed a decade ago by a group of parents seeking employment opportunities for their young adult children and has placed more than people in stores in addition smaller businesses around the nation have made a goal of employing workers passed over by other companies still executives at walgreen and the social services agencies working with it believe the companys program has a larger number of disabled employees doing more sophisticated work than is typically available to people with mental and physical challenges mr mullinax like many of walgreens employees with disabilities learned his job in a large metal clad shed minutes down the road from the distribution center there trainees learn how to work in one of three departments "case check in " where workers initially receive merchandise "de trash " where they unpack the goods and "picking " where they sort the products into tubs based on individual store orders the distribution center opened in january at a cost of &# million it currently employs people more than of whom have various disabilities and it is more efficient than the companys older facilities on some days disabled employees are its most productive workers "one thing we found is they can all do the job " says randy lewis a senior vice president of distribution and logistics at walgreen which is based in deerfield ill "what surprised us is the environment that its created its a building where everybody helps each other out " when they make the transition to the distribution center disabled employees at first have a job coach those needing it learn social skills from the importance of wearing deodorant to finding appropriate conversation topics the idea began four years ago when mr lewis was evaluating new technology that could make walgreens next round of distribution centers far more automated than in the past mr lewis asked could walgreen make the work simple enough to employ people with cognitive disabilities for him the question was personal his year old son austin has autism "im keenly aware of the lack of opportunities for kids like that " he says among people with the disability the unemployment rate can be as high as according to social service agencies because employing disabled people wasnt expected to affect the distribution centers costs or efficiency it wasnt difficult for mr lewis to persuade the walgreen board and david bernauer then the companys chief executive and now its chairman to try the project "the fact that we can use disabled people for this was a great plus " mr bernauer says "it didnt move the needle on the business decision " as part of the program walgreen converted its computer displays from lines of type to touch screens with a few icons it persuaded vendors to include more information in bar codes on merchandise so that employees wouldnt have to enter so much data themselves it redesigned work stations so that people dont have to stretch as far and it added help buttons to summon assistance instead of posting printed cards to remind workers about having their bags inspected walgreen shows a video of someone opening a bag angela campbell the facilitys career outreach coordinator suggested adding pictures to numbered work stations in the "de trash" area where workers remove merchandise from boxes and prepare it to be sorted for individual stores there are images of farm animals ms campbell who has cerebral palsy and carefully maneuvers the buildings many flights of stairs tells employees they should feel comfortable asking her awkward questions about why someone looks or behaves a certain way "i know what its like to fight your whole life to have an employer look past your disability " she says all workers are constantly monitored to track whether theyre meeting productivity goals one day workers with disabilities topped the productivity list in three major departments says keith scarbrough the distribution centers manager many trainees volunteer their time to learn sometimes spending as much as a year without pay anderson county arranges transportation for many employees to get to work walgreen estimates that if it reaches its goal of employing workers with disabilities the value of the government benefits it receives will be about &# million starting pay at the distribution center is &# an hour climbing to &# an hour after two years the disabilities of workers at the center run the gamut and present the supervisory staff with a variety of challenges desiree neff struggles with her balance and uses a walker her year old son and co worker troy mayben is legally blind recently ms neff wanted to learn how to operate a forklift so she could expand her skills but she didnt have a place to put her walker an engineer devised a clamp that attaches the walker to the forklift in another case managers didnt know what to do about a disruptive employee who screamed "hello " every morning some argued that the behavior was part of the workers disability but deb russell the career outreach manager for walgreen reasoned "we dont allow anyone else to do that " she instructed workers to ignore his shouting within two days she says he stopped as for vikki mullinax she says now that harrison is working she can spend more time with her her husband and year old daughter harrison "has improved tremendously " she says harrison mullinax says he has made friends and he likes being paid working at walgreen he says has taught him how to offer help to others and "not to cuss anybody out "
