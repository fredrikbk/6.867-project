why piano owned by john lennon is touring america it pops up in places known for violence and tragedy from waco to virginia tech the piano on which john lennon composed "imagine " his famous ode to peace and healing is on a yearlong magical mystery tour of the u s with a macabre twist the nutmeg colored steinway upright believed to have been in mr lennons country home in ascot england is crisscrossing the country to show up at some of the nations most horrific sites of violence death and destruction it has popped up here and there with little fanfare transported by white gloved attendants in a moving truck who carefully unload the instrument to display it in parking lots grassy fields and on street corners british pop singer george michael and his longtime partner kenny goss a dallas gallery owner are the force behind the tour mr michael bought the piano from a private collector at a sotheby auction for &# million in he had kept it at the couples country home outside london occasionally playing it for guests and using it to record some tracks on his "patience" album so far the exhibit has been greeted with a mixture of skepticism reverence and queasiness when libra lagrone a music curator at the ogden museum of southern art in new orleans was first approached in may about showing the piano in the hurricane ravaged city she thought it was "creepy " she says she researched the project on the internet to satisfy herself that it was legitimate "then i saw what it was doing for people " she said lori blanc a virginia tech ph d candidate in biological sciences is a huge john lennon fan but she was still surprised at how she was drawn to the piano "i am a scientist and not a sentimental person " said ms blanc the piano was displayed on the campus of virginia tech in blacksburg va where students were massacred by a lone gunman in april people drove from as far away as washington d c on memorial day weekend to see it some wanted the chance to play "imagine" or other songs on it others simply ran their fingers over the cigarette burns mr lennon had left on it ms blanc spent more than an hour with the piano playing a song she had composed for a friend who was murdered a few years ago "it was symbolic and healing " she said the piano hasnt always been welcomed administrators at columbine high school outside denver still suffering from publicity fatigue eight years after two students killed people there in refused to allow the piano on the school campus and officials at fords theater in washington where president lincoln was assassinated ignored requests that they play host to it when it showed up anyway one morning on the sidewalk in front of the theater actors rushed out to see it messrs michael and goss shipped the instrument to dallas to appear at a goss gallery exhibit of war photography "we thought the piano provided a great juxtaposition " mr goss said in an email from russia where he was accompanying mr michael on a world concert tour the success of the gallery appearance led to the countrywide tour of disquieting places which messrs michael and goss call "the imagine piano peace project " messrs goss and michael arent making any appearances with the piano they chose caroline true a veteran music video producer from britain to choreograph the instruments tour which they hope to turn into a video and book with the proceeds going to a charity yet to be named "there is a sense of oddity about the whole thing " said ms true "but it is odd in such a kind quirky way " in the past four months the piano has been to more than sites from the memphis motel now a museum where martin luther king jr was assassinated in to a texas prison on the eve of an execution it showed up at a ceremony commemorating the lives lost during the oklahoma city bombing in then hours later was unveiled in waco texas at a service for the members of a religious sect known as the branch davidians who died in a blaze after a day standoff with federal officials "it gives people a distraction from grief and its been a silent peace protest of sorts " ms true said while planning the piano road trip ms true also wanted to include lesser known though no less horrible tragedies she searched the words "violent crime" on google along with the names of towns along their route thats how the piano came to texarkana a city of about on the texas arkansas border that is still haunted by the unsolved murders of five young people by a man only known as the phantom killer the murders were the subject of a movie called "the town that dreaded sundown " ms true planted the piano at a park near where the body of year old paul martin was found shot a local musician played "imagine" for a handful of spectators when the piano arrived in new orleans a few days later ms true faced another quandary "where do you put the piano in this enormous amount of devastation " she wondered a local man suggested the ogden museum one of the first cultural institutions to reopen after s hurricane katrina after overcoming her initial skepticism ms lagrone the curator arranged for the piano to share the stage with one of the performers at the museums weekly concerts "we all had our pictures taken with the piano and were not the type to take pictures with famous musicians " said ms lagrone while letting ms true run the show messrs michael and goss did insist on one stop for the piano the home of gabi and alec clayton in olympia wash whose story they found while researching gay hate crimes on the internet twelve years ago the claytons year old son killed himself after suffering a beating at his high school by an antigay gang the tour has paused for now while ms true wraps up business in london and the piano rests in the home messrs goss and michael share in dallas it is to be displayed this summer at a local mall ms true hopes to resume the tour with an appearance on near the world trade center site ground zero has special poignancy for ms true who had arrived in new york just hours before the bombing and watched the second tower fall from the balcony of a soho hotel with singer lenny kravitz fittingly she expects to conclude the tour in december at the dakota the manhattan building where john lennon lived and died at the hands of mark david chapman in mr lennons widow yoko ono was
