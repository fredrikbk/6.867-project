not income at all congress is trying to decide whether hedge fund profits should continue to be taxed as capital gains or as ordinary income meanwhile democratic presidential aspirant john edwards has come out in favor of sharply raising the tax rate on long term capital gains to from whether these proposals are a good idea is partly a function of economics what will they do to the stock market and economic growth but there is also a philosophical question what in principle is the right way to tax capital gains historically the first time the federal government taxed capital gains at all was during the civil war when a short lived income tax was in effect after the war a case came before the supreme court gray v darlington in which it was argued that capital gains were not income the court concluded that the sale of some bonds for more than their purchase price did not constitute taxable income because the interest was the income and it was taxed said the court "the mere fact that property has advanced in value between the date of its acquisition and sale does not authorize the imposition of the tax on the amount of the advance mere advance in value in no sense constitutes the gains profits or income specified by the statute it constitutes and can be treated merely as increase of capital " repeal of the civil war income tax essentially made this case moot and when a permanent federal income tax was instituted in the internal revenue service ignored gray v darlington taxing capital gains along with everything else it could lay its hands on when another capital gains case reached the supreme court its first reaction was to uphold its earlier decision that capital gains were not income in lynch v turrish the court said that realizing a capital gain simply constituted an asset conversion into cash not the creation of income that did not previously exist "such advance in value is not income at all but merely increase of capital and not subject to a tax as income " the following year the supreme court further ruled in eisner v macomber that a stock dividend was not income "enrichment through increase in value of capital investment is not income in any proper meaning of the term " the court declared despite these decisions the irs continued to tax capital gains when taxpayers challenged this practice lower courts took the view that the supreme court had definitively found capital gains not to be income thus in brewster v walsh a federal district court ruled against the irss taxation of a capital gain saying "the sale of capital results only in changing its form and like the mere issue of a stock dividend makes the recipient no richer than before " in short what the courts were trying to say is that there is a fundamental difference between income and capital the former exhibited regularity as do wages interest and regular dividends in the case of income from capital its essential quality is that it could be separated from the underlying asset without diminishing its value indeed without the flow of income the asset would have no value what value would a bond have without interest the great economist irving fisher came up with an analogy that precisely delineates the basic difference between income and capital think of a fruit bearing tree the tree both grows and yields fruit on an annual basis the tree is effectively a capital asset the fruit is the income and growth of the size of the tree which will yield more fruit in the future is like a capital gain the fruit can be taxed without hurting the tree or diminishing its capital its ability to grow and bear more fruit in the future but taxing a capital gain is like sawing off limbs of the tree that diminishes its capital value and inhibits the trees ability to produce fruit that is to say future income but court rulings and widespread support among economists at that time for distinguishing between income and capital gains changed nothing the irs continued to insist that capital gains were income subject to taxation despite no specific reference to capital gains in the tax code in those days unfortunately the supreme court eventually came around to the irs view and reversed itself in merchants loan and trust v smietanka capital gains have been taxed by the federal government ever since in the s economists were largely persuaded that capital gains were income after all most now subscribe to the so called haig simons definition of income which would tax all consumption plus the change in net worth between two points in time but on this view not only would realized gains be fully taxable so would unrealized gains in other words a tax on wealth and indeed some liberal tax reformers periodically suggest just that some have said that the haig simons principle requires taxing such things as the imputed rent that homeowners in effect pay to themselves for living in their own home the economic value of household production by a nonworking spouse babysitting cleaning cooking etc and other forms of "income" that most people would consider outlandish nevertheless there is still a fundamental distinction between income and capital that remains unresolved since the s congress has basically split the difference by leaving unrealized gains untaxed and generally taxing realized gains at reduced rates however a strong case can still be made that capital gains really shouldnt be taxed at all the right rate for capital gains might be zero mr bartlett was an economist at the treasury department in the administration of president george h w bush see related letters "letters to the editor additions to bolster an otherwise capital idea" wsj aug
