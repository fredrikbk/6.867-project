spectators to genocide four years dead and two million displaced people later the united nations has finally authorized a peacekeeping contingent for sudans darfur region good intentions and eternal hope aside this latest mission looks ready made to continue the u n s sorry record on stopping genocide the troops a combination of the current strong african union force and a new u n brigade will be stretched to cover an area the size of france but the bigger handicap of the "hybrid" force is its mandate watered down by china and russia which blocked tougher action this is what happens when "consensus" is given higher priority than achieving actual security on the ground the resolution approved tuesday by a unanimous vote of the security council goes out of its way to respect sudanese sovereignty fine as that goes except that khartoum has consistently invoked "sovereignty" to prevent peacekeepers from interfering in the mass murder of darfurs black africans the composition of the force itself will be done "in consultation" with sudan which has insisted that it stay strictly african a limitation that if accepted would ensure that troops will be difficult to mobilize african countries have hesitated to fill out the ranks of other african union missions and the first troop offers yesterday came from france denmark and indonesia in any case the troops ability to use force will be severely limited by another concession to sudan the soldiers will not be allowed to seize weapons from the government supported janjaweed killers the darfur rebels fighting against khartoum or other wandering thugs toting guns instead they will "monitor whether any arms or related material are present in darfur " if they find any oh well the resolution also removes sticks to get sudan to cease hostilities and let the u n troops and humanitarian groups do their work as originally worded backsliding would have triggered the threat of sanctions no more chinas ambassador to the u n wang guangya said the resolution was intended "to authorize the launch of a hybrid operation rather than exert pressure or impose sanctions " according to a u n summary of delegations statements more accurately the resolution is intended to suggest the u n is finally doing something about darfur and thus shield china from growing criticism that it is protecting khartoum in the s slaughterhouses of rwanda and bosnia the road to genocide was paved by u n peacekeepers blue helmets armed with weak mandates stood by powerless or were even exploited by the ethnic cleansers to enable their killing sprees after watching nearly a million rwandans murdered in the west realized that the u n mission in bosnia was also doomed to failure nato countries finally stepped in to stop bosnias war with the credible use of force and diplomatic pressure now the same u n mistakes may be repeated in sudan khartoum wont tolerate a potent force in the absence of outside pressure and china and russia wont permit the u n to apply that pressure liberal moralists calling on the world to "do something" in sudan while also putting faith in the u n above all else need to face up to this contradiction otherwise there will be more rwandas bosnias and darfurs
