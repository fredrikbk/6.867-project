informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources technology so this computer walks into a bar scientists have taught a computer program to recognize a particular kind of joke a small but significant early step toward creating robots with a sense of humor reports michael reilly in the new scientist the human sense of humor is so subjective and complex that researchers have focused on getting robots to solve easier problems such as recognizing objects but julia taylor and lawrence mazlack of the university of cincinnati have managed to develop a program that allows computers to recognize some puns to be sure the puns it gets are generally groaners and the programs appreciation of them is purely mechanical the scientists gave their program a database of words and examples of how the words can be related to each other when the program analyzes a passage it uses that knowledge to find a word that doesnt fit with the words around it when an outlier appears the program checks a pronunciation guide for similar sounding words that would make better sense in the sentence if a more logical term is identified the program flags the sentence as a pun new scientist offers the example of a boy who tells his mother that he has been in the garden so much because "teacher told me to weed a lot " the program recognizes that "weed" doesnt go well with "teacher" and that the similar sounding "read" would be a better fit as far as the scientists are concerned the computer gets the joke the program doesnt spot all puns however a patient says "doctor doctor i swallowed a bone " "are you choking " the doctor asks "no i really did " the patient replies the computer doesnt recognize this as a joke because the punning word "choking" makes sense in the context of a doctors office new scientist aug fish stocking rivers can put right trout in wrong place the effort to save trout in the u s is no longer just about keeping raw numbers high says robert m poole a contributing editor of smithsonian magazine but also about having the right kind of trout in the right area of the four major trout species in the u s rainbow brook cutthroat and brown only the brown trout was introduced from abroad but any of the four might be considered invasive when brought into a new watershed mr poole says nonnative trout species were spread as part of efforts to stock rivers for fishing the new arrivals crowded out indigenous species threatening the diversity of trout some of the worst hit are cutthroat trout which despite their tough name faced competition for food and habitats the loss in diversity has prompted conservationists to pay attention to restoring habitats montanas experience offers one model says mr poole the state largely abandoned its trout stocking program decades ago it now uses revenue from the fishing tourism industry to improve trout habitats many wild trout populations have come back as a result smithsonian magazine august education time pressures elevate role of college rankings even though some colleges are opting out of annual rankings such as those published by u s news &amp world report the lists carry enormous weight with applicants says alan l contreras an administrator for oregons student financial aid agency that is because the huge and growing time pressures on students encourage them to rely on rankings instead of doing their own research into schools the "lust for speed " as mr contreras puts it has focused many students on the same few institutions that are easily spotted through their top rankings but choosing a school quickly compounds the message sent to students that college is not "a place for dalliance casual exploration personal discovery or heaven forbid changing ones mind partway through and starting off in another direction " inside higher ed july see more on our blog at wsj com informedreader send comments to informedreader wsj com
