how one firm mined the student loan mess tiny myrichuncle draws new clients after taking on college financial aid system in recent weeks a small student loan company has taken out ads in usa today californias orange county register and other major newspapers touting itself as "conflict free " those words are surrounded by a collage of headlines citing recent revelations about conflicts of interest in the student loan industry the ad is by mru holdings inc better known as new york based myrichuncle and it comes exactly one year after the maverick lender took out a string of strongly worded ads that some credit with having sparked investigations into questionable relationships between colleges and lenders a number of lenders had allegedly been offering incentives to university financial aid officials in exchange for getting on the "preferred lender lists" that schools hand out to prospective student borrowers now with families trust in their college financial aid officials broken more people are looking to alternative resources for student loans such as internet search engines and lenders that pitch directly to the consumer and many of them are turning specifically to myrichuncle the company says calls from customers increased last month from a year earlier a spokeswoman declined to disclose the actual numbers of queries it gets or loans it provides but the company says originations of its main private student loan product more than doubled in the fiscal year ended june compared with a year earlier and federal loan applications in just the past month have more than tripled myrichuncle "is a beneficiary of consumers exercising their choice to shop around " says vishal garg chief financial officer regulators caution that borrowers still must be vigilant and not assume they are getting the best deal by avoiding college financial aid offices the office of new york attorney general andrew cuomo which conducted intense probes of schools preferred lender lists says it has now begun looking into internet based and direct to consumer marketing practices too "we need to ensure that we rid not only the preferred lender list of conflicts but also eliminate any deceptive practices taking place on the direct marketing side " says benjamin lawsky deputy counselor and special assistant to the new york attorney general who declined to name any specific companies being targeted amid all this myrichuncle which says it hasnt been contacted by mr cuomos office is enjoying its surge the tiny lender which has yet to make a profit since going public in made a name for itself in a short period of time it had been carving out a promising niche by promoting its competitively priced products directly to the consumer it was the newspaper ads last year targeting preferred lender lists that brought the company national attention such lists were a long established practice whereby colleges steered students toward specific lenders financial aid officers have said the practice helps whittle down the confusing array of choices in the marketplace as a result the vast majority of students end up borrowing from one of the listed lenders even though they dont necessarily offer the best deals one of the mru ads called the relationships between schools and lenders a "racket " another said more pointedly "before you choose ask your financial aid office about the lenders on their preferred lender list ask if any of these lenders offered kickbacks or incentives to get on the list " by taking aim at financial aid officers who form an important link to customers myrichuncle was taking a big risk and indeed reaction was swift and sharp at the university of the south in sewanee tenn financial aid director david gelinas sent an email to a myrichuncle representative saying "please do not visit or contact me " the university of mississippis associate director of financial aid dewey knight sent an email to a myrichuncle sales representative saying he would "not receive or certify loan requests from your company " lisa cain whose daughter is attending a private college in boston says that the schools financial aid office resisted when she said she was considering myrichuncle she had received a list of recommended lenders from the college but decided to shop around as she began noticing headlines about schools cozy relationships with banks another parent recommended myrichuncle to ms cain an administrative assistant in tequesta fla for their discounts on federal student loans ultimately she chose mru over the objections of the school and says she has been pleased "the bottom line is this is a lot of money " says ms cain "i need to go with the best interest rate " attorney general cuomos probe into colleges lending arrangements has led more than two dozen schools including columbia university in new york and drexel university in philadelphia to settle claims of deceptive trade practices involving undisclosed payments from lenders financial aid officials at some of the best known schools in the country have lost their jobs for taking stock or other payments from student loan firms and some of the biggest student loan firms have reached settlements with mr cuomos office totaling about &# million just yesterday mr cuomo announced that he subpoenaed universities as his investigation expands to possible deals between university athletic departments and student loan companies myrichuncle was founded by two former classmates at new yorks elite public stuyvesant high school raza khan and mr garg both are children of indian immigrants who grew up in the citys queens borough both attended new york university on scholarships and started on their career paths separately from their dorm rooms mr garg traded stocks for a hedge fund mr khan built web sites for companies they came together again on myrichuncle which floundered in its first few years the venture launched in with a novel investment idea matching student borrowers with an investor "a rich uncle " but it didnt take off then the founders noticed opportunity in one segment of student loans those that arent backed by the federal government because federal law limits what students can borrow through less expensive government backed loans rising tuition costs are forcing more students to borrow from private lenders this market has more than tripled in the past five years to &# billion according to the new york based college board the company went public in entered the private loan market in and a year later unveiled a niche private loan using a pricing model they believed could predict a students future ability to pay they targeted students who were being denied traditional private loans these were students who didnt have a co signer or whose parents had bad or no credit history for instance recent immigrants they took into account such metrics as grades major and school attended no parent co signer would be required and the interest rate was based on a future ability to pay mr khan believes lenders turn away about of private loan applicants a potentially &# billion a year market last june myrichuncle entered the federal student loan business but with a twist most lenders offer popular federally backed student loans at maximum interest rates that are set by the government currently on the most common program known as a stafford loan and on the parent loan for undergraduate students or plus to draw business many lenders discount those rates after a certain number of on time payments but because young borrowers often slip up many dont qualify for the discounts myrichuncle offers a steep discount on those rates from the get go for stafford and for plus though still charging an origination fee totaling of the original principal balance which other lenders might waive by offering a steep discount myrichuncle hopes to attract customers to its other potentially more lucrative private loans another twist the product would be marketed directly to students and not through schools financial aid offices but its larger rivals had a near lock on prospective borrowers via the college preferred lender lists so the company took out its now notorious ads in major national newspapers one ad that ran last summer said "you need to know that going through your financial aid office may cost you a premium the only way to be sure youre getting the best rate is to go direct " following the widely publicized lending investigations officials at myrichuncle say they feel vindicated the company is still hemorrhaging money in the six months ended dec its net loss was &# million compared with &# million a year earlier but mr khan says those losses are narrowing as it builds its portfolio milk money after tapping personal funds such as plans or other savings first exhaust free money such as grants and scholarships then turn to subsidized federal loans such as stafford and plus loans for parents which have low interest rates then there are private loans which can carry higher interest rates
