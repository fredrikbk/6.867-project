wonder land barry bonds and the egg two eternal puzzles what came first the chicken or the egg what came second barry bonds or numbskull celebrities much as wed prefer to ponder the miracles of the egg life insists that we instead decipher mr bonds mr vick ms lohan mr donaghys nba and the drug addled messieurs of the tour de france wall street journal style prefers the prefix "mr " for all but famous men of history an admirable but perhaps quaint bow to an era when the world was not filling so fast with individuals content in disrepute you can begin to guess where this is going but some qualifying pushback is in order barry bonds is being booed across mr aarons home run record at the same time tom glavine is gutting out his th pitching victory an everest not likely to be scaled again in modern baseball michael vick and the details of the dogs indictment are off the charts not even close to routine knifings in strip bars the price fixing allegations against nba ref tim donaghy are one mans fall lindsay lohan is a celebrity gone nuts ah almost forgot the real world the fbi this week searched the alaska home of seven term u s sen ted stevens yes indeedy weve been this way before but the celebrity breakdown cycle has ramped up from once a year to once a month to once a week at this rate their behavior will be the norm and youll be the weirdos how did this happen i now take it as an article of faith that marketing rules the world marketing is an ancient business tool but unlike some other artifacts of the past product marketing is a perfect fit for the age of electronic mass media the web has been marketings manhattan project and like iran everyone wants access to marketings mysterious sometimes dark powers take the youtube snowman in the recent democratic debate this week the snowman is being discussed as the latest unfathomable alien from planet web will it ruin politics as we know it yawn almost certainly the two brothers who created the snowman are working on extending the brand beyond politics for better or worse professional sports of course have always been a business babe ruth was no role model but mr ruths great charisma and celebrity the ruthian "brand" pulled baseball into the big time even so baseball operated for decades as a nice family business with the fame of the games stars largely limited to televised games and sports writing back then an egg was just an egg barry bonds came into the game in a time of cloning all sciences advance including business science sophisticated new business techniques of marketing and branding names across platforms powered by the rocket fuel of electronic media made it possible to "stretch" a sport far beyond the last out or buzzer the seer charles barkley once said "you got guys who cant even play that got jerseys shoes and everything " the players became platforms outside the game for selling shoes brands "and everything " like nascar drivers the shirts of the tour de france racers are festooned with product logos but consumers arent going to buy stuff promoted by any palooka professional athletes were tutored that part of the deal was they had to pump extra hang time into their personalities and if they couldnt do that the guys making the nike commercials would do it for them in the early days journalists derided this as "hype " but even the press eventually signed on and suddenly lumpen athletes and entertainers had "attitude" and "edge " this was now admirable fiddling with personality is tricky business some guys are just normal people with high physical skill sets barry bonds and michael vick come to mind actors project personality too but theyre acting and know it when the camera goes off they slump back to normality more or less tiger woods or roger federer seems to understand this but one gets the impression that many more of this new generation of marketed stars eventually forget that its an act theyre allowed to become larger than little old life unto personality explosion they flip do bad things do we want more of this behavior or less of it the problem with more on its current upward trajectory is that they besmirch colleagues and circles of life beyond their own personal catastrophes and to the extent we all "get the news" from the wonderful web it is hard to avoid the sense that one is living in a shameful time now comes the part the thousands of high iq people buying all those the god is dreadful books dont want to hear marketing and branding dont force anyone to cheat a zillion commentaries on these sports scandals have said its all about "integrity" and "character " but where does that come from you have to learn this stuff somewhere it isnt in the water it has to be reinforced through repetition the same way the real barry bonds practiced his way to phenomenal ball contact skills better behavior through repetition maybe barry bonds and the tour de france cyclists should drop into a church more often than never to get "dont cheat" reinforced got a better way to learn it perhaps we really could slide by without religion if the schools the traditional incubator of civic virtues hadnt been rendered values neutral by court decisions and anti virtue ideologues parents where are they supposed to get it watching the discovery channel the simple idea that mr bonds and ms lohan ought to go find something resembling a church to offset the compulsions of modern life drives the no religion people nuts if so they should stop making funny jokes about sprinkling holy water and start proposing an alternative way to learn integrity self respect and character that will have a longer shelf life than "dont be evil " commenting in the new york times last sunday former pro cyclist joe papp now serving a two year drug violation ban summed up the predicament "you are so focused on the travel the training the money and what a wonderful life you are having that you dont realize how far down the slope you have slid " that is a world without ballast at least its fun see related letter "letters to the editor where morals come from" wsj aug
