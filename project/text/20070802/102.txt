style tricks of the trade a nose puts on perfume camille goutal loves to douse herself in perfume but when she rides the paris metro to her work studio every morning she doesnt want her fragrance to nauseate other commuters "i try to respect people around me " says ms goutal the "nose " or official perfume creator for french fragrance house annick goutal ms goutal whose mother annick goutal founded the niche perfume brand has a high tolerance for smell as a child she watched her mother blend aromas at home in her two room work studio she is virtually immune to the intense scent that results from the hundreds of tiny vials of liquid so when the year old mother of two wants to wear one of her strongest perfumes such as guerlains mitsouko she turns to a routine she has developed for perfuming herself thoroughly but subtly it starts the night before she wears the perfume as she sprays it lightly on the outfit she plans to wear the next day "the smell of a perfume changes less on clothes than when it is applied to the skin " ms goutal says in the morning she leans over and sprays the nape of her neck a couple of times then holding the bottle a few inches away she mists her hair with the scent though only lightly since the alcohol in perfume can make hair dry she dresses in the clothes she has misted the night before the perfume is less noticeable than if she sprayed the same amount directly on herself with some scents she refreshes herself throughout the day light perfumes fade more quickly so she reapplies them as often as three more times with heavier smells like vanilla and gardenia which last longer ms goutal sprays herself only once more in the evening ms goutal chooses her perfume for the moment based on her mood not the season or the time of day she is also liberal in mixing fragrances if she starts the day with a fresh citrus flavor she will often switch to an oriental smell later in the afternoon but the opposite doesnt work light scents cant go over heavier ones she says many people end up buying perfumes they dont like because they choose them too quickly she says when in a perfume store shoppers should pick the two or three scents they like best apply them and then wait an hour before making a decision she recommends because the smell can change within that time "if its a good perfume you wont even notice it after a while " she says
