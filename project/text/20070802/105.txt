the long battle to end a war rites of peace by adam zamoyski harpercollins pages &# in a bavarian prince and military leader then fighting napoleons grand armee told his king amid the final campaigns of the war "i would have to write a novel if i were to describe to your majesty all the incredible things that have passed " indeed there is something majestic about napoleons downfall it completed a classical dramatic arc of hubris and ambition bringing about nemesis and defeat the congress of vienna convened to rearrange europe after napoleons defeat provided a fitting coda to the story it was filled with drama of its own and it ended up as a classic case study in the ordeal of peacemaking in "rites of peace " adam zamoyski recounts the story of the viennese conclave with a novelists flair and eye for character the popular image of the congress of vienna juxtaposes cold cynicism diplomats redrawing maps and transferring souls with the waltzing frivolity of its lavish entertainments but the apparently superficial aspects of the gathering mr zamoyski shows played a part in the geopolitics policies in short mixed with jealousies and personal resentments not to mention love affairs "rites of peace" neatly captures it all the congress of vienna is really a shorthand phrase for negotiations that began after napoleons failed invasion of russia in and continued up to his final defeat at waterloo in when napoleon proved unable to bring europe including russia under his control statesmen began working to secure a stable peace as the fighting continued austrias emperor francis and his chancellor metternich aimed to mediate an agreement that would end the war short of the total conquest of france but prussia russia and above all britain took a much harder line and napoleon himself refused to bend telling metternich that without the prestige of victory his power would be lost peace simply could not be had on napoleons terms and his adversaries eventually joined in the long standing british view that his ambition and vanity made compromise impossible diplomatic efforts to sustain the allied coalition against france or to find an early peace shifted along with the fortunes of war mr zamoyski describes a kind of rolling summit meeting sovereigns and ministers took the field with their armies and campaigns became conferences contingent events especially battles upset the best laid plans napoleons victory at bautzen in may over russian and prussian forces checked the allies and gave napoleon the initiative but he threw it away with an armistice at plesswitz in june meant to make way for negotiations the pause in the fighting as a russian general put it "saved us and condemned him " thereafter the balance shifted dramatically against napoleon lest we forget given the prominence of waterloo there was peace with france a year before that famous battle when paris was occupied by the allies napoleon abdicated and the bourbons returned to power it was this "first" peace that set the stage for the wider european settlement negotiated in vienna the conclave began in the fall of one wonders how anything got done amid the balls and amorous liaisons we see alexander i of russia hosting a ball for children and joining in their fun metternich pining over the duchess of sagan who had left him for another man and britains lord castlereagh astounding the viennese with an impromptu sing along after an evenings festivities since many social events were public the common people or at least their upper bourgeois representatives found themselves in closer contact with sovereigns and statesmen than ever before alexander is the villain of the early negotiations in mr zamoyskis telling he betrayed his liberal instincts by agreeing to the restoration of the old order rather than implementing the enlightenment ideals of his youth the french minister talleyrand by contrast wins mr zamoyskis praise for playing a weak hand to french advantage at least until napoleon spoiled the plot with his return and return napoleon did for the famous hundred days beginning in march the allies setting aside their disputes mobilized quickly and crushed him decisively but victory at waterloo did not remove the specter of revolution indeed it made the restoration of the old order seem all the more fragile for much of europe napoleons despotism had followed inevitably from the murderous anarchy of the french revolution what was feared upon napoleons defeat was yet more revolution what was needed was stability thus the leading powers in what mr zamoyski calls "the arrest of europe" combined after the napoleonic wars to monitor internal developments against revolutionary fervor the allies suppressed unrest in spain and italy and metternich cracked down on political activity within germany mr zamoyski condemns such actions arguing that they thwarted the flourishing of oppressed nationalities who wished merely to be free of foreign domination he is particularly bothered about the fate of poland it had been partitioned before the war between russia austria and prussia and "liberated" by napoleon who had restored the duchy of warsaw but the congress of vienna quashed polish hopes once again as the allies redrew the map of europe mr zamoyski quotes metternichs secretary friedrich von gentz describing the aim of the victors as the division of spoils stolen from the vanquished in fairness mr zamoyski gives the opposing case noting that the vienna settlement can be seen as the creation of a stable flexible order out of the wreckage of a dangerously wobbly ancient regime and it is the opposing case that convinces whatever its limitations vienna set up a durable european system that lasted a full century from to it was a century of material prosperity political and social improvement and except for a few short wars peace set against the disastrous versailles conference in and the decades of total war that defined the th century the congress of vienna looks absolutely inspired woodrow wilson disparaged the "odor of vienna " but the prudential realism of metternich and the other statesmen in vienna gave more scope for human aspiration than wilsons grand moralistic design perhaps such realism is coming back into fashion mr hay is a historian at mississippi state university and co editor of "is there still a west
