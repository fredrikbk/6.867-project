weekend journal review books what a time in america heyday by kurt andersen random house pages &# the year is enjoying something of a revival lately the playwright tom stoppard chose it for the setting of "shipwreck " the second part of his "coast of utopia" trilogy currently playing to packed houses in new york now the same year provides kurt andersen with the context for "heyday " his second novel since he was a co founder of the satirical monthly magazine spy and is co editor of the recent anthology "spy the funny years " the first thing to note about "heyday" is that is not one of the funny years mr andersens first fiction outing "turn of the century" was set in the near future and very much of a piece with spy in its mocking of manhattans hothouse media scene "heyday" is something completely different a conventional historical novel with more drama in it than comedy coming from mr andersen this is a surprise but not as it turns out an unpleasant one in "heyday " the new media stars of the s are ink stained newspapermen like horace greeley and walt whitman and the trendy restaurant of choice is the dining room at the astor house menu specialty "small birds italian style " it is at the astor one spring day that a young english traveler named ben knowles looks up from his menu and spots lovely polly lucking at a nearby table tucking into a plate of "calfs head in brain sauce " smitten ben pursues polly and so is introduced to america polly is an actress and part time prostitute her brother duff is a firefighter an arsonist and an embittered veteran of the mexican war together the luckings comprise the yin and yang of young america this is the tumultuous era of manifest destiny when an adolescent nation has just reached its physical maturity and is waiting impatiently for its brain to catch up the buoyantly idealistic polly is a proto feminist and an incipient environmentalist eager to explore the utopian communities springing up in the hinterlands duff is the dark side god haunted paranoid increasingly prone to violence such sibling earnestness requires a foil and "heyday" has one in the form of the luckings friend timothy skaggs a cheerfully cynical journalist who dabbles in that newly invented medium photography since ben knowles has just arrived from london skaggs interviews him to get the latest news about the revolutions sweeping europe that spring in due course he takes the englishman under his wing and tutors him in new world ways not that skaggs has to try very hard ben is eager to embrace america beginning with polly the standard plot progression ensues boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl mr andersen also interpolates a vengeful french policeman seemingly borrowed from "les miserables " eventually they all end up in california where the delirium following the discovery of gold at sutters mill has just begun for mr andersen this is the true coast of utopia "the giddiest most fantastical part of americas dream that practically unspeakable yearning for instant fortune easy prosperity and not merely liberty but no regulation of all had finally suddenly come true here at the far end of america " mr andersen peoples "heyday" with appealing characters plausibly of their time and place they pause occasionally to philosophize allowing the author to muscle some big ideas into his plot on one such occasion ben who numbers charles darwin among his acquaintances proposes a theory of america evolving into a hybrid nation skaggs instantly agrees "we are a mongrel howling " he shouts "the eyes of all people upon our new american species " at such moments you can almost hear the author shuffling through his research notes mr andersen lands on like a census taker determined to name check every important historical figure who might have come within hailing distance of his narrative when a train happens to pass through seneca falls n y we know to expect a shout out to elizabeth cady stanton when our heroes briefly stop off in springfield ill we are not surprised to encounter abraham lincolns law partner when a package from bens friend frederick engels arrives in the mail we know before its opened that a copy of the newly published "communist manifesto" lurks within luckily "heyday" spills over into giving its characters and readers time to acquire some perspective on the annus mirabilis they have just been through given this extended timeline and mr andersens penchant for shoehorning historical references into his plot it is strange that he omits any mention of the astor place riot earlier in the novel mr andersen had meticulously re created the milieu of new yorks bowery bhoys young working class rowdies in stovepipe hats and red flannel shirts who despise anything that smacks of gentility so the reader is primed for a climactic scene based on the real life riot of may when a group of bhoys harassed the english actor william macready during a performance of "macbeth" at the astor opera house things got out of hand the militia opened fire and people were killed this episode seems tailor made for "heyday " duff is a bhoy ben is an english gentleman polly is an actress and skaggs is something of an anarchist who muses that the european revolutions of "were pure spectacle a whole continent on a spree " alas by may mr andersen has transferred most of his characters to the west coast and is pushing his plot toward its conclusion instead of the astor place riot he offers a violent climax of his own devising "heyday" is not the smooth concoction that a more experienced historical novelist say gore vidal or thomas mallon would make from the same ingredients but its an impressive effort nonetheless if mr andersen continues in this genre and learns to skim off the clutter he may have a promising future in the past mr lewis is writing a book about americas colonial experience in the philippines
