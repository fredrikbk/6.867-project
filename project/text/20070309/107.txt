weekend journal review television it still burns bright from the first it began last october nbcs "friday night lights" about a small town high school football team in texas seemed too good to be true more to the point the drama about the dillon panthers their coach his family and their network of connections in the local society seemed too good to sustain as did its artfully achieved atmosphere a potent blend of down home ease and raw tension most promising television dramas become flaccid after a time and not a long time as the writers send established characters whirling off into their separate thin subplots and episodes settle into a gray predictability "friday night lights" wednesdays p m et has not only avoided that trap it has proved to be that rare thing a network series that has grown more absorbing admirable and generally smashing each week that was never more evident than in the episode a few weeks back in which racial resentments surfaced to threaten the panthers hopes of a crucial win black players otherwise smoothly integrated into the team have been offended by the assistant coachs crude generalities about blacks special talents "dangerous" like "junkyard dogs" as compared with those of whites who are he suggested better equipped mentally to be quarterbacks this is what he ended up saying after persistent questioning by reporters intent on getting a bias story out of their interview it was the briefest of scenes the encounter with these fearsome reporters a species of junkyard dogs themselves but one rich in precisely the kind of observation that distinguishes the series still very little will induce a sense of dread as instantaneously as the emergence in a tv drama of a race based conflict with its promise of a cloying resolution and resultant inanity theres no mistaking the offense the talents of the panthers black star running back "smash" williams gaius charles have been compared to those of a dog and no mistaking either what it takes to rouse the black members of the team including williams himself to a feeling of outrage it takes some doing begun by his activist girlfriend and greatly abetted by the assistant coach who has brought himself to make a grudging apology only with the greatest effort resentments flare insults fly between black and white students and finally the black players walk out before the big game and threaten to stay out unless the assistant coach is fired this head coach taylor portrayed with steely authority as ever by kyle chandler ultimately refuses to do after having come to an understanding of what sort of man the assistant coach is and is not theres little point in describing the ultimate resolution here other than to say that it is a satisfying one achieved without the slightest descent into mawkishness and with the most delicate nuance no soppy transformations no magical epiphanies are in evidence here as a way of explaining the progress toward resolution just the exigencies of life among them the panthers brutal encounter with an opposing team famous for efforts to win at all costs with the exception of mr chandler who has an emmy nomination to his credit the cast that has brought this story to such dynamic life consists largely of relatively unknown actors though its a good bet that connie brittons flawless portrayal of the coachs wife tami will win notice both the high school guidance counselor and a mother she is like her husband wildly unnerved by suspicions about their teenage daughters imminent sexual adventures and ms brittons tami captures this character in appealing depth mr charles as williams liz mikel as his mother and zach gilford as quarterback matt saracen deliver similarly powerful performances so does adrienne palicki as the fatherless and mainly motherless tyra a high schooler old beyond her years not quite a social outcast but getting there three more episodes remain of "friday night lights " which hasnt had more than pallid to ok ratings as they say in the business it hasnt found its audience yet whether nbc will renew the series and give it a chance to do so isnt at all clear what is certain is that in "friday night lights" the network has a rare jewel on its hands and knows it just as do the critics who heap praise on the show its an in house favorite of the entertainment division what the management chooses to do with that knowledge we shall see a word or two for "addiction " a large hbo project whose main film has its debut thursday p m et and encompasses much on the subject thats both new and valuable unfortunately the documentary opens with a segment by jon alpert heavy on the obvious about a saturday night in a dallas emergency room mr alperts taste for the graphic has never been more evident it could be an addiction from the look of things here given the endless close ups of wounds and bloody bodies once past this trip to the er the subject matter improves considerably with addiction specialists providing data and visual images of the brains response to addictive substances most instructive of all though are the addicts young and old who appear on screen to speak of lives they could no longer tolerate because they were controlled by drugs these are not the broken street people one might imagine as addicts but normal looking if somewhat haunted types who hold forth knowledgably on the effects of methadone and newer drugs that block their cravings a wide ranging work and a compelling one
