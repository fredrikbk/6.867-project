alternative energy ethanol tariff loophole sparks a boom in caribbean islands build plants to process brazils fuel farm belt cries foul port of spain trinidad surrounded by ramshackle watermelon stands and burning sugar cane fields texas oil man ron white shows off the site for his next big investment a planned &# million ethanol processing plant his company ethylchem ltd is just one of a rush of new caribbean enterprises trying to serve the suddenly booming u s ethanol market these biofuel entrepreneurs wont actually make ethanol from caribbean sugar cane even though sugar makes the best base for the fuel instead theyll just import it from ethanol powerhouse brazil and process it here then theyll try to cash in on the islands sweet tariff status an exemption from a cents a gallon u s tariff on ethanol processed anywhere else "avoiding the tariff thats the economics of our business " says mr white as president bush meets brazils president luiz inacio lula da silva today in sao paulo to promote a loose alliance to encourage more production of ethanol and other biofuels the caribbean ethanol industry illustrates how u s energy policy and trade policy can stand at odds a top energy priority of mr bush is to end a u s "addiction" to foreign oil partly by encouraging alternative sources such as ethanol which can be made from sugar corn or other agricultural products see related article on page c but the u s tariff which mr da silva has been lobbying unsuccessfully for washington to remove damps the supply in order to protect prices for u s corn growers in farm belt states a tortured route around the tariff goes through the caribbean basin there two dozen small countries are exempted as part of a year old trade agreement from near the end of the cold war designed to combat communism by feeding the u s dollar into their poor economies even that tariff exception which requires entrepreneurs like mr white to jump through legal hoops while risking losses from volatility of supply and demand in brazil and the u s is under attack u s farm state lawmakers want to close the loophole sen charles grassley of iowa the ranking republican on the senate finance committee last year accused a trinidad ethanol business of unfairly harming u s farmers last week he asked the president in a letter to refrain from using taxpayer dollars to encourage foreign ethanol production as intended by the planned agreement with brazil the second largest ethanol producer after the u s caribbean ethanol businesses also are in some danger from the opposite camp which wants to drop ethanol tariffs generally that would wipe out the caribbean advantage mr bushs brother former florida governor jeb bush has forged a coalition of american and brazilian ethanol interests called the inter american ethanol commission to lobby to drop the tariff at times mr bush and his cabinet members have indicated interest though given the farm state objections its unlikely to be removed any time soon in a world without trade barriers and trade politics brazil would be ethanol king and the u s would be importing brazilian fuel far more heavily stoking production further in turn with efficient sugar cane production and chemical processing brazil can produce ethanol for as little as cents a gallon less than half the price of u s ethanol producers who mainly convert corn to make the fuel sugar cane is a better raw material for ethanol because it ferments more quickly into alcohol but the cent tariff on top of the cost of shipping to the u s wipes out much of the price advantage there are exceptions in the summer of the u s price spiked enough that brazilian producers that reacted quickly made money exporting large quantities to the u s despite the tariff encouraging more imports of foreign ethanol would drive down prices and likely boost the american market further while the cent tariff early on encouraged the u s domestic industry now it has become counterproductive contends robert howse a trade expert at the international food &amp agriculture trade policy council an advocacy group sponsored largely by agricultural companies "if we wanted to achieve the energy goals in the u s we would disassemble a lot of the protectionist policies " he says the caribbean sugar industry is so antiquated that it cant produce the fuel competitively from its own cane fields instead caribbean companies take on a middle step in the production process they dehydrate the ethanol from its original state then ship it to u s refiners which add gasoline to make the fuel useable in american cars the dehydrating meets the u s requirement that products be "substantially transformed" in caribbean basin countries if they dont originate there to escape tariffs such techniques to satisfy trade rules often are controversial in the s and s caribbean basin countries ran afoul of u s apparel makers when they started finishing low cost apparel from asia and sending it on to the u s skirting trade barriers aimed at the asian products u s farm state lawmakers like sen grassley say that merely siphoning water from ethanol shouldnt qualify caribbean firms for tariff breaks "its subterfuge " he says the caribbean tariff exception originates in a reagan administration agreement called the caribbean basin initiative in between the u s and most countries with caribbean coastline plus el salvador not geographically in the caribbean basin but seen then as vulnerable to communism nations in the group were awarded incentives to increase local production of ethanol and given duty free access to the u s equal to of the u s ethanol market that trade preference is currently worth &# million a u s international trade commission study says that ethanol was jamaicas leading export to the u s under the initiative in the most recent year for which those data are available as the u s appetite for ethanol grows and total consumption swells so will the volume of caribbean exports that can enter the u s duty free this year the rule means the nations in the agreement can export about million gallons of dehydrated ethanol duty free next year thats estimated to grow to million gallons if the u s manages to meet president bushs goal of using billion gallons of alternative fuels up from six billion gallons last year the caribbean basin nations slice would probably top two billion gallons so investors are lining up at caribbean basin ports in trinidad angostura ltd better known for its bitters and rum products started processing ethanol in in el salvador u s agricultural giant cargill inc is producing the fuel as part of a joint venture in jamaica two ethanol processors are up and running with two more ready to start production this year another is trying to line up backing from u s venture capitalists in haiti an idled ethanol dehydration plant has attracted renewed attention projects also are in the works in guyana the dominican republic and aruba so many players are entering the caribbean market that the ethanol exporters may produce more than the duty free allotment meaning some shipments would have to pay tariffs after all "the caribbean is heading to million gallons" capacity this year or almost million gallons above the estimated cap for warns jeffrey tuite managing director of london based ed&amp f man holdings ltd which operates an ethanol dehydrator outside kingston jamaica "were looking at a quota race then it will be first come first served " in about three quarters of the fast rising quota was produced up from less than half in recent years smart operators can do extremely well especially if they time market swings properly but thats no simple task despite the bravura of the dehydration crowd fat profits are hardly guaranteed given price fluctuations in energy markets "weve always referred to caribbean plants as fireflies for the way they turn on and off whenever the price window fails to open in their favor " says manfred wefers of coimex trading co one of brazils largest ethanol traders demand for ethanol is so strong in brazil that no more than of the fuel production is exported and sometimes at prices that are too high for caribbean dehydrators to make any profit on the other end sometimes the u s price rises so high brazilian producers can make a profit bypassing the caribbean step along a seafront highway east of kingston a relic known as jamaica ethanol processing ltd which is ed&amp f mans subsidiary on the island has made money despite relying on ancient equipment some of the storage tanks originally built to hold petroleum for royal dutch shell are still clad in brick masonry a defense rushed into place against axis submarine missions in the s the boilers were built in the s but look a lot older as they sputter and squirt steamed ethanol through creaking pipes the little plant employs people to run round the clock shifts dehydrating "wet" ethanol mostly from brazil the business works managing director erwin jones says because the company has learned to lock in prices for "wet" ethanol when its cheap and pounce on opportunities to ship far from jamaica when the price of dehydrated ethanol spikes on the southern tip of trinidad angosturas ethanol subsidiary trinidad bulk traders ltd wasnt profitable last year because its million gallon a year dehydration plant couldnt get enough fuel from brazil but curtis mohammed an angostura general manager says hes confident of profits this year and is doubling annual capacity he says the revenue generated from the ethanol business will be funneled back into angosturas rum business which has taken a hit in recent years from increased prices for raw materials like molasses ethylchems mr white says the years he spent calculating risk as a sales representative for exxon mobil and other refiners should help in the ethanol business although sometimes his calculations worked out poorly in he became president of global octanes corp a small texas company that manufactured methyl tertiary butyl ether called mtbe which oil refiners were using at the time to reduce air pollution and comply with environmental regulations it looked like a growing business until mtbe was discovered to contaminate ground water global octanes folded in after california banned mtbe and in congress failed to give liability protection to its refiners effectively ending the business mr white took a course to become an insurance salesman before he started going door to door however the year old entrepreneur met patrick johnson a texas businessman familiar with the caribbean ethanol business which was getting a boost from the failure of mtbe he joined mr johnsons ethylchem on trinidad whose economy is built on petroleum natural gas and petrochemicals trained labor was abundant as was the energy to run an ethanol dehydration plant the pair cobbled together a small number of investors from trinidad and the u s and hired a houston investment banker to scour for more funds they found a trinidad bank willing to kick in construction financing and are working on a deal with a second bank overseas mr white is telling investors they can expect returns on investment of between and when the initial debt is paid down he figures he can reduce the risk of not getting enough brazilian supply if necessary by reversing the business model and charging brazilian producers to dehydrate their ethanol and avoid the tariffs without ethylchem buying the fuel in petrojam ltd jamaicas state owned oil company put together a joint venture with brazils coimex trading to process ethanol for the u s market at the time petrojam executive winston watson recalls ethanol was selling for about &# a gallon in brazil and u s buyers were paying between &# and &# a gallon for dehydrated fuel "our break even number was about &# or &# " says mr watson but last year brazilian ethanol export prices soared to &# a gallon as brazilian ethanol makers fed their growing domestic market for flex fuel cars which can run on either gasoline or ethanol at the same time the u s purchase price for dehydrated ethanol dropped below &# a gallon as american ethanol makers improved productivity "we didnt lose money " mr watson insists but acknowledges that the plant still isnt running at full capacity ultimately says karl james chairman of jamaicas petrojam ethanol ltd and leader of that countrys sugar industries association caribbean producers must learn to produce ethanol from the abundant sugar cane on the islands either for the u s or other energy thirsty markets but few caribbean players are in any position to convert sugar production to capitalize on ethanol in many parts of the caribbean the sugar cane industry is rotting the governments of trinidad st kitts and barbados have already decided the sugar sectors of their islands are not worth further investment theyd rather use their islands limited land for tourism and retirement real estate figuring that even with the booming ethanol demand there isnt enough growing space to make modernizing worthwhile rum distillers like trinidads angostura and jamaicas appleton ltd now reach all the way to fiji for molasses to import for their spirits but angosturas mr mohammed wants to encourage sugar cane production in the caribbean basin in guyana and jamaica hopes the sale this year of five government owned sugar cane estates will lead to a renewal of the sugar business there for ethanol production authorities are encouraged that among the prospective bidders at this summers auction are brazils coimex trading and indias dhampur sugar mills ltd both big ethanol traders
