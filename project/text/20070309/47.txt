if memory serves the jury in "scooter" libbys trial has reached a verdict and a trial of historic significance is over he stands convicted of serious felonies and now joins the ranks of such disgraced high flying washington power brokers as sherman adams spiro agnew bobby baker or most recently jack abramoff but there is one big problem the absence of expert witness testimony may have contributed to an unjust verdict our constitution guarantees every person accused of a crime the right to call witnesses in his or her defense this right is so critical to fundamental fairness that trials in which it is not safeguarded have been deemed by the u s supreme court to suffer from a "structural error" so serious that an automatic reversal of any criminal conviction is always required no matter how heinous the crime the central theory of mr libbys defense was that if he made any misstatements either to the fbi or to the federal grand jury they were caused by faulty memory either his or that of the witnesses who testified against him for over years psychological scientists have studied the mechanics of memory and conducted extensive and rigorous research on the subject reaching conclusions that are generally accepted in the scientific community of signal importance to the jurors in the libby trial the science of memory is diametrically opposed to the popular understanding of how the memory and the mind work many people believe that traumatic events will be "burned" into the mind for example so that the facts of the experience will be later recalled right down to the most minor detail in fact very high stress can diminish accurate recall more important memory is not static like a videotape rather it is malleable and subject to change memories change as a result of new information acquired and people are generally unaware of these changes test subjects who watched a movie of an automobile collision when asked how fast the vehicles were going or when they smashed together gave higher estimates of speed and recalled seeing broken glass in the aftermath of the wreck even when there was none than subjects who were asked the same question using less freighted language in another experiment adults were induced into remembering being lost in a shopping mall during childhood even though the event never happened these are only two of hundreds of studies that have been published to demarcate the boundaries of memory and to determine its strengths and weaknesses as time passes memories not only fade but also become more vulnerable to contamination the libby defense team planned to call robert a bjork a distinguished member of the faculty at ucla and a person so qualified in his field that the special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald did not even contest the point moreover the trial judge reggie walton found the proposed evidence sufficiently reliable to satisfy the supreme courts stringent daubert standard for the admissibility of expert witness evidence however after a day long hearing during which one of the authors of this article testified judge walton barred dr bjork from appearing as an expert witness essentially the judge held that the science of memory is not "science" at all but common knowledge and common sense he further held that the right of cross examination was an effective substitute for the right to offer evidence finally he held that the proposed evidence was more likely to confuse the jury than educate it there are serious problems with each of these rationales first the general rule is that such evidence is admissible and the question of what weight to give it is for the jury to decide furthermore the proposition that cross examination is an adequate substitute for expert witness testimony fails to appreciate how hard it is to introduce scientific facts in this fashion cross examination can expose a witness who has faulty memory but does nothing to undermine the testimony of a witness who claims certain memory cross examination lacks explanation finally the suggestion that jurors would be confused by expert witness testimony ignores actual data showing that jurors dont seem particularly confused by this kind of testimony rather such testimony would likely increase the amount of time that they spend critically discussing the memory aspects of the case a benefit to both the government whose principal goal is to seek justice not conviction and the defendant in the libby trial the repeated questions sent by the jury to judge walton forcefully demonstrated the crucial need for expert testimony on the mechanics of memory far from confusing the jury expert witness testimony would have clarified the disputed facts that the jury found so troubling the scooter libby verdict was neither fair nor just because the jury never heard one of the most important pieces of evidence an expert explanation of why faulty memory could be consistent with innocence ms loftus is a professor of psychology and
