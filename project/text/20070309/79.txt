politics &amp economics iraq oil plan avoids key issues draft law is ambiguous on revenue sharing role of foreign firms lawmakers in iraq will soon debate a draft petroleum law for the oil rich country but the legislations current form fails to clarify two issues crucial to the nations future how to lure foreign investment into the vast oil sector and how to distribute the new revenue that results bush administration officials and iraqi politicians have hailed the draft law which won cabinet approval late last month as a milestone in the countrys attempted comeback by allowing foreign investment into the politically charged oil sector officials hope to start rebuilding a dilapidated and war torn industry they also hope that new oil revenue distributed fairly to the countrys fractious regional ethnic and religious groups will underpin baghdads shaky central government but the legislation before parliament may do very little in either regard according to western executives and iraqi and outside experts familiar with it in recent days oil company executives have said the legislation is still too ambiguous to trigger any meaningful negotiations between companies and government officials "there is still quite a bit of work to be done before players feel comfortable sitting down to negotiate " one western oil company executive said if passed the initiative would legally permit some sort of foreign participation in the oil sector that in itself would be a very big step because the countrys oil wealth is a political sacred cow the nationalization of the oil industry in the early s under saddam hussein was a hugely popular move and many iraqis are still wary of foreigners exploiting their fields but the legislation punts for now on crucial questions for foreign oil executives weighing a move into iraq including who can negotiate contracts on behalf of the government what investment terms can be expected how will taxes and royalties be collected and which fields will be open to foreign development government officials say they hope that these and other details can be addressed in subsequent rule making meanwhile civil strife across iraq will keep out most big companies until stability returns since the march u s invasion the country has splintered along regional ethnic and religious lines the kurdish dominated north and the mostly shiite muslim south produce most of iraqs crude oil though hobbled by years of war underinvestment and postinvasion chaos iraq still manages to pump two million barrels of oil a day compared with about million barrels a day before the war but the central and western provinces dominated by sunni muslims arent significant oil producing regions stoking fear among sunni politicians that their people could be left behind by any new development during months of negotiations over the draft kurdish officials have insisted on retaining the right to hammer out deals with oil companies in their autonomous northern enclave they have already signed several contracts and some oil companies have started work there last month the iraqi cabinet appeared to have brokered a compromise agreeing to a complex scheme whereby regional governments can negotiate contracts with some measure of federal oversight but many lawmakers are still unclear as to how that system would work in practice and whether other regional or local governments for instance a bloc of southern shiite provinces could negotiate contracts on their own as well "until now we dont know how much authority is reserved for the regions and how much for the central government " says omar abdul sattar a member of parliament from the iraqi islamic party a major sunni political group several annexes to the draft legislation list specific fields that could be open to foreign companies for now the choicest ones those already producing or near already developed fields are set aside for a new state run oil company that could develop the fields on its own or enter into joint ventures it isnt clear however whether iraq can put together a state oil company anytime soon because a mass exodus by many of the countrys oil technocrats has drained the sector of talent it also is still unclear how the legislation would divvy up the revenue from any new development that someday may flow from foreign participation the draft that parliament is expected to take up states only that iraqs oil wealth belongs to all of its citizens officials in baghdad however say an agreement has been reached to dole out revenue to regions according to population numbers but the legislation doesnt detail any specific mechanism for doing this iraqi officials are saying that important clause too will be left for future debate ashti hawrami the kurdish regions oil minister said the kurdish regional government has agreed to "voluntarily pool" all of its oil revenue to be shared with other regions but kurdish officials have fought hard to retain their ability to negotiate with oil companies and they arent likely to give up all say in how revenue from those deals is spent "it is the most important point but if you see the draft it doesnt clearly lay it out " one expert familiar with the draft said "an outsider looking at it would be puzzled " the details of revenue sharing are to be addressed in a separate law iraqi officials said rampant corruption throughout the government and the oil industry will be another big hurdle in working out how to spread around money in nigeria a revenue sharing system between the federal and regional governments long ago collapsed under the weight of large scale graft theft and corruption and it is still unclear whether even iraqs current draft will pass in parliament the measure is expected to face sharp opposition from sunni legislators who may press for a stronger federal role in negotiations several former iraqi oil ministry officials have criticized the bill as hastily put together and recently some lawmakers with the fadhila shiite party which is influential in southern iraqs oil rich governorates have said they oppose the initiative because it could favor foreign oil companies over local ones jabbar yaseen in baghdad contributed to this article
