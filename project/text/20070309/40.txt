fed draws some fire over inflation views washington a group of experts on federal reserve policy said in a study that the nations central bank puts too much weight on the publics expectations for inflation a practice the group argues could lead to complacency in the face of an inflation threat the study prepared for a conference in washington today to be attended by several fed policy makers suggests that the fed is risking higher inflation over the next few years which could necessitate more drastic increases in interest rates later on fed officials however are unlikely to agree with the studys conclusions or to change their current interest rate stance as a result the theoretical role of inflation expectations as a factor in inflation has persuaded some fed officials to "focus intensively" on them as the main driver of inflation the study said "our results suggest that this practice may be misguided " the study was written by economists stephen cecchetti of brandeis university peter hooper of deutsche bank ag bruce kasman of j p morgan chase &amp co kermit schoenholtz of citigroup inc and mark watson of princeton university in theory if the public expects a pickup in inflation wages and prices are more likely to rise making those expectations become self fulfilling for the same reason if stable prices are expected inflation is more likely to remain low this idea plays an important role in fed policy making including the central banks decision to keep its target for u s short term interest rates at even though inflation is currently higher than it prefers and unemployment is lower than it believes can be sustained over the long run a "significant factor influencing medium term trends in inflation is the publics expectations of inflation " fed chairman ben bernanke said in february "it is encouraging that inflation expectations appear to have remained contained " however the study says that since surveys of the publics expectations of inflation have largely lost their ability to predict actual inflation now "expectations seem more likely to follow than lead inflation " it said in an interview mr cecchetti said the studys findings suggest that the fed risks letting inflation accelerate in the "medium term " and that interest rate actions to address inflation "will be too late it suggests they need to be more vigilant " the study also disputes the feds view that inflation has become less sensitive to whether the economy is operating above or below its normal capacity and level of employment mr cecchetti said that means there is a risk that with the economy now operating above its normal capacity prices and wages could start to rise and inflation expectations would then follow but the fed is likely to dispute these findings its staff research has found that looking at inflation expectations makes the fed better at adjusting interest rates in anticipation of swings in employment and inflation in turn that improved response may have made inflation more stable which could explain why it is less likely to accelerate or slow in response to a shift in expectations the fed could also note that its recent policy statements cite inflation as the predominant risk facing the u s economy particularly because the economy is operating so close to capacity
