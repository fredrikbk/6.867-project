the daily fix florida football schools stun their hoops rivals online edition whats the acc tournament doing in tampa providing a showcase for florida teams florida state and miami still have a ways to go and for the hurricanes a conference title is their only route to the ncaa tournament and the two combined for a paltry conference record this season but lets not spoil their fun along with north carolina state and wake forest the two sunshine state schools known for their football teams though neither excelled last season led a clean sweep of higher seeds yesterday including the departure of duke and maryland keep playing like they did and they might even make baltimore sun columnist rick maese reconsider his objection lodged in yesterdays fix to holding the conference tournament in basketball coldbed tampa the miami heralds david j neal says miami purportedly a football school demonstrated superior free throw shooting rebounding and defense in its defeat of no maryland " easily forgotten as we race across each evolutionary step in a sportscenter youtube highlight world is that it all comes back to the fundamentals " mr neal writes the fix hopes that flopping doesnt get "fundamentals" status anytime but it worked for florida state senior star al thornton who drew a questionable foul call in the final seconds and hit the winning free throw in the seminoles defeat of clemson thats questionable as in mr thornton himself questioned the call and called his fall a "flop " that lucky turn was a long time coming for florida state mike bianchi writes in the orlando sentinel "after four years of failure and frustration maybe this is the season thornton finally takes his rightful place as one of college basketballs biggest superstars " mr bianchi writes "and to do that he must play in the ncaa tournament where one shining defining moment can turn a talented player into a timeless one without an ncaa tournament on his resume al thornton might as well be al bundy " it all comes back to the ncaa tournament of course these days the best teams know their place in the field of is assured and might think three games in three days isnt the safest way to prep for a deep run into the big dance so conference tournaments are fun sure a shot at redemption for bubble teams and a chance to see lots of rivalry games and nonstop action over consecutive days but the stakes have changed markedly from the legendary acc tournament final between no north carolina state and no maryland at the time each conference got just one berth in the national tournament and it belonged to the conference champion "you cant explain the absurdity of only one of us going to the ncaa tournament " marylands len elmore told tampa tribune columnist martin fennelly "or how we put up points without a pointer without a dunk with no shot clock how do you explain this game " mr fennellys entertaining replay of the game ends on this happy note the injustice of maryland missing the big dance led to rules changes and a fairer playing field but undoubtedly something special about early march was lost too in the comparatively pedestrian big east tournament where the top four seeds yawn advanced to the semifinals the big story is the ascendance of louisville from preseason afterthought to championship contender last night the cardinals defeated west virginia in a thrilling double overtime game reminiscent of louisvilles comeback from points down to beat the mountaineers and reach the final four two years ago "considering louisville was an nit team last season and only leapt into ncaa discussion within the past month it may well be the nations least known legit final four contender " stewart mandel writes on si com "so lets slice through the mystery right here the main thing you need to know about the cards is that theyre an extremely young team with three freshmen and two sophomores among their top seven scorers that doesnt at all play like it " its the paradox of arsenal the london club has played outstanding soccer perhaps the best of any european team at least in the eyes of times of london columnist simon barnes and yet its been knocked out of nearly every meaningful competition "this season arsenal produced a team of pure and dizzy talent the distilled essence of football " mr barnes writes "they embodied every kind of footballing virtue question does defeat in four competitions destroy the moral argument does rightness depend on victory or is there really a right way and wrong way to play is it better to lose the right way than win the wrong way " this is an argument unique to soccer fans might grumble about a defense first team winning a title in basketball or football but theres little sense of moral outrage about a lack of style mr barnes accepts that a win first mentality is the logical one but he concludes that aesthetic value shouldnt entirely be discounted "style may not be a moral imperative in sport but sport is more amusing for its presence to say that style doesnt matter in sport does not mean that there is no style in sport it only means that you lack this quality yourself " red klotz the former general of the washington generals is unapologetic at age for his coaching record of thousands of losses and one win "i was trying to win every night " mr klotz tells dave mckenna of the washington city paper "i just didnt have much luck against the globetrotters " "for the first years the teams played each other the generals didnt win a single game " mr mckenna writes "according to generals lore that losing streak ended in january in martin tenn when klotz the teams year old player coach hit a half court shot at the buzzer to beat the globetrotters by a point " john vukovich who spent years working for the philadelphia phillies as a player coach and other roles died of brain cancer yesterday he was mr vukovich who most recently was working in phillys front office was enormously popular within the organization and throughout baseball "vukovich was always good to the little people " jim salisbury writes in the philadelphia inquirer "he big timed no one not the th man on the team not the part time college kid who picked up uniforms in the clubhouse not the reporters who covered the team " philadelphia daily news columnist bill conlin says hed want to be reincarnated as vuke ii a baseball lifer of the best sort "he was a strong man with a strong plan and he kept to it it was sandwiched tightly between the words pride and loyalty no baseball man ever had more of each id insist on a much longer life a little more bat speed and just a tad more range in the end though id make do with what i was given that was the essence of being vuke " alan greenberg a sportswriter at the hartford courant since died tuesday of an apparent heart attack he was the courants jeff jacobs who suffered a heart attack two years ago and recovered after quadruple bypass surgery writes warmly about his longtime colleague "words were his playground " mr jacobs writes "other guys worked at writing he toyed with us he could push a key and draw a response from anyone " mr greenberg knew it and could be a bit cocky in mr jacobs telling but he was also was a loving father to his three children "his good spirit came to exceed his talent and there were few more talented " several of mr greenbergs feature articles are on a courant tribute page uconn fans lamenting the huskies probable nit berth can take solace in these words from a march column years ago "jim calhoun did not have to twist and shout he did not have to stamp his feet he did not have to angrily stalk the sideline he could sit he could smile he could have sat there sipping tea for all the huskies cared they had met the enemy
