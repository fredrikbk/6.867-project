"i must say i am addicted to this now " she says tens of thousands of other investors like her are doing the same thing with japanese interest rates hovering at a low they borrow piles of yen cheaply and then invest them in currencies elsewhere looking for higher returns ms kashiwazaki makes trades totaling &# or so a day among several currencies ranging from the u s dollar to the swiss franc as the yen gyrated over the past week traders such as these are believed to have played a major role in the volatility last week the yen gained against the dollar "japanese individuals are doing essentially the same thing as hedge funds " says tohru sasaki chief foreign exchange strategist at j p morgan chase bank in tokyo "together they are acting like an enormous hedge fund " a combination of technology deregulation and low interest rates is enabling individual japanese to use the same kind of investment techniques as the pros borrowing money to trade currencies has become so popular in japan that individual traders sitting at their computers in homes across the country now trade tens of billions of dollars a day according to some estimates mr sasaki estimates that in the months leading up to last weeks sharp movements japanese individuals some days held foreign currency valued at more than five trillion yen or &# billion that is similar to his estimate for the amount of yen loans taken out by professional investors in order to speculate in foreign currencies the strategy which essentially involves selling yen and buying other currencies gained popularity during the past year or so as the yen weakened individual investors piled into investments designed to profit from its decline that selling helped further push down the yen between last may and jan its most recent low point the japanese currency weakened against the dollar when the market recently changed directions many japanese individuals apparently reversed their investment strategies quickly at least for the short term boosting that rebound in late new york trading yesterday the yen was trading at to the dollar a strengthening of about since its jan low the activity is driven by japanese investors desperate to earn better returns on their savings amid historically low interest rates the japanese central banks short term interest rate was zero for five years until july at now it compares with in the u s the result japanese investors can earn significantly higher returns on a dollar denominated bank deposit than on its yen equivalent it isnt entirely new for japanese households to keep some of

trading accounts has more than doubled in the past two years some brokers allow individuals to borrow times the amount of money they deposit as collateral online trading companies normally try to protect clients from losing too much money typically by automatically selling off and closing down a clients investment if it threatens to spiral out of control and cause losses that would devour the collateral on deposit that happened to many investors in the past week as the yen began rising against the dollar last week investors who had bought large quantities of foreign currency with borrowed yen were forced to sell off their remaining foreign currency to pay back these loans analysts believe this type of selling along with selling by hedge funds and other institutional players pushed up
