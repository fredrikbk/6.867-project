weekend journal taste de gustibus richest country saddest people any coincidence "oh my god i am so starving " says high school student brittany birnbaum who ate nothing except "a twix and a half bag of fritos" before her cheerleading tryout and whose stomach revolts at the sight of her mothers salisbury steak "you know " she warns "its against the law to treat your kids like this " "my god i am starving " rejoins kitum asosa starving african "i would walk miles through the desert to reach a handful of millet the sight of a sparrow carcass would make my mouth water if only i were not too dehydrated to salivate " i am reminded of this immortal exchange a satirical point counterpoint in the online pages of the onion after reading about the results of a study recently reported in forbes purporting to show that the u s has the highest rate of depression among a survey group of countries the study jointly conducted by the world health organization and harvard medical school and based on more than face to face interviews world wide found that of americans suffer from "bipolar disorder major depressive disorder or chronic minor depression " a whopping of americans were also found to be experiencing "mood and anxiety disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorder " these figures come as no surprise we are after all entering our st year as a prozac nation consider the contrast with other countries one can easily understand that ukraine land of chernobyl would have a comparatively high proportion of depressed people one can equally understand that the rate of depression in italy comes in at a low the only mystery there is how anyone could be depressed in italy more interesting are the data about depression rates in poorer countries in lebanon which in the last year has endured heavy israeli bombardment an internal refugee crisis several political assassinations and a quasi coup by hezbollah of the population is considered to be depressed a slightly higher figure than belgiums but considerably lower than frances colombians with their drug cartels and right and left wing death squads remain at a slightly cheerier people than the prosperous permissive dutch and while some million mexicans live below the poverty line they are at doing twice as well at keeping their spirits up than their richer neighbors to the north and then there is nigeria desperately poor infamously corrupt riven by violent confessional and tribal divides and generally filthy it clocked in with a depression rate of by far the lowest of all the countries surveyed could it really be that nigerians are the happiest people on earth and americans the most unhappy at least the first of those suggestions seems absurd and researchers have no shortage of explanations to account for the comparatively lower rates of depression reported in poorer countries "its all about what people are willing to tell us " harvards ronald kessler who helped run the study tells forbes "in nepal its against the law to be mentally ill no surprise nobody there admits to being mentally ill " other researchers suggest that doctors in poorer countries may be quicker to diagnose depression not as a physical malady but as a moral or spiritual one best treated with some bracing advice to the patient about how he should lead his life there is also the matter of differing expectations a new york attorney who fails to make partner at a white shoe firm by his mid s may find himself "depressed " by contrast a fruit seller in lagos nigeria who makes enough in a year to feed and clothe her family may be fairly contented if your goal in life is shelter food and safety the very notion of depression may never even intrude on your psychic space but if youve never known what it means to struggle for survival you might more easily be emotionally crushed by the want of lifes intangibles love purpose meaning and so on still none of this quite accounts for the wide disparities in depression rates among countries that are already rich germany and japan for instance have rates of and respectively about the germans a wag might explain their rate as a late instance of the triumph of the will and perhaps a similar cultural ethic among the japanese militates against admitting to depression if so it could mean that social values are in effect repressing depressed people by making them reluctant to admit to their problem alternatively it could mean that those values also serve as a cure at least in depressions milder forms by providing a variety of social goods that may be lacking in the u s a sense of community stronger family ties an extra four weeks of vacation i suspect however that cultural differences can account for only so much economics must also be at work consider jean baptiste says famous insight that supply creates its own demand we know this to be true about for instance personal computers there was never any demand for pcs until steve jobs put one on the market and persuaded consumers it was something they should have just so with depression is there a country on earth where prozac is more widely prescribed or therapy more readily available than the u s it should hardly be surprising therefore that americans now find themselves so depressed none of this is to say that depression is not for those who suffer acutely from it a serious matter or that it doesnt warrant attention and care but it is also true that what we now call "depression" is something previous generations also knew albeit with different names melancholy unhappiness "the blues " in song in church in labor in philosophy and in the bonds of family community and tradition they were often able to find genuine consolations such consolations still exist though we no longer think of them as cures given how badly our own "cures" seem to be working perhaps it would be well if we did mr stephens writes "global view " the journals weekly
