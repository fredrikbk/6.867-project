scooter libby was the verdict or his offense the real crime in reaction to the march editorial "the libby travesty" and ronald rotundas op ed commentary "the case for a libby pardon" on the same day i am disappointed in your editorial supporting a pardon for lewis libby of course this was a political trial and of course you can question the motives of individuals on both sides of the case including the prosecutor however mr libby was found guilty of lying to a grand jury and that is a crime james e stevenson jr baltimore i get the feeling that scooter libby ended up being the fall guy for other people within the administration apparently some members of the jury feel the same way and one of them said so in a public fashion after the verdict was read steven m clayton ocean n j ronald rotunda is entitled to strongly defend lewis libby and make the case for a pardon however his description of valerie plame and her delight in publicity is entirely beside the point that she enjoyed the limelight once she was "outed" is irrelevant to the case that someone revealed her identity to avenge her husbands unpopular views is what the case was supposed to be about prof rotundas conclusion is offensive namely that if a former cia employee appears to "covet publicity " one should question retroactively whether the principle of protecting her classified status is "sacrosanct " that sounds like suggesting a rape victims behavior justifies the crime joann goldstein fair lawn n j your editorials reaction to this verdict was predictable you set the stage by arguing in a january editorial that this was a case that should not have been brought "regardless of the outcome " lets get this straight a jury of people unanimously agrees in a trial no serious observer suggests was unfair that mr libby lied to a grand jury under oath how in the world does this mean the prosecutor criminalized a policy difference david common new york its eminently fitting that the same administration that put martha stewart in jail for nothing but lying to investigators should find itself tangled up in same non laws the pity in all of this is that mr libby a political adviser should receive widespread sympathy even from the convicting jury if not a pardon from the president when ms stewart a champion of capitalism productivity and luxury was derided by late night comedians using her as an example of how rotten our culture has become dan rohr wildwood mo prof rotunda seems to be saying its okay to lie under oath if the underlying crime in this case violating the identities protection act of did not occur i disagree if we are to have confidence in our legal system our laws must be respected once we consider underlying motives and outcomes our sense of right and wrong becomes clouded and our confidence in the system wanes if the case is overturned on appeal fine but it would be inappropriate for the president to pardon someone whose crime appears to have been committed in support of the president peter j sonnabend boston see related letter "letters to the editor where was the crime in the libby case " wsj march
