never saw again meanwhile pyotr and his sisters left home taking jobs at factories in nearby towns since its launch in "zhdi menya" has brought together people sundered by stalins purges war and the collapse of the soviet union thats earned it a unique and cherished place in popular culture "we reconstruct the real history of this country " says igor kvasha the programs host "not the garbled version in the textbooks " yet the program is ostensibly unpolitical a tear jerking cross between jerry springer and the history channel it recounts the crimes of communism without apportioning blame that makes it palatable to russias leaders for whom soviet era might is still a political touchstone president putin has called the ussrs collapse the "greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the th century " the shows neutral style allows it to tackle subjects ignored by other media russian tv barely mentions chechnya but "zhdi menya" features chechens who were separated from their children in the chaos of war in the rebel republic their stories humanize the toll of the long running conflict at a recent shoot on a sub zero moscow afternoon mr kvasha read out the names of people whose fates remain a mystery among them ruslan gilkhanov a chechen medical student who was dragged from his house by armed men in july and hasnt been heard from since "ive written to everyone for help including the president but gotten no answer " his father said in a forlorn letter to the program under baking lights mr kvasha a celebrated actor sits at his desk surrounded by enlarged snapshots of faces babushki in head scarves couples with s hairstyles and soldiers in world war ii uniforms behind him hangs a glass panel covered with photos of the missing every time someone is found he solemnly removes their picture mr kvasha asks members of the audience many holding up photos of relatives to tell their stories to the lucky few he pronounces the longed for words "we found them and theyre here in the studio " a heroine of the recent shoot was year old maya reis whose father was arrested in the s at the height of stalins terror his four daughters were sent to different orphanages and never saw each other again two wrote letters to "zhdi menya" one six years ago the other last december and researchers matched them up as the audience applauds and dabs eyes maya and her sister rosa dressed in soviet era floral frocks embrace in the studio their first encounter in years while most reunions on the program tend to trigger outpourings of tears and words the two sisters just stare at each other in stunned silence speechless at the sudden turn in their fortunes often the "zhdi menya" plot is more prosaic on the same shoot a teenager is reunited with the boy she had a fling with on a volga steamship an orphan adopted by a spanish couple when she was meets her long lost sister by satellite link up a young man who ran away from home is reunited somewhat reluctantly with his domineering grandmother a cottage industry "zhdi menya" now has a network of volunteer sleuths postmen private detectives and housewives spread across russia since its launch nine years ago its received a million letters and gets appeals by post phone or email every three minutes researchers used to trace people a month now they find a hundred times as many this focus on the victims of the communist regime contrasts with most mainstream media which these days tend to humanize soviet era leaders and gloss over their crimes a tv drama "stalin live " has been panned by critics for portraying stalin as a sympathetic old man "theres a lot of pseudo historical stuff on tv these days " says irina petrovskaya a television critic "zhdi menya is different because its totally authentic thats why its so popular " pyotr leontiev wrote to the program in in search of his brother he had spent years trying to trace him through official channels but was rebuffed at every turn the leontiev family had been devastated by war and terror their father drafted in was declared missing in action in their mother was arrested on charges of "speculation" neighbors informed on her for selling a few pounds of tobacco and she was packed off to the gulag with sergei her youngest son still a babe in arms his siblings had only his cradle to remember him by researchers at "zhdi menya" contacted police in karaganda kazakhstan the site of the mothers prison camp and after trawling archives they found a sergei leontiev whose records matched pyotrs description within weeks they had tracked down sergei a retired carpenter after a childhood in orphanages in karaganda hed spent most of his life impoverished in workers barracks in the studio pyotr told his story "the tragedy that befell our family wasnt unique " he described how his mother was wrenched from her children how their last sight of her and baby sergei was on a prison train bound for the steppes "we never heard from them again " the children raised by a year old sister were lucky children of "enemies of the people" were often separated their names changed and sent to orphanages thousands of miles apart to the strains of mozarts requiem mr kvasha spoke to the audience "its hard to imagine how many stories there are like this they didnt just take away peoples husbands wives and parents they deliberately destroyed archives concealed peoples names they took away their memory " in a heart rending moment he led pyotr leontiev to his brother who was sitting weeping in the audience the two embraced pyotr had mixed feelings about the encounter the joy of seeing sergei was clouded by the revelation that his mother had been worked to death in "it was very hard a very sad day " says pyotr the two men broke down and looked deeply into each others eyes "we survived " pyotr said to his brother "we survived "
