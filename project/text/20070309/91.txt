the evening wrap ethanol diplomacy online edition president bushs goodwill journey around south america will key on themes of green energy and economic inequality but hell also be trying to drown out a noisy tagalong venezuelan president hugo chavez the voyage got rolling in brazil as the u s and that nation announced that they had signed an agreement that will promote ethanol as an alternative fuel source around the americas ethanol is the alternative energy source of the moment in washington and the agreement was announced with much fanfare mr bush and the brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva strapped on hard hats and toured an ethanol production facility outside of sao paulo most new brazilian autos run on sugar derived ethanol giving rush hour there a sickly sweet aroma and emerged to tell reporters their accord should increase prosperity and help lessen the regions dependence on foreign oil "it makes sense for us to collaborate for the sake of mankind " mr bush said with mr silva standing at his side "we see the bright and real potential for our citizens to use alternative sources of energy that will promote the common good " left unspoken was the notion that if it also curbs the influence of venezuelas oil rich socialist regime then so much the better by the bush administrations reckoning brazil and the u s are the worlds biggest ethanol producers cranking out better than two thirds of the global supply despite the overflowing enthusiasm for ethanol among lawmakers from corn producing states the agreement wasnt without its critics in brazil some said a small number of wealthy families and corporations dominate the ethanol market and that if gains from the pact arent broadly shared with workers who swing machetes in the cane fields social unrest could result others were angered that the u s will maintain steep tariffs on brazilian ethanol the pact is also certain to stir up more anxiety from big food producers in the u s which have already started to complain that their earnings are being crunched by the ethanol craze with more corn being turned into fuel livestock feed prices are shooting the moon and that may eventually be passed through to consumers as higher prices for everything from beef shanks to a box of cheerios further it takes a great deal of energy to produce ethanol fuel critics say and the positive impact on emissions from using it in cars may be burned up in making the stuff nevertheless the bush administration appears to be wagering that this kind of ethanol diplomacy will help it to get a handle on the challenge represented by mr chavez the shadow of the venezuelan leader who has at turns referred to mr bush as a "devil" and a "donkey " looms large over the presidents journey and indeed the bombastic mr chavez isnt shrinking from the stage he set up a parallel tour of the region and is scheduled to lead a protest against mr bush in buenos aires tonight earlier he said that the presidents tour is an attempt to "scrub clean the face of the empire in latin america" and that it "seems hes just now discovered that poverty exists in the region " mr bush rejected that assertion saying that "may be what people say but its certainly not what the facts bear out " protests are expected to stalk mr bush as he winds through the region in brazil last night demonstrators and police clashed and officials in colombia worry leftist guerrillas may stage attacks during his visit there tepid hiring slimmer trade gap the labor department said employers added jobs to payrolls last month and the
