lights out for the lords london crazy impetuous devils the british a mere years after edward i invented representative politics with the model parliament they have gone and opted for a fully elected national legislature the mood here is one of slightly baffled "well i never" shock worry too we brits are not yet entirely sure about this democracy business possibly with good reason the revolution came amid hot breathed scenes on wednesday night when the long elected house of commons voted to change the way the country fills its house of lords britains senate to get into the lords until now you either had to be head of a certain type of aristocratic family or be appointed by the prime minister of the day membership most agreeably was for life the money wasnt great "peers" received a modest attendance allowance and minor traveling expenses only their lordships were not to the eye the most suave or elegantly attired crowd they did not often use vulgar sound bites some of their suits inclined to the threadbare nibbled by moths or worn thin by age the lords certainly had more than its share of walking frames hearing aids and dandruffed wild haired eccentrics they were often pretty sharp mentally though the ranks of peers included some of britains best retired doctors dons lawyers clergy military men and charity executives this ancient assembly had something of the flavor of a council of tribal elders there were many beards membership of the lords currently strong was much prized you got a fancy title "lord" or "lady" a parking space in central london a chance to sound forth on the issues of the day and the right to dress in ermine robes once a year when the monarch conducted the official opening of parliament there is also a handsome dining room and a subsidized bar overlooking the river thames with deep riveted leather armchairs eight years ago tony blairs labour government canned all but a few of the aristocrats an act which owed more to class resentment than clear sighted constitutional reform mr blair who is expected to leave office this summer proceeded to replace the dumped dukes and earls and viscounts with low caliber sycophants "tonys cronies " they were soon called mr blairs conservative predecessor john major had not been blameless in this regard he elevated the minor novelist jeffrey archer to the peerage mr blair however was held to have packed the old place with an unusually hopeless selection of soup brained partisans the lords had long been used as a handy depository for superannuated mps who needed to be slipped a favor perhaps to buy their silence perhaps to relinquish their commons seats in favor of some promising youngster mr blair may have pushed into more difficult and unsavory territory there are claims that he handed out peerages to rich men in return for donations to the labour party fund these allegations have led to the recent arrest of two of mr blairs aides and could tarnish the once spotless blair brand just as he is hoping to retire to the u s lecture circuit british politicians have chuntered about lords reform for almost a century like anyone faced with a tiresome item of domestic admin they kept putting off the matter for another day procrastination is usually considered a mediterranean specialty but when it comes to constitutional change the british also have "manana" down to an art form thanks in part to mr blairs alleged "peerages for sale" scandal that procrastination may this week have ended mps had had enough of such apparent corruption the commons voted heavily to allow the british public to elect all future peers the very name "lords" may be scrapped too maybe to be replaced by "senators" or some other modern jargon mr blairs predecessor still most likely to be his finance minister gordon brown will find it hard to ignore the result centuries of political patronage appear to have ended thus has democracy finally reached england the "mother of parliaments " now comes the impolite question er have they made a ghastly mistake is it not possible that the undemocratic elitism of the house of lords was its greatest genius did its muddled cozy provenance not perhaps serve over the centuries to make britain a stronger kingdom and a more stable ally the old lords holding no mandate from the electorate was prepared to ignore populist or emotive arguments what was the point of knee jerk legislation where you were there for life lords were not accountable to any constituency except wisdom they were perfectly happy to tell their party whips to get lost what a wonderfully refreshing attitude the lords showed a clearer appreciation for personal liberty than the elected commons when there were threats to jury trial and habeas corpus introduced by "something must be done" merchants in response to al qaeda it was the house of lords that resisted the authoritarians the horrid truth for all this talk of democratic principle is that the dotty dusty house of lords was cheap to run gave the country a sense of history and worked pretty well even mr blairs patsies when they arrived started to exercise some independence of mind being from the center left they also loved their titles what would have happened back in if when setting up his model parliament edward i had tried to introduce public elections democracy no your majesty a flawed idea it will never catch on mr
