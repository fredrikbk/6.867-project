weekend journal taste only moonlight for vermont it probably came as no big surprise to the citizens of burlington vt this week that their city finished first among metropolitan areas in a "best green places" survey conducted by country home magazine if burlington hadnt won the contest it might have led to an emergency session of the state legislature investigations and who knows even special prosecutors the green mountain state is seriously green it is also seriously small its population of some is about equal to that of charlotte n c its signature export is maple syrup none would mistake it for a player on the world stage still the vermont legislature has lately been engaged to the exclusion of just about all other matters in a discussion of how it might lead the world in the mortally serious fight against global warming the president pro tem of the state senate peter shumlin was emphatic on this point "historically when we do bold things in vermont others follow " mr shumlin was quoted as saying in january "it is our moral imperative to lead again and if we succeed in being part of the solution we can help regain americas moral leadership and trust in the eyes of the rest of the world " a charming vision millions and millions of people in china and india waiting on orders from little vermont before they fall in and march las vegas turning off unnecessary lights to conserve electricity and reduce greenhouse gases because vermont has shown the way movie stars flying coach because they crave approval from the citizens of bethel brattleboro and bennington its a pretty good bet that whatever the vermont legislature does about global warming and greenhouse gases nobody in india or china or anywhere else outside of the state will notice if every living creature in vermont disappeared tomorrow their lack of activity wouldnt compensate for the carbon dioxide produced by one of the coal fired generating plants that china brings online every days so the concern over global warming in montpelier the countrys only state capital without a mcdonalds seems quixotic on the face of it and besides vermont is already a relative good guy its "carbon footprint" is fairly small why because the states electricity comes largely from dams and a nuclear plant called vermont yankee located in the southeastern corner of the state and here is where the discussion gets really interesting we have all become accustomed to political anomalies democrats for balanced budgets republicans for wilsonian foreign policies etc etc now we have among other odd spectacles global warming zealots relentlessly bashing the best available alternative to burning fossil fuels to make electricity meanwhile some serious environmentalists who once opposed nuclear power as a threat to the environment now support it as the most environmentally friendly means of producing large amounts of base load power i e that is available even when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining patrick moore among the founders of greenpeace is one of these converts and he visited vermont recently to make the nuclear case which in vermont is not about building new plants but about extending the life of the one that is operating now the vermont yankee plant is licensed by the nuclear regulatory agency to operate until the plants owners the entergy corp have made an application to extend the license for another years the state can block the extension by denying permission to store additional spent fuel on site if this happens then vermonts utility companies will be compelled to buy power that is produced by burning fossil fuels unless that is vermonters are willing to cut their power consumption by a third not likely since even ben and jerry need electricity to make their ice cream or find a way to provide the power through renewables wind is the current favorite in that category but vermonters have been reluctant to allow the construction of foot tall towers on their ridgelines and many of their objections are based on green arguments last year three wind projects were either voted down by referendum or denied permits by regulators who cited among other things the potential threat to birds and bats from whirling turbine blades resistance to wind is if anything increasing in vermont where uncluttered views are an essential part of the environmental agenda in other words it seems unlikely that vermont will in five years find a way to generate a third of the electricity it currently uses through renewable sources still for more than years now the greens of vermont have wanted to shut down yankee nuclear plant in the way that frenchmen of the late th century lusted for the liberation of alsace lorraine their ardor allows no compromise no retreat shut it down yet if vermont is truly "bold " as state sen shumlin claims it could accept the risk of storing spent nuclear fuel or construct bird chewing wind farms or both in short it could step up and take a hit for the sake of the environment if the planet has years to get its act together as some of the more messianic prophets of doom by global warming are saying then it seems almost suicidal to close down a source of electricity that produces virtually no greenhouse gases just for the sake of false piety a truly "bold " environmentally conscious state would go nuclear even more burlington will only really be the "best of" green places when local postcards show its charming leafy streets with a view of lake champlain and a nuclear power plant looming in the background mr norman writes
