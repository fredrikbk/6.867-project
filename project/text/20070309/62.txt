nbc remixes the office reruns become newpeats get ready for the television "newpeat " in an unusual experiment aimed at improving ratings for reruns nbc next week plans to air two previously seen half hour episodes of "the office" that have been re edited into a new hour long show some scenes will be cut so producers can weave in unaired footage that introduces a new storyline into the older episodes nbc a unit of general electric co wont film new footage but is instead relying on snippets that have been cut from previous tapings a spokeswoman says the "newpeats " as nbc is calling the episodes will air next thursday at p m eastern time in an age where old tv episodes are widely distributed online in some cases just hours after they air networks are struggling to attract audiences to the repeats on their schedules the big four networks in decades past could count on a significant audience to turn up for reruns because there wasnt that much competition but with video games the internet dvds sporting extras and the continued proliferation of cable all competing for their time audiences expect something more repeats of "the office" fare relatively well compared with those of many other hit shows an average of seven million people tune in for reruns of the series compared with an average of million people for new episodes according to nielsen media research but repeats for other series have fallen off drastically some of the biggest hits on television including "desperate housewives" on walt disney co s abc and "house" on news corp s fox lose of their audience or more for repeat episodes some series such as the castaway drama "lost " repeat so poorly that networks have recently started avoiding rebroadcasting them last fall after airing a string of original "lost" episodes abc debuted a new show in the "lost" timeslot instead of relying on reruns "lost" returned last month and originals will continue to air through the end of the season in may in years past reruns of the hit comedies "seinfeld" and "the cosby show" in some cases only dipped below their original audience crime shows such as the three "law &amp order" dramas that are produced with closed ended episodes stories are wrapped up within one hour instead of trailing on for an entire season also display remarkable strength in reruns networks need reruns to grease their business model networks such as nbc pay a licensing fee to studios for the right to air shows for a licensing fee of about &# million for a comedy and &# million for a drama networks get the right to air episodes twice an original and a repeat to cover the steep licensing fees networks need to sell advertising in repeat episodes without big audiences for repeats ad revenue is minimal "the office" is an off kilter comedy about mundane cubicle life at a paper supply company in pennsylvania the series is an american remake of a popular british show of the same name producers of "the office" say re editing the episodes is a way to keep the programs rabid fan base from moving on indeed keeping "the office" fans occupied has been a priority for nbc which last july rolled out a series of exclusive "webisodes" to keep the franchise alive during the summer hiatus "their loyalty must be rewarded somehow and we dont have the budget to send out million muffin baskets " says executive producer greg daniels although nbcs effort plows new ground networks in the past have tried to dress up old footage in new clothes in the s for instance it was common for some networks to air flash back episodes where characters would reminisce about the wild escapades they have endured the network could save money by just taping the short remembrance scenes and cobbling the rest together from old episodes in many ways nbcs "newpeats" are the tv version of what other industries have already been doing the music business in recent years has been putting out greatest hits cds with one or two new songs on them the popularization of dvds too has made splicing together old material acceptable a new dvd of "dont look back " a documentary about bob dylan includes a whole new documentary culled from unused footage of the original nbc says it has no plans to rework other series in a similar manner still if fans respond enthusiastically the network says it will weigh giving other series similar treatments nbc notes that tv fans particularly young ones are becoming used to re edited content popular web sites myspace and youtube for instance are filled with video that users have produced by editing together tv shows in some cases tv companies are encouraging viewers to re edit shows viacom inc s mtv just this week said it will launch a web initiative to make it easier for people to "mashup " or edit together its content but nbc runs the risk of annoying the fan base too "i hope that nbc truly offers something new in these episodes that is compelling " says will dombrowski a finance executive and fan of the show "otherwise people are probably going to feel tricked " sam schechner contributed to this article
