weekend journal tastings sounding off on restaurant wine service our readers tell us their pet peeves a big c for cheap it happened over a year ago but bradley lundy an analyst with an investment management company is still angry about it at a fancy los angeles restaurant he ordered a &# bottle of wine all around him diners were drinking from lovely riedel glasses but "i got one of those tiny old school italian restaurant wine glasses " when he insisted on better glasses the waiter refused "it was crystal clear i hadnt ordered an expensive enough bottle " mr lundy told us he regrets not having walked out but he has never returned which even mr lundy says is a real shame because "the food is fabulous " memo to restaurateurs small easy to correct problems with your wine service are making a good number of diners very unhappy some are letting you know about it but most like mr lundy will simply never return a few weeks ago we wrote a column listing minor issues that make the wine experience irksome at some restaurants for a copy of that column drop us a note at wine wsj com the response was extraordinary mr lundys experience for instance is hardly unique it has happened to us too we were at a restaurant once where the waiter actually took away the nice glasses from our table and replaced them with real clunkers sure there are good reasons why different wines might be served in different glasses depending on issues like whether the wine is red or white young or old sweet or dry sparkling or still and we can even imagine some cases where a diner orders a very very special wine so the owner breaks out the glasses he usually only uses on his own anniversary but in general linking the quality of the glass to the price of the wine is annoying and insulting restaurants argue that hey you have to consider the cost of glasses breakage and so on but in fact the markup on lower priced wines is generally a higher percentage than on more expensive wines theres plenty of room built into that lower price for good glasses our guess is that diners who order less expensive bottles get the bad glasses to make a statement to them and to other diners kind of like a big scarlet c on their chests for "cheap " "i have recoiled in some restaurants where they overprice the wine and then deliver the equivalent of bugs bunny juice glasses to drink it in " wrote donald alford weadon jr of washington d c "with the advent of better quality glass and durable crystal there is no excuse to set garbage glassware " we couldnt agree more interestingly we received more mail from women in response to that column than almost any column weve written were not sure why maybe women notice these slights more than men or perhaps women are more often slighted as dottie sometimes is when she eats out alone or in the company of other women in any event quite a few letter writers simply wrote to give us a hear hear on points we made for instance overfilling glasses when youve ordered a bottle edmond r pelta from brunswick maine wrote that he dislikes "servers who park as much wine as they can get into a glass " he added "our daughter who is an otherwise civilized young lady learned this practice when she was working as a cocktail waitress at an upscale restaurant in san jose calif when she was a college student unfortunately she hasnt unlearned the practice and when she is at our house she will pour everyone at the table a rather full glass if i cant stop her first " on the other hand a number of people like us would really rather just do it ourselves "i would prefer dont pour " wrote gerald f mcilvain of chicago "i find i drink much too quickly when the wait staff pours from my bottle " decanting without permission "i was particularly interested to hear that restaurants in your neck of the woods decant without permission " wrote irene nattel "here in montreal decanters are always at hand but i have never had a wine decanted without first being offered a taste and then being asked whether we wanted the wine decanted it hadnt occurred to me that it would be done any other way " beyond that several readers mentioned another point about decanting as voiced by veronica deguenther of tampa fla "ive always wondered when they take the bottle to open it or decant it away from the table how do you know it is the same wine you purchased " or as lyle hubbard of portland ore put it "when you decant do the whole process at the table its great drama and romances the experience and ensures that we received the wine we ordered ouch " serving reds too warm and whites too cold "more often than not i must ask our waiter to plunge a just ordered bottle of red into a bucket of ice the reaction the server looks at me like i have three heads " wrote jeff linder of great neck n y on the other hand "add one more white wine served too cold and then they want to put the bottle in a bucket of ice " wrote mike powers of morristown n j taking away glasses before theyre truly empty "cant count the number of times that a waiter has tried to abscond with the last great sip from my table " wrote james milbery of chicago serving mystery wine by the glass "i often want to see the glass of wine ive ordered being poured it seems very logical and courteous to do so " wrote john murphy of mansfield mass abusing wine "the one that continues to amaze me are people who purport to know something about wine who store it in a dedicated built in rack in the kitchen near the oven over the stove " wrote mary florin mcbride of croton on hudson n y in addition many readers brought up other issues they find annoying dont leave wine in the "empty" bottle and take it away "to join the remnants of other bottles as the basis for the kitchens next reduction " wrote mike williams of chester springs pa "at &# a bottle this is grand larceny " "dont twirl spin or shake that bottle when you serve any wine especially older wines " wrote steven pinsky of san francisco ungenerous or nonstandard pours of wines by the glass "i sure would like some standards when it comes to a glass of wine rather than depending on the eye and guess of the server as to what constitutes a glass of wine " wrote harold hawkes of melrose mass dirty glasses several people such as frank webb of wilmington del mentioned glasses or decanters that smell of detergent and ruin the taste of the wine carin fike of cincinnati wrote "please clean wine glasses thoroughly so that i do not have to enjoy my glass of wine with a previous diners lipstick on the rim " and lou martins of new york city added "seems simple enough but i am always spotting something most of the time i dont want to know what even at better places " talk about easy to fix problems and thats really the point here there are so many simple little things restaurants could do to enhance the wine experience and so many restaurants these days really do get everything right lets hope more do with each passing day you can contact us at wine wsj com
