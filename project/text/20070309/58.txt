initiative will pay students to pass ap tests jessica stark a year old from abilene texas earned &# for some hard work last year it wasnt flipping burgers or waiting tables she made the money for passing six of the toughest examinations in high school at &# apiece ms stark is part of a movement that is going national paying kids to take advanced placement tests success on these exams administered by the nonprofit college board often gives students college credit and sometimes encourages them to pursue study and careers in the field ms stark plans to become an engineer and has already been admitted to the colorado school of mines "i do homework all the time " she says "i dont have too much of a social life study parties were pretty good at those " a new initiative aimed at encouraging careers in math and science plans to replicate these ap bonuses across the country teachers get them too at times &# annually or more for helping their kids pass ap classes in math science and english the money is provided by a network of private donors along with cash students in texas sometimes get gifts such as ipods as door prizes for attending weekend prep classes the national math and science initiative expected to be announced today is a nonprofit project whose leaders include former high ranking u s department of education official tom luce former president of the massachusetts institute of technology charles vest and college board head gaston caperton it aims to build on both the texas ap incentive effort and a university of texas program that that encourages college students to become math and science teachers the programs proponents say ap incentives have succeeded at getting more students to pass the tests in texas and they expect the broader initiative to encourage more students to go on to careers in math and science but some critics question whether cash bonuses are an appropriate and effective way to engage students in the subjects robert schaeffer public education director for the national center for fair and open testing a critic of standardized tests calls the approach "basing education reform on a series of bribes to kids and bounties to teachers" and says the money would be better spent on broader efforts to improve instruction the new initiative comes as business leaders have bemoaned the mediocre achievement of u s students compared with other countries in math and science as well as a shortage of people qualified to work as engineers and computer scientists to launch the initiative exxon mobil corp is contributing &# million the biggest single gift in the oil giants history the leaders of the initiative are hoping to raise a total of &# million including the exxon gift donations from other foundations and matching government funds the bill and melinda gates foundation is considering joining the effort within five years the new initiative aims to have ap incentive programs running in school districts in states and the teacher training units set up at more than universities it hopes to add an additional u s students to the numbers now passing ap math science and english tests which means scoring or higher on a scale of to the program also covers ap classes in english because it is considered important for math and science careers last year the college board says about students nationwide passed ap exams in math and science and in english many of the same business and academic leaders involved in the initiative produced an alarming recent report called "rising above the gathering storm " their research found that only of fourth grade students of eighth graders and of th graders performed at or above the proficient level in science and that of high school math students and of physical science pupils have teachers who didnt major in the subject or werent certified to teach it international tests have shown that u s students are lagging behind other countries in math and science and in turning out scientists and engineers in the trends in international mathematics and science study ranked u s students just th in eighth grade math skills behind both australia and the slovak republic singapore ranked no followed by south korea and hong kong "the math and science situation in this country is serious serious to the point that the u s is suffering competitively today and is going to suffer worse competitively in the future if we dont do something about it " exxon chief executive rex tillerson said in an interview exxon reported a record &# billion in net income for the largest ever annual profit by a u s company put in that perspective the gift amounts to a bit more than one days profit the exxon funded effort joins a number of other government and private programs seeking to address weakness in math and science along with the ap incentive program the new initiative hopes to use uteach a university of texas program as a national model the program encourages math and science majors to enter teaching by offering them financial assistance and a teaching certificate over the next decade the initiative hopes to expand the program onto campuses with more than graduates available to help fill the expected gap in highly trained teachers of those subjects but the ap bonuses are likely to inspire the most attention dallas based advanced placement strategies inc began in that year only students passed ap tests in math and science at the original dallas schools in the program last year the number jumped to gregg fleisher the organizations president says the concept is working as the jump came from "students who wouldnt have taken the test anyway " the program in texas includes schools with significant minority and low income populations the program was originally funded by the odonnell foundation of dallas and now includes other donors it has expanded into schools around texas under the program students can receive incentives ranging from &# to &# for passing the test with students from poorer schools sometimes getting more money because for instance they may have to cut back on jobs to study more teachers get training bonuses &# to &# for becoming ap instructors improving their skills and achieving a specific increase in the number of students passing lead teachers who coordinate the program in the schools
