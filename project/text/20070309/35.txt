even in monaco the talk turns to u s subprime woes monte carlo monaco this resort town famous for its high roller gambling tables seems far from the disastrous bets made in the u s subprime mortgage business but at citigroup inc s annual credit conference here speakers and attendees say the turndown in the u s subprime market is turning up in investors portfolios where they dont expect it reflecting the increasingly connected global markets investors are realizing they may own more exposure to subprime mortgage loan pools than they thought that exposure is surfacing because of the way fixed income investments can be layered banks sell asset backed securities known as abs backed by mortgages to investors the abs can ultimately end up in complex structures called collateralized debt obligations or cdos institutional investors invest in cdos sometimes not realizing they have subprime mortgages in them "there are european investors who until a few weeks ago did not know an awful lot about what subprime was who are realizing that they actually have exposure through some of their cdos " said citigroup credit strategist hans lorenzen "ive spoken to one investor who said that their portfolio had exposure to subprime and they just knew that it had some american abs exposure they hadnt gone through enough detail" of their investment to realize they owned loans to americans with spotty credit records talk of subprime mortgages dominated several conference sessions while some investors believe the impact of the subprime sector on debt performance long term will be minimal "as far as the near term risk of further market correction is concerned its at the top of the list" of worries said matt king head of credit strategy for citigroup individual abs portfolios typically are diversified across u s regions but when they are combined into a cdo the risk of losses is increased for even relatively senior note holders because many of the original abs portfolios will have been affected by mortgage defaults "that actually makes the asset backed securities themselves less diversified from one another when they go into the cdos " mr king said "the cdo of abs market like every other market has been reaching for spread and as a result a significant proportion of the abs which has gone into cdos has been of the subprime variety " while some big banks namely britains hsbc holdings plc have set aside money to cover their losses from the subprime market there is concern that the turndown could spread to others "in some places like hsbc you have seen massive provisioning for losses " mr king said "and to be honest that makes us deeply suspicious" of banks "with exposures in that space who have not declared anything like the same degree of provisioning "
