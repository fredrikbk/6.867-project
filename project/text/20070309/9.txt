between iraq and a hard place the meltdown among house democrats over iraq is rightly being described as the first big test of nancy pelosis leadership its also an early example of just how much political damage the antiwar left is capable of inflicting on their new speaker ms pelosi has been backed into a tight corner over president bushs &# billion request for war funding hoping to quell a revolt from a liberal bloc that wants out of iraq pronto the speaker unveiled a new new plan yesterday that includes a timetable for withdrawal to begin as early as july ms pelosi needs to win this vote the first real showdown over iraq but its becoming increasingly clear she can only do that by sacrificing her moderate wing which opposes her plan and could pay heavily for it in next years election talk about a downward spiral from just a few weeks ago when ms pelosi stepped in to save senate democrats from their own iraq irresolution ms pelosis own approach was politically clever if nothing else the house resolution criticized the troop buildup making congress look as if it were taking a stand against president bush even if it had no binding force yet it also contained a sop about the "bravery" of those troops and vows of "support " words designed to coax war weary republicans into joining with democrats republican leaders were privately admitting they were beat and even the white house was bracing for as many as gop defections had ms pelosi served up that vote quick she may have presided over a stinging bipartisan rebuke to the administrations troop buildup and gained some breathing room instead madame speaker gave into the lure of a bush bashing event stretching the resolution "debate" over a week that delay was more than enough time for her liberal base to get beyond her control or rather it was enough time for pennsylvania antiwar vet john murtha to wrest the debate away from ms pelosi and let the faithful know what they could expect under his sway as the house debate got rolling mr murtha crowed to a liberal blog that the non binding resolution was just the "first step" in cutting off funding for the troops he also laid out his strategy for avoiding accusations that democrats were abandoning soldiers in the field instead of just cutting off the money his party would create new backdoor "readiness" standards that the administration would be unable to meet in one fell interview mr murtha put ms pelosi in a box republicans who might have been tempted to vote for the resolution thought better of signing up for mr murthas "slow bleed " only jumped ship on the resolution vote far fewer than even the giddiest white house official might have hoped what might have been seen as a congress wide rebuke of mr bush fizzled into a party line vote by the opposition poof went a key pelosi victory mr murtha managed to do much more than just unite republicans he blew apart his own party just as it turned to the war supplemental the sizable blue dog and moderate wing might have been willing to stick with their leadership on a non binding resolution but made clear they couldnt vote for anything the public might perceive as cutting off troop funding some such as blue dog leader allen boyd went further voicing wariness of any bill that micromanaged the war many of these moderates were the key to ms pelosis electoral victory last year as she well knows more than a few eked out wins in conservative districts because of their promises to approach iraq as adults and most have spent recent weeks reminding their leadership that if they are forced to walk the plank on an out of iraq vote they are in fact being forced to walk the plank in next years election in other words poof might go ms pelosis majority by last week ms pelosi showed signs of bowing to intelligent thought and cleansing the supplemental of iraq poison pills but her antiwar wing once again wasnt in a bowing mood mr murtha had after all promised them red meat and a clean supplemental was merely tofu the cofounders of the strong out of iraq caucus including the never sensible maxine waters and barbara lee declared their whole contingent would bolt unless the bill brought the war to an end without them ms pelosi would only be able to pass a war funding bill by teaming up with republicans and blue dogs to defeat her own base which would hardly count in ms pelosis mind as a victory her withdrawal plan of yesterday was therefore a capitulation to her liberal bloc and the only folks truly delighted were republicans minority leader john boehner has had good reason to worry about the political consequences of his party voting down its own presidents request for war funding by yesterday afternoon the gop had declared the new pelosi plan a troop funding cutoff that equaled "retreat" and felt confident they could lay a supplemental defeat at the door of the democrats mr bush jumped in with cover for the shakier elements of his party by promising a veto the message to ms pelosi is that shell have to cobble together a victory from within her own party toward that end she and appropriations chief david obey have already turned to good old fashioned bribery there is talk that the &# billion "war" supplemental will include an extra &# billion in goodies at least &# billion would be emergency agriculture spending aimed at blue dog southerners for their struggling farmers back home a huge dollop would go to childrens heath care katrina and homeland security and to provide further coverage against accusations that democrats dont support the troops theres billions more for veterans and troop health care so much for ms pelosis promise of fiscal discipline the joke is that even if ms pelosi can buy the moderate wing to her side her proposal still might go poof and why her liberal wing of course after all the speakers concessions antiwar critics were still griping yesterday that the withdrawal proposal left mr bush too much flexibility over the timing reps lynn woolsey and ms lee introduced their own amendment to the legislation that would demand a complete withdrawal by year end ms pelosi is loath to give them a vote since the amendment would surely fail and allow mr bush to note that even congress is against withdrawal the question is if her liberals will give her any choice they certainly havent up to now write
