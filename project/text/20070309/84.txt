standards deviation over the past several months the low murmur of complaints about the post enron regulatory regime has turned into a loud roar the head of the new york stock exchange the treasury secretary a wide range of business leaders even the mayor of new york city and the states senior senator have bemoaned the apparent lack of competitiveness of our nations capital markets putting aside the dubious factual claims of many of their arguments the fact remains that the way to keep our nations capital markets competitive is to preserve the advantages that we have over other markets world wide for years one of the chief differentiators our capital markets had was a clear and transparent system of financial reporting over the past decade however signs of erosion have come to light from the ease by which executives were able to manipulate numbers in order to mask a companys true performance to the creative accounting undertaken by many cities and states to hide unfunded pension obligations to preserve the privileged position of the u s capital markets we need to reinvigorate and re engineer the organizations responsible for setting the accounting standards upon which our market system rests specifically the financial accounting standards board fasb and its sister the governmental accounting standards board gasb the two groups that set accounting standards must be reconfigured to keep our markets healthy these boards have fallen captive to constituent groups slowing their progress or even diverting their efforts to keep pace with critical issues as a result standards fail to provide investors with transparent comprehensive and understandable measures of resources or performance when i was sec chairman in the s we tried to remedy this situation by remaking the board of trustees of the financial accounting foundation faf the parent organization of the fasb and gasb after an intense struggle we were able to broker a deal in which five of the trustees would be independent and represent the public interest at the time this was a good compromise but those efforts provided only temporary remedies it is now clear that the entire standard setting structure needs to be reconstituted many members of the fasb and gasb are devoted to creating a strong financial reporting system however intense interest group lobbying has delayed action and severely compromised stock option expensing pension accounting rules and now threatens lease accounting standards when the fasb falls prey to these compromises the resulting standards can end up being overly complex and confusing fas for example deals with the accounting for derivatives when it was first proposed the standard was significantly simpler and easier to understand and we expect to apply yet as different interests asked for exceptions to the rule it metastasized into an page treatise of rules and interpretations that continues to grow with each passing month the cause of this complexity is rooted in the structure of the fasb and gasb while the sarbanes oxley act created an independent funding mechanism for the fasb the gasb in order to operate still relies on donations from those for whom they write standards various constituencies in practice have board seats set aside for them at the fasb three from public accounting two from corporations one from academia and one financial analyst those who fill them in turn at times have lobbied for the groups that put them there exceptions are then thrown into the rule making mix in order to create a compromise that pleases each and every constituent group the result is a regulatory sausage that is hard for companies and investors to swallow to be fair fasb chairman bob herz created a users advisory council and an investors technical advisory committee to get investors input this is a good first step but it does not go far enough instead the fasb and gasb should be reconstituted around a written central mission to serve the investing public and those who rely on financial statements to make market decisions all the faf trustees who pick fasb and gasb members should have a demonstrable track record in serving the public interest and not be tied to a particular constituency currently faf trustees are parceled out to different groups much like the fasb ideally these would be men and women of unimpeachable integrity distinguished records of service deep financial knowledge and an understanding of the needs of users of financial reports and to break the close connection between constituency groups and the standard setting process faf trustees should be appointed by the sec in an open nomination process in turn these trustees should select fasb and gasb members not based on constituent quotas but based on who is best qualified as demonstrated by their breadth and depth of understanding about the needs of users of financial reporting their leadership and ability to think independently and their ability to translate business economics into standards that are clear reflect economic reality and serve the public interest congress should also create an independent source of funding for the gasb as it has for the fasb the potential for crisis in municipal finance arguably is worse than that in corporate america the public sector needs an equally independent and strong standard setter the result of these changes should be accounting rules that are less complex and more relevant its an approach that we should undertake not only here in the u s but among our international standard setters as well for decades we have relied on the accounting profession through the fasb and gasb operating independently to develop standards for the financial world over time vested corporate and other special interests have chipped away at that independence and undermined these organizations commitment to meeting the needs of investors and the public as a result the standards have not always been as high quality as they should be unsatisfied with the results and considering how important solid financial reporting is to our nations competitive advantage in the global marketplace its time to reaffirm the founding objectives of the fasb and gasb and re engineer our accounting standard setters to serve the public that relies on their rules mr levitt was chairman of the securities and exchange commission from to see related letter "letters to the editor accounting standard setters independent and tough" wsj march see related letter "letters to the editor dont tinker with fasb just
