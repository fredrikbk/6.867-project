why etfs can have an outsize impact on small stocks the rising popularity of certain exchange traded funds is starting to have a disproportionate effect on the trading of some companies shares according to research from prudential equity group llc three etfs that track small company stock indexes now account for to of the trading of certain smaller stocks in the popular russell small cap index the three etfs are barclays global investors ishares russell index fund ishares russell value index fund and ishares russell growth index fund this has implications for investors in individual stocks one way to gauge the markets opinion of a stock is to watch the volume of shares changing hands if a stock is being traded more heavily than usual it is an indicator of investor sentiment now in some cases etfs which are similar to mutual funds but trade on a stock market are turning that indicator on its head any money that is invested in an etf is used to buy stocks represented in the index it tracks regardless of whether they are stars or dogs money managers call this "insensitive" buying meaning the buyer in this case the etf isnt concerned with a companys business prospects "its not an indication of knowledge or information " says edward von der linde a mutual fund manager at lord abbett &amp co it also has ramifications for prices according to steven desanctis of prudential who conducted the research partly because of the heavy inflows into etfs last year some smaller stocks "had their best year " he says some mutual fund managers agree that etfs may increase volatility in the prices of smaller stocks which can be more susceptible to market pressures than the stocks of bigger companies "to the extent that the etf is a larger presence in small cap stocks theres at least a chance that theyre going to be able to move stock prices one way or the other " says curtis jensen manager of the third avenue small cap value mutual fund barclays didnt provide comment of course money flowing in and out of regular index tracking mutual funds also triggers buying and selling of underlying stocks the difference is that money tends to move in and out of etfs more rapidly than regular mutual funds triggering more buying and selling of the underlying shares one example when u s markets tumbled recently small stock etfs had much greater outflows than mutual funds between feb and feb just one etf the ishares russell reported outflows of &# billion whereas major small stock mutual funds combined had outflows of only &# million according to amg data services some etf experts say they arent entirely persuaded that etfs are boosting investment in small stocks if the etfs werent there they say one way or another investors would probably still have bought the underlying shares etfs are "one of a large group of choices that investors have " says scott ebner who heads the etf development team at the american stock exchange the prudential research found that the stocks of companies got or more of their average daily trading volume from the three etfs being studied during the first months of last year in the case of firms including the financial and banking companies park national corp columbia bancorp and national western life insurance co the etfs accounted for more than of trading while this is a small number of companies overall given that the russell index includes stocks analysts expect that as the etfs grow larger the impact will spread the ishares russell etf has grown rapidly since its creation in to become the largest small company etf in the u s at about &# billion in assets by comparison one of the most reputable small cap index mutual funds the vanguard small cap index fund which was launched in manages about &# billion the researchs methodology involved mr desanctis examining the average daily net inflow or outflow into the three ishares etfs he then calculated the money channeled into each underlying stock and further calculated the number of individual shares bought due to those inflows etfs dont necessarily hold all stocks in a given index so long as they can replicate the return of the index the calculations took that into account
