would you buy a car from a suicidal robot struggling to be heard latest auto ads go edgy dealers miss the old ones in the opening shot a gleaming car hugs the curves of a sinuous road the soaring rockies filling the background or perhaps its the glimmering painted desert or maybe the twinkling pacific next we see the once roaring auto at rest basking in the sunshine then the screen fills with big numbers and small print detailing just what itll take to get you into this little beauty down at the local dealership question is this an ad for a ford b gm c chrysler d any of the above if you picked d youre right for the most part automobile commercials look alike "most car ads are lame they are boring " says lance jensen chief executive at modernista an independent ad firm that works for general motors corp s hummer and cadillac thats beginning to change as u s auto makers which have steadily lost market share to japanese rivals despite spending more on ads look to cut through the glut of messages on tv with edgy evocative pitches theyll rely instead on the internet to bring consumers a models numbers and options "lets face it there is lots of advertising out there you have to find ways to break through " says dave sanabria marketing communications manager for ford motors edge hence gm produced an ad for last months super bowl that featured an assembly line robot contemplating suicide after being fired for dropping a screw the subtext being gms emphasis on quality while the ad drew criticism from suicide prevention groups and was re edited for future airings it sparked plenty of chatter in other u s car spots the edge is shown driving on the ledges of buildings while daimlerchrysler ags dodge nitro falls through the earths core european car makers have been moving in this direction for some time and are now taking things a bit further to hype the safety features of the jetta volkswagen ag ran an ad last year showing a graphic closeup of the car crashing japanese car makers are also becoming more creative nissan motor co recently ran an ad for its sentra showing the adventures of a man named marc horowitz living in his car ads for toyota motor corp s yaris have the car squashing a spider like creature made from gas tank nozzles plenty of car ads still follow the template of a shiny vehicle whizzing down a highway or a city street often while music plays in the background and an announcer talks about the vehicles features car dealers in particular push manufacturers for such ads which as dealers like to say "show the metal" and emphasize key points such as the price of a car but a growing consensus in the car industry argues that the traditional approach doesnt work particularly for u s auto makers trying to regain the edge a big part of the problem is simply the overload of commercials on television tv networks seeing their ad revenues flatten out are cramming more spots onto the air than ever car makers are among the biggest advertisers in the u s gm spends about &# billion a year while ford spends about &# billion and daimlerchrysler about &# billion according to tns media intelligence most of the money goes to tv foreign auto makers tend to spend a little less with toyota spending about &# billion in tns says what that means is that consumers often see an overabundance of car ads recent episodes of popular network series " " "lost" and "heroes " for instance all contained at least one car ad in each commercial break that aired media buyers for some auto makers such as gm ask networks not run ads from rivals in the same commercial break according to people familiar with the situation but because these rules apply only to ads that air nationally and not to the ads that local stations run commercial breaks sometimes feature ads for two kinds of cars media buyers familiar with the car category say research shows that consumer recall of each car ad is weakened as more air look alike ads only worsen that problem it isnt the first time auto makers have tried breaking the mold in for instance hummer got lots of attention for a spot that showed a boy building a wooden version of the car to use in a derby no actual hummer appeared in the ad but the trend is stronger today partly driven by the web because consumers can use the web to get specifics about a model of car theyre interested in like gas mileage and price car makers feel they no longer have to load up their tv ads with those details "you can pretty much do a complete buying experience on the web " says george e murphy senior vice president of global marketing at daimlerchryslers chrysler group instead companies see the tv ads as making an emotional pitch aimed at reminding people of the feeling they get from a particular brand of car "you have to seduce them " says eric hirshberg president and chief creative officer of interpublic groups deutsch los angeles which crafted gms robot ad car dealers though view the shift warily they argue that ads need to have specific information in order to lure buyers "you need to have more of a price oriented commercial i think most people are price conscious today " says steve schack general manager of gainesville dodge in gainesville fla another dealer in annapolis md who didnt want to be identified noted that most consumers buy a car only once every few years when they do they want concrete information about a vehicle not messages designed to make them loyal to a brand doug north president of north brothers ford in westland mich says the more imaginative ads can work but only in tandem with more typical messages "people have to see can i get my kids in there is it safe whats the mileage do they have an automatic transmission thats information that they need before they are even going to make a buying decision " pressure from dealers has in the past forced car makers to adjust their strategy some dealers complained about chryslers ads showing singer celine dion driving a car while her music played chrysler didnt renew the ads and soon came out with no nonsense ads emphasizing the vehicle interior while manufacturers arent likely to shift course as quickly nowadays industry executives acknowledge they need to be careful with more creative ads past attempts to break with convention have sometimes produced commercials whose meaning wasnt clear in for instance gms saturn ran an ad showing people acting like cars rather than the vehicles themselves the idea was to show that saturn was aware of the humans inside the vehicles but was "a little bit of a hard sell " says jeff goodby co chairman of omnicom group inc s goodby silverstein &amp partners which crafted the ad the spot won plenty of ad industry praise but in focus groups he says consumers had some difficulty understanding the concept but in a world where consumers are often armed with ad skipping dvrs they can expect car advertisers to try to keep pushing the limits and that may mean dropping other conventional car ad trappings such as droning voiceovers "youre relaxing after a day at work and someone shouts at your about a sunroof its like whatever " says modernistas mr jensen
