unknowns into stars every day the roughly one million people who visit the itunes store home page are presented with several dozen albums tv shows and movie downloads to consider buying out of the four million such goods the apple site offers this prime promotion is analogous to a cd being displayed at the checkout stands of all best buy stores or featured on the front page of targets ad circular how do bands get these boosts who decides whether arcade fire is plugged at the top of the itunes site or whether nickelback gets no mention apple has jettisoned some of the conventions of traditional music retailing notably the practice of selling prime promotional spots to recording companies willing to pay for better visibility for their acts but behind the scenes theres plenty of horse trading going on that influences which songs are seen and purchased by itunes customers apple now one of the largest sellers of music in the u s offers home page placement in exchange for things such as exclusive access to new songs special discount pricing or additional material such as interviews with stars most other big retailers digital and physical also seek exclusive offerings but apple is especially aggressive and has outsize clout when it comes to the slightly out of mainstream music it often emphasizes the decisions by the small group of silicon valley and music industry veterans running itunes can help put an unknown band on the map adding millions of dollars in sales while relegating others to the obscurity of the sites virtual back bins apples muscle flexing has begun to rub some artists and music companies the wrong way during a recent radio interview outspoken british pop singer lily allen accused itunes of "bullying" artists into supplying exclusive content theres a further worry among music executives that the few spots available to promote artists on itunes are dwindling as apple remakes the store into a broader entertainment destination for tv shows movies and games but so far most labels comply because of the sites ability to drive sales during a week when an album is featured on the itunes home page it can sell about five times more copies on average through the site than it does in the three to five weeks that follow when the album isnt featured says one industry executive "the way mtv used to be the place where you had to have a video playing as one of the key legs of the stool itunes is now one of the key legs of the stool " says chris douridas an influential deejay at public radio station kcrw in santa monica calif and a former consultant to itunes not only does securing a spot on the itunes home page require concessions by music companies it also depends on having material that resonates with the tastes of itunes

movies that he later purchased including an album by a british act called guillemots and a mark wahlberg football movie called "invincible " "its pretty powerful " says mr schiller years old who worked as a record store clerk while a teenager in omaha neb "it will give you exposure to stuff that you dont normally see " itunes is housed at apples cupertino calif headquarters in a cluster of nondescript cubicles that could easily be confused with a software development group but for a smattering of music posters on the walls according to people who have visited or worked there the itunes staff includes people with music pedigrees including alex luke a longtime deejay who is the director of music programming and label relations mr luke still sits in occasionally for stations like los angeless indie fm bruno ybarra who co founded a house music record label manages relationships with independent music companies denzyl feigelson a south african who was a manager for singer paul simons "graceland" tour is a music editor for itunes in london in all dozens of itunes editors and label relations staffers collaborate in meetings and discussions throughout the week to determine what the home page of the itunes store will look like when it is refreshed every tuesday apple is a rare growth story in the music business it nearly monopolizes digital music sales just about the only growth area for the beleaguered industry which saw cd sales fall for seven years running itunes sold billion songs last year compared with million in its first year in operation apple says the company says it passed amazon com last year to become the fourth largest music retailer in the u s behind wal mart stores target and best buy a claim that isnt disputed by music companies at the end of last year apple was selling five million songs a day at cents each its growing clout has transformed apple chief executive steve jobs who kick started online music sales several years ago with a set of breakthrough song licensing deals with major recording companies into a figure music executives alternately admire and grouse about mr jobs recently caused a kerfuffle by urging music executives to consider dropping their insistence on digital copy protection software on songs which mr jobs believes is holding back internet music sales label executives say that since apple began selling tv shows and movies in the past year they must begin discussions with apple three to six months before a major music release if they want a shot at home page promotion in physical stores such prime real estate is typically for sale to secure prominent "end cap" placement on cd racks near the ends of aisles at national retail chains major music labels can pay as much as &# per disc

unbiased music recommendations eddy cue the apple vice president who oversees itunes says the company hopes to recapture some of the spirit of independent record stores when clerks would give uncompromised tips on promising performers "that for us was kind of gone in the new retail environment " mr cue says customers used to believe that advice on music "was coming from someone who really liked it versus someone who was paid to say they liked it " apple isnt under as much pressure to squeeze profits from itunes because of the money it makes on ipods in fact it earns little from itunes after paying fees for the music and credit card processing itunes typically pays major labels about cents a track while it pays most independent labels around cents exclusive material greatly increases the likelihood that itunes will turn up its promotion machine in some cases that involves getting artists such as sting or willie nelson to record interviews and performances that apple sells as a package the company recently struck up a relationship with the las vegas casino the palms to record live concerts by artists such as john legend for which it pays production costs the orchard an online distributor of music from independent labels recently agreed to let apple have an album of material by the artist g love one week before other internet retailers got it apple ran a promotion on the front page of itunes and the album reached no on the sites album charts says greg scholl the distributors ceo yet ms allen the young british singer behind the hit "smile " complained during the recent radio interview about apples tactics "they wont advertise your album unless you give them extra material " ms allen said she said itunes pushed her to quickly turn out a version of a song so she planned to give them a "rubbish remix " ms allen said she would offer a better version free on her myspace page apple declined to comment on ms allens remarks and a spokeswoman for her label emi groups capitol records said the singer and her manager werent available to elaborate and while apple has made it a practice to seek out new artists itunes still has glaring gaps in its inventory the best known is the absence of anything by the beatles and much of the band members subsequent solo recordings a situation that stemmed partially from a trademark dispute between apple and the bands apple corps ltd record label apple has said its hopeful it will get the beatles on itunes following a recent settlement between the company and apple corps led zeppelin ac dc and radiohead

went so far as to bring urban artist kevin michael to cupertino to perform for itunes staffers apparently impressed itunes executives committed to releasing an apple only collection of tracks next
