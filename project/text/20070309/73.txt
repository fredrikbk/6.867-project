politics &amp economics french centrist gains ground in presidential race bayrou rides a wave of voter discontent paris in france where voters long have been split sharply between left and right vying for the presidency from the center hasnt paid off since valery giscard destaing narrowly won the office in this election however francois bayrou the candidate of the centrist union pour la democratie francaise is suddenly surging in the polls hitting a voter approval mark this week to the surprise of the political establishment mr bayrou is only a notch behind the two leading candidates shaking up what was supposed to be a two horse race according to a poll released yesterday by csa a public opinion research firm interior minister and conservative ump party candidate nicolas sarkozy commands followed by socialist party candidate segolene royal with mr bayrous sudden rise underscores a growing frustration with frances partisan politics which has produced a succession of right and left wing governments over three decades and which failed to remedy the countrys high unemployment widening wealth gap and emerging social segregation along ethnic lines economists have expressed concern that global competitive pressures could undercut frances standing as a leading industrialized nation if it doesnt tighten its finances invest more in promising high tech sectors and make its strict labor laws more flexible a former literature professor who likes to recount how he overcame a stutter as a child the year old mr bayrou pronounced "bye roo" is often photographed on a tractor at his farm in the pyrenees where he breeds race horses his family farming background embodies a cherished french image a politician with regional roots who doesnt belong to the parisian elite the bipartisan proposals with which he is wooing voters include increasing state aid for frances education system and curbing the governments authority by granting greater powers to parliament "the snag for mr sarkozy and ms royal is that they are tied to the legacy of past right and left governments " said francois miquet marty an analyst with the lh poll agency "with his centrist posture mr bayrou is doing a better job in capturing protest votes " mr bayrous bump in the polls has forced his adversaries into some awkward political maneuvering both mr sarkozy and ms royal are trying to bury their political insider backgrounds and present themselves as offering a break with the past ms royal for example is presenting herself as an outsider to the parisian intelligentsia although she is a graduate of frances elite political training school ecole nationale dadministration mr sarkozy meanwhile is trying to shake his partys patrician stigma he recently dropped by a nightclub where members of pariss gay community had gathered to discuss the candidates opposition to adoption by gay couples voter discontent has been stirring for some time in the election angry voters propelled far right leader jean marie le pen into a second round runoff against incumbent president jacques chirac a stunned socialist party rallied behind mr chirac who eventually won of the vote until his recent jump in the polls mr bayrou had a long although not particularly distinguished political career he finished fourth in first round voting with as education minister in the mid s in the conservative government of prime minister edouard balladur mr bayrou suggested increasing state funds to catholic schools a proposal that brought one million protesters into the streets this time he has successfully courted voters disenchanted with the status quo "rallying behind my name voters can impose a peaceful revolution reconciling the left and the right " mr bayrou said as he trolled for votes at frances annual agricultural trade fair this week the candidate has said that if elected he would create a coalition drawing "talented politicians" from the left and right he often cites the example of germany where in voters forced the left and right wing parties into a broad coalition however that government hasnt been able to rectify major issues such as health care funding and pensions mr bayrous rivals have tried to deride his middle of the road stance presenting it as an invitation to gridlock "aiming for the perfect middle leads to inaction " ms royal said during a recent meeting one of the hallmarks of mr bayrous approach is his attempt to reconcile social welfare policies with a pro business approach he proposes to boost job creation by allowing small companies and start ups to hire two new workers each who would be exempted from frances onerous payroll taxes at the same time he says his government would tame frances towering public debt which has soared to of gross domestic product compared with about some years ago mr bayrou has also proposed a small business act under which government contracts worth euros &# or less would be reserved for small and midsize companies mr bayrous agenda has lured some former socialists who say the left wing party is short on innovation jean peyrelevade a former chairman of credit lyonnais who spearheaded the socialists nationalization of much of french industry in the early s is backing mr bayrou "the socialists are divided and entrenched in protest " mr peyrelevade said adding that mr bayrou is the "least demagogic" of the leading candidates yet a major obstacle for mr bayrou is that his udf party has historically been linked to the right in parliaments lower chamber most of the lawmakers affiliated with udf owe their seats to a pact with mr sarkozys ruling ump party "it casts a doubt on whether mr bayrous centrist approach is genuine " jean jacques liot said after mr bayrou visited his meat stand at the agricultural fair "it smells of political gimmick " middle man a snapshot of francois bayrou the centrist candidate who has attracted growing interest from french voters born may

financing to catholic schools draws a million protesters to the streets collects of the votes in the first round of the presidential election rejects a proposal by president jacques chirac to merge
