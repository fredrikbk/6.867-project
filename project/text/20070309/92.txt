day sign up for the e mail here creditors forced one of the largest u s mortgage providers for riskier borrowers to stop making loans a clog in the credit plumbing that highlights just how far those risks have backed up across the global financial system new century financial the countrys second biggest subprime mortgage lender is far from being the only big industry player hurt by widespread defaults on its home loans but its the first to stop accepting new applications among its financial backers ubs barclays bank citigroup and bank of america have cut off new centurys credit lines the new york times reports just one of its banks expressed confidence in the company by providing &# million to finance loans and deal with other obligations and &# million to replace a credit line people familiar with the matter tell the times it was morgan stanley but even with those funds new century said it could finance only a portion of its loans this week as the times reports also yesterday one of new centurys outside directors hedge fund manager david einhorn resigned the board seat he won last year during a spat with management over strategy the wall street journal reports the exposure of new century shareholders is illustrated by that of mr einhorns greenlight capital which holds a stake in new century currently valued at about &# million down from a value of &# million plus in mid but the potential damage of the subprime lending situation may be much much wider as the journal says the investment bank creditors of new century including goldman sachs and credit suisse as well as the banks mentioned above "provide financing for lenders like new century to make loans then buy those loans and package them into securities for sale to investors world wide " the morgan stanley loan for example is secured by new centurys loan portfolio the times says in other words new century has been loaning money to risky borrowers who want to buy homes and sharing that risk with its investment banks who then took those risks and packaged them as derivatives and other products to spread the default risk and potential profits with investors around the globe this is why the turmoil in the subprime lending sector and the tightening results in the credit tap were blamed in part for last weeks tumbles in the stock markets when the markets began to fall shares in the previously soaring investment banks fell faster than the rest as the economist notes this wasnt just due to the subprime state of affairs but to the wider worries that investors have been too complacent about a broad array of credit risks "the credit markets to which the banks are naturally exposed have long looked like an accident waiting to happen " the economist says noting that interest rates for high yield corporate and emerging market debt had been historically low in comparison to the yields of much safer u s treasury bonds the gap between those credit yields widened during the market volatility last week more investment risk for chinese reserves until recently china has kept most of its &# trillion in foreign exchange reserves in safer if lower returning investments like treasurys but chinese finance minister jin renqing today confirmed the governments plans to overhaul how it manages that money in what the journal calls "a sign that the worlds largest investor is developing the confidence to take greater risks with its money " though he didnt give figures mr jin said the reserves will be managed by two different groups adding that "we will strive to achieve greater profits and benefits with the prerequisite of maintaining safety " he didnt say whether the reserves might also be used as some other officials have suggested to bolster chinas stockpile of natural resources like oil and metals mr jin spoke as the nearly delegates to the national peoples congress chinas parliament "have been enjoying their annual fortnight of wining dining snoozing and pressing the yes button " in the words of the economist the npcs function is essentially to endorse the legislative proposals of the communist party whose name in chinese literally translates into "the public property party " as the economist notes but that name seems to clash with the fact that chinas private sector now accounts for two thirds of the countrys gross domestic product thus in a long anticipated move the npc is preparing to pass a measure that would legalize private property rights in what the washington post points out is an increasingly well off society the draft legislation states that the party still considers all land to be owned by the state but that the growing economy has meant that private property "has been increasing with each passing day " protection of that property it adds is the "urgent demand of the people " on another front the npc is set to end some three decades of favorable tax treatment for the foreign companies whose investment china long sought to encourage it plans to equalize corporate tax rates paid by chinese and overseas companies yet another long awaited law that as the financial times says "will immediately benefit chinese companies which have long complained about discrimination in favor of foreigners " foreign companies previously paid taxes as small as while local companies paid a tax of up to now they will both pay fired wal mart worker on plugging a leak the wal mart stores information security employee fired this week for allegedly monitoring calls between wal mart staff and a journalist tells the wall street journal he was part of the retail giants threat research and analysis team whose job it is to "plug any information hole " bruce gabbard who along with a supervisor lost his job after the justice department began to investigate the alleged wiretapping said he took it upon himself to discover where the new york times was getting internal information about wal mart but he says he felt pressured to do so "that was the primary reason for our team to be there " he says a sahara effect on caribbean hurricanes after the ravages of katrina and rita in predictions for the hurricane season were grim with meteorological signs "unanimous in foretelling yet another hyperactive hurricane season " as the journal science recounts but the season was normal leaving the u s and caribbean relatively unscathed climatologists william lau of nasas goddard space flight center and kyu myong kim of the university of maryland suggest the mild hurricane season was the result of dust blown across the atlantic from the sahara desert in africa science reports "the dust seems to have suppressed storm activity over the southwestern north atlantic and caribbean by blocking some energizing sunlight " according to the researchers also of note new york times veterans face serious inequities in compensation for disabilities depending on where they live and whether they were on active duty or were members of the
