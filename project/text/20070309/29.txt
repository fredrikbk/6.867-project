dialing back as power shifts at&amp t may alter yahoo pact telecom can now lure broadband customers without paying others in november yahoo inc and at&amp t inc s predecessor sbc communications inc announced a partnership they touted as a "landmark strategic alliance" that would link the telecom and internet worlds sbc showcased the relationship by painting field crew vans with yahoos logo and brash purple color under the deal the companies successfully sold internet access together to millions of u s consumers the partnership offered a way for the stodgy phone company to tap into yahoos internet aura for yahoo it provided extra revenue and access to at&amp ts big customer base but today the arrangement is looking like a relic of an earlier internet era the companies are negotiating potentially sweeping changes that could scale back their partnership which expires in april says a person familiar with the matter at&amp t has quietly painted over its colorful vans expunging the yahoo logo the vans now sport at&amp ts new blue insignia alone the fraying of the alliance could be a blow to yahoo which gets roughly &# million to &# million of revenue annually from at&amp t according to two people familiar with the matter it also shows how at&amp t itself is much stronger and less reliant on yahoo than during the early days of their alliance the potential unraveling illustrates how high profile partnerships by internet companies to reach consumers can quickly become fragile big alliances can rapidly fall apart as partners interests diverge and the internet evolves the shift in the relationship of at&amp t and yahoo is partly a result of changes in the economic structure of the internet industry most significantly yahoos rival google inc has begun offering rich payments approaching &# billion in some cases to partners causing players such as at&amp t to question their existing deals at the same time at&amp t no longer needs yahoo the way it did nearly six years ago when it was struggling to coax consumers to sign up for high speed internet service today with the huge popularity of downloading video and music and other services on the web broadband is in demand the partnerships troubles also underline the web eras slowness to deliver on one of its big promises that by working together companies like at&amp t and yahoo would be able to offer internet services over a broader range of tech gadgets not just over pcs but also through cellphones and tv sets after they announced their deal in both sides believed yahoo could play a big role alongside the phone companys wireless unit as well as the television service at&amp t hoped to launch but yahoos services for mobile phones such as web search and a photo offering have since had only limited distribution on at&amp ts cellular carrier at&amp t now wants to overhaul its yahoo deal according to a person familiar with the issue instead of paying yahoo a percent of the revenue from its broadband business at&amp t wants to offer yahoo only a cut of revenue from the sale of products yahoo provides such as from its music and photo services this person says one reason at&amp t now believes it shouldnt have to share broadband subscription revenue is that the phone company has been approached by other internet companies offering to pay to reach its broadband customers says the person google over the past year has played a high profile role in paying companies that help expand its online services and advertising those offers bankrolled by googles internet ad success have roiled the market for deals structured like yahoo and at&amp ts as google pays partners rather than charges them in a written response to questions at&amp t and yahoo said they collaborate frequently and have "the most successful partnership in the industry " the statement added "that success is rooted in the open and ongoing dialogue we maintain " one person familiar with the matter says a renegotiated partnership could potentially involve increased cooperation in areas such as services or advertising for mobile phones when the two first struck their partnership at&amp t then the regional southwest phone company named sbc hoped yahoos internet luster would help it catch up with cable operators broadband offerings and compete with time warner inc s america online unit before that at&amp t had faced problems with its broadband rollout including regulatory hurdles that so frustrated chairman and chief executive edward whitacre he had said he was reluctant to spend the money to expand high speed internet service throughout the companys territory now in the wake of its december acquisition of bellsouth corp at&amp t is the countrys largest phone company with more than million high speed internet subscribers and is outpacing some cable companies in signing up broadband customers yahoo meantime has lost some of its buzz as it operates in the shadow of google and grapples with slowing revenue growth "its fair to say that as the industry has evolved and as the company has grown and the broadband marketplace has grown at&amp t shouldnt be in the position of paying them for attracting broadband customers " says one person familiar with at&amp ts thinking "it comes down to money " the roughly &# million to &# million in annual payments from at&amp t is a small fraction of the &# billion to &# billion in revenue that yahoo is forecasting for when certain payments to partners are factored out but people familiar with the matter say the fees paid to yahoo by at&amp t have profit margins as good or better than the rest of yahoos business because of the relatively minimal resources required of yahoo under the deal losing the revenue from at&amp ts broadband access could dent yahoos net income which was &# million in the relationship currently directs millions of at&amp t customers to yahoo and changes could potentially reduce their usage of yahoos sites that could lower yahoos online ad revenue more broadly including revenue related to web searches the at&amp t customers conduct the internet company shares some ecommerce and ad revenue with at&amp t under their arrangement the roots of at&amp t and yahoos partnership stretch back to a march state dinner for mexican president vicente fox where at&amp ts mr whitacre and yahoo co founder jerry yang were seated next to each other after the two companies announced an agreement in november messrs whitacre and yang took some of their executives on a trip to hawaii to celebrate at&amp t then known as sbc began selling high speed internet access coupled with yahoo services such as email with extra storage subscribers to at&amp ts broadband service got yahoos web search engine and other services on their default at&amp t web site the phone company back then bought a stake in yahoo for &# million at first the highflying dot com and the staid telephone company werent an obvious fit but the two teams warmed up to each other at&amp t staff began instant messaging with their yahoo counterparts and top at&amp t executives began leaving their ties at home when they traveled to yahoo meetings the at&amp t yahoo agreement quickly began helping at&amp t make up for lost revenue from its traditional phone business the partnership became so successful that the two sides explored numerous collaborations including some never made public in yahoo and at&amp t plotted an acquisition of walt disney co after comcast corp launched an unsolicited disney takeover plan said two people familiar with the matter microsoft corp was rumored to be entering the contest and yahoo wanted to block it said the people familiar with the discussions time warner was also considering entering the fray these people said yahoo and at&amp t went as far as lining up bankers to prepare the joint bid in the end microsofts move never materialized at&amp t and yahoo backed away and the comcast deal collapsed yahoo and at&amp t in the past have seriously discussed making joint bids for other major internet assets said another person familiar with the matter by winter yahoo and at&amp t staffers were working together on new projects beyond the scope of their initial agreement after several months of negotiating top executives from yahoo and at&amp t agreed on the outlines of an expanded partnership agreement over lunch in a private suite at the bellagio hotel in las vegas the two companies announced their expanded tie up in november the new agreement gave yahoo a central role in at&amp ts plan to offer a range of new features that combined voice video and internet services customers were to be able to tap into a yahoo portal via a cellphone pc or tv to do things such as route phone calls check email order tv programming and set parental content controls for the internet or television yahoo also would provide software for at&amp ts planned tv service as well as for cellphones for at&amp ts wireless unit but by early last year many of the reasons at&amp t and yahoo came together in the first place had changed or disappeared the phone giant had amassed roughly seven million broadband subscribers and no longer faced intense competition for internet customers from aol which had made much of its services freely available on the web yahoos popular email service was still a core attraction for at&amp t subscribers but google had started to offer a competitive free email service at&amp t also saw that google had started to pay companies such as computer maker dell inc hundreds of millions of dollars over several years to distribute google software and set consumers default settings to googles search engine google subsequently signed a deal under which it promised a minimum of &# million in advertising revenue to news corp sites including myspace for using google search technology and carrying ads brokered by google among the companies getting checks for using googles search service were other broadband providers such as cable giant comcast complicating matters at&amp t was getting offers from internet companies to put their search services on at&amp ts web sites and share in the advertising revenue not only was at&amp t paying yahoo under their exclusive deal the phone company also was precluded from pursuing these offers according to a person familiar with the matter meanwhile efforts by at&amp t and yahoo to jointly provide internet based services for devices such as tv sets and cellphones have been bumpy yahoo had hoped that at&amp ts wireless unit would push yahoos "go for mobile" software which links cellphone services such as photos and email with consumers yahoo accounts but at&amp t has only shipped the software with one device which it no longer sells at&amp t lets consumers access yahoos web search on mobile phones but its listed alongside four other search providers some of the original features the two companies said they might offer to span devices have yet to materialize customers cant for example route phone calls or set parental controls for at&amp ts tv service using the two companies joint site internet policy issues have pitted the two companies against each other at&amp ts mr whitacre a year and a half ago said he wanted to charge internet companies to deliver content such as video clips to consumers at higher than usual speeds he named yahoo as one such company since then yahoo has attached its name to groups that lobby for so called "net neutrality" laws to preempt such fees their positions on opposite sides of the issue were especially awkward last year when at&amp t was trying to persuade regulators to approve its takeover of bellsouth and net neutrality emerged as a potential stumbling block to the deal people familiar with the matter say mr whitacre has at least once raised the idea of at&amp t and yahoo merging when yahoos stock has swooned last summer mr whitacre pitched such a deal to executives at the internet company according to one person familiar with the approach but yahoo wasnt keen to do it people say yahoo executives have subsequently expressed confidence that the company would remain an independent concern "we and our board see tremendous opportunity for yahoo as a public company " chief executive terry semel said in an interview in january when asked about rumors that it could be acquired these days at&amp ts management is focusing more on other services such as its wireless company which is the biggest in the u s in terms of customers and the company doesnt have trouble selling consumers on faster internet connections anymore at&amp ts mr whitacre has made no secret that hes on the prowl for another acquisition the company invested &# million in echostar communications corp in some industry executives think at&amp t eventually could try to acquire an international wireless carrier at&amp t had no comment on future merger and acquisition activity while a change in its relationship with at&amp t would likely hurt yahoo financially the internet company has been pursuing its own initiatives to expand beyond the computer to cellphones and tv sets in january the company unveiled a new version of its yahoo go software that it is marketing to consumers to install on mobile phones themselves even if at&amp t isnt doing that yahoo separately offers free software for pcs called "go for tv" that consumers can use to access yahoo services such as photos and music on their tv sets
