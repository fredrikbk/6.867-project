weekend journal review theater laughing at lear new york kevin kline is smart imaginative and unfailingly watchable but can you really see him as king lear evidently james lapine does mr lapine who is best known and rightly so for collaborating with stephen sondheim and staging "the th annual putnam county spelling bee " has directed the new production of "king lear" in which mr kline is currently starring at the public theater admiring both men as i do i hoped against hope that their "lear" would work but it doesnt not at all and though its not the worst one ive ever seen that prize goes to robert fallss comprehensively stupid production presented last summer at chicagos goodman theatre its pretty awful all the same no matter who played shakespeares fatally misguided monarch mr lapines "lear" would still be an incoherent oddity the first half is set in what looks like the stairwell of a modern art museum the second half in a sandbox the costumes are part "vicwardian" mr kline makes his entrance wearing a velvet smoking jacket and part god knows what no doubt the director had a point ive never seen a production of "king lear" so thickly smeared with self evidently high concepts but i didnt get it might it be that mr lapine was simply trying to devise a "lear" so offbeat that mr klines distinctive presence wouldnt seem out of place at hes not altogether too young to play shakespeares decrepit deluded king but he looks too young even with a scraggly white beard and that puts him at a disadvantage the moment he steps on stage nor is lears demented rhetoric quite within mr klines theatrical range he comes off well in the plays meditative moments but every time he turns up the volume it sounds as though hes doing a sly parody of a ham actor further complaints the pacing is slow and overemphatic the incidental music by mr sondheim and david starobin is alternately pretty pretty and spooky spooky though i liked their stark setting of the shakespeare sonnet that mr lapine has inserted just before intermission logan marshall greens edmund is obtrusively showy i could go on but i wont for the truth is that i didnt buy anything about mr lapines "lear" except philip goodwins fool a drunken clubfooted vaudevillian who looks like harpo marx and talks like jimmy durante unlike the rest of this misbegotten production he made sense great acting can do a lot to make a mediocre play look good an axiom proved yet again by both of the roundabout theatre companys new revivals one off broadway and one on alfred molina last seen around these parts as tevye in david leveauxs revival of "fiddler on the roof " is now giving a commanding performance in the title role of "howard katz " patrick marbers play about a foul mouthed london talent agent whose marriage and career suddenly come unglued mr molina blasts his lines at the audience as if he were spraying it with rounds from an automatic weapon and doug hughes has flanked him with a strong supporting cast led by alvin epstein who appeared a half century ago in the new york premiere of "waiting for godot" and whose own king lear seen off broadway last spring burns brightly in my memory mr hughess staging is fast and unrelenting while scott pasks set is suitably dour so whats the problem well watching a play about a midlife crisis is like listening to a song cycle about prostate trouble and mr marbers take on the old old story is a stealthily sentimental and b far from fresh in fact it was around the time that mr molina tried unsuccessfully to go back to his wife jessica hecht that i recalled how tony shalhoub had been put through a not dissimilar wringer just two months ago in theresa rebecks "the scene " its not that theres nothing new to be said about such crises but whatever it is mr marber hasnt said it four blocks downtown at the roundabouts larger american airlines theatre john mahoney is working wonders in "prelude to a kiss " craig lucass wannabe serious romantic comedy about a dying old man who mysteriously swaps bodies with a quirky young babe annie parisse on her wedding day mr mahoney who hasnt been seen on broadway in years had a solid reputation as a stage actor before he spent a well paid decade as martin crane on "frasier " now i know how he got it not only are the scenes in which he plays the babe in a mans body brought off with the utmost finesse but hes wrenchingly believable when he becomes himself again as for ms parisse another familiar tv face she did a turn on "law &amp order" who knows her way around a stage suffice it to say that she does mr mahoney as well as he does her and when shes being herself she oozes star quality alan tudyk is engaging as the husband narrator the other cast members do their jobs with supreme competence santo loquastos glossily urban sets come and go unobtrusively it isnt hard to sit back and let yourself be entertained but dont expect more out of mr lucass punchline strewn fantasy about love and death which longs to be profound but settles for sugary slickness "how precious the time is how little we realize till its almost gone " mr mahoney assures us stop the presses dog bites man
