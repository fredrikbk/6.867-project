the evening wrap mending walls online edition good fences make good neighbors the old saw says but while president bush and democrats in congress may share some common ground on controlling immigration economists are none too thrilled with the barriers the administration is trying to build around certain types of trade conservatives wary of extending anything that could be construed as amnesty to illegal immigrants have demanded proof that the presidents border security initiatives are working before they sign on to support his comprehensive reform package in congress mr bush says proof is now in view nearly one year ago the president went to yuma ariz a city nestled on the border with mexico and california to announce that he was placing national guard troops along the border today he said that plan is working "the good folks down here are making progress " mr bush said at a u s border patrol station the president is pushing a plan that includes a guest worker program and limited legal rights for the estimated million illegal immigrants now in the u s congressional democrats have signaled their eagerness to pass some kind of reform measure massachusetts sen edward kennedy said there is "a lot of common ground especially in the need to strengthen our borders and enforce our laws " but mr bush and the democrats need to woo more republicans in order to win passage

criminal act and has increased fines and penalties for offenders further piracy isnt just a china problem that sort of poaching is also an issue in countries like russia piracy much like illegal

that "inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in china costs u s firms and workers billions of dollars each year " but some economists worry that whatever the numbers on counterfeiting really are the broader toll of roiling trade relations with china may be even greater todays developments follow last weeks decision by the administration to open the door to steeper tariffs on
