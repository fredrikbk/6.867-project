politics &amp economics for thompson delay is costly as white house run is debated money goes to declared candidates washington if fred thompson decides to run for president he will have some powerful supporters the self described "tennessee mafia " a group of republican politicians from his home state well versed in the craft of national campaigns what the actor and former senator may lack is the financial juice that fired the group for more than a quarter century driving local and national campaigns with astonishing amounts of cash "mafia" members include howard baker a former republican senator ambassador and white house chief of staff who himself ran for president in sen lamar alexander a former two term tennessee governor who ran for president in and and bill frist the former senate republican majority leader who considered then rejected his own run for the white house for egged on by a campaign to draft him and buoyed by polls that suggest he would be a serious contender even though he hasnt declared the conservative and blunt spoken mr thompson has said he is considering jumping in and may make a decision as early as next month but in a presidential campaign that is likely to be the most expensive yet three candidates have already banked over &# million in donations dithering would seem to be a liability mr thompsons deliberations have already cost him a natural ally ted welch a wealthy nashville businessman with an uncanny knack for raising political cash has long been the go to guy for republicans seeking the highest office a successful commercial real estate developer he has served as republican national committee fund raising chairman and as a chief fund raiser for ronald reagan president bush and his father in their campaigns he has also given generously to mainly republican candidates &# in the last years according to campaign filings this time around he is pledged to former massachusetts gov mitt romney "fred is a dear friend " mr welch said in a telephone interview "but i committed to mitt romney and once i committed i cant back out " though the biggest recipients of mr welchs efforts have been tennessee politicians such as mr thompson last week he hosted an event in nashville for mr alexanders re election campaign that hasnt insulated him from criticism for foreclosing a role in a thompson campaign mr welch said he is called frequently about a possible thompson candidacy and he said the people on the other end of the line arent mollified when he tells them he originally planned to back local favorite bill frist when mr frist opted out mr romney came calling in the presidential sweepstakes candidates are wielding their war chests to drive weaker contenders from the race three hopefuls mr romney new york sen hillary rodham clinton and illinois sen barack obama each collected more than &# million in the first quarter for the same period in al gore led the field with &# million money mr welch said "is going to be a challenge for anybody entering late " this applies to other requirements of a presidential campaign too top campaign staff get snapped up early as do local politicians able to drum up support in some states last week for example former new york mayor rudolph giuliani recruited florida attorney general bill mccollum to lead his efforts there he had earlier won the endorsement of louisiana sen david vitter both are from states that as a southern conservative mr thompson could be expected to run well if he was in the race strong candidates can overcome such challenges and mr welch said he expects mr thompson "could raise enough money to be competitive" should he decide to run and with the dissatisfaction many in the party are voicing about the current field republican primary voters could follow as well mr romney may have cash but some conservatives have raised questions about his commitment to their social agenda and an undeclared mr thompson outpolls him mr giuliani leads in the polls but is seen as too liberal on social issues by many party faithful arizona sen john mccain who has been running second in polls turns off some voters with his unswerving support for the iraq war and there still are some bruises in the party from his challenge to president bush in the race mr thompson by contrast has a conservative record that many party members find appealing his private life a successful acting career and children ages and might keep him from running however among the staunchest of his backers is rep zach wamp a six term tennessee congressman who helped plant the idea of a thompson candidacy in the first place he said he and former sen baker hit on the idea late last year and mr thompson hasnt discouraged him about three weeks ago mr wamp and john duncan a fellow tennessee congressman started an independent campaign to bring him into the race and launched a web site fred com to spread the word and attract supporters will fred run mr wamp said he is unsure as head of the independent committee known as a for the section in federal campaign law that covers such groups he is barred from speaking to mr thompson about the subject could fred win "you would not believe the kind of reaction were getting its like fireworks going off over the national mall on the fourth of july " mr wamp said could fred win without mr welch mr wamp admits this isnt the scenario he would prefer but mr welch has been active in tennessee and national politics for more than a generation he said and he has spawned his share of capable if lesser known fund raising acolytes "i dont want to downplay it sure youd like to have a ted welch in your corner " said mr wamp "but we have a pretty good farm team here in tennessee "
