status quo kidnapping some things in life you can depend on such as the claims in the u s foreign policy establishment that irans release of the british hostages last week is an opening to negotiate with the mullahs the folks at the council on foreign relations seem especially eager to sit down with what they like to call this "status quo power " as it happens on friday the british sailors and marines who were hijacked by irans revolutionary guards discussed their treatment at the hands of their captors the brits described a coordinated assault in iraqi waters by two iranian vessels once they surrendered the british captives were blindfolded and their arms tied behind their backs as they were lined up facing a prison wall one marine said that a prisoner declared aloud that he thought they were about to be executed over the course of two weeks the brits were barred from speaking to one another they were interrogated at night and advised that they had a choice either of confessing to crossing into iranian waters or spending years in prison the photos of the prisoners mingling with one another that iran had released to the world were staged for propaganda purposes and bore no relation to their actual treatment only at the end of their kidnapping were the brits told to don irans version of casual friday attire for their meet and greet with president mahmoud ahmadinejad once upon a time such kidnapping was considered piracy or an act of war and we sent in the marines if this sort of behavior is what our foreign policy nabobs now believe is typical for a "status quo" nation then we guess the acceptable rules of world civility have changed with their blessing
