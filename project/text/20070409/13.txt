the first time require the full board to approve and be legally responsible for the proxy statements report on pay practices "some of the recent changes in ceos perks and overall compensation levels are clearly driven by the changed disclosure rules " says david yoffie a harvard business school professor on the board compensation committees at intel corp and charles schwab corp such "pay practices are now being discussed by the entire board to an unprecedented degree " says charles elson a healthsouth corp and autozone inc director who runs the weinberg center for corporate governance at the university of delaware business school boards hottest target perquisites on top of their salaries bonuses stock options and restricted shares most chiefs enjoy a stunning array of benefits these often include free financial planning home security systems and chauffeur driven cars the perks frequently cost a company relatively little but draw considerable criticism as symbols of irrational largess under the new disclosure rules proxy statements must list executive perks valued at &# or more apiece the old rules limited disclosure to perks valued above &# with their reputations on the line directors fear being embarrassed by the enlarged list twenty eight businesses cut or curbed at least one ceo perquisite in concludes a proxy analysis of major u s corporations by mercer human resource consulting for the wall street journal among them personal use of corporate aircraft club membership fees and "gross up" payments to cover officers tax bills for other compensation washington mutual inc one of the companies said ceo kerry k killinger had just one perquisite last year personal usage of corporate aircraft and began reimbursing his employer for such use at the start of this year some companies acknowledge the expanded proxy requirements played a role in their killing certain perks "we certainly had our eye on the new disclosure rules " says john daniel an executive vice president at first horizon national corp in december the memphis tenn bank holding company stopped reimbursing executives for taxes paid on benefits such as a car allowance disability insurance premiums and personal use of corporate aircraft first horizons board pay panel primarily halted the reimbursements because they no longer were seen as good governance according to mr daniel when a business covers a senior officials taxes "the perception is that the executive is getting something special " he says dissident investors occasionally claim credit for pared perks applebees international inc is struggling with depressed earnings and a proxy fight by hedge fund activist richard breeden his greenwich conn investment firm breeden partners lp holds about of applebees shares in a january letter to the chairman of the applebees compensation committee mr breeden lambasted what he suggested were extensive flights on corporate planes by former applebees ceo lloyd hill the companys planes had flown times since last april in and out of galveston texas where mr hill "happens to own a beach house " the letter said mr hill has remained board chairman since he left the corner office last september laurie ellison an applebees spokeswoman says she doesnt know how many of those flights mr hill was on shareholder interests arent served "by turning corporate aircraft into flying limousines for senior executives personal vacations " the breeden letter argued mr breeden a former sec chairman thinks his attack persuaded applebees directors to ban senior officers personal use of the companys sole remaining plane effective march it recently sold its other plane the rides will occur only "in the case of a medical emergency or other extreme hardships " the overland park kan restaurant chain states in its latest proxy the board updated the policy to reflect "best business and governance standards " ms ellison says a handful of chiefs are encouraging the perks retreat undoubtedly "because theyre worried about internal optics as lavish benefits can demoralize a work force " says g steven harris a mercer senior executive compensation consultant sunoco inc s john g drosdick asked the philadelphia refiner and gasoline retailer to cease tax gross ups for his personal use of corporate aircraft the current proxy says he also abandoned his company provided car financial counseling and country club dues in addition he decided to pay sunoco upfront for the full annual cost of his company parking space and home security monitoring system mr drosdick can well afford the extra tab perks accounted for &# of his total compensation which sunoco valued at about &# million "the proxy statement speaks for itself " says spokesman jerry davis similarly exelon corp s plan to drop most executive perquisites next january was strongly supported by chief executive john w rowe says gary snodgrass chief human resources officer for the chicago electric utility and mr rowe rejected the &# he is entitled to under the companys plan to give officials one time transition payments to cover their canceled company cars financial planning and club memberships because "he felt it was unnecessary " mr snodgrass says "john had a pretty good year last year " mr rowes compensation totaled &# million a regulatory filing reported not all ceos simply lose out when they lose perks norman h wesley the longtime chief of fortune brands inc received &# in perks last year a small piece of his &# million total compensation the deerfield ill consumer products giant abolished some of those perks his allowance for a car financial planning and country club membership last month in return the company bumped up his salary &# to &# million the idea was to simplify compensation "and keep everyone whole in the process " says company spokesman clarkson hine perquisite reductions "get rid of this nickel and dime stuff " says charles haggerty a retired leader of western digital corp whos mulling similar moves at four other companies where he chairs the pay panel but "in the grander scheme of things " he adds "perks arent a big item " the more valuable goodies such as severance pay deferred compensation and supplemental pensions are disappearing more slowly even though the new proxy rules highlight their stupendous size jerry a grundhofer chairman of u s bancorp and ceo until his december retirement amassed &# million in deferred compensation and pension benefits for instance teri charest a u s bancorp spokeswoman says mr grundhofer can now collect his years of accumulated benefits but she declines to say whether he does among these big ticket items huge severance deals have come under the sharpest attacks at least a dozen big

after a takeover of the abbott park ill drug and medical device maker more than &# million of mr whites stock options and restricted shares would have vested if abbott had changed hands last dec the latest proxy reports he would have been eligible for three years salary and bonus too mr white believes a change in control accord isnt necessary says company spokeswoman melissa d brotz sumner redstone executive chairman of viacom inc and cbs corp in new york is among the few business titans to relinquish deferred compensation he and fellow directors revised his pay packages so theyre more closely tied to shareholder returns according to both companies mr redstone previously collected &# million a year in deferred compensation from viacom and cbs plus two salaries he changed his mind partly because philippe dauman spurned deferred compensation when he took the helm of viacom last september viacom spokesman carl folta says mr redstone the media conglomerates chief before it split early last year also swapped his &# million of deferred compensation for viacom options and lowered his &# million salary to &# million at both companies cbs recently agreed to settle a shareholder suit filed against viacom before the split that alleged directors breached their fiduciary duty by approving nearly &# million in compensation for mr redstone and two other executives after a year in which viacoms share price fell nearly several other employers are curtailing their chiefs potential payout from a supplemental executive retirement pension or serp such pensions can be very expensive

following a review launched by ceo kerrii anderson while she was finance chief recalls jeffrey m cava an executive vice president at the dublin ohio fast food chain "times had changed " he says such steps however fail to mollify disgruntled investors they say too many chief executives still reap sizable compensation despite poor performance they vow to step up their activism by seeking lifetime limits on equity grants eradication of employment contracts and board seats businesses with the worst investor returns typically "have not made any attempt to link performance and compensation and are substantially overgenerous " says mr breeden the applebees dissident he finds board members only "get religion about executive pay when somebody runs against them "
