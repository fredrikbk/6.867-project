the last tycoon worlds greatest newspaper " the chicago tribune used to bill itself with p t barnumesque modesty worlds greatest it never was but viewed from my neighborhood in chicago it always seemed the worlds least jewish newspaper which makes the fact that the paper is now owned by sam zell son of immigrant jewish parents from poland the first of the ironies associated with mr zells much publicized recent acquisition of the tribune company the crown jewel of which is of course the trib when i was a boy during world war ii and well beyond the chicago tribune was not allowed in our house the paper was owned and run in those days by colonel robert mccormick whose anglophobia defined his psychology and worldview his philosophy and religion the colonel was an american firster which is to say an isolationist during the war which is further to say that he thought the nazis were europes and not our problem with jews being systematically slaughtered by hitler this did not play well in chicago jewish households the colonel also loathed franklin delano roosevelt whom he viewed as in cahoots with the english and a traitor to his fdrs and the colonels own social class as an interventionist roosevelt had the jews in thrall my father normally a temperate man so disliked the chicago tribune that once when he had a flat tire in a snowstorm and a man driving a tribune truck offered to help him my father told the man to mind his own damn business and bugger off my father used to tell that story as an example of how stupid politics can make you even by the early s jewish funeral directors advised families of the deceased not to bother placing paid for obits in the chicago tribune since no jews read it in calling the trib the least jewish of newspapers i dont mean to suggest that the paper is today or in recent years has been anti semitic i mean only that jews have always seemed to have so small a hand in running it either editorially or at the level of management tall laconic midwestern irishmen with names like madigan have been at the helm for all the zany talk of jewish control of the media the jews never laid a glove on the chicago tribune enter mr zell a short bearded man of who favors jeans over business suits and rides a motorcycle and who made an early killing in real estate riding to the rescue &# odd million in hand to buy the tribune company the chicago tribune under jewish ownership incroyable as they scarcely ever say at city hall ive never met sam zell but i did go to school with a few fellows like him guys who scored often and heavily while still young their fathers tended to be merchants and they studied business at state schools illinois wisconsin michigan where mr zell went some of them going on to law school in those days the late s and early s received opinion had it that with a cpa and a law degree one held the world by that exceedingly delicate part of the male anatomy indispensable for reproduction not diverted by culture or libertinage their eyes never off the prize these men now in their late sixties and early seventies have no social ambitions unlike new york multimillionaires they are never photographed with their wives at hopeless parties alongside ralph lauren and karl lagerfeld nor do they wish to set up as pundits or public figures they seem perfectly content merely to get richer and richer they do however observe certain amenities of the ultra wealthy they no longer fly commercial belong to eight or country clubs around the country donate enough money to have new wings of medical schools named after their deceased parents come to divorce settlements with ex wives in which scores of millions are forked over they also happen to be nice guys whose notion of a good time is golfing with michael jordan or flying mayor richard m daley down to the super bowl in a private plane in chicago a number of them are partners in owning the white sox which is managed by jerry reinsdorf a brooklyn and not chicago born real estate player of the similar type and temperament mr zell is one of the white sox owners but now by buying the tribune company with its various newspapers and radio and television stations he appears to have stepped outside the realm of the extremely wealthy hobbyist into that of a man in a position to influence public opinion mr zell reports that he plans to take the management of the chicago tribune seriously owning a newspaper not as ones principal source of income but as a sideline of sorts has in recent years attracted lots of very rich men zellionaires one might henceforth think of them mortimer zuckerman appears to derive much pleasure from owning the new york daily news a hedge funder named michael steinhardt has a large investment in the new york sun on which he hoped for more than mere financial returns david geffen and ronald burkle have declared their eagerness to acquire the los angeles times now owned by mr zell if i were a cartoonist i should draw these gents together in a large motorboat with lots of louis vuitton luggage piled up at the stern racing to catch up with and board the titanic for one of the strong conclusions of the day is that newspapers are on the way out and well beyond saving even by the application of sound business principles the young rarely read them advertisers are losing interest in them the internet appears to be beating them at every turn as the news and information medium of choice so why are all these rich men scrambling to buy up newspapers and newspaper companies while the rest of the world seems in agreement that newspapers are going down the you tubes is owning a newspaper or media company nothing more than the new xanadu of the very rich an expensive folly bred by sheer egotism yet these are not men in the habit of losing large sums of money especially for the fun of it do they know something the rest of us dont is it possible finally that with all these new players what in the chicago of my boyhood used to be called the smart money taking a hand that the newspaper game itself may be a long way from over pleasing to think its possible at least for those of us who love newspapers mr epstein is the author most recently of "alexis de tocqueville democracys guide" harpercollins
