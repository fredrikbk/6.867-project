politics &amp economics singapore growth quandary whats enough land reclamation and influx of foreign talent risk an internal backlash singapore singapore a president of giant neighbor indonesia once said is nothing but a tiny "red dot " it isnt so tiny anymore a land reclamation campaign has added two manhattans worth of fresh territory to this tropical island in the last four decades with new dredging under way all around its coasts meanwhile as the government opened the gates to more immigrants the city states population has risen to more than million from three million people in while this growth has already made singapore more populous than nations such as new zealand and ireland the government says it wants even more people the current population it argues just isnt sufficient to fulfill singapores long standing ambition to become an international financial cultural and commercial hub on a par with cities such as new york and london "we need to have a critical mass which is probably higher than million " minister of national development mah bow tan said in an interview "we have to have here a global city serving the needs of the region and the world we still have room to grow " so in planning for the future the islands authoritarian government now assumes the population will reach million in the next few decades since native singaporeans have one of the worlds lowest birth rates such rapid growth would require flooding the island with legions of newcomers from countries such as china and india the government admits tens of thousands of immigrants every year foreigners on temporary visas already make up one fifth of singapores population such dizzying transformation of the countrys physical and social landscape is beginning to cause a backlash even parliament members from the ruling peoples action party have been expressing disquiet "with such limited land surely something has to give one only needs to visualize the cramped apartments in hong kong the crowded streets in chennai and the high property prices in central london in order to get a sense of what its like living in an overcrowded city " pap lawmaker ahmad magad said in a recent parliament hearing as property prices skyrocket and traffic jams become commonplace despite heavy taxes on car ownership opinion pollsters report that of singaporeans believe the country already has all the immigrants it needs a recent commentary in the islands today newspaper described singapore as a "revolving door nation " where foreigners come only because of materialistic concerns without any desire to integrate in the native society many singaporeans are particularly sore about the influx of so called "foreign talent" the well educated professionals whom the government is especially eager to lure "there is a pervasive worry that the foreign talent will take middle class jobs and its a valid fear " says angelique chan associate professor of sociology at the national university of singapore "when the foreign talent comes in its often at a higher level higher pay and with better housing" than native singaporeans she says government officials acknowledge these fears moving this year to bolster social spending on its citizens and excluding foreigners from some education and health care subsidies but they also argue that large scale immigration is the only way forward for singapore and that immigrants ultimately create more jobs than they take "we as singaporeans each one of us we have to welcome immigrants " prime minister lee hsien loong urged fellow citizens in a national day speech last year "we need the foreigners to come to add to our color to make this a special exciting diverse cosmopolitan place " to accommodate the newcomers singapore is pushing ahead with huge new infrastructure projects a whole new downtown is being constructed on what used to be the seabed next to singapores current central business district and the government has announced multi billion dollar plans to extend the public transport system it is also pumping vast funds into the network of plants that turn sewage into potable water dubbed here newater singapore expects newater usually called recycled urine by snickering newspapers in neighboring countries and imbibed at press conferences by beaming singaporean ministers to fill one third of its water needs by the land reclamation campaign is the lynchpin of this growth plan creating physical space for the population expansion one of the main areas where reclamation is proceeding full steam nowadays is the tuas peninsula an industrial area that jags southwards from singapores western edge in contrast with singapores tropical greenery these newest bits of the country still present a desert landscape of sand fields covered by withered shrubs just offshore a large dredging ship sucks cubic meters or cubic yards of water and sand from the sea bottom every day pumping it via a snaking pipeline to a nearby hill as this brownish liquid flows from the hill back into the sea painting the water in a pale yellow hue most of the sand stays onshore slowly but steadily pushing the coastline westwards though singapore says its using silt screens to limit any environmental damage from such work its neighbors indonesia and malaysia arent convinced the reclamation effort has become a recurrent point of contention in singapores relations with both countries while fast growing rival hubs such as dubai and hong kong also have massive land reclamation projects with similar environmental issues singapore is unique in being hemmed in between two foreign states in malaysia went to an international court arguing that singapores reclamation works have encroached upon its territory and destroyed its fragile sea life while malaysia lost that case in the chief minister of its southernmost state of johor which borders on singapore has rekindled the controversy by claiming that januarys devastating floods in the state were a result of singaporean reclamation clogging the mouth of johor river singapore rejected these accusations apprehension is even more acute in indonesia where parliament speaker agung laksono in february called for the expulsion of singapores ambassador to protest the "unfriendly" reclamation work citing environmental damage from reclamation indonesia also banned all export of sand and granite to singapore prompting the city state to tap its strategic reserves and to use more distant suppliers such environmental concerns are shared by some within singapore too about of singapores own coral reefs have been destroyed by reclamation and most of the rest are threatened by silt from the projects says leong kwok peng of the singapore nature society "our reclamation is proceeding quite indiscriminately " he warns as a result he says "the natural coastal habitat is gone " the singapore government promises increasingly stringent environmental controls to reduce such damage but it also insists that the reclamation program must continue apace current plans call for adding another square kilometers or square miles a manhattan size chunkto singapores square kilometer territory "our responsibility " says national development minister mah "is to make sure that the conditions are there for singapore to continue to grow and to prosper "
