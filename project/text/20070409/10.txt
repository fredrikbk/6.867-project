ceo compensation survey a special report compensation carrot can pay policies help create a more diverse workplace the jury is still out over the past decade a handful of companies have linked management compensation to efforts to further workplace diversity do the incentives work many compensation and diversity experts as well as the companies that have adopted these approaches say such policies are helping to create more diverse workplaces but critics say that if linking compensation to diversity efforts is effective its only mildly so in part because such policies often are vague arent strictly enforced dont provide enough incentive or fail to support women and minority workers once they are hired while the number of companies employing such policies is growing it remains small no one has complete statistics but frank dobbin a professor of sociology at harvard university says that a harvard study of a broad representative sample of u s corporations with at least employees showed that only of the firms linked executive bonuses to diversity performance among the companies that have such plans are coca cola co johnson &amp johnson and merrill lynch &amp co companies institute such plans for a variety of reasons with an ever more diverse u s population and an increasingly global marketplace many businesses view such efforts as a crucial step toward expanding their markets others act in the wake of negative publicity and costly employee lawsuits both texaco inc which has since become part of the company now called chevron corp and coca cola put such policies in place after paying large settlements in class action lawsuits that alleged discrimination cyrus mehri a founding partner of the washington based law firm mehri &amp skalet pllc who served as class counsel in both the texaco and coca cola actions says incentives are critical to increased diversity in the workplace "everybody is talking the talk but they wont do anything unless theres accountability in some way " mr mehri says once texaco and coca cola put in place measures tying diversity to executive pay he says they "made major jumps in representation of minorities in meaningful powerful positions " in the wake of its settlement coca cola designed a system under which managers compensation reflects their effectiveness in areas including diversity performance management and employee development the program was tested with a small group of managers in and implemented for all managers in steve bucherati director of diversity and workplace fairness for coca cola says tying compensation to diversity efforts "has been instrumental in helping us move our diversity goals forward " and a report last year by a seven member outside task force led by former u s labor secretary alexis herman showed that progress has been made the task force reported that of coca cola executives those at the assistant vice president level and above were women at the end of september up from at the end of minority representation among executives grew to from in that period the percentage of women managers below the executive level edged up to from while minority managers grew to from but mr dobbin says harvards survey showed on average only a small increase in the number of african americans and women in management positions at companies that linked bonuses and compensation and critics point to a number of flaws that might account for the ineffectiveness of some programs some companies that say they link compensation to managers diversity efforts fail to give the measures any teeth diversity experts say "is anybodys bonus really seriously affected by their diversity performance " asks frederick lynch professor of government and public policy at claremont mckenna college in claremont calif "its going to be really hard to pin that down " the key is putting clear measurable goals in place mr mehri says policies tying compensation to diversity goals that arent clearly defined are "faux provisions " he says citing johnson &amp johnsons policy as an example the compensation of johnson &amp johnsons chief executive is based on the compensation and benefits committees assessment of the companys financial and nonfinancial performance according to the companys proxy statement among the nonfinancial factors reviewed is talent management which includes "developing a diverse superior talent pool " but "no specific fixed weighting or formula is applied to these factors in determining performance " the proxy says says mr mehri "if you list things and one of them is diversity that doesnt get you anywhere its too amorphous " johnson &amp johnson says all of its management bonuses are affected by talent management including diversity "were always evolving the metrics and how we apply these factors in compensation decisions but diversity has been and remains an important element " says spokesman bill price marian h carrington is a principal at chicago based carrington &amp carrington ltd which specializes in the recruitment and placement of african american hispanic and other diverse professionals she says she has seen cases where linking compensation to diversity has made a great impact but in some cases "the executives are paid so well that missing a goal such as diversity doesnt matter to them so its not taken as seriously " she says frans johansson a new york based consultant who writes and lectures on the benefits of combining people from different fields and different cultures says that tying "somewhere between to " of managers bonuses to compensation seems to have a real impact on their behavior at general mills inc which has tied its senior executives compensation to diversity achievement for more than years how well senior executives perform on diversity goals accounts for about to of their personal incentive rating the personal incentive rating accounts for half of their annual bonus general mills says the percentage of its officers who are minorities has doubled in the past years and the percentage who are women has more than doubled another flaw that ms carrington sees in some cases is that diversity goals are centered on how many conferences an executive attends or whether he or she goes to diversity training "so some executives can score very highly without actually hiring anyone " companies that are serious about making a difference "have not only tied executive compensation to diversity but theyve made sure that the numbers are there and made sure that its monitored very very closely " she says other experts on diversity criticize policies that focus solely on getting diverse candidates in the door and dont also aim to ensure that minorities and women have as much chance as anyone to advance within the company that could result in a high attrition rate says joseph gibbons a senior consultant at the futurework institute a new york based diversity consulting group at the merrill lynch global private client group about of a branch managers annual bonus is tied not only to finding and hiring diverse job candidates but also to the retention development and success of those financial advisers says dan sontag head of the global private client americas client relationship group the incentive for finding diverse candidates has been in place for three years and the rest of the program for two years he says one way progress is measured mr sontag says is by the revenue produced by different groups of advisers for example if revenue from women and minority advisers grew in a given period and revenue from other advisers grew "that says you were making improvements " he says "in order to do that you have to provide effective training and development programs to make sure that they grow in the role for the organization " the divisions percentage of women and minority financial advisers has increased in each of the past three years mr sontag says though he declines to provide specific figures in addition from to the revenue improvement for women and minority advisers was twice that for the other advisers he says ms maxey is a special writer
