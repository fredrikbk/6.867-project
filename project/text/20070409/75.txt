whos monitoring chinese food exports hong kong tainted foods from china are becoming a growing problem as the country plays a greater part in the global food chain chemical use is high regulations are lax and while the u s food and drug administration has the authority to check imports for contaminants that are in violation of u s law it is able to physically inspect only a small fraction of them late last month the fda said it had traced the culprit in the deaths of more than a dozen cats and dogs in the u s to contaminated wheat gluten produced thousands of miles away in jiangsu province china the wheat gluten ended up in pet foods sold in stores across america run by kroger co safeway inc wal mart stores inc and others it is far from clear how many pets have been affected but the number could rise the fda says it has received more than complaints the chinese wheat gluten was contaminated by an industrial chemical called melamine which is used to make plastics glue and fire retardants but is also used as a fertilizer in asia according to the fda it may have led to kidney failure in the animals although the fda says it isnt yet certain how exactly the pets died the chinese company xuzhou anying biologic technology development co has denied shipping wheat gluten to the u s contaminated foods from china have shown up overseas before in frozen spinach shipped to japan was found to have high levels of the pesticide chlorpyrifos late last year hong kong health officials halted imports of turbot from mainland china that contained a banned substance called malachite green an antifungal agent that may cause cancer over the years foreign governments have also found and rejected chinese exports of honey containing the antibiotic chloramphenicol crushed peppers with pesticides and seafood contaminated with veterinary drugs to name only a few examples according to helen jensen professor of economics who works on food safety issues and international trade at iowa state university the pet food case she says shows how as the food system has become global in sourcing "were vulnerable to what goes on throughout the world " chinas contamination problems stem in large part from its loose regulations and highly fragmented food production hundreds of millions of small farmers grow its food and they rely heavily on chemicals to coax production out of intensively cultivated soils and to fight pests the result "china has one of the worlds highest rates of chemical fertilizer use per hectare and chinese farmers use many highly toxic pesticides including some that are banned in the united states " according to a report published last november by the economic research service of the u s department of agriculture more than a dozen government agencies are responsible for ensuring the safety of chinas food supply and coordination and communication among them is a often a problem notes henk bekedam the world health organizations chief representative in china "despite many efforts food regulations and standards have been developed in an ad hoc way without the benefit of a basic food law " he adds the fda has the power to stop shipments at the border and collect samples and test for certain contaminants that may be in violation of u s regulations last month it refused shipments from mainland china for various reasons a shipment of dried red dates from chongqing was considered filthy frozen swordfish from shandong contained a poisonous substance and ginseng from changsha had unsafe pesticides but the food shipments that get tested are the exception not the rule "the volume of food imports from overseas is approaching million per year and the number that fda inspectors physically examine is in the single digit thousands making it virtually certain that any given food shipment will enter the united states with no fda inspection " william hubbard a retired associate commissioner of the fda said in senate testimony in july "i could provide many more similar statistics all of which paint a picture of an fda regulatory structure that is under resourced understaffed and essentially incapable of meeting" many of its responsibilities on ensuring food safety in many cases the burden of ensuring that food shipped out of china is safe falls on the foreign buyers who negotiate with chinese producers over what quality standards the food must meet a spate of poisoning cases in china has forced the government to publicly address the problem at home even though it is unclear how much progress has been made towards improving safety one of the most high profile incidents occurred in when more than a dozen infants died after their mothers unknowingly fed them fake milk powder that had little or no nutritional value chinese television stations broadcast images of sick and dead babies that were fed the counterfeit formula last november chinese authorities found that poultry farmers in hebei province were adding sudan b a cancer causing red dye used in industrial manufacturing to the feed of their ducks the dye caused the ducks to lay eggs with a reddish yolks instead of yellow ones fetching a higher price "food safety is a problem for china " says mao qunan spokesman for chinas ministry of health in beijing however he adds that "so many times the media says the problem is so big so huge but i dont agree with these comments on the safety of the food " in the ministry of health reported that people were stricken by food poisoning according to the state run xinhua news agency of the deaths that year around half were caused by poisonous chemicals in the food the rest were from bacterial contamination and other causes but those numbers may understate the problem because it is often difficult to pinpoint the cause of such illnesses in rural china at least million people are estimated to be affected by food borne disease in china each year according to mr bekedam of the who the who estimates that food borne disease costs china between &# billion and &# billion a year in medical care expenses and loss of productivity meanwhile chinas food problems are becoming the worlds problems as agriculture exports surge as of last year china accounted for about of global trade in fruits and vegetables challenging u s producers in three main areas including apple juice fresh apples and fresh vegetables according to a usda report published last year the u s is chinas largest market for exports of apple juice chinas agricultural exports to the u s have soared over the past three decades rising to &# billion in from &# million in according to the usda the current problems with pet foods began in mid march ontario based menu foods inc which produces major brands like eukanuba and iams recalled its "cuts and gravy" style pet food in cans and pouches after receiving information that pets that ate the product had fallen ill the recall was later extended to more products within nearly a week of the recall the company received complaints or expressions of concern from about consumers the fda suggested that chemnutra inc a las vegas based supplier of wheat gluten to menu foods had received contaminated gluten from xuzhou anying biologic technology development co in jiangsu the u s government halted shipments of wheat gluten to chemnutra and is now requiring that all shipments of wheat gluten from china be scrutinized china is carrying out a nationwide inspection on the quality of its wheat gluten a report from state run xinhua news agency said friday a manager of xuzhou anying surnamed mao told reuters last week that his company never sold any wheat gluten to the u s "i dont understand how come they are blaming us " he said but when representatives from chemnutra met with mr mao on march in china to discuss the alleged contamination he "was apologetic and embarrassed and promised to do an investigation " said a person familiar with the matter this person said that the wheat gluten was shipped through an intermediary before arriving in the u s reached at the company on friday a manager who gave his name as mao lijun who may or may not have been the same mr mao said that he was busy and hung up his phone when asked about the allegations wheat gluten a mixture to two proteins is used as a thickening agent in pet food gravy and is in many products for humans from cereals to pasta exports from china have been brisk with demand exceeding supply this year according to li wenxin sales manager at qingdao wansheng chemical co a trading company in shandong province that exports wheat gluten to several countries including australia india italy and russia the fda says there is no evidence that any of the wheat gluten imported from xuzhou anying biologic has entered the human food supply marc ullman a lawyer for chemnutra said that at this point it is still not completely clear how the wheat gluten became contaminated the wheat gluten that was imported from china wasnt tested for melamine and testing for the chemical isnt routinely done in the industry he said "theres no way to test every container of food for every potential toxin coming into the united states " tang hanting contributed to this article
