small business link topic of the month employee benefits one size plan doesnt always fit all stallar solutions gives employees a benefits account and the freedom to choose how to spend it designing a package that attracts employees without breaking the bank stellar solutions inc s compensation program isnt rocket science but even the firms aerospace engineers need help figuring it out most job candidates at the palo alto calif company have never seen a compensation and benefits package resembling stellars a flexible arrangement designed to maximize tax free savings while most companies offer their employees a one size fits all menu of benefits stellar puts aside money in an account for employees and lets them pick and choose how they want to spend it "its a pile of money to do with what you will " says celeste volz ford founder chairwoman and chief executive of the aerospace engineering firm which has full time employees and posted &# million in revenue in stellar works on projects ranging from earthquake predictors to shuttle launches it spun off quakefinder llc an earthquake forecasting research firm in stellars experience shows how small employers can create a package that makes the most of employee choices and minimizes administrative headaches if they are willing to apply some creativity and time upfront it also shows the challenge small business owners face when their ideas about benefits dont fit the cookie cutter offerings most providers push the plan was a hard sell to most providers ms ford spoke to and it isnt always an easy sell to job candidates spend as you please human resources experts see advantages in using plans that allow employees to customize benefits they may "keep your work force engaged and satisfied" because workers like the freedom to choose how to spend the money says allen steinberg a principal at hewitt associates a human resources services and consulting firm in lincolnshire ill stellars plan stemmed from ms fords own frustration with the benefits offered at her past employers for example the yearly cap on pretax medical spending accounts were never enough while she had no use for most of the other programs offered the year old business owner says her firms unusually flexible arrangement is a potential selling point when trying to attract employees in a market with limited qualified applicants once prospective hires understand the ins and outs of the benefits package "it could mean the difference between someone saying yes " she says heres how the package works for every dollar of an employees pay an additional cents go into a pretax profit sharing investment account designated for retirement stellar then puts another cents into a separate benefits account which is immediately accessible for any employee personal expense from medical co pays and over the counter purchases like contact lens solution to vacation and sick time and child care expenses employees submit receipts for the expenses through an automated computer system and they are reimbursed in their next paycheck some of the reimbursements are designated as taxable income the benefits account is designed in part to take advantage of irs rules that allow certain items out of pocket medical dental and vision care expenses not covered by insurance as well as day care and elder care expenses to be paid using pretax dollars irs rules generally dont have a cap for pretax medical expenditures says irs spokesman bruce friedland though there are exceptions for companies with shareholders or certain highly compensated employees pretax dependent care expenses are generally limited to &# per year stellar pays of the premiums on medical and dental insurance for employees and pays for both short and long term disability if employees want coverage for family members they can pay for it tax free out of the benefits account and theres an additional and unusual feature employees dont have a set number of vacation or sick days instead they "pay" for any time off using funds from the benefits account so how much time off employees get depends on how much money they have in the fund and how much of that money they want to spend the rate for a day off is based on a workers daily pay and is subject to income taxes so someone who earns say &# a year would get &# in the benefits account the employee could then buy a day off for about &# and six weeks vacation would cost &# ms ford doesnt impose a limit on time off but she estimates that most employees take about six weeks off a year and says no employee has abused the policy she says one employee worked without a day off for months then took a six week trip to africa any money left over in the account at the end of the year is paid out as regular salary and taxed as such cherry picking a plan stellars benefits plan does cost the company slightly more upfront than a typical traditional plan because of all the money that is set aside for each employee but ms ford says its a more efficient plan because she isnt wasting money on programs that most employees arent using hewitts mr steinberg says if an employer is looking to set up a similar arrangement a plan like this can be adjusted to fit a budget "if youre just giving people a certain amount to play with youve got a lot of flexibility " he says ms ford who founded the firm in says she set up her plan after talking to other business owners and cherry picking ideas while most employees liked the idea of flexible vacation and more pretax savings ms ford says she experienced some resistance from lawyers and insurance and benefits people who had never seen this kind of arrangement and werent sure how to put it together mr steinberg says flexible benefits accounts generally are separated into two buckets one thats used for pretax eligible expenses and one for vacation and days off rather than stellars discretionary account for both pretax and post tax expenses the key to venturing outside traditional benefits arrangements he says is finding "lawyers or other service providers who understand what youre trying to achieve " business owners who dont know the ins and outs of tax law could end up hearing from the irs down the road if an unusual plan isnt set up correctly he adds kris henley stellars vice president of intelligence programs says he welcomes the ability to set aside as much money tax free as possible mr henley a u s air force veteran had been accustomed to a portion of his income coming from nontaxable military allowances facing a civilian job he says "all of a sudden the tax percentages became significant " mr henley adds that he also likes the idea of paying for vacations and making more money if he doesnt take one lower pay all the flexibility may not be enough for some people however ms ford says while most potential employees view the arrangement as a selling point a few do take issue with one trade off a lower base salary mr steinberg says its difficult to compare the cost of stellars plan to traditional setups without knowing the specifics on the pretax benefits employees use and other details ms ford estimates that the total cost for salary and benefits is probably about the same as more common arrangements but stellars base salary offers are about lower than those of other aerospace engineering firms that lower rate makes up for the money that is being put aside for the plans "people who have difficulty with this compensation system tend to be the younger folks who are dependent on cash flow " says mr henley that problem is compounded by silicon valleys pricey housing market "weve had folks who didnt accept our offer because we couldnt match the cash flow of their current employer " he says
