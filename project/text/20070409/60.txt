the daily fix zach johnson holds off woods to don green jacket at augusta online edition and the latest man to slip on the fabled green jacket at augusta is zach johnson yep zach johnson the year old iowan locked up his masters win with a foot chip and tap in for par on the th hole shaking off a bogey on retief goosen rory sabbatini and tiger woods all finished two strokes back mr johnsons hole total a over par matches the highest total in augusta national championship history but that says more about the brutal wind and fast greens the field faced this weekend than it does about any flaw in mr johnsons game "year after year we watch as the merely talented underdogs crumble in the last mile doing whatever is required to give place to those with world class gifts " thomas boswell writes in the washington post "but occasionally just often enough to give the rest of us some perverse yet inspirational hope a true plodder a man without any pretense to great gifts in his field will upend the most universally acknowledged genius of the age thats how we end up with jack fleck beating ben hogan at the u s open or charles coody leaving jack nicklaus to share runner up honors at the masters we wouldnt want such things to happen too often beyond a certain point its deeply unsettling against the order of things but every once in a while its profoundly okay " in the los angeles times thomas bonk looks at a lousy sunday for woods one marked by glum walks down fairways and a four iron snapped against a tree not in anger as the fix carelessly wrote this morning "this isnt something woods wants to spend too much time thinking about but after his even par round of he has played nine consecutive rounds at the masters without one of them in the s " mr bonk writes "the statistics show that hes a notorious front runner on the games biggest stages he has won majors but never once from behind and it happened again sunday " in the kansas city star joe posnanski puts us in mr johnsons shoes with history on the line read this and see if your pulse doesnt quicken too the moment came on the th green zach johnson had told himself all afternoon not to look at the scoreboard he thought by ignoring the scoreboard the sunday pressure might go away sort of the same theory that by not opening a bill you might not have to pay it but he could tell by the crowd that he was leading the masters he also could tell because his caddie had just told him he was beating tiger woods the putt was feet from the hole but he knew it would break hard to the left toward raes creek he also knew this would be a bad time to take stock of his life he had come to augusta for the first time in back when he playing one of those tours he had come as a fan he had walked around the place with his mouth open and his heart pounding something in that heart told him he would play here someday now he was here tiger woods had just made an eagle a few moments before and those roars had shaken the ground retief goosen had been charging all day and he had won two u s opens and then there was history all that masters history jack nicklaus and arnold palmer and gary player and tom watson not to mention jack fleck an iowan who had never really done all that well at the masters but who had taken down a giant ben hogan in the u s open the crowd watched him curiously zach johnson thought if i make this putt i could win the masters the frozen four may not have the cachet of the version played on hardwoods but to hockey aficionados its every bit as fun with rabid fans pep bands and some terrific hockey and now it has a champion michigan state which beat boston college saturday in st louis for bcs eagles this disappointment is getting a little too familiar bc was the also ran in as well theyve been to seven frozen fours in the last years finished second four times and emerged from that stretch with just a single title in the boston globe jackie macmullan begins on a dark note with bc ahead and in trouble yes really "maybe in retrospect the scoreboard was the most accurate harbinger of things to come " she writes "the eagles who potted an average of goals during their winning streak had scored none against michigan state and its diminutive goalie jeff lerg after one period and only one after minutes of play " there are no dark notes for the spartans as bryan burwell writes in the st louis post dispatch "they were a fourth place team in their own conference " he writes "they had no nhl first rounders on their roster heck they were so highly thought of in their central collegiate hockey association that no one from msu made even honorable mention all conference they had a foot asthmatic munchkin in goal who heard all his hockey life that he was too small to play in the big time little jeff lerg wasnt just small hes an asthmatic who has to suck on oxygen before games and the year old coach rick comley carries around nitroglycerin tablets in his pockets to prevent heart attacks they werent just underdogs they were the poster boys for underdogs but now they are also ncaa champs too " fifty years ago president eisenhower sent the st airborne to little rock ark where nine black teenagers trying to integrate little rock central high school faced white mobs on si com gary smith uses three photographs of little rock centrals football teams to tell a story how the segregationists inadvertently destroyed a football dynasty and how the all white players on that team were caught up in history and now live with their regrets about what they did and didnt do during those tumultuous years "this story shouldnt be told " mr smith writes "no one wants to hear it theyre all too busy celebrating another group at central high that year the nine black kids too busy planning their th anniversary building their museum across the street getting ready for the crowds and the network news reporters and the two presidents mr bush and mr clinton who will fill the schools front yard on sept to commemorate them no one wants to tell this story not even the white boys who lived it it reeks of political incorrectness its sure to be misconstrued they cant ask you to feel for them theyre southern caucasian males on the other side of for goodness sake born and bred not to feel for themselves just of the white faces on the wrong side of the saga of the little rock " mr smith does tell their story including wondering what would happen if the old men from the all white team photo could sit down with the young men from the racially mixed team photo "imagine if everyone in those two team pictures sat elbow to elbow at dinner in the school cafeteria and tried to understand what happened from both sides what might be learned " he writes "no not hollywoods or historys version not what happened to the heroes or the hatemongers not the black and white version the story of the gray the people in between the majority that ends up drifting toward one side or the other and determining history often without even knowing why the ones we need to understand most because theyre us the kids we likely wouldve been had we grown up white in the s in the south and because we too might drift when our moment comes " tip of the fix cap to reader bill ricke found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and
