tried many diets from atkins to jenny craig to weight watchers only to lose and then regain to pounds he even contemplated surgery then he looked into the university of california los angeless risk factor obesity program according to the programs own research of its patients the center sees about each year successfully achieve their weight loss goals and three years later of them keep off all or most of the weight mr galorath filled out a nine page application and began the program in april weighing pounds mr galorath was put on whats known as a "very low calorie diet program " see details he spent nearly four and a half months consuming calories a day in powder drinks and supplements before phasing in real food the first week mr galorath lost pounds which he says was mostly water weight he lost three and a half pounds per week after mr galorath started the program on a saturday and went to work the following monday but says he didnt get much done "my body was crying out for food and the office is generally full of junk i came home from work and just went to bed " he says by the next day mr galorath felt better "my body adjusted to starvation mode " he says "so while i might have smelled food and would have liked to eat it i was not hungry and the only time i felt dizzy was when i didnt drink sufficient water " over the next few months he brought his protein shakes to work for lunch and dinner and simply explained to colleagues that he was on a special diet two weeks into the program mr galorath started doing cardio after eight weeks he was down to pounds but he still had body fat considered obese for men mr galorath started incorporating strength training in his routine after five and a half months he was down to pounds nearly a year later at feet tall mr galorath weighs pounds and his body fat percentage is around at the high end of the acceptable range for a man the workout mr galorath failed to lose weight on other diets in part because he says that he wasnt putting exercise into the equation the ucla program introduced him to the importance of physical activity and the role it played in weight loss and health the programs staff showed him both aerobic and strength exercises that would benefit him "im an exerciser for life now " he says he meets with a personal trainer for minute strength training sessions three times a week at the club at pacific corporate towers located in the same complex as his office they meet at either a m or p m depending on his schedule twice a week they work upper body muscles and once a week they focus on lower body mr galorath says they move quickly from one exercise to the next "there is no rest in between " he says "its deadly " his trainer has him do sit ups and push ups between sets rather than rest he completes three sets of each exercise aiming for eight repetitions or to the point where his muscles are exhausted for cardio mr galorath walks three to four days a week usually with his wife in the mornings at around a m when its cool outside he lives at the top of the palos verdes peninsula and various trails are close by during the week he walks for about minutes up and down about feet of elevation at a pace of four miles per hour on fridays and the weekend he aims for a longer five mile loop both he and his wife walk with nordic poles a modified ski pole designed for people to train for cross country skiing in the summer mr galorath says that he likes the poles because they give him a full body workout incorporating many larger core and upper body muscles and because some of his weight is transferred on the poles lessening the pressure on his bad knees because the poles are collapsible he can fit them in his suitcase when he travels mr galorath and his wife also sometimes bike around the hills in palos verdes on the weekends the diet mr galorath is a staunch calorie counter using a pocket pc and occasionally a portable scale to weigh restaurant portions in the past he didnt pay attention to the number of calories he was burning and consuming "i would have a breakfast burrito which everyone eats in california but wouldnt realize thats calories or id ride the lifecycle at the gym for minutes and work off calories only to go eat calories " he says "i can now eat anything i want even junk occasionally but i do have daily calorie limits " mr galorath eats between and calories a day depending on how much exercise he gets for breakfast he might have oatmeal with two scoops of soy protein isolate and a banana he tries to get grams of protein a day more than three times as much as the recommended daily allowance so he continues to build muscle this may sound excessive but people on severely restricted calorie diets need to consume more protein to help stave off hunger and build muscle mass says christine gerbstadt m d a researcher and spokesperson for the american dietetic association mr galorath keeps soy burgers in the fridge at his office for lunch and will cook two in the microwave and eat them with snap peas or baby carrots and a piece of fruit he usually has whatever his wife is cooking for dinner but if hes already had too many calories that day he sometimes just has a soy patty he indulges too "the kids always have garbage around and i cant resist a brownie " he says the cost uclas risk factor obesity program requires an initial physical exam which costs &# a parking permit for visits costs &# a visit the low calorie diet program that mr galorath was on cost &# a month which included weekly visits with a nurse biweekly blood work two doctor visits a month weekly educational classes and some nutritional products he spent about &# a week on nutritional powder and other supplements he pays &# a month for his

for walking and replaces them every four to five months at a cost of about &# his bike cost &# mr galorath says hes a computer geek and bought a personal diet program that tracks his calories and a sports training program that tracks his sets and reps for strength training for his pocket pc each cost about &# "i really wanted to measure performance so i found a polar heart rate monitor that approximates calories " he says "it was top of the line and cost about &# but my wifes is pretty basic and cost &# " mr galorath also purchased a tiny scale online for &# so he could weigh food when he is at restaurants the effort significantly restricting his calorie intake took both motivation and discipline "the first three days were horrible " he admits "i was starving had headaches it was awful i would smell food and want to eat it but my wife and kids were very supportive " he says his diet is often challenged on the road on a recent trip to brussels he thought he was making a healthy choice by ordering fish but it came covered in hollandaise sauce that he wiped off he sometimes brings a protein drink on the road just in case he has no other healthy option mr galorath says attending educational classes that explained basic behaviors and principles of weight loss were a major factor in his being able to keep his weight down "im not a dumb guy but i just never understood the consequences of eating and exercise " he says "but when you turn it into numbers and put it in a formula you realize you are in control of your weight " the benefit "i have seen amazing differences in the way i live " says mr galorath he had been taking lipitor for his cholesterol which was about ml dl but he stopped taking it when he started exercising and now his cholesterol is down to he says buying clothes a once humiliating task is now fun he used to hate driving in his wifes toyota prius because he was too big for its seats and the coach seats on airplanes are no longer uncomfortable mr galorath says the time he spends exercising with his wife has also been good for their marriage "we have never had an hour and minutes to talk until we started walking together " he says "with five kids you dont get that much alone time " he also has more energy to keep up with his kids "anything my kids can do i can do now " he says write to jen murphy at workout wsj com
