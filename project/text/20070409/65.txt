journal that barclays wants greater reassurance that a justice department probe of abn money transfers can be resolved before barclays goes ahead in the coming two weeks with an estimated &# billion purchase while it isnt clear which operations the government is investigating though abn was fined in for violating money laundering laws and sanctions against iran and libya "barclays doesnt want to inherit the risk of a criminal probe " the journal reports abn which said after the fines that it would improve its internal controls is working to reach a settlement with the justice department back at home the dutch authorities raised questions about the deal by saying a rival bidder would be allowed to take over abn even if that means its operations would be split up and sold "it might be that a solid bank comes in takes over and decides in the context of its own strategy to restructure " central bank president nout wellink tells the financial times "well let them come to the supervisor and we will look at it and when it looks fine there will be no problem whatsoever " those comments are likely to grab the attention of european banks already circling abn despite the exclusive nature of the talks with barclays the ft notes taking on the alternative minimum tax there has long been a broad spectrum of political critics of the alternative minimum tax the system created nearly four decades ago to target loophole using millionaires and now set to threaten millions of middle class households in the current tax year but so far president bush and congress have only resorted to a series of one year fixes to keep the amt from expanding as the new york times notes now democratic leaders in the house "in an effort to upstage republicans on the issue of tax cuts are preparing legislation that would permanently shield all but the very richest taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax " the times reports work on such a bill is still in its early stages lawmakers tell the times and they would have to find a way to pay for what amounts to a measure that would be "far bigger than democratic initiatives to provide money for childrens health care education or any other

the "surge" of u s troops in baghdad began in february but who continues to wield a mix of street and political influence through his partys participation in iraqs governing majority and his mahdi militia yesterday mr sadr accused u s forces in iraq of stoking violence even as he urged mahdi army militiamen and iraqi security forces to make peace in the southern city of diwaniyah where they

found dead across the country since the "surge" began while the overall death rates in iraq havent dropped significantly mostly due to suicide bombings there has been some success in lowering the number of death squad victims and calming parts of the capital the new york times reports "but there is little sign that the baghdad push is accomplishing its main purpose to create an island of stability in which sunni arabs shiite arabs and kurds can try to figure out how to run the country together " the times says "there has been no visible move toward compromise on the main dividing issues like regional autonomy and more power sharing between shiites and sunnis " and though american commanders say it will be months before they can judge the campaign to secure baghdad political
