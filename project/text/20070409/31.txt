global boom fridays solid report of the march labor environment showed more americans working more hours at higher wages than ever before unemployment fell to instead of rising as many expected the average hourly wage rose to &# the strong jobs report along with the january february surge in spending personal income and core inflation points to sturdy growth and an inflation problem not the recession and interest rate cuts many predicted in early march the good news on u s jobs highlights a welcome global phenomenon unemployment rates have fallen to lows in europe japan china india brazil and many other areas while the u s itself is less openly exuberant than in the s most of the world is much better off economically the sea change in global conditions toward fuller employment has profound implications this is an opportunity to build on success rather than dwell on u s recession odds developing countries could double their housing stock by adopting stable currencies and market based banking systems the building blocks for tapping into global liquidity and mortgage finance mexico vital to u s immigration concerns and behind in global job creation has the opportunity to take an economic leap forward using todays plentiful liquidity to expand housing raise living standards and transform energy exploration and development brazil india israel south africa and others could use part of their international reserves to reform their anti growth tax systems a step blocked until now by the fear that tax revenues from the existing system would decline before tax receipts from the new system replaced it whats driving the improvement in the global economic and labor environment in the s the strong and strengthening dollar created a shortage of global capital and a crippling global deflation as the u s drew liquidity inward u s big businesses especially their stock prices did well as global investors chased after "king" dollar but most of the rest of the world sank europe was stagnant while asia suffered an extended deflation crisis but the post switch in u s monetary policy injected liquidity into the global economy lowered real interest rates and brought the value of the dollar down stopping deflation the tax cuts accelerated the expansion adding profits jobs and asset price gains these two key growth steps reflation and the reduction in the marginal tax rates on labor and capital are largely ignored in economic headlines dominated by concerns about global imbalances and looming recessions meanwhile the global economy is adding more to jobs output literacy and government tax receipts than ever in its history the u s continues to be the biggest contributor to global growth we grew as fast in as in over real growth on a &# trillion base with small businesses making up for the slowdown in u s homebuilding and auto production the "weak" u s fourth quarter showed real growth with the just ended january march quarter nearly as fast using fridays data man hours worked in the first quarter grew at an annual rate with productivity growth though diminished expected to add another or so big business spending on equipment and software has been sluggish but the impact on gdp may not be as large as expected several factors still contribute to a deep underestimate of the u s economy and shade the global outlook monetary policy should be measured by the level of interest rates not the number of fed increases from housing is a small part of job and economic growth about rather than triggering a recession the sector is merely returning to normal after the construction boom the trade deficit also not a recession trigger is matched by a capital account surplus providing an extra source of inexpensive funding for u s growth and investment consumption growth has consistently beaten expectations driven by growth in jobs and hourly wages u s household savings are high not the negative rate calculated by arbitrarily excluding capital gains the growth impact of the tax cut is having its biggest effect years after enactment as the lower cost of capital works its way through small businesses and innovations and while the u s urgently needs federal spending and tax reforms the u s fiscal condition has improved substantially in recent years due to economic growth and is far superior to most countries even after factoring in national security needs growing medicare commitments and the unfunded social security system one of the biggest underestimates of the u s economy has been the labor situation highlighted in fridays data dating to december the expansion has created million net new jobs per the survey of businesses million per the survey of households which picks up self employment small and new businesses and part of the off the books labor force the strong labor report should caution those counting on moderations in u s growth and inflation to allow u s interest rate cuts in addition to a weak dollar the related increase in inflation and high levels of global liquidity monetary policy is facing a lower than expected unemployment rate even as labor force growth is set to slow further due to demographics while low unemployment doesnt cause inflation it often increases productivity and output holding prices down the fed will probably factor the new jobs report into its thinking on the economys growth relative to its potential still a factor in its interest rate decisions the theory is that growth is above potential and possibly inflationary if it is pushing the unemployment rate down the declining unemployment rate is great news for living standards but is a stiff challenge to the markets fixation on slowdown theories and a softening of the feds monetary policy mr malpass is
