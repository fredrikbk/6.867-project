close contact to woo afghan locals u s troops settle in tactic wins friends isolates insurgents but boosts casualties waygal afghanistan one sunny morning last month a group of bearded men stood beside the gurgling waygal river and stared as a helicopter loaded with heavily armed americans dropped out of the sky and into their cornfield the moment the rear ramp opened the soldiers ran for cover behind stone terraces and leafless trees they had reason to be wary these mountains are notorious for sheltering taliban and al qaeda fighters and the soldiers were the first americans to set foot in waygal since the afghan war began in but instead of a hail of bullets the soldiers got an invitation to dinner when first lt eric malmstrom a fresh faced university of pennsylvania graduate approached the hirsute reception committee village leader ghulam sakhis most pressing question was "why didnt you come sooner " a year ago u s commanders here would have been reluctant to insert a small force of infantrymen into a remote village but along the pech river and tributaries such as the waygal one man u s army battalion is trying a risky grueling way to isolate the insurgents and win the support of the villagers instead of operating out of safe rear bases and commuting to the war for the past year the soldiers of the first battalion nd infantry regiment have lived on the battlefield in a series of small rudimentary encampments situated among the disputed villages themselves its an intimate style of warfare and for the americans a brutal one they go weeks without showers or decent food they live every day exposed to enemy fire and it has cost them dearly over the past year has lost men almost half of the deaths in the entire man brigade the americans and their afghan national army allies live among the people on the valley floor while the insurgents taliban al qaeda and other fighters of various stripes are up in the steep rocky ridges when the insurgents attack they fire down on american soldiers and afghan civilians alike "the semiotics of it are great " says lt col chris cavoli commander of a unit of the th mountain division "you cant buy press like that the way the fight is constructed is to deliver one message were here to protect you and the bad guys are here to ruin your lives " the battalions progress comes amid warnings that elsewhere in afghanistan the taliban are resurgent and public faith is sagging in the government of president hamid karzai the united nations secretary general reported last month that the insurgents are "emboldened by their strategic successes rather than disheartened by tactical failures " a february study by the center for strategic and international studies a washington think tank said the situation in afghanistan is "both more perilous and more complex" than at any other time since the u s led coalition toppled the taliban regime after sept critics say the setbacks have come in part because the u s distracted by the war in iraq has too little manpower in afghanistan to engage in community policing here however the results are striking a year ago the pech valley the main artery through the area was a gantlet of roadside bombings and rocket propelled grenade fire lately there have been just two or three roadside bombs a month and the locals frequently report them to afghan or u s troops before they explode a year ago it took five hours to drive the miles from asadabad the nearest big town to nangalam site of the nearest sizable u s military base the road was little more than a goat trail now a u s funded &# million project is turning it into a two lane paved road connecting the pech valley to in effect the rest of the world col cavoli a year old princeton graduate who spent much of his youth in italy argues that the key to defeating the insurgents is having a "persistent presence" among the people not just "persistent raiding " placing american and afghan troops around villages creates a security bubble he says that allows the u s to pour money into economic development projects "the basic idea is to kill the enemy to convince the people that you can and will protect them " says the colonel a compact man with receding hair and an easy grin "then in the breathing space created youve got to do something to connect the people to the government " the road is central to col cavolis strategy it demonstrates the goodwill of the american and afghan governments by giving the residents a commercial link they desperately need already a hotel is under construction in nangalam and gas stations are appearing along the river once the hard surface is in place it will be more difficult for insurgents to plant roadside bombs the construction provides jobs to hundreds of local men who might otherwise be tempted to join the insurgency and the road lures the insurgents out of the mountains in a way that army officers argue will inevitably alienate them further from the population the road is popular with the locals attacking it is not the americans now plan more roads including a &# million stretch to waygal the village where lt malmstrom and his men landed recently in december the army and marine corps issued a new counterinsurgency doctrine that closely hews to col cavolis approach arguing that killing the enemy is less important than building ties to the local populace and to do that american troops may have to take on more risk themselves "if military forces remain in their compounds they lose touch with the people appear to be running scared and cede the initiative to the insurgents " the new manual says col cavoli is "on the cutting edge of a new approach to counterinsurgency " says col john nicholson commander of the rd brigade combat team col nicholsons brigade which includes has tripled the number of outposts it inherited from the units it replaced last year but did so in the most hostile part of the brigades turf "there is no better case study of modern counterinsurgency than the recent performance" of col cavolis men col nicholson says over the past couple of months the army has tried to put the tactic to work in iraq as part of its desperate effort to quell insurgency and sectarian violence in baghdad u s commanders there are setting up neighborhood security stations manned by americans and iraqis but it is still too early to see the results applying the technique in iraq is complicated because much of the mayhem is between one iraqi faction and another u s troops are caught in the middle supporting an iraqi government that many sunni muslims suspect is the tool of their shiite muslim rivals even replicating the battalions progress elsewhere in afghanistan would be difficult col cavolis men have spent a year fighting for public acceptance along just a few dozen miles of river valleys the militarys counterinsurgency doctrine specifies that at a minimum one soldier is required for every residents although the insurgency is concentrated in the east and south applying the formula to the entire country would require more than troops a force a dozen times the size of the international coalition now in afghanistan nonetheless the pentagon has taken notice of s gains and col cavolis next posting will be to teach counterinsurgency techniques to officers from other nato nations which make up about half of the coalition in afghanistan for the tactic developed almost by accident the battalion arrived in afghanistan in early and it soon became apparent to col cavoli that the pech valley would have to be the focus of his efforts the marines they replaced had fought out of two large bases in asadabad where the pech empties into another river and upstream near nangalam when the marines attacked the insurgents would fade away only to return to the valley as soon as the americans went back to their bases according to col cavoli last april he ordered one of his company commanders to fight his way west and set up temporary outposts on the pech between asadabad and nangalam at patrol base california one of several along the river soldiers lived in the open rain snow or sun and slept next to their humvees using large dirt filled barriers to shield them from insurgent attacks they did without showers and ate packaged meals it was supposed to be a short term fix days stretched into weeks and weeks into months however as col cavoli realized that his best hope of separating the insurgents from the locals was to keep his men in place these days they have cots and have built themselves cramped sandbag bunkers with plywood roofs but when it rains their hooches run deep with mud or water and the small weight lifting pit turns into a cafe au lait pool the men still clean themselves with baby wipes and use half of a gallon drum as a toilet every couple of days they get trays of hot food trucked in but they frequently fend for themselves grilling pizzas toasting biscuits or deep frying chicken patties over an open fire unlike at the major bases there is no internet or phone service no refuge from the war "i live like an animal here " says spc marcus whited a year old from wichita kan manning a machine gun atop a humvee at the camp entrance "ive never in my life smelled odors like this " when the soldiers got word in january that their yearlong combat tour would be extended by four months the colonel gave orders that each platoon rotate to asadabad every two weeks for showers and a couple of days of rest "its a hell of a thing to ask men to live like that day after day after day " col cavoli says but its no accident the colonel doesnt want his men living visibly better than their afghan neighbors the men at patrol base california have been in some firefights usually insurgents move out of the mountains to stony redoubts on the ridges overlooking the u s positions then open fire with machine guns rifles and rocket propelled grenades the americans and the afghan soldiers who share their encampments return fire with machine guns automatic grenade launchers mortars and missiles howitzers located in big bases miles away rain shells down on the mountaintops until the insurgents die or withdraw the proximity of the soldiers to the local residents has indeed led to the intimacy that col cavoli seeks first lt michael harrison a platoon leader in the battalions dog company studied law and nuclear engineering at west point where he was a minor troublemaker doing punishment marches for such offenses as keeping a rice cooker in his room but along the pech river the year old has a fan club of neighborhood urchins a counterweight to insurgent propaganda that the military says claims the americans are here to convert muslims to christianity and eat their children when the lieutenant approaches patrol base california he lowers the bullet proof window on his humvee reaches out and slaps high fives with the children "michael " they shout as he passes mimicking his two finger peace sign "whassup hussein haircut " lt harrison says to a close shaved orphan boy in a dirty white jersey and loose trousers he gives a set of baby bottles to a boy whose sister died after giving birth when he isnt patrolling the lieutenant spends much of his time sounding out the locals listening to their troubles and trying to arrange solutions one recent day he sat on a bit of carpet sipping sweet yellow tea with a group of police auxiliary officers outside their sandbagged station ras mohamed a year old police chief pointed across the pech to a small brown brick house halfway up the valley wall "last year the enemy was coming all the way down there and shooting at jingle trucks " he said referring to the decorated freight trucks seen everywhere in afghanistan "now they dont dare " another day lt harrison chatted up village elders in a small police bunker along the river the afghans talked about how they used to set up roadblocks along the valley and ambush russian tanks with rocket propelled grenades during the year war with the soviet union "we never talked to them we just shot at them " said mohammad shareen a year old elder wearing a black watch cap with a nike swoosh the soldiers intentionally reinforce the authority of elders who traditionally have the power to expel or ostracize miscreants and can serve as a bulwark against younger hotter heads the u s required the afghan road contractor to hire at least workers from the pech valley itself but left it to the elders to decide who got what positions lt harrison "never does anything without asking the elders first " said mir azfal a year old police auxiliary officer the americans have provided other benefits as well installing small hydropower generators along the pech river handing out school supplies for children and setting up makeshift clinics for the ill "the enemy is more isolated from the people than last year " says year old lt col m farid ahmadi who commands the man afghan national army battalion that lives and fights alongside "when we separate the evildoers from the people its easy to kill capture or destroy them its difficult to do when the enemy is among the people " some areas particularly south of the pech river have proved resistant to col cavolis approaches however elders in the village of matin initially rejected a u s offer to build a bridge connecting them with the new road a sign the soldiers thought of their ties to the insurgency recently the elders changed their minds still lt harrisons night patrols watch for insurgents leaving matin and crossing the shallows of the pech to plant explosives on the valley road farther south the army has found few winnable hearts or minds in the korangal valley an area ethnically and linguistically distinct from the northern bank of the pech the people of the korangal have longtime links to the insurgency according to the military the fighting on the mountaintops in that area has been particularly bloody over the past year "the ones who liked us before like us now " says pvt adam boguskie of spencer county ky his heavy machine gun pointing toward the snowy ridgeline south of the pech "the ones who hated us before hate us now its all about money if the taliban had money the locals would be bringing them pepsis up there " the men of are due to go home to fort drum n y in june some months after they arrived in afghanistan and col cavoli has been worried that the troops who follow will abandon the relationships his men have spent so much time establishing last month his replacement lt col bill ostlund of the rd airborne brigade paid an advance visit to afghanistan where col cavoli pitched his up close and personal approach to counterinsurgency "it would be easy for me as a commander to put people in rear bases at asadabad and jalalabad and spend a year painting rocks " col cavoli told col ostlund pointing to the pech valley on a wall map he continued "but the people were trying to help are up here "
