creston takes small guy pitch to u s british shop is looking to acquire independents wary of joining giants memo to small marketing services firms if steve blamer calls pick up the phone the madison avenue veteran most recently chief executive officer of interpublic groups foote cone &amp belding has a new gig helping ambitious young british marketing services concern creston build a u s presence to help mr blamer has a war chest of at least &# million for acquisitions formed in by british adman don elgie creston is one of a number of smaller ad holding companies a group that also includes mdc partners that have emerged in recent years alongside the half dozen global ad giants such as omnicom group wpp group and interpublic since birth creston has swallowed up marketing and ad firms in the united kingdom including delaney lund knox warren &amp partners a london shop that works for companies such as general motors exxon mobil and ebay last year creston had revenue of gbp million &# million other big clients of its firms include unilever bayer and diageo now creston wants to repeat its success this time in the u s its timing is good in the wake of the ad worlds consolidation in the s a new generation of independent firms has cropped up they have reached the point where they need capital to continue growing either to open offices in different markets or to hire talent for these firms the choice is finding venture capital funding or selling to a bigger advertising company for those considering a sale midsize companies such as mdc or creston are an increasingly attractive option many in the ad world have soured on life inside the ad holding behemoths often considered slow moving bureaucracies "the big holding companies hold out a huge financial carrot but the second that smaller creative boutiques are purchased the bean counters step in and destroy their business models " says charles rosen chief executive of amalgamated an independent ad boutique based in new york mr rosen says he is at the "crossroad right now" of deciding whether to sell crestons mr elgie has been looking to establish a u s foothold for almost two years but doing so from across the pond has proved difficult he says while sending a british executive to the u s doesnt always work in contrast "steve is high profile and understands the market " mr elgie says and who better to drive home an anti big holding company message than mr blamer he left fcb last year after interpublic merged fcb with draft its direct marketing unit and placed draft chief howard draft at the helm of the combined concern prior to his stint at fcb mr blamer headed grey worldwide north america departing in shortly after wpp group acquired the firm wpp later sued mr blamer claiming he had breached his employment agreement that suit was settled out of court "i can show them the scars of those situations " mr blamer says "as chief executive of one of the largest operations of grey it was difficult to have that role and have the holding company bear down on you and put pressure on the business that wasnt benefiting the operating unit and not benefiting the clients " crestons pitch to independents that it wants to acquire is simple we wont meddle in your business that is the same approach taken by mdc whose portfolio includes widely known firms crispin porter + bogusky and kirshenbaum bond + partners so the independents dont lose their entrepreneurial spirit mdc only takes partial stakes in firms ensuring executives retain a chunk of the equity "we think people think and act differently as owners than employees " says miles nadal ceo of mdc many big ad holding companies in contrast keep founding executives on with "earn out" deals in which the purchase price is paid out over a number of years dependent on the firm meeting performance targets creston traded on the london stock exchange does complete buyouts but mr elgie insists on using a mix of stock and cash as payment that ensures executives at newly purchased firms are shareholders in creston mr elgie says of the company is owned by employees still this approach has proved to be a hindrance in some deals creston according to a person familiar with the matter was among several bidders for new media strategies a word of mouth marketing firm recently acquired by meredith new media strategies wasnt interested in having to take part of its payment in creston stock particularly as it would have had to hold the stock four years according to this person "we will not buy private companies for all cash " mr elgie says "if they want cash i will give them wren or sorrells phone numbers " he adds referring to omnicom ceo john wren and wpp chairman martin sorrell mr elgie faces other obstacles the acquisition landscape has become more competitive in advertising and marketing thanks in part to new buyers such as private equity firms moreover even some independent firms that have soured on larger holding companies havent entirely written off selling to them "they are paying the money " adds amalgamateds mr rosen in some instances he says interest from smaller holding companies such as mdc and creston "gives us more flexibility to negotiate with the big holding companies " more competition "gives us leverage " even so crestons chief hopes to have a u s purchase within months most likely in marketing services
