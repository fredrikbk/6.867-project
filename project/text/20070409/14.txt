ceo compensation survey a special report sharing the wealth at heartland payment systems ceo robert o carrs goal is to keep his employees from taking the money and running princeton n j most chief executives would gloat about a annual spurt in new business but at heartland payment systems inc robert o carr grumbled the provider of credit card processing services had seen new business volume soar about a year between and so when the rate slowed to in "i wanted to throw up " says mr carr heartlands year old co founder chairman and ceo "we only have of the market its frustrating " hoping to revive that tempo mr carr persuaded fellow directors to cancel salaries and bonuses for the six highest sales executives the officials sole reward a chance to earn &# million apiece from commissions its the latest in his series of innovative compensation tactics partly created to retain millionaires like them many staffers became affluent because mr carr gave them part of his stake long before heartland went public in and some of those heartland millionaires took their money after the ipo and ran he expects the company will repeat last years double digit gains in net income and revenue this year by processing &# billion of transactions for more than merchants mr carr offered insights into the benefits and drawbacks of sharing wealth with workers during a chat at corporate headquarters here where a large mural depicts a skyscraper under construction the unfinished tower symbolizes heartland "because we have a long way to go " says mr carr an unassuming man who once aspired to be a math teacher here are some excerpts from that conversation the wall street journal why did you abandon academia to launch a computer consultancy after discovering libertarian philosopher ayn rand mr carr i was in a mathematics ph d program when somebody told me about "atlas shrugged " i read all of her books i had been brought up to think businesspeople took advantage of workers ayn rand showed me it was possible to craft a business where you treat everybody with respect and give them the opportunity to live up to their potential wsj why didnt you finish your doctorate mr carr i was going to get drafted i took a teaching job at parkland college a community college i stayed until i was no longer draft eligible i started a consulting firm that morphed over the years from providing services to small business people some customers wanted to take credit cards at fuel pumps and thats when my credit card software systems inc got started heartland payment systems is basically the same business credit card software systems was acquired by heartland payment systems a business created in that was owned by heartland bank and by mr carr and his credit card software partners wsj how did you devise the notion of sharing the fruits of your labor mr carr i felt that if i asked somebody to work for me who is going to help me get rich they ought to get rich too that happened at heartland in when we bought out heartland banks half of heartland payment systems we had revenue of about &# million i owned our survival was highly at risk i gave about one third of the company to top level people and hourly workers with more than two years seniority everyone was quite appreciative i figured owning less wasnt really a big sacrifice these people deserved to share in the wealth if we were able to make this into what i thought we could wsj how many stock recipients from still work here mr carr of those left the next year because of the companys financial problems today still work for heartland wsj you presently own about million shares equal to of heartlands stock outstanding whats your net worth mr carr my stake is worth north of &# million at last weeks closing price of &# a share i was a guy who struggled to pay bills years ago this wealth has given me a new job custodian of funds that i want to disseminate in my lifetime in the most useful way possible to the most people we have trusts for our six kids everything else we are going to give away we are focused on helping disadvantaged kids get a great education wsj speaking of shared wealth when heartland went public in august staffers held such a significant stake that dozens quickly became millionaires how did that happen mr carr from until we became a public company we gave stock options to employees every full time hourly and salaried employee gets options when they have been with the company for two years prior to the ipo our salespeople had a separate program called pep shares an amazing way to distribute wealth pep shares allowed all the salespeople to earn options from accumulated commissions when we went public of our employees became millionaires that includes people who got stock in or options along the way we now have employee millionaires out of people wsj how soon could staffers exercise their options and collect their &# million mr carr in january of the we lost one died seven left after cashing in their options six were terminated wsj were they no longer interested in working mr carr you got it figured out wsj because your share price has risen since the ipo how many of those remaining became multimillionaires mr carr probably half are now worth &# million or more wsj how do you motivate multimillionaires mr carr thats the &# million question you work really hard to maintain an environment where people love getting up in the morning thinking they are doing important work we think we are wsj you try to treat employees well in other ways tell me more for instance about your fresh lunch salads for call center workers in jeffersonville ind mr carr we started the heartland losers club in july because health insurance costs are going up rapidly we wanted to encourage people to stop smoking and lose excess weight we formed a fitness center then we started our free salad program and smoking cessation program we renamed it the heartland fitness club because people didnt like being called losers we lost pounds in the first six months among people we had of those people stop smoking we ended that free salad program in january people were eating salads and going to taco bell defeating the purpose people who werent getting free salad said it was not fair for others to get salads because they were fat wsj i understand you also offer your salespeople an unusual compensation program paid purely on commission they earn more than of an accounts gross margin during the first year and then collect residual commissions mr carr that program has been in place since we invented that concept in our industry we pay out the first year of profit margin to our sales organization we dont start making money on a new account until the th month we want our salespeople to not rip off merchants by forcing them to buy equipment they dont need because most of heartlands revenue comes from processing equipment commissions are tiny by comparison we pay our salespeople to sign up an account out of our money they dont have to sell or lease unnecessary equipment which is the model of our competitors they build wealth by building up a big portfolio of customers that do a lot of processing this residual income stream is what they so highly value wsj seven other heartland staffers earn more than you who are they mr carr all salespeople i wish every salesperson made more than me wsj if you didnt own a roughly stake would making less money than colleagues bother you mr carr probably my dividend income this year is going to be &# million wsj so why do you take any cash compensation mr carr i feel i should be the highest paid noncommissioned person in the company i work hard and i earn it wsj how does heartland benefit when you share wealth employ multimillionaires and get paid less than certain associates mr carr the company had the most successful ipo in the history of the financial services industry we were times oversubscribed the company continues to be the fastest growing in our industry wsj but you recently missed earnings expectations mr carr it is harder to grow from merchants than from wsj has your pay philosophy affected turnover mr carr historically we have had very low turnover among people with us for over a year but last year it was this was a result of millionaires and others with six figures of wealth who were able to take their profits and move on wsj how might you excite staffers again like you did when you handed out a third of your shares mr carr i am now focused on bringing up the lowest paid people to a better wage i like the way ben &amp jerrys used to cap executive pay at seven times the salary of the lowest paid worker wsj how much higher is your base pay than heartlands lowest paid employee mr carr my base is &# times hourly workers starting pay i think i will be successful in getting that to by the end of this year i raised the starting wage for service center hourly workers to &# last year from &# i am hoping it is going to &# by the end of this year i have given the service center an incentive to continue to improve retention of customers as our retention improves the minimum wage gets raised wsj why lower the multiple mr carr it is my sense of fair play the ceo is not more than times more important than an unskilled worker wsj how will this improve heartlands ability to attract talent mr carr starting pay in jeffersonville could be &# a year that catches everybodys attention they dont care what the ceo makes they do care what they make wsj but a lower multiple doesnt hurt someone collecting &# million in annual dividends mr carr i am not saying it is a sacrifice the company earns more if you hire people at &# an hour but you should be able to afford people a living wage if you are willing to work your butt off we are going to do the best we can to treat you as well as we possibly can afford to treat you
