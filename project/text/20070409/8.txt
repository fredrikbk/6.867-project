bush will tout border progress as he vies for republican support on immigration bill when president bush visits yuma ariz today to showcase gains in securing the mexican border he will be looking for crucial republican support for his plan to make immigration rules more workable and welcoming the white house wants at least republicans to back mr bushs immigration proposals in the senate so as to generate bipartisan momentum for the bill in the house where divisions are even wider but many republicans have demanded proof of improved border security before they consider mr bushs priorities in an issue where the president has had more in common with democrats than with members of his own party these priorities include a new guest worker program that would involve issuing tamper proof employment cards and a way to give limited legal status to about million people living and working illegally in the u s during his one day visit to yuma mr bush is expected to argue that he has lived up to his side of the bargain by beefing up security forces at the border he also plans to inspect some of the new investments being lavished on the border effort such as fences and patrol vehicles and is expected to highlight data suggesting that early progress is being seen in the governments attempts to stanch the flow of illegal immigrants across the mexican border each year his choice of yuma which lies in arizonas southwestern corner near the border with california and mexico offers another benefit it is in the home state of sen jon kyl a leader among senate conservatives on immigration issues sen kyl who is scheduled to appear with mr bush in yuma said the visit "helps to demonstrate the progress were making" on border security though he hasnt said he is certain to back the new bill while it is too early to predict the outcome of this years debate several other factors in addition to sen kyls positive comments on border security appear to be working in mr bushs favor democratic leaders are facing growing pressure from the partys large hispanic base to deliver on a bill that makes immigration rules more welcoming especially after the government launched a series of deportation raids last may that has continued this year arresting more than suspected illegal immigrants immigration is emerging as a key indicator of whether the white house and republicans can work with newly empowered democrats in congress "people expect us to get this done " said sen mel martinez a florida republican who has been working with the white house to weave together a compromise plan palatable to republicans of all stripes "for all the claims of bipartisanship at the beginning of this congress weve done darn little and nothing bipartisan " last may in response to conservatives demands for tougher security mr bush said he was sending as many as national guard troops to the southwest to crack down on illegal crossings and underscored his plans to double the strength of the border patrol mr bush visited yuma then to dramatize his seriousness today he is expected to say that those moves have helped lead to a significant drop in apprehensions which the administration says indicates that fewer people are trying to cross illegally the department of homeland security says border apprehensions are down for the five month period from october through the end of february over the same period a year earlier to from still the news on the security front isnt all good the same data show that tens of thousands of illegal aliens still are attempting border crossings others might be getting in through undetected channels some experts worry that the drop in apprehension figures could be a temporary lull as smugglers wait out the new policy the u s also is making investments in some new equipment that is largely unproven such as a series of foot tall sensor towers that use radar and cameras to spot people sneaking across the border political barriers also loom for any legislative efforts the white house effort to link arms with senate republicans is pulling its policy proposals to the right further complicating sticky negotiations in which democratic support is needed many senate republicans for example want people now in the country illegally to pay stiff fines and return first to their countries of origin to achieve legal permanent residency they want guest workers to be temporary and would prohibit them from bringing their families to the u s they also propose a merit system for issuing green cards that would favor those who are better educated or are fluent in english in a recent meeting on capitol hill democrats told administration officials that the plan would make it too hard for temporary workers to become citizens agriculture groups have concerns about the merit based green card system and immigrant rights groups particularly those representing asian americans have blasted the administrations proposals to discourage "chain" migration by immigrants families an effort last year to pass immigration reform was largely a political exercise aimed at staking out election year positions there was never a serious chance it would become law the senate passed a comprehensive bill by a vote of to with republicans supporting it the effort was a response to much tougher legislation passed by the republican controlled house that focused on security this year lawmakers say the senate must pass a bipartisan measure before house democratic leaders even bring up the issue senate majority leader harry reid of nevada has set aside two weeks in late may for debate on the bill but democrats remain wary of mr bushs recent turn to the right they worry that as they demand concessions republicans would abandon support for the legislation and try to shift blame for its failure to democrats mr kyl puts the chances that the senate will produce a bill that gets broad bipartisan support at one key for senate democrats will be how much mr bush gets involved personally in pushing the negotiations which could help bring republicans on board and ease the way to a compromise so far they say he has shown he is committed democrats also face conflicting pressures from their constituents while hispanic voters and some service oriented unions favor overhauls some old line manufacturing and trade unions oppose the proposed guest worker program some african americans also are ambivalent about the guest worker idea because it may threaten low income jobs lawmakers say "in the republican party theres been more division on substance but in the democratic party there are going to be very deep conflicting views on the politics of doing it this year " said tamar jacoby a senior fellow at the manhattan institute "a lot of democrats would say were not sure we want a deal so why would we want to make concessions to get one "
