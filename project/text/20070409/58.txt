profits may be fickle oracles this quarter wall street is about to get information on one of the stock markets biggest drivers and one investors havent focused on lately corporate profits whether and how the profit news surprises investors is likely to be the main determinant of the markets direction in the next few weeks with all the worry about home sales mortgages interest rates inflation employment and the like profits have been on the back burner as the first quarter ended and the new one began few big name companies came forward with warnings about profit disappointments to come now come the actual reports a few major firms including alcoa inc and general electric co are reporting this week and the real flood begins the following week wall street knows the news wont be very good profit growth has slowed notably at big oil companies they had been leading the profit gains but oil prices are off their highs slower profit growth wont surprise anyone and shouldnt disrupt the stock market what would surprise investors would be actual profit declines at some big influential companies or warnings that profit declines could be coming analysts and investors arent ready for that kind of news they widely believe that overall profits at the big companies in the dow jones industrial average and in the standard &amp poors stock index arent going to decline this year but in recent weeks analysts forecasts for earnings growth have fallen "the numbers are slipping away more quickly than one would expect " said albert edwards global investment strategist for dresdner kleinwort securities in london a confirmed bear on the stock outlook "the market really hasnt taken the risk into account " when the year began analysts had forecast an rise in first quarter profits for the companies in the s&amp p according to thomson financial which tracks analyst forecasts that in itself was a bit of a disappointment because profits have been rising at double digit percentage rates for quarters in a row through the last quarter of since then the outlook has worsened by the end of last week analysts had cut the projection by more than half they now project a gain the forecast for the second quarter is leaving expectations for profits in both quarters close to negative territory disappointments from a few big oil financial or technology companies could throw the profit picture into the red many investors and analysts seem unconcerned and they can provide strong reasons not to worry at the quiet suggestion of the companies they cover analysts often cut their estimates before earnings reports come out companies want to ensure they will beat the estimates often actual results come in a few percentage points ahead of reduced forecasts furthermore there have been signs the economy may be in better shape than the pessimists have feared business investment consumer confidence and new home sales have looked soft lately but pending home sales were better than expected as was fridays report on job creation thomsons own projection is that first quarter profits will show gains of or which would be about average for recent decades and more than double the predictions whatever the outcome investors remain hopeful that after slowing in the first part of this year along with economic growth profit growth will bounce back later in the year permitting stock gains to continue but there is no guarantee analysts already are warning investors to expect profit declines at companies such as ford motor co and the home builders as well as some energy companies whose profit gains have been so high they are hard to sustain second quarter profit growth could be more at risk if companies begin issuing warnings that analysts are too optimistic for the second quarter it wouldnt take much to knock the figure into negative territory stephen biggar director of u s stock research at standard &amp poors said his analysts see the third quarter as the one with the biggest risk of weakness uncertainty about the profit outlook is one of the big reasons some analysts expect stocks to be volatile with the possibility of short term swings before the year is out ned davis research venice fla has studied how stocks perform when profits are rising slowly or declining stocks can do well during those periods said tim hayes ned daviss chief investment strategist even when profits are falling there are two factors to watch mr hayes said first any profit weakness has to be well telegraphed with few surprises "it is when earnings come down and have negative surprises that the market adjusts " mr hayes said second he said "a lot has to do with interest rates and inflation " when profits are weak investors need some other source of optimism to push stocks higher investors are more likely to look past short term profit trouble if they think the medium term looks positive the thing most likely to make them optimistic about the medium term is the interest rate outlook falling rates stimulate the economy which helps explain why hopes for federal reserve rate cuts this year have been so bullish for stocks but if investors see inflation rising forcing interest rates higher they will fear weaker profits and stock declines historically stocks havent done well during periods when the pace of profit gains was high and then began to fall mr hayes said that makes him cautious about the stock outlook but there have been enough exceptions that if the economy can avoid a return either of inflation or recession stocks still can do well he said the big problem is few investors see much risk of a profit decline analysts in addition to former fed chairman alan greenspan say there is a chance of recession this year but many investors are behaving as if the chance is close to zero they are ripe for disappointment and that means stocks could hold up poorly if there are any negative surprises the stock outlook could depend less on the actual profit announcements in the next three weeks and more on the guidance companies offer about the kind of performance they expect in the months to come
