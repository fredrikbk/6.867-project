the afternoon report dont call it a cartel online edition natural gas producers are gathering in qatar for discussions they say are aimed at creating a more stable market for their fuel but if to the world that screams "cartel " they say fear not senior energy officials attending the meeting denied that the summit was called with intentions of fashioning an opec style bloc "i hate the name cartel we are not a cartel " protested qatari energy minister abdullah al attiyah "were just here to consider our interests " iran minister of petroleum seyed hamaneh also blanched at the suggestion that the loosely knit organization known as the gas exporting countries forum would try to tighten its grip on the gas market he said there was "no discussion in this meeting about a cartel the cartel is not an issue were here to exchange views on technical issues and on the markets " nevertheless the notion that the member group may consider synchronized activity of any kind has put the u s and the european union on edge the bloc controls well over two thirds of the worlds natural gas reserves and accounts for more than of production and a number of the states in the group have had relations with the west that might be described as tetchy at very best talk of a cartel started up this year when ayatollah ali khamenei proposed that iran and russia create one venezuelan president hugo chavez also was reported to be on board other bloc members include algeria indonesia and nigeria joining forces would obviously give the political and economic clout to lord over consumers russia supplies the eu with close to half of the continents gas but relations got spikier after moscow showed that it wouldnt shrink from tightening the spigots amid recent spats with ukraine and belarus but russian energy minister viktor khristenko said before the meeting that participants do not "and will not set ourselves the goal of ganging up on anybody it would be destructive and it would make no sense at all " according to reuters other countries seemed enthusiastic about the idea of using their collective strength to influence the gas market rafael ramirez venezuelas energy minister said an opec like club is a "very good idea" and "we need to defend our interests " such sentiments wont please european and u s officials europes energy minister threatened to promote other energy sources like clean coal and nuclear power if the group considers a cartel u s rep ileana ros lehtinen ranking republican on the house foreign affairs panel has opposed what she calls the "establishment of this global extortion racket " even if the group were unified on formation of a cartel creating one wouldnt be a snap the gas exporting countries forum doesnt have the central organization that opec does and it would take time to establish the kind of sophisticated research infrastructure that the oil producers possess further gas is mostly sold on long term contracts that allow buyers to lock in gas prices for up to years producers would need a more liquid spot market to influence the price of gas by fiddling with production levels politics may also get in the way joining a gas cartel with iran would constitute a major break from the west for russia for example the members states also have divergent reserves differing production levels and vastly varied domestic economies all of which makes it hard to cooperate and gas producers could see their product threatened with replacement amid a push toward cleaner energy sources the forum agreed to form a group to study how to strengthen their
