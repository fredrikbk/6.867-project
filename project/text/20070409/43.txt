mugabe and friends robert mugabe is digging in his heels and why not the old man in harare knows that his neighbors particularly south african president thabo mbeki are behind him last months "emergency" summit of the southern african development community in tanzania was supposed to change the softly softly approach toward the disaster called zimbabwe but if the zimbabwean dictator was read the riot act in private as some african diplomats were eager to leak it didnt show the next day mr mugabes ruling zanu pf nominated him to stand for president again next year mr mugabe then blithely noted that morgan tsvangirai leader of the movement for democratic change "deserved" his recent beating in police custody speaking about the summit he said that "we got full backing not even one leader criticized our actions " the failure of african leadership on zimbabwe reflects especially badly on mr mbeki and his government led by the african national congress in the kindest interpretation pretoria fears a failed state on its northern border but by what measure is zimbabwe not already a failure once stable its economy is a wreck with the worlds highest inflation rate at millions of zimbabweans are fleeing mostly to fast growing south africa where they work as domestics waiters and teachers less kindly and more accurately the south african leader has taken mr mugabes side in his war on zimbabwes democratic institutions its press and opposition and its people the thought of zanu pf losing power to a black opposition party such as mr tsvangirais mdc in league with organized labor appears to make mr mbeki especially uncomfortable seeing a former liberation movement ousted could give south africans second thoughts about the inevitability of anc rule the mbeki approach also puts south africa in an awkward diplomatic position having marshaled international outrage in its own struggle against apartheid the anc now says zimbabwes "internal affairs" are its own problem and pushes "constructive engagement " using a phrase that was detested by the anc when used to describe a less confrontational approach toward apartheid in south africa the double standard suggests the anc cares more about holding power than standing up for the human rights of africans the smidgen of good news is that african leaders are being left behind by public opinion listen to the regions lively talk radio shows or read the papers and the outrage and embarrassment about mr mugabe is striking a recent reggae hit in south africa denounces mr mugabes corruption of power the people of zimbabwe will ultimately decide mr mugabes fate and their own but they could use some help from their neighbors last months assault on mr tsvangirai his face bloodied and swollen may end up being the beginning of the end for the mugabe era in their easter message yesterday zimbabwes roman catholic bishops said mr mugabe should resign or face "open revolt " but zimbabwe could unravel painfully and violently as internal tensions escalate alternatively zimbabwes troubles wouldnt be hard to fix its a naturally rich country with by african standards solid schools a skilled workforce and good infrastructure at the head of sub saharan africas most powerful country mr mbeki can either shape the outcome next door in zimbabwe or let his own legacy not to mention the region be shaped by it
