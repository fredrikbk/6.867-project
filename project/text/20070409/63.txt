the jobs expansion u s financial markets were closed friday which was just as well for those on wall street and in washington whove been betting on a recession the bullish employment report for march would have ruined their easter weekend everyone else however can rejoice that the economy created net new jobs along with upward revisions of for january and february the unemployment rate fell to down from a year earlier and matching the lowest rate in six years since mid and the passage of the second round of the bush tax cuts the u s economy has added million new jobs to put these numbers in perspective consider that last week circuit city became the corporate villain of the moment by announcing it would lay off or cut pay scales of several thousand employees this is a hardship for those circuit city workers reflecting management mistakes and the challenges in the ferociously competitive retail industry but overall u s employment in retail rose by in march and by in the first quarter more broadly those circuit city losses are dwarfed by the net new jobs the economy is creating every week this jobs momentum is especially impressive because it is sailing into the headwinds of a housing slump that continues to subtract a percentage point or more from overall gdp growth it also stands as a rebuttal to those economists largely of the rubinomics persuasion whod been predicting that the expansion couldnt withstand a popping of the residential housing bubble gene sperling william dudley at goldman sachs now at the new york federal reserve bank and robert rubin himself have all been anticipating disaster for months or years in some cases their mistake has been to assume that the expansion has been solely a creature of federal reserve policy and the housing boom they discounted the incentives to growth provided by the u s tax cuts as well as faster growth elsewhere around the world yet despite several months of a housing recession and a subprime lending virus that has contaminated the balance sheets of many banks other parts of the economy such as retail technology and business services have continued to expand even construction jobs were up last month despite the drop in home building helped in part by better weather it now appears any negative effect of falling housing prices on consumer spending is being partially counteracted by the boost in americans wages and salaries over the past months worker pay has increased by or an extra &# of purchasing power per worker thanks to the combination of a tight labor market and productivity gains wages are no longer stuck in neutral for most middle class workers though dont expect certain politicians and journalists to admit it they have too much invested in their "war on the middle class" political agenda theres no doubt the economy has downshifted in recent quarters from the nearly pace from mid to mid the subprime lending debacle has also exposed some ugly financial excesses inspired by the feds easy money and history suggests there will be more before this tightening cycle is done theres no such thing as a free fed lunch but certain signs that typically precede a recession still arent noticeable such as rising jobless claims and falling commodity prices if anything the largest current danger is that inflation wont decline the way the federal reserve has been anticipating the dollar continues to be weak especially against gold at &# an ounce and commodities are also very strong some of the rubinomics crowd are now arguing that it is time for the fed to ease once again but such a policy is hard to square with price signals in the real economy while easing might help the housing market in the short run it could come at the cost of building up further inflationary pressure that would require more onerous fed tightening down the road the other danger is congress amid the housing slowdown and monetary policy that may yet become tighter congress could help the economy by making the bush tax cuts permanent this would reduce uncertainty and help investor and business confidence but the democratic majority is moving in the opposite direction writing a budget plan that makes tax increases far more likely saber rattling on trade and attempting to punish lenders in a way that will make housing credit even less accessible to working class borrowers for now however we can be grateful for the jobs growth this impressive expansion is providing
