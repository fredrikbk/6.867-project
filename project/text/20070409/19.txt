car makers mobilize over co curbs industry aims to shift potential economic pain as tougher rules loom auto makers are shifting into high gear to protect themselves under a federal global warming cap they see around the corner cars and light trucks generate about one fifth of u s emissions of carbon dioxide the main global warming gas which is produced when fossil fuel is burned with pressure for u s emission curbs intensifying auto makers are mobilizing to try to shift the potential economic pain onto someone else different auto makers could win or lose depending on the gritty details a fight that is likely to get particularly heated given some auto makers already are struggling under one scenario u s auto makers general motors corp ford motor co and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group could face less of a burden than their japanese rivals even though the big threes overall fleets have lower fuel economy and the entire auto industry could be affected differently than other heavy emitting sectors of the economy that fight is likely to intensify in the wake of last weeks supreme court ruling that the federal government has the legal authority to limit global warming emissions from cars and trucks auto makers long have operated under what amounts to a carbon emission limit a federal requirement that the fleet of vehicles they make each year meets a minimum average fuel economy standard over the years the industry has beaten back calls for toughening those rules now political momentum to significantly toughen the rules is increasing the industry says a major toughening of the fuel economy rules would be devastating "if we had to we would cancel a lot" of the vehicles gm is planning for the future if the government forced gm to achieve a significant increase in fuel economy in the near term robert lutz gm vice chairman for global product development said in a recent interview "meeting these accelerated and very very steep standards would consume the quasi totality of our investment in engineering resources " he said the industry is starting to throw its support behind a policy that it has decided is a lesser threat an economywide carbon constraint whose heaviest economic burden is likely to fall on other sectors notably the utility industry the likeliest model is what is known as a cap and trade rule under which the government would give companies permits to emit a certain amount of greenhouse gas each year and companies could buy and sell those permits among each other the auto industrys stance puts the industry in conflict with the bush administration which opposes an economywide global warming cap it also puts various auto companies in conflict with each other as each tries to shape any future carbon cap to protect its own lineup "were all trying to position ourselves and where it comes out nobody knows " said michael stanton president and chief executive of the association of international automobile manufacturers a trade group the industrys skittishness was on display last month when john dingell the michigan congressman who is one of detroits staunchest political protectors held a hearing to bore into how any global warming cap should be shaped the auto industrys main trade group the alliance of automobile manufacturers stressed in the hearing that "all sectors throughout the u s economy must share responsibility" for reducing emissions one cap and trade proposal viewed as politically viable would produce the biggest chunk of energy related emissions cuts from the utility sector according to a recent federal study it is cheaper to cut emissions from power plants than from cars and curbing emissions from a relatively small number of power plants is easier than curbing it from millions of cars and trucks "in the way most people conceive of an economywide cap and trade program the impacts on the auto sector would be pretty modest " says jason grumet executive director of the national commission on energy policy a washington think tank whose ideas underlie the proposal by lawmakers including sen jeff bingaman new mexico democrat yet any policy would impose some costs on the auto industry one spat is over how the federal government should structure tax breaks for vehicles that consume less fossil fuel including hybrid gasoline and electric models the government recently boosted tax breaks for them but capped the number of vehicles eligible each year the united auto workers wants to maintain that ceiling many vehicles that qualify for the credit are made by honda motor co and toyota motor corp whose workers arent represented by the uaw toyota wants the government to remove the ceiling similarly a quiet fight has erupted over an idea for how to structure a cap and trade program for auto emissions the concept was written by environmental defense a green group as currently stated it would replace the current federal fuel economy rules with a cap and trade program requiring all auto makers to reduce total carbon emissions from their new vehicle fleets by the same percentage each year that would require a far greater fuel economy improvement from honda and toyota than from detroits big three honda and toyotas fleets already get better fuel economy than the big threes so further improvements would be tougher and honda and toyotas annual sales are rising while the big threes are falling meaning that each honda and toyota vehicle would have to be that much more fuel efficient for the companies fleets to stay in compliance with the rules depending on the details each of the big three might be able to crank out vehicles that averaged worse fuel economy in than they do today according to an analysis of the concept by the union of concerned scientists an environmental group that instead wants tougher federal fuel economy standards mr stanton of the international auto association whose members include honda and toyota says his group is "adamantly opposed to anything that treats us differently than other manufacturers " the big three havent yet taken a public position on the details of any specific cap and trade plan "the auto industry recognizes its a new world and we need a new approach " says gloria bergquist a spokeswoman for the alliance of automobile manufacturers whose members include the big three as well as toyota the environmental defense concept is intended as only an attempt "to think outside of the box " says john decicco senior fellow for automotive strategies for the group he adds "you dont have a viable policy unless you have an equitable policy " joseph b white contributed to this article
