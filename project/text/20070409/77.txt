why flush financiers court unloved businesses relatively cheap entries potential for rich exits draw bargain hunters to the turnaround game veteran financiers flush with cash are turning their sights on industries shunned by the stock market tapping into tax benefits newfangled loans and an ability to borrow far more money than public shareholders would tolerate proposals from buyout specialists in recent weeks kirk kerkorians offer for chrysler group property magnate sam zell buying newspaper publisher tribune co and carl icahns bids for florida home builder wci communities inc and auto supplier lear corp are striking because they are bets on companies or industries that appear to have lost the confidence of public shareholders financial experts say more such deals may be on the horizon especially for retailers and companies suffering from housing market weakness these deals offer a chance for successful restructuring of companies and industries struggling to meet the challenges of globalization modern technology or economic cycles as private enterprises they can undertake union talks and financial restructuring outside the glare of public scrutiny and without worrying about the impact on small shareholders in a letter to daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche last week mr kerkorians longtime adviser jerome b york said private owners would "take a very long term approach to solving chryslers problems " he added that results wouldnt come quickly and going private would eliminate the need to report earnings numbers for the "initial five six or seven year period it will likely take to build chrysler into a robust and lasting" company "private capital will ultimately be appreciated for having imposed discipline on these ailing u s industries while there was still time to rescue them " says daniel arbess founder of new york investment firm xerion partners lp which invests in troubled industries including the detroit auto sector of course these transactions could be most vulnerable if the economy slips into a recession or if interest rates rise raising payments that need to be made on debt in the auto industry the success of these financiers will depend heavily on whether they can persuade unions primarily the united auto workers to accept cuts in retiree benefits and other concessions to help the companies compete with lower cost asian rivals proposals to buy auto companies or newspaper publishers are different from other big leveraged buyout proposals that have garnered headlines such as the recent deals to take credit card processor first data corp and utility txu inc private those companies are fairly healthy and have growth prospects companies in struggling industries especially those in a secular decline cant easily raise capital by issuing more of their unwanted shares or use their depressed stock as currency to make strategic acquisitions retain staff or improve their businesses as a result their earnings growth slows their stocks fall further and they lose even more confidence of shareholders this is precisely what attracts bargain hunters the companies are cheap many continue to generate significant amounts of cash and some own assets their new private owners can sell merge or liquidate without the need for shareholder approval to make the businesses more efficient mr zells proposed buyout of tribune a deal that values the year old chicago newspaper giant at &# billion shows how certain tax structures can sweeten or even drive the buyout of a struggling company with depressed stock tribunes share price has fallen since the start of expecting to tap debt at cheap prices to finance most of the transaction mr zell put down just &# million of his own money if the company turns around mr zell can exercise his option to buy of the stock at a bargain price he beat out other bidders by offering to pay &# a share about a premium to the stocks week low mr zell plans to convert tribune to a so called s corporation which doesnt pay corporate level tax on income most u s companies are c corporations which must pay corporate income tax shareholders of an s corporation generally are required to pay tax on income they earn from the company but under a tax code exemption they arent taxed if they are part of an employee stock ownership plan or esop once private tribune will adopt an esop meaning shareholders wont need to pay taxes on income from tribune "the company is treated effectively like a charity itll be a tax exempt entity " says robert willens an accounting and tax analyst at lehman brothers the structure also can protect companies from capital gains when they shed assets a key cost cutting strategy in the publishing industry where assets that dont generate ample revenue are shopped for sale capital gains taxes are imposed if a company sells assets within years of becoming an s corporation such as tribune selling its stake in the chicago cubs baseball team for example but if the companys income that year offset by tax deductions or carrying forward previous operating losses is lower than its capital gains the tax is assessed on the lower amount other financiers may be eyeing proposals tied to esops mr willens expects chrysler now the target of a four way bid by private money managers to also be structured as an esop and s corporation "this is going to be the wave of the future " he says indeed private money has been diving into the auto sector which many public shareholders wrote off years ago mr kerkorians &# billion cash bid for the daimlerchrysler ag unit follows expressions of buying interest from cerberus capital management lp a partnership of blackstone group and centerbridge partners and auto parts supplier magna international inc "when whole manufacturing industries are disappearing in the u s there are frequently pockets of value left behind " says xerions mr arbess the steel industry in pennsylvania and the coal mining industry yielded bargain assets hidden in failing companies for financiers such as wilbur ross who picked up assets in both sectors at deep discounts in he sold his international steel group which pooled assets he bought a couple of years earlier from moribund u s steel companies to britains mittal steel for &# billion he salvaged billions in profit from the scrapheap in part financiers are betting that these companies which still generate a lot of cash can take on much more debt as private companies publicly traded firms risk shareholders ire by taking on too much debt because higher interest payments eat into earnings "public companies have been very reluctant to operate with more leverage " says david kostin investment strategist at goldman sachs "financiers see the opportunity to operate with more complex capital structures with bank loans secured loans and unsecured loans which will enhance their return on equity " buyout firms have long operated by using borrowed money to finance improvements with interest rates in the past several years at record lows companies issued bonds that offered only slight premiums to government debt to impress traditional bond investors such as insurance companies mutual funds and pension funds increasingly though private equity funds have been using loans from wall street banks backed by collateral such as an acquisitions assets in many cases these are then packaged by the banks and sold as "collateralized loan obligations " or clos that offer various levels of risk for investors making them much more marketable hedge funds and traditional bond investors are big investors in clos private equity funds like these bank loans in some cases preferring them to issuing bonds because the collateral technically makes the loans safer allowing their target companies to load up with debt that pays lower interest rates strong demand from buyers of clos also allows weak companies to raise money by issuing even riskier loans backed by collateral already used to secure other debt while financiers are betting they can outsmart the public markets by taking on their rejects the success of these long shot turnarounds relies on revived interest by public shareholders thats because private equity funds often cash out of investments through initial public offerings selling them back to investors who didnt want them in the first place henny sender contributed to this article
