ceo compensation survey a special report purchase price if a private equity firm buys your company what does it mean for your compensation private equity firms buying binge of recent years is raising some tough questions for many executives at publicly traded companies if a private firm buys your employer should you stay or go and if you stay how do you wrangle a compensation package thats at least as good as what you had before "pay is very aligned with performance" after a takeover says tom franco a spokesman for new york based private equity firm clayton dubilier &amp rice inc thats because the goal in most cases is to get the organization leaner and improve its performance so that the company can be sold or taken public again within three to seven years if the people who bought your company think you help drive its performance you may be surprised at how generous they are if not you may be surprised at how unwelcome you feel heres how it usually works gone are perquisites like gym memberships and company cars vesting of executives stock option grants from the public company generally gets accelerated and those shares are bought by the acquiring company the new owners hand out equity stakes but only to an elite group that they want to feel motivated to stick around those fortunate few can often get double or more the equity stake they had before and buy more equity themselves that puts them in position to reap huge windfalls if the private equity firm succeeds in turning the business around for those below the top brass the advantages of sticking around can be far less clear many executives may not get equity at all and even if equity is distributed broadly theres a significant hitch for those holdings to pay off you often have to stay until the investors payday which could be more than five years away if it ever comes at all thats a long time to wait when your stake is less than lavish "in a public company many people are taken care of " says alan johnson managing director of johnson associates inc a pay consultancy in new york "in a private company its much less automatic they single people out " it isnt all about the money buyouts often involve management shake ups and a new corporate culture that not everyone feels comfortable in says bill coleman senior vice president for compensation at salary com inc some executives become disgruntled with the new focus on increasing profits or dont have faith in the chieftains to execute a turnaround its also possible that your job could change under the new ownership "the place you worked yesterday is not the same business you work for today " mr coleman says but dont resign too fast he says at least wait to see whats being offered because of the potential for a windfall if you get the right deal and a turnaround happens you can often glean clues to your prospects during the transition period when the new owners are scouting out the most important players this of course is a good time to work extra hard mr coleman says and pay attention to how much youre being included in transition meetings since thats usually a clear indicator of how much you will be involved afterward and how much leverage you have while you should pay close attention during the transition period its usually best to wait until the new owners and management team have made you an offer before asking for anything says mr johnson so that you dont sell yourself short you might end up getting a better deal than you expected the most coveted compensation in this situation is equity in the company which can be lucrative if the company is sold or goes public usually the private equity investors will map out exactly which executives should get that equity but theres some room for negotiation if you can convince them of your worth and sometimes certain executives are allowed or even strongly encouraged to invest their own money in the company t tracy bilbrough is a former executive at black &amp decker corp who now runs generation brands a cary n c lighting fixture company backed by the private equity firm quad c management inc of charlottesville va he says executives who want a slice of equity often have to show the new owners how they contribute to creating shareholder value because sometimes certain key executives are overlooked one advertising manager at generation who was originally left out of the equity distribution last year was able to persuade the company to let him in by putting together a portfolio showing how the significant advertising budget he oversaw influenced company performance mr bilbrough says he says its important for compensation matters to be addressed within the first few months after the buyout because theres often only a certain amount of equity that will be doled out brent longnecker a houston compensation consultant says theres another consideration even if youre left out of the equity today do you have a chance at being promoted to an executive job in the near future that will let you in if you think the turnaround will be a gold mine its worth inquiring about your job prospects "ask them what it takes to get to that next level " mr longnecker says keep in mind though that while an equity stake can make you rich it can also be worthless usually the value cant be realized until the private equity firm sells the company or takes it public again if you leave before that happens generally youre out of luck its unlikely the owners will allow an executive who leaves to keep a stake in the company and its a risky subject to broach during compensation negotiations the private equity firm may frown upon an executive who suggests that he or she may decide to bail out early executives who dont have the opportunity to get equity should aim for better cash incentives or just plain cash to replace the stock options they once had to retain strong performers some private equity firms will increase annual cash bonuses or short term and long term cash incentive plans tied to company performance others may simply pay better salaries cash might even be worth more to executives who arent sure the private equity firm can turn the company around or who think they might leave after a year or two many private equity firms are reluctant to pay extra cash though unless its directly linked to performance so the most successful negotiating tactics usually are those where the executive ties his or her cash bonuses to performance metrics says lawrence cagney chairman of executive compensation and employee benefits for debevoise &amp plimpton llp a new york law firm "what you need to do is sell what you can do to increase the value of the business " he says for instance a midlevel marketing program manager might recommend setting up a cash bonus arrangement that provides a certain annual payout dependent on how much revenue the program delivers whatever you do be careful about threatening to leave as a negotiation tool says mr coleman "unless you really mean it dont go there " ms spors is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in south brunswick n j she can be reached at kelly spors wsj com
