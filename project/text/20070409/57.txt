powerhouse on the trail inside clinton campaign a potent political machine veteran team masters tactical nuts and bolts lagging in web money manchester n h bill shaheen has been a kingmaker in democratic politics here since helping jimmy carter win a surprise victory in the presidential primary in he helped john kerry carry the state and was expected to work for him again in then in january mr kerry dropped out and hillary clinton pounced "john kerry said he was out at p m at shes on the phone saying she wants to meet with me " mr shaheen recalled in an interview no other candidate called for more than a week after more than a month of getting wooed by multiple campaigns the veteran operative recently joined the new york senators campaign by then hed had breakfast twice with mrs clinton once at his home an hour from manchester in the early months of the democratic presidential contest the strengths of the major candidates are becoming clear charismatic illinois sen barack obama can generate media buzz and large crowds and has particularly strong appeal among fellow african americans former north carolina sen john edwards has become the darling of the partys liberal base both men are winning support from the partys strong antiwar wing mrs clinton is seen as the heir to the clinton presidency appeals strongly to women and as the courting of mr shaheen shows has a well oiled political machine mrs clintons staff is packed with operatives experienced in presidential campaigns most of the people in her inner circle have worked for decades in politics often including stints on the presidential campaigns of bill clinton her fund raising team features some of the businesss top pros led by campaign chairman terry mcauliffe who raised more than &# million in four years as head of the democratic party recently mr mcauliffe told a crowd "this cycle we are going to raise trillion dollars " that was a joke but mrs clinton did raise &# million in the first three months of this year more than triple the top haul four years ago for the corresponding three month period mrs clinton hopes her veteran staff and early fund raising will attract more supporters who in turn can bring in more money and enable her to hire more people the goal is to create the "aura that she will be the nominee and that she will be the winner " says stephanie cutter who was mr kerrys spokeswoman and is currently neutral in this election to be sure massive organizations can be overly cautious bureaucratic and prone to power struggles also democratic activists and primary voters are often drawn to grass roots insurgents and bristle at the feeling of being steamrollered by a machine when mr clinton ran for president in against more experienced politicians his aides were mostly in their s and s working on their first national campaign and they won it mrs clintons opponents have criticized her campaign for its ties to the washington political establishment indeed mr obama without the same fund raising apparatus hauled in nearly as much as mrs clinton &# million aided in part by that sentiment among the partys base an obama supporter created a widely viewed internet ad that parodied a famous apple inc commercial introducing its macintosh computers in with mrs clinton in the role of the leviathan international business machines corp for his part mr edwards is betting on a strong performance in iowa which holds the first presidential caucus in january that could give him a sudden infusion of cash and support the same strategy that catapulted jimmy carter past better known democrats in mr edwardss campaign says it has a presence in all iowa counties and he has visited the state times since the campaign when he finished second still the history of presidential politics has plenty of examples where the establishment candidate with a well organized operation prevails in and the democratic nomination went to a sitting or former vice president hubert humphrey walter mondale and al gore who relied on a previously successful national campaign operation all three overcame senators eugene mccarthy gary hart and bill bradley who advertised their insurgent status "clinton continues to dominate this race with the size and scope of her organization around the country " says scott reed a republican strategist who supports arizona sen john mccains campaign for the republican nomination a good campaign operation could be more important than ever this time because the primary season has essentially been condensed to just a month many big states including california and new jersey are voting in early february just weeks after the first contests in iowa and new hampshire "the way the calendar is shaping up with this unprecedented degree of front loading means that a campaign has to be in a lot of places at once " says democratic pollster geoffrey garin who isnt working for any of the candidates mrs clintons organization is a direct descendant of the one that captured the presidency for mr clinton in won again in and then lifted mrs clinton to easy victories in and in new york senate races one of its pillars is the former president himself who advises his wife and often makes appearances on her behalf when she is unavailable in late march mrs clinton won the endorsement of former iowa gov tom vilsack who ended his presidential run in february because of a lack of funds mr vilsack said his endorsement was in part payback for the decade old chit mrs clinton had collected when as first lady she helped raise money for his first campaign for governor in after mr vilsacks endorsement mrs clinton offered to help pay down his &# campaign debt by helping him raise money mr vilsack said in an interview that most of the democratic candidates made similar offers fund raising is one thing the clinton operation has always done well mrs clinton raised &# million for her senate campaign more than any other candidate running for congress last year at the start of this year she was able to roll over &# million of that into her presidential campaign mr obama started the year with &# the clinton organization built with those dollars is working overtime to bring in more last week a group of wealthy new jersey democrats announced they will be joining the clinton fund raising network teaneck n j lawyer al decotiis says he and a few other democratic boosters decided a year ago to select one presidential candidate for whom to raise money in the state the group personally interviewed most of the major candidates but couldnt get mr obama "we must have put in five or six calls " mr decotiis recalls "for whatever reason he didnt respond then we met with hillary and we decided to endorse her and work aggressively for her presidency " money proved helpful in south carolina when mrs clinton was seeking state sen darrell jacksons support mr jackson serves as the pastor of one of the largest african american congregations in the state and runs a public relations and consulting firm mrs clintons campaign hired the firm after mr jackson rejected a less lucrative contract offer from the obama campaign an obama spokeswoman says the lower offer was for &# a month mr jackson who says the fees had nothing to do with his endorsement believes that mrs clinton has "one of the best political operations that ive seen" in south carolina "when you look at those people who really know how to run a campaign who have been involved in numerous campaigns before thats where she has the advantage " he says an aggressive stance on media and message is also a clinton tradition going back to jack quinn a former chief of staff to mr gore says that after he was booked to appear on msnbc one day earlier this year he received an unsolicited email from the clinton campaign "offering to provide any information that might be helpful before going on " mr quinn hasnt endorsed a candidate and says he doesnt know how the clinton campaign found out that he was going to be on television "the fact that they reached out was an indication of a very highly functioning communications operation " mr quinn says one area where mr obama has outpaced mrs clinton is internet donations a reflection of the appeal of his messages of generational change and to web savvy activists opposed to the iraq war mr obamas campaign spokesman bill burton points to a recent student organized rally at george mason university outside of washington that drew attendees without support from the campaign that shows the "grass roots energy that sen obama has inspired " mr burton says dave tiffany a year old retired computer entrepreneur from hollis n h came to a town hall session with mrs clinton in february with a sign reading "quit stalling bring our troops home " he says a security guard told him mrs clinton would take a question from him if he turned over the sign he did but the message apparently didnt get through and he had to shout at the end to get his question in "i was definitely left with the impression that it was a scripted event and that we were all being spun " mr tiffany says he had a better impression of mr obama after an event last week mr tiffany says mr obama "was very open and forthcoming he seemed to be presenting himself for an interview for the most important job in america " new hampshire is a key state for mrs clinton as it was for her husband who proclaimed himself the "comeback kid" after a second place finish there in the president visited in his final days in the white house to thank the state for its support and has returned regularly to maintain his political contacts last summer mr clinton came back for a golfing trip and lunch with new hampshire political operatives in early february about a dozen new hampshire party members went to washington for the democratic national committees annual meeting few of these people had signed up for a campaign and several candidates tried to lure them mr obama had planned to do so as well but had to cancel when the committees proceedings took longer than expected one new hampshire operative who signed up with mrs clinton after the meeting was nick clemons who helped orchestrate a campaign last year that put democrats in control of both houses of the new hampshire state legislature for the first time since after meeting personally with mrs clinton he agreed to run her new hampshire campaign when state representative betty lasky and her husband were contemplating their endorsement mr clemons "was calling every day " recalls mrs lasky a member of the new hampshire house leadership mrs lasky who had hosted mr obama at her home says she was concerned that mrs clinton was a polarizing figure who couldnt beat a republican in the general election mr clemons listened to her concerns and arranged a minute private meeting with his candidate "other campaigns were willing to do the same thing but were just not as quick " says mrs lasky she says she would have liked to meet again with mr obama before making her endorsement but "the opportunity didnt arise " on march mrs lasky endorsed mrs clinton and agreed to help her round up endorsements from other state legislators last thursday she signed up nine additional legislators bringing her tally in the state to mr obamas campaign says he has eight endorsements from new hampshire legislators so far while a spokesman for mr edwards says he plans to roll out his endorsement list this week
