a new wireless player hopes to challenge ipod yahoo joins the mp fray with a &# device that links to its music services a long and distinguished list of companies including sony corp microsoft corp and samsung co have tried and failed to make deep inroads into the digital music player market dominated by apple inc s ipod internet giant yahoo inc and its partners dont want to join that list a new wireless mp player called the sansa connect the result of a three way collaboration among yahoo mp player and storage device maker sandisk corp and technology start up zing systems inc hit store shelves on friday the &# device crafted to work closely with yahoos internet music and other online services has a novel twist its designed to download music from the internet wirelessly when the user isnt necessarily near a personal computer and wants to get fresh batches of songs the sansa connect is the latest effort to succeed by emulating elements of apples ipod formula apples success with its player about million have been sold to date results in large part from the products ease of use and thats mainly because ipod hardware software and the online itunes store are designed to work together seamlessly apple rivals in the digital music market initially sought to compete by introducing players and online music services that werent as closely integrated resulting in technical snafus for the products users increasingly though software hardware and online service companies are working together to make their products easier to use last year microsoft introduced the zune music player made by toshiba corp designed to work with microsofts digital music store so far though the zune hasnt taken off sandisk has done better in the mp player market it quickly rose to the no position with of the u s market after it entered the music business a little over two years ago among the companys products are a music player the sansa er thats designed to work closely with realnetworks inc s rhapsody subscription music service yahoo and its partners are gambling that they can have an impact in the market by offering a new class of connected devices that are different from ipods but with similarly tight links between hardware and internet music service a key feature included in the sansa connect a black device sized like a small stack of business cards is wireless technology thats commonly used to provide internet access through home networks and countless cafes hotel lobbies and other public "hot spots " if sansa connect users are within range of a wi fi network they can connect directly to yahoos music services users of the device dont always have to be in range of a wi fi connection to enjoy songs though yahoo offers a subscription music service that permits unlimited song downloads at prices starting at &# a month subscribers can fill up their sansa connects with as many as songs and still access them when they leave a hot spot though they dont permanently own the music they access through the service "we want to be the music dial tone for connected devices " says ian rogers general manager of yahoo music the device also lets users access yahoos flickr photo service so they can browse through their pictures online a central player in the sansa connects creation is zing of mountain view calif a company co founded by tim bucher a former apple executive who ran the macintosh technology group within apple that developed key pieces of the ipod zing developed the complex software that allows the sansa connect to connect to yahoos various internet services mr bucher hopes the sansa connect will appeal to people who have never owned an mp player and convert those who already own ipods "if we can make it seamless enough where you dont have to be an it professional you can tap into those newbies " he says there are limitations to the sansa connect though for one it doesnt have a keyboard to easily enter text so users cant type in artists name and download their songs wirelessly from yahoo instead with a couple of button clicks they can download groups of songs from yahoo mixes across dozens of genres or yahoo radio stations downloading songs wirelessly can take seconds or so a song longer than transferring songs the old fashioned way over a cable connected to a pc so the sansa connect gives users the traditional option as well the idea is to give users a way to download new music on the go something the ipod doesnt currently allow users to do even apples new iphone due out in june wont initially let people buy music wirelessly "the ipod is very much a pod it provides functionality and an ecosystem that is somewhat cocooned " says daniel schreiber a senior vice president at sandisk apple declined to comment the sansa connect isnt the first mp player with wireless capabilities microsoft put wi fi in the zune but its device uses the wireless capability only to share songs with other users nearby not to download music from the internet a start up musicgremlin inc was one of the first to offer a music player for downloading music wirelessly but the product hasnt sold well some analysts are skeptical that yahoos new device will be able to compete against apple "i dont think that anybody is likely to be able to steal share from apple based on some kind of hardware feature " says stephen baker an analyst at npd group cellphones are making better progress with products that marry wireless technologies and music playing functions sony ericsson a joint venture between telefon ab l m ericsson and sony sold million walkman phones by the end of however most users of those devices are loading music from personal song collections on their pcs rather than downloading them wirelessly through cellular carriers networks li yuan contributed to this article
