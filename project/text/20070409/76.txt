why china need not fear u s economic slowdown beijing if the u s economy weakens further as many now worry it will china would seem to be vulnerable about a fifth of chinas exports go to the u s its biggest single foreign market and those shipments have been a major driver of chinas fast growth chinas total exports have been rising by about a year for the past five years and are equivalent to roughly a third of the annual economic output of what is now the worlds fourth largest economy yet barring a major collapse in the u s and world economy there are good reasons to believe china could weather slowing demand from the u s most economists are penciling in a possible loss of just one or two percentage points from chinas recent annual economic growth rates of or more that may seem surprising given the fact that chinas top leaders themselves have flagged the countrys heavy dependence on exports as a problem "our economic growth relies heavily on investment and exports " premier wen jiabao said last month citing an example of how chinas expansion has become what he called "unstable unbalanced uncoordinated and unsustainable " yet chinas policy makers at the moment are more focused on keeping growth from getting ahead of itself than on preventing any incipient slowdown many chinese economic indicators showed signs of accelerating activity in the first two months of the year in response the central bank raised interest rates in february and tightened bank credit again through other measures just last week a mild slowdown in the u s could actually further the governments efforts to rein in growth it might also encourage chinese companies to focus more on serving domestic consumers than overseas ones another shift chinas leaders are trying to promote recent history doesnt offer much cause for concern about a slump in the u s buffeting china economic growth in the u s during the last recession slowed from in to less than a quarter of that in chinas growth rate by contrast barely budged its economy expanded in and in indeed chinas exporters have a record of doing pretty well during slowdowns the recession in the u s knocked percentage points off of the growth rate of chinas exports that year but the nation still managed to eke out a respectable increase in export shipments by value more recently chinas exports have faced other head winds u s imports fell in the fourth quarter of on a seasonally adjusted basis chinas currency has risen against the dollar in the past year making its exports more expensive and some manufacturers are defecting to cheaper locations like vietnam yet its exports grew in and are up from a year earlier in the first two months of this year chinas exports may continue growing even if the u s slows down because of the high competitiveness of chinese exports " said milan brahmbhatt the world banks lead economist for east asia he notes that challenges like a stronger currency and weaker demand usually push chinese exporters to upgrade quality and productivity so that they can maintain growth by taking market share from others and while exports are important chinas expansion is flying on more than one engine much of its boom has come from massive building of new factories highways and housing while some investment does go into export manufacturing more than half of such spending last year went to housing and infrastructure the kind of investment that serves local demand and doesnt depend on the vagaries of u s consumer spending "china seems to be an outlier in terms of having its own independent cycle this is happening because of the primary importance of fixed asset investment in china which seems to be autonomous " said ifzal ali chief economist at the asian development bank unlike consumer spending investment can be easily directed by chinas government that makes it a useful tool for escaping a serious economic downturn chinas government displayed its willingness and ability to spend its way out of recession during the asian financial crisis of when it issued huge amounts of debt to fund a massive program of public works construction chinese policy makers have been playing down the importance of investment recently voicing worries that its fast growth is concealing wasteful projects that will weigh down the economy in the future they are placing more of their hopes for future growth on increasing consumer demand and are trying to encourage households to save less and spend more but should exports unexpectedly collapse chinese consumer spending would be unlikely to be strong because manufacturers would probably have to trim wages and jobs so investment now the high profile target of government economic controls could turn out to be the economys saving grace
