hilliam clinton in the s "clintonesque" became a by word for political double speak we even became briefly a nation of deconstructionists when president bill clinton mused on the meaning of "is " such existential questions seemed to be in the past but with another clinton running as if shes all but a sure thing for the white house clintonesque is once again becoming a politically relevant adjective in tuesday nights democratic presidential debate the moderators and hillary clintons fellow panelists took pains to pin her down on one question after another without notable success the junior senator from new york seems increasingly to have adopted her husbands political methods minus the savoir faire the result is that its impossible to know what she believes about anything on irans nuclear ambitions moderator brian williams asked a number of the candidates what their "red line" was as he put it to barack obama "what would make it crystal clear in your mind that" the u s "should attack iran " when he repeated the question to senator clinton her answer was in sum "i think that what were trying to do here is put pressure on the bush administration " she added "weve got to rein him in " and no she didnt mean mahmoud ahmadinejad when pressed by mr williams she clarified in a way "were not in my view rushing to war we should not be doing that but we shouldnt be doing nothing " a bit later tim russert the other moderator tried again "senator clinton would you pledge to the american people that iran will not develop a nuclear bomb while you are president " "i intend to do everything i can to prevent iran from developing a nuclear bomb " mrs clinton replied in a formulation that would make her husband proud "but you wont pledge " mr russert asked "i am pledging i will do everything i can to prevent iran from developing a nuclear bomb " mrs clinton repeated mr russert then tried a third time with the same ambiguous result the question of experience came up repeatedly and mrs clinton wasnt shy about citing her time as first lady as a main qualification to be president she was less forthcoming about the records of her time in the white house however mr russert asked "in order to give the american people an opportunity to make a judgment about your experience would you allow the national archives to release the documents about your communications with the president the advice you gave because as you well know president clinton has asked the national archives not to do anything until " mrs clintons initial response was to blame the archives but mr russert asked whether she would lift her husbands "ban" on releasing their correspondence "thats not my decision to make " was her reply apparently we are supposed to believe that the former president would refuse his wifes request to release those records if she asked even gentle mr obama couldnt bite his tongue about that one comparing the episode to the "secretive" bush administration senator clinton was especially clumsy in trying to evade any clear position on new york governor eliot spitzers proposal to give drivers licenses to illegal immigrants when asked why in her words it "makes a lot of sense" to give licenses to illegals her first answer sounded like an endorsement mr spitzer is trying to "fill the vacuum left by the failure of this administration to bring about comprehensive immigration reform " she said but after senator chris dodd disagreed calling a license a "privilege" not a right she broke in a moment later to clarify "i just want to add i did not say that it should be done but i certainly recognize why governor spitzer is trying to do it " this prompted mr dodd to interject that her second answer didnt sound like her first so mr russert tried again "do you support mr spitzers plan " "you know tim this is where everybody plays gotcha " mrs clinton replied "it spitzers proposal makes a lot of sense " so she does support it unfortunately she wasnt done speaking "do i think this is the best thing for any governor to do no " at that point mr williams changed the subject the story was similar on taxes and social security on charlie rangels tax plan she "agrees with the goal" and "admires his willingness to take this on " its just that she doesnt share that willingness at least not before shes in the white house and on social security she said "i do not advocate" and "do not support" raising social security taxes but she would still "consider" it the political strategy is clear enough mrs clinton wants to roll to her partys nomination on a tide of "inevitability" while disguising her real agenda as much as possible but democratic voters ought to consider whether they want to put all their hopes for retaking the white house on mrs clintons ability to obfuscate like her husband without his preternatural talent for it aside from lacking her husbands political gifts hillarys challenge is that weve all seen this movie before and performances like tuesdays might be enough to convince voters to opt for a candidate who is his own man see related letter "letters to the editor the clinton bush dynasty" wsj nov
