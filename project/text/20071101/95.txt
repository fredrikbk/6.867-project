poison served his purpose the devils gentleman by harold schechter ballantine pages &# roland burnham molineux a well to do manhattan socialite and the son of a civil war general was an outwardly normal man but a combination of shame betrayal and rage transformed him from a law abiding if haughty sportsman into an ice cold killer inclined to settle his grievances with poison harold schechter traces molineuxs metamorphosis in "the devils gentleman " a dark chronicle of ghoulish revenge journalistic sensationalism legal wrangling and badly treated hangovers molineuxs crimes committed in manhattan in the fall of but unsolved for months were the subject of one of the great newspaper wars of the period joseph pulitzers world and william randolph hearsts new york journal conducted lavish investigations often just ahead of the citys police detectives whom they cheerfully maligned for not closing the case soon enough "the amateur detectives of the press " a police captain said in a newspaper interview "are not my detectives " after molineux was finally caught the "great poison case" became a kind of celebrity murder trial it ended ambiguously when the verdict was overturned on appeal and established a legal rule that is part of new york state jurisprudence to this day molineux was a trained chemist his familys fortune came from the manufacture of chemical dyes and a bon vivant whose life until his moment of notoriety had centered largely on the knickerbocker athletic club he reveled in demonstrating his sporting prowess at the club and hectored the management for permitting his social inferiors to become members then in quick succession molineux developed grudges against two male acquaintances he decided to take his revenge by anonymously sending each man a "free sample" of health remedies both of them laced with mercuric cyanide his first victim henry barnet was molineuxs hard drinking fellow clubman and the indiscreet lover of blanche chesebrough a singer who happened to be molineuxs girlfriend barnet experiencing a heroic hangover one october morning spooned out some of the free powder hed received in the mail and died miserably two months later a man named harry cornish the knickerbocker clubs athletic director received his own free sample not long before molineux had been living at the knickerbocker until he feuded with cornish over the clubs supposedly lax management and was forced to resign "you win " had been molineuxs last words to cornish at the time cornishs victory it would turn out came at a heavy price when cornishs distant cousin katherine adams complained about not feeling well after a night of too much wine he suggested that she try the remedy that had come in the mail she did but complained of the medicines bitter taste so cornish took a small test dose himself and nearly died his cousin for her part "dropped like six feet of chain " dead on the bathroom floor cornish later testified in the cultural iconography of the time it was thought that only a woman perhaps a jilted girlfriend would resort to so effeminate a means of murder as poison real men preferred knives or firearms but the writing on the poison packages would turn out to be that of molineux a sampling of his own hand was found among other places on the requests he had written to companies that promised cures for male "debility" or "atrophy " blanche who married molineux a few weeks after barnets murder would confess in an unpublished memoir a gold mine for mr schechter that molineux indeed suffered from this particular ailment indeed blanches first impression of her future husband had been of a man "not very tall but his body was slender and beautifully proportioned he carried himself very erect and gave a nonchalant air of self possession poise and breeding " it was the breeding she was most interested in having always fancied studying voice in paris one quality that molineux did not possess apparently was the aura of "brute masculine force" that blanche found so appealing she discovered it in the "virile" attentions of molineuxs friend barnet that molineux might be what the newspapers called a "moral degenerate" that is a homosexual certainly enlivened the case and its coverage in the press "evidence grows that degenerate was poisoner" announced pulitzers world in january winkingly reporting that the suspect had decorated his club rooms with "many fine bits of bric a brac pictures and all that sort of thing " around the club cornish told prosecutors molineux was known to keep a number of obscene or "immoral" works including krafft ebings "psychopathia sexualis " the manhattan district attorney called molineux "a man sicklied oer with the pale cast of sexual perversion " molineux was charged with only the death of cornishs unlucky cousin mrs adams the death of his first victim had not been carefully investigated the second though turned up plenty of evidence the trial lasted more than three months and the prosecution called more than witnesses including several handwriting experts at the end of the prosecutions day siege the defense unveiled its strategy calling not a single witness it didnt work molineux was convicted and sent to the sing sing death house where he lingered until he was granted a new trial on appeal "generally speaking " wrote justice william e werner in an appellate decision that has given us what is still called the molineux rule the state "cannot prove against a defendant any crime not alleged in the indictment " the trial had spent a great deal of time making the case that out of romantic jealousy molineux had killed henry barnet in a gruesome prelude to the attempted murder of cornish and the inadvertent death of mrs adams molineux had almost certainly killed barnet but he had not been formally charged for it a second trial in brought a better result for molineux with a new judge placing great restrictions on evidence presented by the prosecution and with the defense offering an alibi witness the jury acquitted molineux but long term syphilis which may have played a role in molineuxs murderous crack up eventually put him in an insane asylum on long island where he died in at age mr schechter a mystery writer and true crime author finds plenty of drama in this story before molineuxs arrest in the competitive rivalry between police detectives and the yellow press and after in the legal circus of the sprawling first trial after sampling from dozens of florid contemporary accounts he sometimes allows his prose to take on the stately mannerisms of the era "goff had no choice but to adjourn the case until the morrow " but such intrusions hardly undermine the enjoyment offered by this well wrought anatomy of a murder and portrait of an age mr ward has written often about new york history for american heritage magazine and other publications
