reinventing the wheel complete vehicle imaging the latest car technology what it is the around view monitor or avm is another step in the development of automotive rear view cameras instead of using a single camera to show the area behind a vehicle when driving in reverse the avm uses four wide angle cameras to view the cars surroundings to the rear front and flanks the cameras feed a processor that converts the images into an overhead view of the vehicle how to get it the feature will be available on the ex a station wagon like crossover model from infiniti the luxury division of nissan motor co the car goes on sale dec the company says it expects to offer the avm on other infiniti models but has not specified which vehicles will get it or when rival luxury car maker lexus a unit of toyota motor corp will offer somewhat similar technology on its lx an suv that goes on sale early next year the lexus uses front and side mounted cameras to help drivers maneuver in tight spaces but the dashboard screen shows one cameras image at a time not an integrated overhead view upside with the infiniti system a driver may never again inadvertently mount the sidewalk or scrape an expensive alloy wheel on the curb the avm uses cameras from sony corp and a navigation system from xanavi a unit of tokyo based electronics maker clarion co together the devices produce a moving image clear enough to make looking out the window seem almost unnecessary downside there are still narrow blind spots at each corner and the view reaches only a few feet from the car so while backing out of the driveway recently we didnt spot an approaching jogger until he was next to the car the monitors view of the car is virtual meaning it will show your briefcase if you mistakenly leave it on the sidewalk but not if you leave it on the roof of the car cost infiniti and its parent company nissan motor co decline to reveal the price of the avm or even the car comment where much of the latest automotive technology is sometimes annoying the around view monitor is easy to use and helpful
