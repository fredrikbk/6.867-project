moving on some date how homecoming is losing out to hanging out last month a boy asked my year old daughter to his schools homecoming dance she agreed to go bought a new dress and made a hairdresser appointment the boy never bought tickets to the dance neither did his friends they decided that attending homecoming wouldnt be cool and instead planned to just dress up that night go out for dinner and then hang out with their dates at someones house my daughter was disappointed as were her girlfriends they would have loved to have been taken to the dance to show off their dresses to see and be seen at p m on the night of the boycotted dance about a dozen of these girls and their dates gathered in one boys backyard so a mob of parents could photograph them i found it dispiriting my heart went out to those girls all dressed up with no place to go couldnt we as parents have demanded that the boys take our daughters to the dance why did we stand there clicking our digital cameras saying nothing i live in suburban detroit but this phenomenon is playing out elsewhere in the country too a telling example of the indifference with which young people today view dating chivalry and romance studies of course show more young people skipping romantic relationships in favor of "hooking up " as teens socialize in packs forgo one on one dating and trade sex nonchalantly it is no stretch to find that boys are asking girls to homecoming and not bothering to take them there but with so many young people ignoring once sacrosanct dating rites how can we respond at some schools students are boycotting dances to protest bans on sexually suggestive "freak dancing " at others dances are just falling out of favor southeast high school in wichita kan canceled its homecoming dance last february after just tickets were sold half to members of the homecoming court at cardinal ohara high school in springfield pa class of homecoming queen cathy caramanico never got her big moment at the dance it was called off due to lack of interest many teens today prefer to gather in someones basement because its easier to pair off in dark corners "there arent as many chaperones in basements as at dances " says ms caramanico meanwhile of college students in a new study by michigan state university have had a sexual "friends with benefits" relationship nine out of "hookups" didnt lead to dating relationships the study found more ominously after casual sex females are more likely than males to show symptoms of depression according to a study reported last year in the journal of sex research "young women are longing for romance " says laura sessions stepp author of "unhooked how young women pursue sex delay love and lose at both " she interviewed girls who considered it empowering to be dismissive of romance and casual about sex later many were beset with regrets obviously boys no longer have to call girls on wednesday for a saturday date now college boys seeking weekend hookups send girls "u busy " text messages at or a m and girls routinely rouse themselves and go according to ms stepps research many girls spend the next day clutching their cellphones waiting in vain for the boy to call while visiting a high school students in mclean va ms stepp was approached by four girls seeking advice they wanted to start a "dating club " "these were gorgeous girls " she says "i told them to print up t shirts ask me for a date " family advocates say we should ask our daughters point blank about hooking up "does it make you happy " and we should explain that it can be helpful for teens to start practicing relationships learning to listen to trust to consider someones needs my wife and i debated insisting that our daughters date take her to homecoming our daughter asked us not to do that the boy a nice kid wanted to go to homecoming she said but was following his peers because there was parental supervision at that nights gathering we bit our lips and let it be as the father of three daughters i wish that more parents of sons would talk to their boys about being respectful and about the thrill that can come from holding hands those of us with daughters need to tell them that empowerment is less about sexual freedom and more about recognizing their true feelings it is too bad that my daughter and her friends didnt demand that the boys take them to homecoming yes they risked being dumped for easier girls but maybe the boys would have gotten the message and as promised graciously escorted their dates to the dance email jeffrey zaslow wsj com see related letters "letters to the editor girls who demand respect usually get it" wsj nov
