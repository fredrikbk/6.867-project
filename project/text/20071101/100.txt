politics &amp economics fcc orders cable firms to end exclusivity deals the federal communications commission told cable companies they must immediately cancel exclusive access contracts with apartment buildings and condominiums but also gave cable operators some help by streamlining the process for obtaining licenses from local governments by ending exclusive arrangements with apartment and condo buildings the fcc creates an opening for competition from phone companies such as at&amp t inc and verizon communications inc and other multichannel service providers the rules arent expected to have a large immediate impact given the small number of buildings covered by exclusive contracts the fcc decision didnt touch a more common arrangement exclusive marketing contracts under which a cable company or other video provider agrees to pay part of the wiring costs while the building owner agrees to market only that companys service to its tenants the fccs decision to streamline the application process for licenses from local governments follows a similar move for phone companies earlier this year it gives local governments days to decide on license renewal applications limits the fees they can charge cable companies and bars them from making unrelated financial demands in exchange for granting a license both decisions are expected to be challenged in court the first by cable operators and the second by groups representing state and local governments the earlier fcc move to streamline applications for phone companies is already the subject of a lawsuit
