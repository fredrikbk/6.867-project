quantifying taxes income inequality and the pursuit of happiness regarding arthur brookss commentary "happiness and inequality" editorial page oct why should we care about income inequality i dont think i can give you a good answer that would satisfy prof brooks but something tells me that the increase in income inequality is not a good thing government for the people should at least be about addressing this issue i am in favor generally of low taxes i would prefer to address this issue without raising taxes though i would like to try a flat or at least a flatter tax it seems the republicans have just ignored the issue so it will be no surprise if the country turns to the democrats who will raise taxes it would have been better had the republicans addressed the issue you cannot rationalize the issue away the country cares david rapaport scarsdale n y prof brooks states that for the u s the gini coefficient of inequality is much lower for happiness than for income this comparison must be taken with a large grain of salt because unlike income the numerical values assigned to different levels of happiness are arbitrarily determined e g does someone who is "very unhappy" have a negative value of happiness or does he have an absence of happiness a value of zero seemingly insignificant changes in these arbitrary values can have large changes in the calculated gini coefficient for example the gini coefficient could increase from to simply by shifting from a to scale to a to scale lawrence w robinson associate professor of operations management cornell university ithaca n y i think that while prof brookss essay raises some good points i would be more interested in a survey that asked about happiness and then asked what people thought about income equality i would like to know if even those who are happy are still concerned with income equality after all i can have a loving family and a relationship with god and still feel that congress is corrupt and the president is leading the country in the wrong direction jesus was divine youd think such a person would be happy and yet he was angry with the money changers in the temple another survey question that might be enlightening would be to ask of everyone "are taxes too high " if everyone answers the same does that mean everyones unhappiness is equal or are some more justified in their unhappiness than others lastly i would like to point out that income equality is about money but those who complain about it from the outside congress and low wage earners generally talk about benefits like health care and education those who complain about it from the inside are complaining about taxes losing money whose focus is more about money michael riordan washington golly im sure glad prof brooks pointed out to all of us middle classers who didnt make it into the top end of the income gap that we are nevertheless "very happy" three points or "pretty happy" two points i wouldnt have minded a little bump in my salary over the past years instead of points but who am i to quibble im just a middle class professional struggling to keep what ive got happy as a clam and mr brooks i really didnt get that little analogy you made concerning income inequality and depressed people no one i know wants to give depression to happy people what we would like is a little more income to keep up with our bills pay our kids tuition which has doubled over the past years and maybe set something aside so we can retire and keep our same home but hey i would hate to be accused of rank materialism or raw envy what mr brooks does not address is that something has happened in our economy over the last years and whether it is a conspiracy or not is not really very relevant to those of us who stubbornly want to remain in the middle class if the top earners have to pay more taxes to keep things fair and happy then maybe thats what we need even warren buffet pointed out to his fellow rich friends that their maids paid a higher tax rate than they did so maybe we need to concentrate on fair taxation then those of us in the middle class can continue to work on our happiness barbara schneider grand rapids mich
