reflecting their holdings one fund was called the bear stearns high grade structured credit strategies fund the other had the same name plus the words "enhanced leverage " that one had &# million in investor cash and at least &# billion in borrowed capital so for every dollar of investor money it borrowed roughly &# mr cayne showed little sign of concern about the mortgage market at a dinner with analysts in late march according to one attendee but soon that market took a turn for the worse the values of some holdings in both hedge funds sank the more leveraged fund told its investors in early june that it was down for the year through april prompting demands by many to get their money back to raise cash both funds began selling billions of dollars of the assets theyd acquired with borrowed money all this selling put still more pressure on the values of such securities about this time mr cayne began his summertime ritual of taking a helicopter from new york city to deal n j on thursdays

the office when he was free even when he wasnt there in person mr cayne was hands on say other associates mortgage division head tom marano who temporarily left his post over the summer to help stabilize the two flailing funds in the firms asset management division says mr cayne offered some helpful advice on handling irascible creditors during a critical period in july mr marano says the ceo told him in a phone call to "keep your irish down " or cool his temper and try to negotiate calmly mr marano is of irish and italian descent late in june as the outcry from investors in bears hedge funds grew bear authorized an th hour loan of up to &# billion to the less risky of the two beleaguered funds the fund ultimately borrowed about half that amount from its parent company on july

the afternoon games began on the calls mr cayne rarely dictated orders participants say when fingers were pointed he urged others not to "worry about who got us here " the funds reached an impasse on july fretting over a margin call that hadnt been met bear took the painful step of seizing most of the remaining collateral in the less leveraged fund to which bear had extended &# billion in credit although the fund had paid back &# million of the loan it couldnt come up with any more cash essentially forcing its own parent company to shut it down days later mr marano who had been unable to
