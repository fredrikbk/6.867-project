wonder land garry kasparov dissident one of the current truisms of the news business is that the internet has shrunk the world and that everyone knows everything from the web the moment it happens yet sometimes we know nothing last month the former world chess champion garry kasparov announced his candidacy for the presidency of russia to be decided in march the world shrugged at the kasparov candidacy and went back to surfing the web is this because we in the wired world already know all there is to know about whats up in st century russia or in fact are we clueless about the place churchill described as the deepest enigma garry kasparov believes the latter and so as leader of a grab bag coalition called other russia he has undertaken his doomed effort to succeed vladimir putin he works hard to get his message out in the west but he is given relatively short shrift by the professional skeptics among the western media and its intellectuals yes he has no chance but the inattention is a mistake i believe garry kasparov should be regarded as russias first post soviet dissident starting in the s deep in the cold war the world essentially put under its protective custody a generation of anti soviet dissidents their names became household names sakharov sharansky bukovsky medvedev sinyavsky kopelev others solzhenitsyn too hot to handle was exiled in the primary reason for analogizing mr kasparov to these dissidents is not for his opposition to the putin government and his views on mr putin though these are worth listening to the more relevant reason is that he believes his life is in danger in an interview this past weekend for "the journal editorial report" on fox cable news mr kasparov spoke with his characteristic force and animation about what he believes are the underlying weaknesses of a russia that looks to be thriving under mr putin mr kasparov was scheduled to fly back to russia a few days after the interview and at the end he was asked if he feared for his safety one could not help but notice that his answer came after a brief but obvious hesitation "yes " he said "i am im afraid my familys afraid its our greatest concern " why logic argues against killing mr kasparov the street demonstrations in moscow by his group number in the low thousands though they attract truncheon attacks by a small army of police agents a murder would make him a martyr in russia where he is still revered as a soviet and russian hero as a political threat he is a fly on the back of the putin rhinoceros but this is russia for all the same reasons one could have said the same of the russian journalists killed or mysteriously dead there in recent years their names are also a "dissident" list ivan safronov of kommersant iskandar khatloni of radio free europe paul klebnikov of forbes russia anna politkovskaya of novaya gazeta freedom house estimates some two dozen journalists have been killed since mr putin came to power earlier this month in prague and washington radio free europe radio liberty held symposiums on the status of russian media tied to the first anniversary of ms politkovskayas murder mr kasparov was there other than the washington times the symposiums received virtually no press coverage in the west mr kasparov is no political dilettante his first article on the status of democracy in russia appeared on this page in august he was years old he came to our offices near the world trade center for lunch and one has to say that at first it was hard to set aside that the fellow discoursing over chinese food on the wests unseemly affection for mikhail gorbachev possessed the most mammoth chess brain in history we made him a contributing editor to the journal editorial page and in the years since he has written often for these pages on russias wild ride to its current state across years mr kasparovs commitment to democratic liberty in russia and in its former republics has been unstinting at that september lunch mr kasparov proposed an idea then anathema to elite thinking in washington and the capitals of western europe the west should announce support for the independence of the former soviet republics the baltics ukraine armenia georgia moldova and the rest one suspects that vladimir putin noticed what the young chess champion was saying in about the old soviet empire the russian president has famously said "the demise of the soviet union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century " russia today is not what it was mr kasparov however has not stopped analyzing what it has become briefly he argues that mr putins internal and external politics should be seen almost wholly as a function of oil prices the primary source of revenue for the russian state and the prop beneath the extended putin political family mr putins "unhelpful" policies on iran and the like mr kasparov argues keep the oil markets boiling but not boiling over money in the bank at &# a barrel he says mr putin is the glue that binds this fabulously wealthy family and if he left politics in any real sense they would start killing each other as to secretary of state condoleezza rices argument that the west needed mr putin inside the g structure so it could "influence" him the former chess champion replies "occasionally you have to look at the results of your brilliant theories " bringing mr putin in as g no he says "jeopardized the whole concept of this club seven great industrial democracies " arguably these views make mr kasparov a dissident even in the increasingly cynical "pragmatic" west to their credit the wests political elites in the s protected the soviet unions dreamers today mr putin wants russia to be seen again as dangerous it is that garry kasparov deserves protection he stands for something important a word from pennsylvania avenue would be a start
