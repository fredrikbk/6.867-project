the month that the contest is held convincing more business professionals like mr oboudiyat to grow mustaches even for a cause may be tough in the u s where mustaches arent currently in vogue and facial hair runs afoul of corporate grooming norms none of the chief executive officers at the top fortune companies have mustaches for example and for young professionals seeking to follow in their footsteps growing one may seem like a step in the wrong direction "you dont see lot of men with mustaches working in corporate america " says aaron perlut co founder of the american mustache institute www americanmustacheinstitute org which formed in in st louis and has members its mission is to fight bias against men with furry upper lips he says "youre definitely out on a limb when you grow a mustache especially a flamboyant one and if you do you always run the risk that people will think youre going too far " while few companies have official policies banning facial hair wearing a mustache or beard is still taboo at many firms employees in customer facing roles at pitney bowes inc a maker of mail processing equipment and supplies are encouraged but not required to mirror the look of their clients says eileen springer vice president of human resources at the stamford conn based company this means that if executives at a customer firm are clean shaven the pitney bowes

mustaches are out of fashion in the workplace and elsewhere many young men today see them as an expression of defiance in the same way that tattoos and piercings held for generation x says celebrity stylist and actor phillip blotch "its become an urban bad boy thing young hip guys have them " he says for movember participants who arent necessarily young or hip explaining the motivation behind growing a mustache to friends family and co workers is exactly what they want the facial hair conversation is how they hope to spread awareness about prostate cancer says adam garone one of the charitys three co founders "the mustache is a vehicle to get men talking " he explains "what we say is youre essentially donating your face for a month you become a walking billboard because you walk into a meeting and youre forced to explain yourself " mr garone chose a mustache growing contest because "fun runs auctions wristband campaigns theyve been done to death " "the people who participate in movember have never really been active in these things " says mr garone "nothing has resonated with them " by contrast he says "movember is sort of retro " see a guide to mustache styles an added

llc in new york plans to participate in movember by growing a fu manchu style mustache he anticipates generating a lot of attention from his colleagues and friends and family members "if i were to
