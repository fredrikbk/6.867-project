politics &amp economics putins indecision leaves russian elite puzzled worried moscow vladimir putin has said he intends to remain influential after he steps down as president next year but as the end of his term looms his refusal to say how he will do that is spawning anxiety among the russian elite and an outbreak of bizarre political theater until september many kremlin watchers expected mr putin to step down at the end of his presidential term next year and hand power to a strong handpicked successor from among his close allies then last month mr putin said he might stay on as prime minister but last week he suggested he wont do that either though the head of the party he is backing says mr putin will somehow remain "russias leader " in russias tightly controlled politics the december parliamentary and march presidential contests are less about electoral competition than a referendum on mr putins popularity since he came to power in mr putins supporters say a strong popular mandate will ratify his plan to remain one of the countrys most powerful people russia has no tradition of leaders giving up power at the peak of their authority until mr putin makes his decision analysts say those around him are likely to try to preserve the status quo with soviet style stagecraft fawning television coverage choreographed demonstrations and some fear bombs and arrests "everyone is trying to influence him now because they know he hasnt made his mind up " says nikolai zlobin analyst at the center for defense information in washington "the elite is really really nervous " if mr putin does leave next year he would be the first healthy and popular kremlin leader in modern russian history to step down voluntarily soviet rulers either died in office or were ousted love of power has kept some in the kremlin but they have also been held in place by the countrys elites who fear a redistribution of spoils that tends to follow change of power in russia mr putin has repeatedly said he intends to follow the constitution which mandates he step down when his term ends in the spring as the elections approach analysts say mr putin is under increasing pressure from his own cadre "everyone around him says he should stay so that they can keep their own jobs " says igor bunin director of the moscow based center for political technologies mr putin his popularity boosted by a booming oil fueled economy and his tight control of the media has agreed to head the party list for the pro kremlin political party united russia in the parliamentary elections in december united russia has built its entire campaign around what it calls "putins plan " and party officials say the vote will effectively be a referendum on his rule "putin will remain russias leader " wrote boris gryzlov leader of united russia in rossiskaya gazeta in october in recent weeks a wave of demonstrations and public appeals calling on mr putin years old to stay on for a third term has swept the country opposition leaders have charged that local authorities working for united russia have orchestrated the demonstrations but a kremlin spokesman said they were simply a sign of russias vibrant civil society russia announced yesterday it would sharply curtail the number of election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe allowed in to monitor the parliamentary vote and also imposed restrictions on how long monitors could stay the white house said it was "disappointed" by the move and the osce called it "unprecedented " russia has in the past accused the osce monitors of bias against russia analysts say the campaign appears to be timed to deliver a victory in the parliamentary elections so strong that mr putin will be able to claim a mandate in whatever post he chooses to take after leaving the presidency some united russia members had suggested the party might use its commanding majority in parliament to make legal changes to shift powers from the president to the prime minister allowing mr putin to take that job but remain the top leader but mr putin said last week he wont do that but just who he will back as president remains unclear state controlled television for most of this year had been lavishing coverage on two top government officials sergei ivanov and dmitry medvedev who were widely viewed as potential presidential candidates recently tv newscasts have relegated them to less prominent slots meanwhile viktor zubkov the little known financial regulator mr putin unexpectedly picked as prime minister in september is covered prominently dressing down bureaucrats and demanding results mr zubkov years old is the only one of the three potential successors who has acknowledged publicly he would consider the presidency analysts say many of mr putins security service allies are pushing mr putin for a third term arguing that a less radical move would be destabilizing earlier this month tensions within the security services spilled into the open russias top drug fighter warned in a public letter that a battle among agencies which had led to corruption charges and arrests could undermine the countrys security yesterday a powerful bomb ripped through a passenger bus in a central russian city killing eight people and injuring more than emergency officials said investigators told russian news agencies they thought islamist terrorists or local criminal groups could be responsible viktor ilyukhin deputy chairman of the parliaments security committee called it an attempt to destabilize the country "the main question is who does it benefit " he said
