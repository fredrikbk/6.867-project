politics &amp economics cbo study casts doubt on co caps washington a new analysis by the congressional budget office could help those who argue that giving companies permits to emit carbon dioxide amounts to a tax congress is debating ideas for combating global warming one of them is a tax on carbon emissions another reflected in several bills under consideration is to cap emissions at a certain level and require companies to obtain emissions permits that could be traded advocates of "cap and trade" say a tax would probably force companies to raise prices quickly hitting consumers advocates of a tax say cap and trade carries hidden costs that make it equivalent to a tax they say a tax is more fair than a permit system that could be manipulated by politically influential polluters the congressional budget office is expected to give its analysis of cap and trade today the office plans to say that there is a strong case for treating the permits when first created as federal revenue raised if the permits are given to companies free of charge that should be treated as spending it will argue no cash would actually enter or leave the governments coffers in such a case but the analysis bolsters the assertion that giving away permits amounts to a subsidy for polluters in effect that there is a cost to taxpayers the office says that the subsidy theoretically could be worth &# billion or more a year based on the value that such permits might have when traded on an open market robert greenstein executive director of the liberal center on budget policy and priorities praised the analysis "the allowances have value that shouldnt be masked and made to disappear from the budget " he said the nonpartisan budget office is also expected to say that cap and trade like a tax might result in a quick hit to consumers wallets its analysis finds that companies would still raise prices even if the permits were free because they would factor in the cost of using the permit versus selling it to another firm for a profit most of the cap and trade bills in congress envision giving away most permits for several years before eventually switching to an auction and collecting the proceeds a bill being considered in the senate today sponsored by independent connecticut sen joseph lieberman and republican sen john warner of virginia calls for a progressive auction with of permits eventually auctioned by some environmentalists economists and consumer advocates have argued that the government should auction permits immediately and use the proceeds to offset higher energy prices through tax cuts or other relief kenneth green a resident scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute said the budget offices analysis is "hugely important" because it makes it harder for lawmakers to argue that cap and trade avoids the downsides of a tax but fred krupp president of the advocacy group environmental defense and a supporter of cap and trade programs said the way cap and trade is treated by cbo is going to be less important to lawmakers than what the policy could accomplish in terms of curbing greenhouse gas emissions "what happens will be governed more by the politics of what it takes to get deep reductions in emissions rather than by the optics of the cbo testimony " mr krupp said
