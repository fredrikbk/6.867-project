capital one pay gap shrinks another grows theres a new myth percolating about the u s economy female workers are doing great so are educated men the only ones hurting are male high school dropouts so the argument goes cut the whining about globalization and technological change hurting the american middle class fix the education and training system and get on with it its a nice story unfortunately it isnt true women are closing the pay gap with men and are outpacing men in the race to get college diplomas but the fact is that the remarkable burst of productivity of the past decade has not been widely shared with the women or men living at the middle of the american middle class "women are doing better than men but still not good in the sense as not as good as from to and not as good given the strength of productivity growth " says lawrence katz a harvard university economist who has become the arbiter of arguments about the american labor market "if men had done as well as women things would look much brighter but people would still be questioning why the median worker hasnt earned more " justifiably uneasy about democratic politicians demonization of globalization labor economist stephen j rose of the centrist democrats progressive policy institute is the latest to raise his voice to argue against what he calls the "dark vision" that "the american middle class is disappearing " part of his case expressed in a ppi monograph adapted for an op ed piece in this newspaper is this "for three quarters of the american work force women and the top half of male earners economic growth between and translated into earnings gains for the clear majority of the work force then the job market has become more welcoming " he does however offer a rather significant admission "the last six years have seen very little wage growth for the bottom of the work force " a few caveats the choice of years to compare the particular wage measure used and the way one adjusts for inflation can tilt the data toward a brighter or gloomier picture men and women tend to live together so when wages for one go up and wages for the other go down they share the pain or gain in many ways cleaner air healthier children amazing technology the middle class american family is far better off than it was years ago a few facts women are gaining on men women who worked full time year round earned less than of what men earned until the early s when social attitudes changed and women moved into high paying jobs once reserved almost exclusively for men as recently as more than half the something working women with college degrees were teachers now its less than one fifth in the census bureau says the typical woman earned of the typical mans wage but as the accompanying chart demonstrates the men and women at the statistical middle of the middle havent done all that well see accompanying table wsj nov the typical man earned &# last year which is more than the typical man earned in adjusted for inflation for women its &# up better not great in the same decade output per hour of work known as productivity climbed nearly yes some of this discrepancy is because employers spent more on health insurance and had less left over for wages but a lot is because the gains of recent growth have gone to the very best off women are getting more education in there were men graduating from four year colleges for every woman according to mr katz and his harvard colleague claudia goldin by there were as many women as men graduating today there are about women graduates for every man but the noteworthy gap is between workers with education and workers without regardless of gender the payoff for getting a diploma traditionally has been greater for women in the past some men got high paid blue collar jobs and thats still true the bigger story is how much more valuable a college diploma is than it was years ago and how much of a penalty a worker pays for not going to college the gap between womens wages and mens is narrowing but the gap between economic winners and losers of either gender is widening and the patterns of inequality among women are more similar to than different from the patterns among men earnings at the very top are growing much faster those at than at the middle or the bottom everything else is detail former treasury secretary lawrence summers puts it sharply if the distribution of income in the u s today were the same as it was in and the u s had enjoyed the same growth the bottom would have about &# billion more or about &# per family a year the top would have about &# billion less or about &# a family the bottom line the economy treats female workers more like male workers than it did a generation or two ago thats a welcome fact but it doesnt obscure the unwelcome reality that the fruits of americas prosperity arent being widely shared see related letter "letters to the editor this isnt about sharing" wsj nov
