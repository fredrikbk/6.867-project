mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i currently spend about &# to &# per year for norton security software is this necessary when windows xp has its own security built into the operating system a windows xp doesnt include antivirus or antispyware programs so you definitely need some sort of add on security software if you dont want to pay for it there are free alternatives available q how do we determine when to purchase a new pc our current dell is about five years old im feeling a little worried because i have my music and photos on the computer and dont want to lose them a theres no universal answer to your question in general i dont believe people should replace computers that are working well for them just because they reach a certain age on the other hand five years is pretty old for a pc at that age the odds increase that the hard disk may develop problems and that newer versions of the software you like will require hardware upgrades that may cost more than you want to invest in an older machine assuming your dell is working fine that you arent a power user and that your music and photo activities are simple and basic theres probably no urgent need to replace the pc but to assuage your concern about "losing" your pictures and music you might back up those precious files to an external hard disk or an online backup service q last week you compared the start up time of windows vista to apples new leopard operating system and found vista to be much slower but you used different laptops for each what would the numbers be on the same macintosh running the two operating systems a i ran the tests again on a single computer a fairly new apple imac which can be started up and restarted in either vista or leopard i used the macs boot camp feature in which only one operating system is running at a time has its own dedicated portion of the hard disk and fully controls the hardware the machine uses an intel processor and other key components commonly found on windows machines and runs windows just like a dell or any standard windows pc without any involvement from the mac operating system this vista installation doesnt include any of the speed robbing trial software commonly included by pc makers though it does have security software from symantec however the test results were very similar leopard started and restarted much more quickly than vista did in this simple test i timed both operating systems from a cold start and a restart until the computer was fully ready for operation with the hard disk quiet and the network connection established the cold start beginning with the computer completely off took leopard seconds but took vista one minute and seconds a restart beginning with the computer running an email program the firefox web browser and microsoft word took one minute and two seconds for leopard and three minutes and seconds for vista you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns free online at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
