glaxo granted injunction on patent rules a federal court in virginia granted glaxosmithkline plcs request for a preliminary injunction blocking the u s patent and trademark office from implementing new rules that the british pharmaceuticals company says will cause it "and other innovative companies like it" irreparable harm the proposed rules which were scheduled to go into effect today would reduce the number of times a patent applicant could contest or amend rejected or pending patent claims previously applicants could file an unlimited number of amendments or challenges known in industry parlance as continuations under the new rules applicants would have the right to file two continuations but anything above that would have to be accompanied by an explanation justifying the request continuations are considered an important tool by patent applicants particularly in the pharmaceuticals industry because new information about an invention often comes to light after the initial patent application has been filed this information can be added to the application via a continuation allowing the applicant to retain the original filing date which is critical in the ultracompetitive pharmaceutical and technology sectors the patent and trademark office wants to limit the number of continuations to help make the patent application process more efficient and to reduce its massive application backlog continuation requests accounted for nearly of all patent applications in up from in and in according to the office and the patent application backlog is critics of the existing system also note that many companies use continuations to delay introduction of a product monitor market developments and then modify their patents to take advantage of emerging trends on the flip side opponents of the new rules said the rules were unclear stifled innovation and would make it more expensive for small companies and individual inventors to patent their inventions glaxosmithkline which filed its suit against the patent and trade office and its director jon dudas in early october will now file a summary judgment motion asking the court to block the new rules permanently said john desmarais glaxosmithklines lawyer the patent and trade office will also file a summary judgment motion arguing against a permanent injunction and for the rules to be implemented he said the judge will then hear oral arguments and make a decision mr desmarais said the case will likely be argued early next year the battle over the new continuation rules comes as the senate readies to vote on a patent reform bill designed to curtail the power of patent holders among other things the bill would reduce damage awards for infringement limit venue choice in patent litigation and create a new way of challenging a patents validity after the patent has been approved
