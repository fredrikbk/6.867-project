thanks to rene jacobs don giovanni made new for many years i thought id never want to hear mozarts "don giovanni" again thats partly because i learned it more or less by heart more than years ago when i was years old but another problem paradoxically is that its such a good opera it offers eight strong and highly individual characters all brought to vivid life in mozarts music how often when the opera is performed do we get eight truly vivid singers i often feel id rather play the music in my memory and imagine how it ought to go and then the operas jokes get stale you might wonder why it has jokes at all since its story features the don juan of legend who seduces woman after woman one of his seductions goes off the rails and he kills the womans father whose statue later drags him down to hell so where are the jokes more or less everywhere because thanks to mozart the piece manages to be chilling heartfelt and at the same time funny but how funny are these jokes "listen i think i smell a woman " "oh my god what a sense of smell " that may have been a rouser back in but now can even hardcore opera people smart ones anyhow obediently titter when they hear these not so boffo lines thus my "don giovanni" problem but now theres a new recording conducted by the crazy genius rene jacobs on the harmonia mundi label and most of my doubts go out the window for one thing mr jacobs nails the operas meaning which for centuries has been much debated is don giovanni wicked or is he some kind of antihero a man whose appetite for life however stupidly indulged just wont quit mr jacobs in the recordings liner notes suggests another answer one that plays perfectly today don giovanni is a kid just years old irresponsible and wild all at once everything makes sense especially since mr jacobs found a singer johannes weisser a norwegian baritone who himself is in his s and embodies the role more truthfully in some ways than anyone ive heard sing it yes including all the greats mr weisser is quick impulsive sharp and endlessly seductive and he sings just beautifully too with for instance a hushed and smooth delivery of the famous serenade in the second act a tricky piece that has to sound relaxed and irresistible and for once does both those things the rest of the cast my "don giovanni" problem once again goes up and down but with the center of the opera so right theres always someone to care about and then theres mr jacobs who uses the instruments of mozarts time the edgy strings crashing kettledrums and the rest but with no claim that hes re creating the way they were played he uses them almost as his personal palette and the orchestral sounds he gets are sometimes off the charts arresting even startling often absolutely new when the singers catch the spirit the opera almost levitates and some passages the old mans death in the first scene to cite just one are so haunting that im ready to believe ive never truly heard the piece before mr jacobs also sometimes stops the music where no stop is indicated or else will suddenly slow down in ways that mozarts orchestras surely never could have because in the th century orchestras hardly ever rehearsed its as if everyone were saying "lets try something here " i dont know how well all this will hold up on repeated listening i wish the recording could somehow be alive so id hear new surprises each time through and already im tired of the recitatives long passages in which the singers sing lightly almost as if they were speaking and the only accompaniment written in the score is simple chords played by a piano and a cello mr jacobs who knows that mozart loved to improvise invites the pianist and the cellist to make up elaborate fantasias a terrific idea but it gets to be a little much but this recording mostly solves my "don giovanni" problem except for the stale jokes it makes the opera new mr sandow a composer is writing a book on the future of classical music
