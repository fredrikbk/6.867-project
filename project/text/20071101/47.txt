feds rate cut could be last for a while the federal reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point but with an eye on surging energy prices and other inflationary threats it strongly discouraged expectations of further cuts the decision following a half point cut six weeks ago shows fed chairman ben bernanke is grappling with risks on two fronts plunging home construction and eroding real estate values could hit the broader economy while rising oil and commodity prices combined with a falling dollar could spoil the feds hopes to contain inflation developments yesterday underlined the tension though data showed the u s economy growing at a faster than expected annual rate in the third quarter a purchasing managers survey showed weak manufacturing in the midwest in october the latest in a series of such reports at the same time crude oil futures prices jumped &# to &# a barrel a nominal record and gold futures settled at &# an ounce a year high for now though investors appear to believe neither of those scenarios will materialize stocks initially fell after the announcement dashed expectations of more rate cuts but then recovered with the dow jones industrial average climbing points or to less than points from its record the fed cut its target for the federal funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks to from after cutting it half a point in september the combined cuts were designed it said in the accompanying statement to "help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy" from the summer credit crunch that drove up interest rates paid by many homeowners corporations and banks growth was solid in the third quarter but likely to slow with the "intensification of the housing correction " the fed said in its statement core inflation which excludes food and energy has improved it said "but recent increases in energy and commodity prices among other factors may put renewed upward pressure on inflation " as a result the fed said "after this rate cut the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth " in the weeks leading up to the meeting fed officials saw their choice as no cut or a quarter point ease but their room to maneuver was limited by the fact that markets had become certain there would be a cut and by last week perhaps even a larger half point cut many on wall street justified their predictions on the grounds that fed officials hadnt publicly countered them fed officials dont like to do something just because the markets expect it but with futures markets assigning a probability yesterday morning to a cut a failure to deliver would have been the biggest surprise in the years for which comparable data is available according to bianco research llc a chicago financial research firm many predicted that would have led to a stock selloff and increased reluctance to lend alan blinder a former fed vice chairman who teaches at princeton university said "the fed did not make their views very clear to the markets for about a three week period in october when they could have as a result they wound up being pushed by the market the fed has a communications problem when the markets thinking diverges from the feds and the fed doesnt say anything to get back in line " but mr bernanke has been less inclined than his predecessor alan greenspan to try to steer market expectations and in any case officials also saw good economic reasons to ease borrowing conditions markets remain unsettled and the housing slump could yet spill over more broadly to consumer spending already weighed down by high energy costs by some estimates a funds rate is high relative to inflation and growth implying the fed was likely to ease eventually doing so now rather than later bought insurance against worst case scenarios there were hints the decision was a close call federal open market committee members voted to to cut the first time this year a vote hasnt been unanimous thomas hoenig president of the federal reserve bank of kansas city dissented preferring no cut just six of the reserve banks requested the parallel decrease in the discount rate charged on direct fed loans to banks to from that suggests presidents of some of the other banks also would have preferred to stand pat just five of the bank presidents have a vote on the fomc in any given year perhaps mirroring the differing views inside the fed outsiders criticized the decision from both sides some said the fed is underestimating the risks posed by the housing bust and credit crunch and will have to ease monetary policy again before long "the bursting of the housing bubble and strains in parts of the credit markets are profoundly deflationary events and the feds concerns seem out of place " bank credit analyst a financial research service said but others say the fed despite yesterdays promise to monitor inflation pressure risks stoking it "the fed has to walk the walk as well as talk the talk " said john ryding an economist at bear stearns "they have to should the numbers demand it be willing to reverse the rate cuts with gold up sharply and the dollar down the market is still questioning the feds commitment to do what it says " the expected inflation rate as implied by trading in inflation protected treasury bonds also rose yesterday though that may reflect short term trading dynamics despite the rhetoric the feds leadership probably isnt too worried about inflation officials believe the tendency of a lower dollar or higher energy prices to become embedded in underlying inflation has declined significantly in recent decades their principal source of inflation concern the low level of spare capacity in the economy has waned as the unemployment rate rises and the economy slows wage and benefit costs rose at a subdued rate in the third quarter the labor department said yesterday the economy is expected to slow sharply in the fourth quarter as high energy prices bite into consumer spending and housing construction tumbles further on the other hand the fed doesnt see the self reinforcing dynamics that lead to recession such as in when it had to cut rates repeatedly rather it sees the economy as sagging temporarily as the pool of potential homeowners shrinks to match the tightened terms of credit and the inventory of unsold new homes is worked down after which it expects growth will return to a normal rate
