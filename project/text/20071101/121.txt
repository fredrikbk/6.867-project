taking an emotional audit of rodeo drive we test shopper reception at boutiques on fabled strip contempt at yves st laurent the mission said dan hill a specialist in emotion was to shop on beverly hills rodeo drive for certain things one tends to find in a luxury shopping district "delight shame disappointment" and "self indulgence " i went along and found surprising delight at the jeweler chopard which stocks lollipops and coloring books to occupy the kids while parents gawk at million dollar diamond pendants we encountered shame at van cleef &amp arpels where the saleswomans frown and suspicious "can i help you " sent us scuttling out the door putting customers at ease is becoming much more important for the famously snooty luxury goods sector as more high end retailers broaden their offerings think prada legwarmers and dior sunglasses in order to reach a wider audience as they democratize many luxury companies are finding theres a fine line between positioning themselves as lofty to signal just the right amount of exclusivity and being so haughty they alienate their customers getting the balance right is all the more urgent this holiday season retailers are looking to the luxury category to help carry the season even as early signs point to a spending slowdown in october affluent u s consumers spending on luxury items fell to its lowest level since according to an index by unity marketing a stevens pa firm that tracks luxury purchases recently rodeo drive has been struggling with its own image as marc jacobs diane von furstenberg and other stores open on hipper melrose avenue rodeo drive retailers have been discussing ways to appear friendlier "rodeo sends messages that are not welcoming " says wes carroll the regional director of chopard louis vuitton has gone so far as to adorn its rodeo entrance with a cartoonish smiling apple figure i decided to gauge just how inviting rodeo drives stores are with the help of mr hill who is president of sensory logic a company based in minneapolis that helps businesses from target to toyota connect emotionally with patrons mr hill employs "facial coding " a technique of reading and using facial expressions to elicit the most profitable emotional response in a customer the premise is that feelings occur more quickly than thoughts and play a more effective role in purchasing decisions so businesses need to appeal to our emotions this is territory plumbed eons ago by madison avenues ad men but its been harder to put into practice in many retail stores if its the emotional rather than the rational part of our brains that makes many of our buying decisions thats particularly true when it comes to luxury certainly it was my emotional brain that bought a st john knits suit recently which my rational brain is now trying to justify yet just training sales clerks to say "may i help you " may not be terribly effective given mr hills argument that only of communication relies on verbal exchange the rest is store decor the facial expressions of sales associates and things our eyes and ears pick up subliminally thus on rodeo drive chicagos michigan avenue or londons bond street one of the key factors deciding whether you walk out with a new prada handbag may be the muscles at the corner of a sales clerks mouth the van cleef saleswoman sent us out the door with little more than her scowl she probably did some decoding of her own reading accurately that we werent her days big spenders we had dressed like professionals with an hour or so to shop with mr hill tie less in a dark business suit and me pairing a long tailored emanuel ungaro vest with dressy black wool pants yet its risky to make assumptions based on looks in los angeles where that guy in ratty jeans may be steven spielberg emmanuel perrin president and chief executive of van cleefs north american operations later told me that the saleswomans reaction was "exactly what we do not want to achieve " van cleefs second rule of customer service mr perrin said is "do not profile anyone who is walking in the store " his first rule "a customer should receive a warm and authentic welcome " he said we hadnt made it inside yves saint laurent before mr hill stopped struck by the mannequins in the windows "this is contemptuous " he announced pointing to the down stretched arms with hands flexed as though to ward off intruders contemptuousness in a store display actually can be a good thing in a high end shopping district mr hill explained "because it suggests superiority but if contempt is directed toward me by the clerk then its devastating " he continued pressing open the glass doors as we gawked a saleswoman sailed past one corner of her mouth slightly turned up two upturned mouth corners make a smile of course but a single upturned corner amounts to the way the homecoming queen regards the president of the math club according to mr hill who whispered "she just gave us a contempt expression " an yves saint laurent spokeswoman declined to comment mr hill became fixated by rodeo drive stores security guards who function as the equivalent of wal mart greeters opening the door for customers good ones seem to suggest youve just swept past the velvet rope at harry winston a guard commended us for noticing a light filled sculpture in the foyer "most people walk right past it " he said but the salespeople failed to catch his hand off when no one invited us to see diamonds i was left admiring the wood paneling with my hands behind my back feeling very look but dont touch a harry winston spokeswoman later apologized for our experience saying that sales associates attempt to be welcoming without being overbearing we slunk next door to dolce &amp gabanna where we were transfixed by a life size video of the design duos fall season runway show upstairs we wandered into the vip room where the doors are covered in mink and so are the chairs mr hill liked this a lot "downstairs its meet the goddesses and upstairs you are the goddess " he said chopard was overtly friendly we were ushered to a black granite espresso bar where we saw the cabinet with the lollipops coloring books savvy illustrated with chopard jewelry and even dog biscuits mr hill pronounced the coffee brilliant because the scent reaches the olfactory origin of the brain where memories are created it was coach though that stole the show for mr hill "the code word is accessible " he announced as he crossed coachs threshold into a bright cheery store he pronounced the pleasant sales staff "a breath of fresh air " extending his approval to "even the body types" not as intimidatingly model thin as the salespeople at other stores i must confess that coach reached my emotional brain as my rational brain grappled for control within minutes a saleswoman named lucienne had me in a pair of &# high heeled maxene boots when i didnt buy the boots lucienne deftly placed her card in my hand mr hill explained what had happened "she actually smiled at you the whole time at the other stores they smiled once because they knew they had to "
