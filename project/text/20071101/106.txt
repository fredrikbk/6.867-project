scenes from next week value of content distributed via net phone is big issue as writers strike looms as a possible strike by film and tv writers looms one of the most contentious points is how much writers should be paid when their work is distributed digitally for viewing on computers mobile phones and ipods theres a big problem resolving the issue though no one in hollywood has any idea how lucrative the digital marketplace will become the contract between film and tv producers and the writers guild of america was set to expire at midnight wednesday setting the stage for a strike that could be called at any time talks adjourned late last night without resolution a strike would have an almost immediate impact since many tv producers are expected to run out of completed scripts for their shows in the first few weeks a walkout would also throw a wrench in some expensive long planned movie productions the issue of compensation for digital distribution has helped bog down contract talks for months writers believe they got a bum deal years ago when they made an agreement covering their payments for works distributed on videocassette and later dvd that deal was made in the early days of the vcr when the full potential and multibillion dollar windfall of the medium wasnt well understood the dvd issue remains so contentious that the writers have so far insisted on revisiting it in the current negotiations a move that nick counter president of the studio alliance last night characterized as "a complete roadblock to any further progress " now the writers see hollywood charging hard at another new medium the internet digital distribution is growing fast with studios racing to start sites that throw tv episodes online quickly after they air or seeking creative ways to adapt their shows for mobile phone use consumers can also purchase downloaded movies over the internet via services like apple inc s itunes the current contract for writers pays them only if the viewer in turn pays to watch the show online extra content created expressly for the internet isnt covered under the contract with compensation for such digital use being worked out case by case but the many experiments only underscore the uncertainty of digital distributions future "were trying to create an economic model now for the various creative people to participate in but nobody knows what the business is " says steven katleman a partner at law firm greenberg traurig llps los angeles office where the clients include writers "nobody knows what its going to develop into when it matures " the networks are sinking millions of dollars into building up web distribution channels where they can stream advertising supported shows and movies free to users online but to date the revenue from these projects has been negligible largely because the web video audience is still small and online viewing habits are still in their earliest stages of development digital executives at the four major broadcast networks say revenue from itunes sales is small james mcquivey an analyst at forrester research estimates that itunes users downloaded million tv shows in the first half of compared with roughly a billion music downloads in the same period earlier this year the paucity of online tv show revenue made it easy for general electric co s nbc universal to announce it would be pulling its shows from apples itunes studios and networks are still figuring out the form digital distribution will take one big question revolves around whether the internet will become more like the dvd model with consumers buying content online to keep and watch when they choose or more like broadcast television with people watching ad supported programming online free the latest thinking has consumers watching more television online at no cost assuming online sales will explode the way dvd sales did is faulty logic some industry observers say "this content will not command a premium online that is not how the internet works " says eric garland chief executive of bigchampagne llc an online media measurement service while people consume more media in a world with high speed internet access and ever glitzier mobile phones they usually arent willing to pay much for it he says in part thats because so much offered online is available free if an advertising based model prevails as seems likely for television it is far from certain how lucrative that will be currently advertisers pay far less for the internet than they do for network television but that could change the internet offers advertisers the opportunity to target potential customers by age gender or interests in a way they cant do with television interested potential customers can click on links for more information conceivably advertising on the internet could result in more sales per ad viewed than television with distributors one day getting a piece of the sales right now advertising sales arent factored into the compensation writers get for programming streamed over the internet or on mobile phones for prime time network television they receive a flat fee covering the first two times an episode runs and extra fees known as residuals if the show goes into syndication or sells foreign rights for online or mobile phone distribution the writers guild wants compensation to be of the distributors gross revenue negotiating a deal would be much easier if distributors could estimate what percentage of their online or mobile phone viewers would be new to the show and what percentage would be regular viewers simply changing their viewing habits but again nobody knows internet viewing "may not equate to a gain " says mr katleman "it may be a shift " the distributors note that the internet currently plays more of a role in marketing than in generating revenue sometimes the first episode or two of a new show will pop up online a few weeks early to generate buzz this year for example fox made all its new shows available early on itunes last year time warner inc s hbo cable unit tried to get some viral traction by releasing the first episode of the musical comedy "flight of the conchords" on myspace and elsewhere on the web in most cases digital distribution services including network web sites and download to own sites like amazon com inc s unbox service offer episodes for view one day after they air on television so that people who missed the original broadcast or want to watch again can catch them for many shows networks are asking writers to churn out extra "promotional" content for marketing purposes online including short clips and extra scenes exclusively for web surfers these creations typically mini episodes that last a couple of minutes apiece have come to be known as "webisodes" or when they cater to mobile phone audiences "mobisodes " those emerging platforms are proving among the most contentious with the union trying to wrestle webisodes under their control last year ges nbc studios inc and universal network television llc landed in arbitration with the writers guild of america west inc over webisodes of "the office " the writers guild argued that asking a union member to oversee webisode creation violated the union contract nbc said it didnt in february a judge sided with nbc but in july in a separate case involving "the office" and other nbc shows the national labor relations board said the union was within its rights to encourage members not to work on webisodes so far webisodes mostly run on shows created and distributed by branches of the same corporate family thus walt disney co s abc studios makes "ugly betty" programming and accompanying webisodes for its abc network studios say webisode watchers are among the most loyal of a shows
