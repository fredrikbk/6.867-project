nasa head challenges air safety survey washington the head of the national aeronautics and space administration told the house committee on science and technology there "may be reason to question the validity" of a survey that found engine failures near collisions and other safety problems happened more often than government statistics say nasa administrator michael griffin questioned the survey which includes data that engine failures on commercial aircraft occurred four times more often than regulators said "it is not credible to believe" that the federal aviation administrations official engine performance data understate the problem to such an extent mr griffin said nasa will release the study after it has been scrubbed to protect the commercial flight industry the methodology behind the survey which included some pilots and was conducted over the telephone years ago also has been challenged by airline pilot union leaders
