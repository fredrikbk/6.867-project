electronics often contain toxins such as lead and mercury we tried to repair five broken electronic items sending them to their manufacturers for repair most of the items were out of warranty we learned that repairs are worth considering but deciding whether to repair or replace depends on the situation if you fix your own gadget you often delay the enjoyment of new technological advances such as the blu ray disc player which can record and play high definition video you also may not save any money since the cost of repairing compared with the cost of replacing can sometimes be about the same we saved money in two of our tests at least &# but part of our savings was because our devices were newer than we remembered one was still under warranty we also found that repairs arent always possible a motorola cellphone for example that we accidentally laundered was beyond hope according to a company customer service representative manufacturers web sites answered many questions about repairs and fees usually under the customer support section but we often had to call customer support representatives because we had trouble processing some of our online requests repairs are

working after it fell on the ground kodaks online support system informed us a &# repair fee would apply or we could trade our camera for a discount on a new camera from the kodak online store
