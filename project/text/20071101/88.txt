new gateway desktop takes on look of imac but cant match it if youve lusted after apples sleek one piece imac desktop computers but have no interest in switching to the mac youre in luck this holiday season two of the big windows pc makers gateway and dell will offer their own all in one desktops which like the imac are designed for style and pack an entire computer into a svelte body that looks like its merely a monitor both new contenders oddly are named "one " ive been testing the gateway one which can be preordered now at beautyofone com and is set for delivery this month it will also be available at best buy stores dells entry called the xps one will be unveiled later though dell is already teasing it on a page buried within its huge web site all in one desktops have been around for many years but they failed to win a big slice of the consumer market the imac has been a success however partly because it combines beauty and power it is speedy and can even optionally run windows another factor is that mainstream nontechie nongamer consumers are gradually turning away from clunky towers toward laptops and other smaller forms like the imac the gateway one is striking though the two products look very different while the latest imac has a brushed aluminum front with a black border around the screen the front of the one is all black clad in a seamless sheet of plastic the imac sits on an aluminum foot the ones bottom edge rests directly on the desktop supported by a small tilting metal stand in the rear i cant recommend the gateway over the imac however it offers smaller screens and lower resolution huge factors in an all in one machine for prices that can exceed the imacs it starts up and restarts more slowly unlike the apple it comes with annoying trial software it also is noisier than the imac and lacks a built in web camera plus twice during my few days of testing it crashed with a blue screen losing all open data the gateway one comes in three models priced at &# &# and &# unlike the imac which comes in two screen sizes inch and inch gateway is offering only one screen size across the entire line inch considered a middling dimension these days for a desktop best buy has an exclusive on the low end and high end models the midrange model will be sold directly by gateway all can be bought only with windows vista not windows xp shockingly for those who still cling to the notion that windows machines are always priced lower than comparable macs the entry level gateway one costs &# more than the entry level imac which is &# and the less expensive mac gives you more in several key areas a slightly larger screen with much higher resolution a faster processor and a better video system at the high end the &# gateway one has a much smaller screen than the comparably priced imac which sports a huge inch display with much better resolution for the same price the &# imac also has a faster processor all the imacs come with a better operating system and better bundled multimedia software apple also offers a built in camera while gateways is an ugly snap on gadget that ruins the lines of the design on my test model the camera never stayed on straight and the videos it made contained so much background noise as to be worthless this may have come from the ones fan which seemed to run a lot but the gateway offers some advantages at every price point it has more memory than the imac double the amount in the base model and triple in the &# model the one also has larger hard disks gigabytes in the base model compared with apples gigabytes and gigabytes in its top model compared with gigabytes on the same price imac the gateway also has a wireless keyboard and mouse which cost extra from apple plus built in slots for camera memory cards which apple doesnt offer on the high end model gateway throws in an external tv tuner something apple doesnt include gateway also boasts that unlike the imac its one model has only a single thick cord protruding from its rear this is partly due to the standard wireless keyboard and mouse but mostly its due to the fact that unlike on the imac the power supply isnt built in but is contained in a bulky heavy module meant to rest on the floor this power module contains the networking port and a few other ports meant for peripherals you dont plug in and out often the one started up faster than some other vista machines i tested but its still slow compared with even an older inch imac it scored very well on vistas built in performance rating garnering a but my high end imac set up to run vista scored a the gateway one may appeal to style conscious windows users but i think the imac remains the best consumer desktop on the market email me at mossberg wsj com find all my columns and videos online free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
