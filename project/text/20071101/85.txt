my nobel moment ive had a lot of fun recently with my tiny and unofficial slice of the nobel peace prize awarded to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc but though i was one of thousands of ipcc participants i dont think i will add " nobel laureate" to my resume the other half of the prize was awarded to former vice president al gore whose carbon footprint would stomp my neighborhood flat but thats another story both halves of the award honor promoting the message that earths temperature is rising due to human based emissions of greenhouse gases the nobel committee praises mr gore and the ipcc for alerting us to a potential catastrophe and for spurring us to a carbonless economy im sure the majority but not all of my ipcc colleagues cringe when i say this but i see neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see rather i see a reliance on climate models useful but never "proof" and the coincidence that changes in carbon dioxide and global temperatures have loose similarity over time there are some of us who remain so humbled by the task of measuring and understanding the extraordinarily complex climate system that we are skeptical of our ability to know what it is doing and why as we build climate data sets from scratch and look into the guts of the climate system however we dont find the alarmist theory matching observations the national oceanic and atmospheric administration satellite data we analyze at the university of alabama in huntsville does show modest warming around degrees fahrenheit per century if current warming trends of degrees per decade continue it is my turn to cringe when i hear overstated confidence from those who describe the projected evolution of global weather patterns over the next years especially when i consider how difficult it is to accurately predict that systems behavior over the next five days mother nature simply operates at a level of complexity that is at this point beyond the mastery of mere mortals such as scientists and the tools available to us as my high school physics teacher admonished us in those we shall conquer the world with a slide rule days "begin all of your scientific pronouncements with at our present level of ignorance we think we know " i havent seen that type of climate humility lately rather i see jump to conclusions advocates and unfortunately some scientists who see in every weather anomaly the specter of a global warming apocalypse explaining each successive phenomenon as a result of human action gives them comfort and an easy answer others of us scratch our heads and try to understand the real causes behind what we see we discount the possibility that everything is caused by human actions because everything weve seen the climate do has happened before sea levels rise and fall continually the arctic ice cap has shrunk before one millennium there are hippos swimming in the thames and a geological blink later there is an ice bridge linking asia and north america one of the challenges in studying global climate is keeping a global perspective especially when much of the research focuses on data gathered from spots around the globe often observations from one region get more attention than equally valid data from another the recent cnn report "planet in peril " for instance spent considerable time discussing shrinking arctic sea ice cover cnn did not note that winter sea ice around antarctica last month set a record maximum yes maximum for coverage since aerial measurements started then there is the challenge of translating global trends to local climate for instance hasnt global warming led to the five year drought and fires in the u s southwest not necessarily there has been a drought but it would be a stretch to link this drought to carbon dioxide if you look at the year climate record for the western u s you will see not five year but year long droughts the th and th centuries were particularly dry the inconvenient truth is that the last century has been fairly benign in the american west a return to the regions long term "normal" climate would present huge challenges for urban planners without a doubt atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing due primarily to carbon based energy production with its undisputed benefits to humanity and many people ardently believe we must "do something" about its alleged consequence global warming this might seem like a legitimate concern given the potential disasters that are announced almost daily so ive looked at a couple of ways in which humans might reduce co emissions and their impact on temperatures california and some northeastern states have decided to force their residents to buy cars that average miles per gallon within the next decade even if you applied this law to the entire world the net effect would reduce projected warming by about degrees fahrenheit by an amount so minuscule as to be undetectable global temperatures vary more than that from day to day suppose you are very serious about making a dent in carbon emissions and could replace about of the worlds energy sources with non co emitting nuclear power by roughly equivalent to halving u s emissions based on ipcc like projections the required new nuclear power plants would slow the warming by about degrees fahrenheit per century its a dent but what is the economic and human price and what is it worth given the scientific uncertainty my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short the uncertain impacts of global warming far in the future must be weighed against disasters at our doorsteps today bjorn lomborgs copenhagen consensus a cost benefit analysis of health issues by leading economists including three nobelists calculated that spending on health issues such as micronutrients for children hiv aids and water purification has benefits to times those of attempting to marginally limit "global warming " given the scientific uncertainty and our relative impotence regarding climate change the moral imperative here seems clear to me mr christy is director of the earth system science center at the university of alabama in huntsville and a participant in the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate
