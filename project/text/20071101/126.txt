the daily fix lebron iguodala endure defeats on lackluster opening nights online edition this wasnt the opening night lebron james had in mind the cleveland cavaliers unfurled their eastern conference championship banner last night and then got shredded by the dallas mavericks king james failed to score a single point in the first half something that had never happened in his four year career in the cleveland plain dealer terry pluto writes that "the cavs wore their retro orange uniforms from the middle s to blend into the halloween theme problem is they played like those of some years ago those teams lost far more than they won and had a massive forward named lonnie shelton who looked like the great pumpkin in those orange trunks wide enough for a family of five " it was a strange opener for the philadelphia ers andre iguodala as well the sixers were beaten by the toronto raptors but much of the drama for "the other a i " came on the sidelines mr iguodala and the sixers had until midnight to reach an agreement on a contract extension in the philadelphia inquirer phil sheridan describes mr iguodala sitting in the locker room after the game staring at a "stubbornly silent" cellphone "that the sixers unfinished business with iguodala hung over their opening night was neither sides fault " he writes "as a former first round pick going into his fourth season iguodala had until the final minute of october to agree to a long term contract extension once the clock crossed over to all saints day talks could not resume until next summer its a typical bit of nba collective bargaining wizardry a new deal wouldnt affect iguodalas current salary but it would guarantee him financial security and allow him to play this season knowing hes the cornerstone of this sixers team " now the two sides cant negotiate again until july when mr iguodala will be a restricted free agent in denver kevin durant scored points in his nba debut but shot just for and failed to contain the nuggets carmelo anthony who saw his team walk off with a win over the seattle supersonics the sonics are in for a tough year theyre expected to lose a lot of games and the teams new owners are trying to break their lease with seattle to relocate to oklahoma city "what are you supposed to do if youve grown up rooting for this team " the seattle timess steve kelley wondered yesterday "how are you supposed to cope with the possibility of losing a franchise you love " mr kelley acknowledged that many fans will be inclined to retreat instead of risking more heartbreak or to try and hit chairman clay bennett and his partners in the wallet but he argues thats "playing right into bennetts game plan a better idea to borrow lakers coach phil jacksons life philosophy is to live in the moment forget your fears about the future enjoy the season because none of us not even bennett knows if this is the final act in seattle or if there will be a new arena a new lease and a new hope in town " the new orleans hornets began their season by beating the sacramento kings behind strong performances by chris paul points assists and peja stojakovic points granted the kings were playing without mike bibby and ron artest but the hornets biggest challenge this year might not be the western conference but continuing to fill the seats in new orleans the hornets arrived from charlotte for the season were displaced by hurricane katrina and have played only nine home games in the last two years while being embraced by fans in oklahoma city now theyre trying to reconnect with a city some argue hadnt become home in the first place in the new york times jere longman runs down some of the hornets challenges "even before katrina new orleans was the smallest n b a market with a thin corporate base so far the hornets have sold season tickets short of the goal of and considerably below the sold last season in oklahoma city unless a cable dispute is resolved televised hornets games will be unavailable to residents on the north shore of lake pontchartrain limiting the teams contact with an affluent potential fan base as for national visibility while point guard chris paul is an emerging player the hornets cannot match the star power of saints players like reggie bush and drew brees " the latest battleground for the sports worlds sharks and jets the old school trust your eyes scouts and players turned executives vs the new breed of quantitative trust the numbers executives its houston the rockets daryl morey has earned brickbats from traditionalists since arriving in april first for existing and then for his role in the trade that sent rudy gay to the memphis grizzlies for shane battier but the houston gm has also earned kudos for the teams return to contention and his remaking it into an enviably deep squad so whats it like being the face of "moneyball" for the nba "hes working to hour weeks only taking an occasional break to attend his kids soccer games " jason friedman writes near the beginning of a long interesting profile in the houston press "hes here to usher in a new golden age and if his methods happen to raise a few eyebrows along the way so be it " the new england patriots are on a vengeful march through the rest of the nfl going for it on fourth downs no matter how little time remains and how many points theyre ahead on the scoreboard unless someone can stop the pats peyton manning a good chunk of a nation turns its lonely eyes to you decrying the team and coach bill belichick will soon be a full employment act for columnists and bloggers but the washington posts sally jenkins isnt afraid to stand with the evil empire "you can have the sentimental underdog ill take the dynasty or the empire every time " ms jenkins writes "theres an imperial marching quality to the way the patriots have trampled their nfl competition which i frankly appreciate this is a team that clearly wants to sweep the board own everything from egypt to babylon there are those who dont appreciate the patriots who find their dominance cold and unappealing this is merely weakness a common complaint from those whimperers and whiners who dont understand what dark beauty lies in dominion and the exercise of total power " ms jenkins gets off some good characterizations mr belichicks expression is "part lord sauron and part doctor no" though the fix must note both those supervillains dressed a lot better while qb tom brady "dimples as innocently as shirley temple " but then she gets to the heart of the matter "the discussion about whether the patriots are running up scores is really about competing ethics its about gamesmanship vs sportsmanship the gamesman is exclusively focused on winning rules are something to be maximally exploited and the final score is an expression of superiority the sportsman is more focused playing the game the way it ought to be played and is perhaps even willing to lose in the name of sportsmanship " whats wrong with sports illustrated and how can it be fixed on slate josh levin offers an angry unhappy survey of everything he thinks has gone wrong a critique that obviously comes from a longtime reader and frustrated fan of the magazine before moving on to a prescription for change the fix would start with si com which seems like an attempt to hide the magazines best material "despite all of its missteps si can still save itself " mr levin writes "there is no shortage of sports journalism these days but theres still a niche for a literate weekly sports magazine that doesnt talk down to its audience there are millions of si loyalists like me who want the magazine to succeed " tip of the fix cap to reader don hartline and to espn coms truehoop found a good column from the world of sports
