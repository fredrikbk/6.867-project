politics &amp economics madrid convictions dont end questions terror trial shows how difficult it is to snare leaders madrid a spanish courts sentencing yesterday of people for europes worst terrorist attack ended three years of police investigations in the wake of the madrid train bombings but left open the bigger questions of who planned the attack and why spanish high court justice javier gomez bermudez sentenced a group of homegrown islamic radicals and spanish explosives traffickers to thousands of years in prison for the attacks though spanish law limits a convicts time in prison to years but he acquitted an egyptian radical who prosecutors argued was the mastermind behind the attacks and who is in prison in italy the sentencings placed the blame squarely on islamic jihadists dispelling lingering theories that the basque terrorist group eta played a part in the bombings which killed people and injured more than the political repercussions led to the fall of the center right popular party which initially blamed eta for the bombings in national elections just three days after the attacks the sentencings also debunked other theories of police and government conspiracy that have poisoned spanish politics and divided the populace for the past three years but the courts inability to unravel exactly who ordered and planned the bombings despite months of testimony and hundreds of thousands of pages of evidence underscores the difficulty of fighting global terrorism in the courtroom in this case spanish intelligence and police work proved that many suspects belonged to al qaeda linked terrorist outfits like the moroccan islamic combat group or gicm but couldnt prove the suspects connection to the train bombings the court ended up convicting low level operatives without nabbing the brains behind the operation evidentiary standards in courtrooms are clashing with cloak and dagger antiterrorist operations and are making it hard for gains in one area to translate into gains in the other for example spanish and german prosecutors have long complained that u s reluctance to provide sensitive evidence gathered by intelligence services against terror suspects like sept conspirator ramzi binalshibh have undermined terror trials in their countries "convictions in counterrorism cases are difficult because much of the evidence is secret " says sven leistikow a german lawyer who represents victims families "and the evidence that remains is often too weak for a conviction " while prosecutors in europe have won some important victories in terrorism trials fighting terrorism in the courtroom often leaves law enforcement officials primarily battling just the front line foot soldiers rather than jihadi leaders one of al qaedas leading planners syrian mustafa setmarian was wanted for years by spain and other european police forces but he was captured by military forces in pakistan in and never extradited to spain striking the right balance is increasingly urgent as the threat of further islamist terrorism rises spanish intelligence officials and police said this year that the country is at greater risk of a terrorist attack than it was in march spain despite pulling its troops out of iraq in april has repeatedly been threatened with further attacks by al qaeda linked groups most recently this spring in a video message by al qaeda no ayman al zawahiri yesterdays sentencings which must be ratified by the spanish supreme court gave other alleged ringleaders relatively light sentences and acquitted seven of the people on trial sparking criticism from victims groups "the sentence seems very soft and we will appeal it " said pilar manjon the president of the march victims association and a leading spokeswoman for victims of the bombing many of whom are still receiving medical and psychiatric treatment under spanish law both sides of a trial may appeal the sentence david crawford in berlin contributed to this article
