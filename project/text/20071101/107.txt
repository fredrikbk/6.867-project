politics &amp economics immigration burns candidates republicans and democrats alike approach issue with care washington an uproar over new york gov eliot spitzers plan to issue drivers licenses to illegal immigrants and new york sen hillary clintons seeming endorsement of it shows how perilous the issue is for the presidential candidates democrats arent alone in their difficulty with the issue either republican candidates rudy giuliani and mitt romney have adopted tough enforcement platforms after being criticized for their former immigrant friendly policies arizona sen john mccains standing slid with his partys base for his support of an immigration overhaul many saw as amnesty he too now favors strong enforcement mr spitzer has been forced to jettison the drivers license plan and mrs clinton appeared to edge away from her support during a democratic debate tuesday even though many policy experts say granting licenses would improve road safety and give police a new crime fighting tool providing illegal immigrants with a drivers license wouldnt qualify them for public benefits jobs or legal residency but it enrages immigration opponents who see it as the government making life easier for lawbreakers says steve camarota of the center for immigration studies which argues for reduced immigration "its the sense that the government is violating the law " he says the furious opposition to the idea that might be sound public policy suggests why the democrats have been largely quiet on immigration overhaul so far in the campaign and why the republicans have generally focused on promises to toughen enforcement of immigration laws mrs clinton and former north carolina sen john edwards dont even mention immigration on the issues pages of their campaign web sites in the tuesday debate connecticut sen christopher dodd opposed a drivers license plan even though he voted for a bill that would have allowed most of the nations million illegal immigrants to earn legal residency "a license is a privilege " mr dodd said during the debate the drivers license issue has bubbled in state legislatures for years generally heating up with the debate over illegal immigration the issue came to a boil in when new york and california moved to change their licensing laws california legislators twice passed a law that would have allowed illegal immigrants to get licenses only to be forced to repeal it once and to see gov arnold schwarzenegger veto it the second time mr spitzers republican predecessor george pataki set up administrative barriers that immigrant rights groups said would prevent about illegal immigrants from renewing their licenses mr spitzer had planned to remove those barriers and to join other states that now dont require applicants to prove their legal status supporters argue that licensing illegal immigrants would improve road safety by subjecting millions of currently unlicensed drivers to road tests making them abide by laws that require drivers to buy liability insurance and including them in police databases millions of americans flash a drivers license to get on an airplane purchase a handgun open a bank account cash checks or otherwise prove their identity in most cases a passport credit card and even a rent bill are just as acceptable says tyler moran who follows licensing laws for the national immigration law center an advocacy group but a license has become "a de facto id card it makes things easier " which is why its highly sought says the center for immigration studies mr camarota a license also "embeds" illegal immigrants in their communities which is what riles many immigrant opponents he adds "they get a license a job a car insurance it makes legalization a fait accompli " he says that view makes for a potent political issue even though polls show a majority of voters are in favor of allowing illegal immigrants to earn legal status the bipartisan bills that mr mccain and others pushed in the senate in and again this summer would have provided a path to legal status republican opposition killed it both times and it isnt likely to come up again for years last month supporters tried to break out and pass one of the bills most popular provisions but it too was rejected known as the dream act it would have given legal status to the children of illegal immigrants after they completed two years of college or military service mr mccain who voted on an unrelated bill minutes earlier didnt stay around for the dream act balloting the presidential candidates facing a small but noisy opposition have generally shied away from talking about any legalization during the campaign mr giuliani has received flak from his republican rivals over a sanctuary policy that barred new york agencies from turning in suspected illegal immigrants when he was mayor he now says he would build a high tech fence along the u s mexico border and issue tamper proof id cards to citizens "politicians are afraid of groups that care deeply and people who care the most about immigration are against it " says david redlawsk a university of iowa political science professor
