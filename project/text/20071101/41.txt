fiscally fit a christmas wii sh thoughts of christmas are taking the fun out of halloween for the cullen family online edition october is usually my favorite month of the year the back to school frenzy is over the trees are erupting with color pumpkin pie is back on the shelves football season is in full swing and local farms are gearing up for the harvest in the weeks leading up to halloween my husband gerry our year old son gerald and i typically spend our weekends at farms picking apples and pumpkins enjoying fresh apple cider racing each other through cornfield mazes and taking "haunted hayrides " having never done these things as kids gerry and i get as big a kick out of such activities as gerald does i grew up in the city about as far away from a farm as it gets so trick or treating was the extent of our fall festivities and gerrys parents grew up in farm country in ireland so they didnt see the point in paying to visit one but this year it seems like gerry and i are the only ones getting a kick out of the fall revelry for the past few weeks geralds been too preoccupied with another holiday to care very much about halloween or autumn festivities hes too busy looking ahead to christmas i know gerald will thoroughly enjoy himself tonight when he goes out trick or treating with his friends but the joy he used to have in farm visits and pumpkin carving and all the things that scream happy childhood memories to gerry and me seems absent this year and i blame the marketing juggernaut that christmas has become it started last month when one of geralds friends got a nintendo wii as a birthday present since then the neighborhood boys have been spending all their free time at this boys house and all of them want a wii for christmas gerald already has a sony playstation "but wii is way cooler " he says gerry was also captivated by the wii and after seeing the kids play it he mulled over where we might put the console so thered be enough space to play the games other parents in the neighborhood also have wii on the brain for the last week theres been a "wii watch" among the neighborhood boys moms to give each other the heads up about when the next supply of consoles is expected to hit the local toy store the wiis not cheap new game systems retail for &# and sell for much more at some online retailers and that doesnt include the card for storing games and various extra remote controls needed to play certain games at least another &# the games themselves meanwhile are about &# each its not just the wii on geralds christmas wish list recently he began seeing relentless commercials for sonys "star wars battlefront" hand held game console it costs around &# not including &# for the travel case and &# for another game ive stopped counting the number of times geralds excitedly dragged me into the family room to show me the "battlefront" ad and tell me he wants the game for christmas i used to think nickelodeon was peppered with ads for sugary foods and drinks now it seems like ads for games toys and electronics rule the roost and in the last two weeks weve been bombarded with no less than toy and gadget catalogs many of which gerald excitedly pored over in search of more wish list fodder last night i got home from work expecting to find gerry and gerald carving the halloween pumpkin something gerald was excited about when pumpkin carving kits hit the shelves in mid september but what i found depressed me our son was at the kitchen counter diligently writing another letter to santa the jurys still out as to whether he still believes in the old guy or is just trying to make sure we know exactly what he wants gerry said hed asked gerald if he wanted to carve the pumpkin right after school but he was busy playing with his friends then by dinner time gerald said he was tired from so much football and not interested in pumpkin carving no doubt there are some parents who like to shop early for the holidays and welcome the tv ads and catalogs though surely not the holiday songs on the radio ive heard two already but shopping early and often only encourages retailers to get even more aggressive in starting the holiday marketing "season" earlier and earlier looking forward i plan to do a better job of shielding gerald from holiday ads by turning off the tv and encouraging him to play or keeping him from seeing the ads by letting him watch his favorite movies instead the "star wars" series what else even the ones with jar jar meanwhile the preseason holiday catalogs will be tossed before we get into the house i cant stop his friend from getting the coolest christmas gift three months early for his birthday but next year ill invite his friends to come along on our family farm trips in hopes that a group experience will rekindle the thrill for gerald and this year ill write my own letter to santa but ill have only one request retailers save the beginning of your holiday marketing blitz for the day after thanksgiving so our son can stop fixating on his christmas bounty and enjoy fall festivities as much as his parents do how do you keep your kids from being influenced by holiday ads for toys
