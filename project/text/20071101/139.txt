will lilly trial data cause more bloodletting on stock the decision by eli lilly &amp co to suspend trials of an experimental drug sent the companys stock down one day last week but data due for release at a heart meeting this weekend could either make the shares a classic buying opportunity or cause more bloodletting on wall street lilly is banking on prasugrel a potent blood thinner for heart patients to prop up the company as patents on some big sellers expire between now and by then a hit with prasugrel could bring lilly as much as &# billion a year or so some on wall street thought before the indianapolis pharmaceuticals concern suspended two small studies last week because of unspecified issues involving dosage amounts in some patients even if the food and drug administration approves the drug analysts worry that prasugrel wont sell as well if doctors need to do any tinkering with the dose that concern in part prompted steve scala a drug industry analyst at cowen &amp co to cut his estimate for prasugrels sales from &# billion to &# million he estimates that each &# million in sales is valued at five cents a share for the companys stock still investors are now wondering whether broader safety concerns emerged as investigators tallied data from a large late stage study the confidential results of which will be presented to doctors on sunday which patients might require dosing adjustments is particularly important for prasugrels prospects since the blockbuster it aims to challenge bristol myers squibb co and sanofi aventis sas plavix is relatively safe even for extremely ill patients and doesnt require doctors to tune down the dose investors lopped about &# off the stock on news of the trial suspension this past thursday to &# from &# yesterday in p m new york stock exchange composite trading lillys shares closed at &# up cents the shares trade at about times estimated per share earnings for slightly cheaper than its u s peers according to banc of america securities jami rubin a drug industry analyst at morgan stanley thinks lilly should be trading even lower at &# a share in part because the new concerns about prasugrel make a home run with the drug unlikely she estimates the share price will drop to &# if prasugrel never makes it to market a likelihood she handicaps now at ms rubin downgraded lilly stock last week to "underweight " morgan stanley owns or more of lilly stock and has investment banking relationships with the drug maker others dont see such a significant downside "its highly unlikely that last weeks information could be construed as a positive outcome for this study " said kris jenner a portfolio manager for the t rowe price health sciences fund which owns about lilly shares valued at about &# million as of sept but some of the skepticism already was starting to be built into the current price and investors didnt completely write off prasugrel "thats why the stock dropped but not precipitously " prasugrel is far from lillys only problem most investors are aware that lilly will lose market exclusivity in on schizophrenia drug zyprexa which accounts for some of its annual revenue after that a string of drugs that account for at least a third of sales will lose patent protection in quick succession "even if prasugrel data is positive its not enough to replace those losses " ms rubin says lilly which has a market value of about &# billion says its decision to stall the pair of studies shouldnt be used to interpret the outcome of the larger prasugrel trial called triton after all triton is so big with patients followed for as long as months that major safety concerns should have materialized before the last patient was processed in july yet the fact that the company took some data from triton into account in deciding to suspend the smaller tests opened the door to concerns that more bad news could surface prasugrel like plavix comes with a benefit risk trade off such drugs are meant to prevent blood fragments from forming life threatening clots the better the drug does this the more risk it carries of thinning the blood too much and causing anything from brain hemorrhages to surgical risks prasugrel which lilly is developing with daiichi sankyo co of japan is thought to be stronger than plavix in preventing so called platelet aggregation now investors are waiting for the data to see if that translates into helping patients prevent heart attacks stroke and potentially death compared with plavix the concern that has overshadowed prasugrel and was heightened by lillys vague statement about dose adjustments last week was whether the drugs greater potency will cause such serious extra bleeding in patients that it negates the upside doctors and investors are trying to figure out which patients could require a different prasugrel dose "when lilly said dosing issues and subgroups the first two i thought of were the elderly or those with decreased kidney function " says steven steinhubl a cardiologist at the university of kentucky who participated in one of the suspended trials he isnt privy to the final triton data prasugrel is broken down by the kidneys and excreted mostly through urine making patients with impaired kidneys as much as of the u s adult population the group that is attracting the most attention these patients already tend to come with a higher risk for bleeding and the inability of their kidneys to clear the drug quickly could leave more of the medicine than necessary in their bloodstream elderly patients and women also could be at higher risk of bleeding in general because lower body weight makes a drug like prasugrel relatively more potent and doctors will be watching how well the drug performs in patients with drug eluting stents metal scaffolds that prop open diseased arteries and which have raised concerns for promoting clotting in a duke university registry of heart patients with similar characteristics to those being studied on prasugrel suffered from moderate to severe chronic kidney disease the triton studys design doesnt appear to break out how many patients have weak kidneys but does say that are women had diabetes and are older than
