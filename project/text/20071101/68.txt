how netlog leaps language barriers diversity challenges belgian social networking web site ghent belgium from a loft like office in this medieval town a start up called netlog nv has built one of europes largest social networking web sites on a shoestring budget by relying on some clever technology and a ready supply of foreign students at a nearby university netlog has become a veritable tower of babel it counts million members and has versions in different languages including french german and italian as well less common tongues like romanian and norwegian polish and russian versions are nearly finished and another dozen languages including catalan estonian and arabic are on the way that is a notable achievement because outside of north america many internet start ups are hemmed in by linguistic barriers that limit their ability to attract users and generate revenue the european market for example is theoretically huge with a population of million and million internet users but europeans speak more than a dozen languages and many countries have only fledgling online ad markets the fragmented landscape means that europes internet start ups cant focus just on their domestic markets if they are to succeed "we have global ambitions but only limited resources " said lorenz bogaert who founded netlog with his partner toon coppens in "so we have to design the right tools " by contrast u s internet firms usually focus first on the massive english speaking domestic market of some million residents international expansion usually comes later news corp s myspace and facebook the biggest u s social networking web sites still have about two thirds of their users in north america but myspace has been on an aggressive international expansion in the past months and has launched in languages and countries including japan china france and germany facebook has said it will hire more staff overseas over the next year "the reality is that european start ups have to extend beyond their comfort zones and globalize much sooner than u s ones " said neil rimer of index ventures which invested million euros &# million in netlog in april "its a totally different mind set " index ventures based in geneva is one of europes leading venture capital firms having backed internet calling service skype and tv firm joost users of netlog are typically years old and use the site to post profiles meet people and share photos and videos the challenge that all social networking sites including netlog face is how to monetize user traffic by selling online ads giants like myspace have large staffs to sell ads and work on cross border marketing deals with everyone from hollywood studios to sneaker companies myspace for example has people managing its french language site plus people in europe just to sell ads netlogs resources are skimpy by comparison netlog has no sales staff yet and many countries where it has launched remain undeveloped online ad markets its person staff manages everything including the different languages "the most difficult thing about being in europe is that the online ad market is very fragmented " acknowledges netlogs mr bogaert netlog doesnt disclose its revenues one way netlog keeps costs down is a novel tool the software developers came up with to make the site easy to translate while writing the code that underpins the site they labeled each word that would appear as text with a tag all the tagged words such as the headings of the fields in peoples profiles like "age" or "location" are then automatically fed into the companys internal translation system the system allows the core of the site to be language independent when netlog wants to launch in a new language it just hires freelancers usually foreign students at ghent university to translate the words not the underlying computer code compare that with what myspace had to do when it wanted to launch in non western languages like japanese and russian the site had to rewrite the code of its entire web site a herculean task that took myspaces developers six months "it was pretty controversial internally " said travis katz myspaces managing director for international "but we thought this was the right thing to do international growth is the key to our future " turkey is an example of how quickly netlog can move in july mr bogaert decided to launch a turkish version after noticing that turkish immigrants living in germany were congregating on the german site he found two turkish exchange students to translate the site four months later the site has million users mr bogaert estimates that it cost about euros to launch "we never thought it would take off this fast " he said growing so quickly into such diverse places can pose cultural challenges however netlog came up with another low cost solution again drawing on foreign students netlog hired melike tugba yener a year old turkish student studying finance at the university to be the "community manager" for the turkish site she answers queries from users in their native tongue polices the site for illegal or inflammatory content such as posts of flags from groups calling for an independent state for the kurds "people sometimes start to fight on the site " said ms yener citing debates over the place of islam in turkish society and the kurdish question "usually i email them and tell them this isnt a place to talk politics but to hang out with friends "
