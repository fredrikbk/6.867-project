an ambitious celebration of japanese horticultural skill kiku the art of the japanese chrysanthemum new york botanical garden through nov www nygb org bronx n y i must admit ive never been a big fan of chrysanthemums and every september when they begin to appear in droves the garden snob in me is unleashed however a few years ago i was in kyoto in early october and saw on many a street corner curiously elaborate displays of chrysanthemums arranged in what i can only describe as huge wire ice cream cones they had undoubtedly taken an inordinate amount of time and skill to produce and despite my prejudice i was intrigued at the time i had no idea that in japan the chrysanthemum or kiku is the crest of the imperial family and that these arrangements are part of an ancient floral tradition that is at least years old something i found out when i visited the new york botanical garden nybg to see its magnificent new exhibition "kiku the art of the japanese chrysanthemum " first of all put aside any preconceptions you may have about those ubiquitous mums stacked outside your local supermarket the kiku display at nybg is as different from them as chalk is from cheese this exhibition has been in the making for nearly five years and is the result of a true collaboration between nybg and the shinjuku gyoen national garden in tokyo formerly the private garden of the imperial family and now a public one for almost a hundred years shinjuku gyoen has presented an annual fall chrysanthemum exhibition and their seven styles of floral kiku arrangements are considered the best of the best when plans for this exhibition got under way in yasushira iwashita the kiku master at shinjuku graciously agreed to take on yukie kurashina a japanese born graduate of the botanical gardens school of horticulture as his apprentice she trained with him in for six months learning all about the complex cultivation techniques needed to create kiku arrangements and has returned to japan eight more times since then in having selected three of these styles each of which requires a different kind of chrysanthemum variety and an entirely different cultivation technique ms kurashina and her colleagues at nybg began the intricate task of growing and training the flowers from tiny cuttings in order to master every detail affecting their growth and bloom the culmination of their work can now be seen in this dazzling not to be missed exhibition that occupies the three courtyards of the enid a haupt conservatory the kiku displays are housed in four uwaya bamboo roofed garden pavilions which have been exactingly copied down to the last detail from those at shinjuku gyoen each pavilion is curtained in traditional purple silk drapery with orange tassels the bamboo roofing is held together with black twine knotted according to precise instructions also learned from japan to the western eye the elaborate swags of purple silk may seem a trifle formal but then one remembers that historically these pavilions were intended to provide a ceremonial backdrop for these astonishingly elaborate kengai ogiku and ozukuri arrangements and elaborate and dramatic they are kengai are formal cascades of brilliantly colored tiny chrysanthemum blossoms that have been trained to grow in a series of small stems by being pinched and tied down repeatedly over a diagonal wire underpinning the result resembles a waterfall or as someone near me described it "an opulent drooping bridal bouquet " ogiku are huge luscious upright single blossomed chrysanthemums in delicate pastel shades of pink lilac yellow and white they are displayed in perfect diagonal rows and i mean perfect with not one centimeter out of place and are intended to bring to mind the braided effect of the bridle of the emperors horse but most astonishing of all is ozukuri a far more sophisticated rendering of the arrangements i saw on the streets of kyoto here a single chrysanthemum plant has been trimmed back to five main branches and these are trained to produce hundreds of simultaneous blossoms each of which is strung through an individual wire holder that is part of a massive dome shaped wired armature the cultivation and training of one plant takes at least months and the plant sits in a beautiful oval wood container copied exactly from those at shinjuku the final effect is stunning and to anyone who has ever tried his or her hand at training any kind of a plant quite miraculous be sure to bend down and see the amazing evidence of the single stem for yourself its hard to believe but the exhibition does not end here to help transform the central "western" courtyard leading to the main exhibition into a more suitable venue an amazing foot high bamboo sculpture created by tetsunori kawana greets visitors as they enter from the enid haupt conservatory made of interlocking poles and stalks from a variety of green bamboo it is an amazingly intricate and beautiful piece of outdoor art temporary alas and the making of it took six days volunteer assistants and pieces of foot long freshly cut bamboo harvested and transported from savannah ga flanked on four sides by four huge foot high bamboo stems their ends dramatically split and floating in the breeze the hornbeam bordered formal boxwood courtyard has been magically transformed into a suitable entranceway for a display of japanese horticulture move into the larger courtyard on the right and you will see two very beautiful outdoor chrysanthemum landscapes one representing autumn the other the snows of winter the work of landscape artist marc peter keane both are sensitively placed between groupings of rock boulders he found on the grounds of nybg this show is an ambitious celebration of the culture skill and tradition of japanese horticulture and should be seen by anyone curious to learn more about gardening and flower arranging traditions other than our own for the few weeks the east has come to the bronx and the humble chrysanthemum is no more ms garmey writes about gardens and gardening for the journal
