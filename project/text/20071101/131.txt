impact on consumers for wall street however it seems likely that more pain is to come with its quarter percentage point snip of the federal funds rate to the federal open market committee sent a clear signal to investors that they shouldnt hang on their edge of their respective seats for further such cuts "todays action combined with the policy action taken in september should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time " the fed stated the announcement came hours after the commerce department said the u s economy likely grew a healthy in the third quarter although the wall street journal points out that this was offset by a purchasing managers survey showing weak manufacturing in the midwest in october aside from navigating the tension between upside and downside economic risks though fed officials "knew they were under very heavy pressure from financial markets had the central bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged the stock markets would most likely have plunged into a panic " the new york times writes indeed alan blinder a former fed vice chairman now teaching at princeton told the journal "the fed did not make their views very clear to the markets for about a three week period in october when they could have as a result they wound up being pushed " the financial times suggests that officials recognized their mistake and were trying not to repeat it when the fed "engaged in one of its most overt attempts since ben bernanke took over as chairman to manage market expectations when it warned investors against counting on future interest rate cuts " in other hints that the feds decision wasnt an easy one members voted to to cut the first time this year a vote hasnt been unanimous as the journal notes thomas hoenig president of the kansas city fed voted in favor of holding rates steady furthermore only half of the regional reserve banks requested the parallel decrease in the discount rate to from which because just five of the bank presidents have a vote on the committee at a time suggests some of the other bank presidents also had doubts about a rate cut the journal says "i think the fed wants to disabuse the market of the notion that its going to cut at every meeting for the foreseeable future " paul kasriel chief economist of northern trust in chicago told the kansas city star "its interesting that there was a dissent from your own guy who in prior cycles has been more prescient than other fed members " but markets arent yet home free whether or not mr hoenigs thinking is a signpost a keen observer making his or her way down wall street these days could probably ferret out a few red flags a

instruments the ft says until recently the part of the index that tracks aaa debt was trading almost at face value but in the past three weeks it has fallen sharply with the so called abx index tracking aaa mortgage bonds originated in the first half of this year falling to a record low tuesday meaning that traders reckon these bonds are worth only cents on the dollar "the swing could create

different pressure points down every path " the times writes "they cannot allow investors to lose money which would damage their reputations they want to avoid a fire sale which would result in large write downs that could accelerate the unraveling of these special investment vehicles but they also want to avoid bringing the loans onto their balance sheets " buy the rumor buy the fact buy google
