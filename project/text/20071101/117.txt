still more masterpieces the prado expands madrid there is no old europe older than spain but since the mid s the newest word in the spanish vocabulary has been renewal its long dormant economy has come back to life its famed ancient cuisine and wines have caught the attention of a new generation of innovative chefs and winemakers time was that spain was a country americans flew over on their way to marinate in the culture of italy or france no more for a younger generation of american travelers barcelona and madrid have become the cities they parachute into before paris rome or venice now this same enlivening spirit has descended on an institution that holds some of spains most hallowed traditions the prado if it is possible to say that one could overdose on masterpieces of painting the prado has been the palace of aesthetic addiction across the past two centuries velazquez zurbaran murillo el greco goya ribera those are just the locals and on to rubens titian tintoretto raphael caravaggio bosch the brueghels van dyck durer the prados problem however is that it had too much of a good thing let me explain on a visit to madrid in may i had three free afternoon hours and there is no better way anywhere to pass minutes than a random walk through the prados galleries taking a break after absorbing four astounding rubens works i ducked into a deserted stairwell to squeeze off a forbidden cellphone call and while i was chatting my eyes rose to see the stairway wall hung with two large riberas paintings of such technical and emotional virtuosity that in almost any other museum they would be inside one of the main galleries here they were in a stairwell this past monday the prado put an end to grand art as sardines monday marked the official opening of the prados new exhibition space a handsome adjacent building designed by the renowned spanish architect rafael moneo in an interview days before the opening the prados director miguel zugaza acknowledged that the museum was only now joining the museum worlds favorite game of adding new architectural acreage in this he found a benefit "the fact that the prado has arrived rather late can be considered a competitive advantage because we were able to learn from the success of others and not repeat their mistakes " he continued "first of all we have not fallen victim to the trend of creating signature buildings which compete with the institution itself " precisely museums elsewhere have undertaken expensive building campaigns in part on the expectation that the building itself and the reputation of its architect would revive the institution the art often seems almost a second level concern to the new glamoreum the prado by comparison is one of the few museums with a collection that deserves the extra space the prado has some works of art in its possession but until now it had only enough space to show objects to the more than two million visitors who come annually a show of tintorettos from the prado and elsewhere this spring produced lines of hundreds of people standing with the traffic and street performers on the avenida del prado unlike those of other institutions often in the u s whose basements serve as crypts for second rate art unloaded on the museum by patrons for the aesthetic pleasures of tax avoidance the prados unseen collection is important and worth seeing "the prados collections were not created by art historians " mr zugaza notes "rather it was the patronage of the kings of spain who invited the most prestigious artists of their time titian rubens velazquez and goya to work for them that is what has shaped the collections " in the future says mr zugaza the prado will be able to show more of its netherlandish and hispano flemish paintings more work from the italian and spanish baroque "and for the first time we will be able to show our th century collections from goya to sorolla " the prados space increases by more than the inaugural exhibition in the new moneo wing "the th century in the prado" through april reflects both the seen and unseen benefits of the prados additional resources up to now much of the museums art was packed in tight stacks in the basement making curatorial work difficult parts of the new wing will be reserved for research what mr zugaza calls "the curatorial agenda of the museum " forthcoming shows will be built around vel&amp aacute zquez in november el greco in december and goya next april the "th century" exhibition displays not only some of the prados finest works by superstars such as ribera and goya showing for the first time a recent acquisition a small goya drawing of a bull lifted into flight by a pair of butterfly wings but also painters less well known to the public beyond spain one stops and stares under the gaze of several large portraits by jose de madrazo from vincente lopez there is a moving portrait of goya himself from federico de madrazo the madrazo clan which also includes raimundo was genetically mapped to produce great art for years there is a painting of the countess of vilches her mouth formed into an insouciant inviting half smile the goya prints filling one room have been rehung in sleek new wood frames designed by mr moneo one of the most striking aspects of the exhibition is the determined realism of the spanish painters late into the th century while their fellows in france discovered beauty in smudged or squibbed evocations of flowers hillsides or tahitian girls eugenio lucas was painting a woman aboard a donkey on her way to death in "condemned by the inquisition " jose jimenez aranda in offered a kneeling nude girl with a sign around her neck "a slave for sale " the shows signature work is by antonio gisbert "the execution of torrijos and his companions " from this almost life size work depicts a group of liberals bound together holding hands and awaiting execution amid friends already shot it is hard to look away from their faces as the world headed for the endless realism of the th century these spanish artists werent offering the distractions of a stroll in the garden there is a school of thought in the spanish press that the prado "played it safe" with rafael moneos design for the new exhibition wing whose straight lines and reddish orange brick facade is a modernized mirror image of the neoclassical main building by juan de villanueva perhaps the native critics have gotten too used to living with the prados overwhelming magnificence down the street the impression i took away from the quiet moneo design its "th century" show and director zugazas thoughts on the new era seemed less a reflection of complacency and more like justifiable self confidence "one way of being radically modern " says mr zugaza "is to value the past " if ones past consists of paintings such as those at the prado this statement makes simple sense this of all world museums has no need to ask an architect to rediscover its relevance while the prado is largely supported by the spanish state some of its budget comes from admissions and an effort is under way to attract corporate support the museum has recently received about million euros just over &# million each from the spanish companies telefonica bbva axa winterthur and acciona at a reception monday for some invited vips from the art worlds of europe and north and south america an eerily calm mr zugaza pulled a visiting journalist aside to talk enthusiastically about the smooth texture of a bright red stucco wall in the moneo entranceway the huge mottled red wall is in fact already a point of contention among the contentious spaniards either loved or derided days later touring the magnificent "durer and cranach" show at the nearby museo thyssen bornemisza i noticed that the red background to albrecht durers "portrait of a young man " from the early s was exactly the color and texture of the stucco entrance wall in the prados moneo wing suddenly the paradoxical notion of making the past "radically modern" at the prado began to make sense mr henninger is deputy editor of the journals editorial page and writes the wonder land
