pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink theyre not martinis the most common complaint i hear about the offerings on the current cocktail scene concerns the epidemic of "martinis" that arent martinis for the purists its bad enough that a drink of vodka and vermouth is referred to as a martini but one doesnt have to be a stickler to bemoan the candy colored cocktails with labels like "raspberry martini" or "apple tini" that fill out the "martini list" at innumerable bars and restaurants a drink of vodka sweet liqueur and fruit juice is not a martini some linguists might contradict that assertion it has after all become common usage to refer to any drink in a stemmed cocktail glass a "martini glass" as a "martini " and usage is usage the compilers of dictionaries struggle endlessly with the descriptive prescriptive question do they document the way language is actually used or do they present language as it should be used the prescriptivists are usually engaged in a fighting retreat even dear old fowlers succumbs to new editions every now and then though the transformed meaning of "martini" may be regrettable it is an evolution no more dramatic than that which altered the word "cocktail" itself when the cocktail first turned up a little over years ago it wasnt a category of drink but a specific quaff liquor sugar water and bitters one could have a brandy cocktail a whiskey cocktail or another variation based on the spirit used but that was the full extent of the words elasticity it wasnt until after the civil war that the term "cocktail" started to be used for a class of mixed drinks those with bitters by the teens just about any mixed drink served as a preprandial was considered a "cocktail " bitters or no and by the time prohibition was shown the door a "cocktail" had come to mean any mixed drink at all now the word is applied by metaphorical extension to anything that is mixed if the term "martini" stretches as expansively as "cocktail" has already done some day we will refer to treating difficult diseases with combinations of medicines called "drug martinis " and what a shame that would be though hardly the purest of the purists i am firmly of the belief that a martini is a drink of dry gin and dry vermouth no other drink has what songwriter frank loesser called the "slam bang tang" of the original but beyond my unshakeable fidelity to the basic ingredients of the martini i must admit a tendency to apostasy for example i like to have an olive or three in the glass two olives is bad form which is anathema to the most orthodox who insist a twist of lemon peel is the only acceptable martini garnish and even more heretically every now and then i like to doctor martinis with a smidgen of liqueur lets remember that the classic dry martini wasnt always so pure it was common well into the s to douse ones "dry" with a dash or two of orange bitters and perhaps the most common variant on the martini was to mix it with absinthe in f scott fitzgeralds "the beautiful and damned " this is just the sort of drink that the aristocratic anthony patch serves up to geraldine the theater usherette when he invites her up to his apartment for some canoodling "he wheeled out the little rolling table that held his supply of liquor selecting vermouth gin and absinthe for a proper stimulant " a martini with absinthe substitute the real stuff is not allowed in the u s is still served in new orleans where it is known as an obituary cocktail messing about with the essential martini recipe however is not without risk in his book "martini straight up " classics professor lowell edmunds champions what he calls the "communal" martini with a standardized recipe the cocktail is a civilizing force a secular "sacramental drink that unites in spirit even those who have never met " as such the classic martini "resists the pompous intrusion of personality " and mr edmunds declares that efforts to individualize the drink "are doomed in advance " the point is well taken which is why i think we should make it clear that any cocktail that varies from the strict martini paradigm is no martini but rather a drink of some other name altogether thus we can enjoy the occasional permutation on the martini theme without contributing to the linguistic erosion of the martini david embury in his opinionated classic "the fine art of mixing drinks " decrees as acceptable "occasional interesting variations in your martinis " but each variation he suggests comes with a name attached add a couple of dashes of orange curacao to a martini and you have a flying dutchman if instead you add a touch of the herbal french liqueur chartreuse the drink is called a nome a dash of creme de cassis and you get an international embury is so serious about correct martini nomenclature that he insists a martini is not worthy of the name if it has not been stirred "if you shake the martini it becomes a bradford " it is only natural that a popular cocktail will breed variations on the theme witness the proliferation of pomegranate margaritas and mango mojitos when the dry gin martini was at its peak there were dozens of "special" cocktails anchored with gin and vermouth one of my favorites is a house cocktail that was served at londons savoy hotel dry gin dry vermouth and a little mellowing dubonnet the savoy hotel special is a fine sophisticated drink and one that might appeal to those who like the idea of a martini but who find gin and vermouth alone to be a bit demanding just please dont call it a martini email me at eric felten wsj com savoy
