smart investment with harvard retirees give and get back with university trusts rita schneider and ron alberts wanted to give something back to harvard university after working there for many years and they also wanted to pump up their retirement portfolio the couple found a way to meet both their goals through an option that allows charitable trusts to be invested alongside harvards high performing endowment harvard was the first to offer such an option in other top schools including stanford university the university of notre dame and the massachusetts institute of technology have been granted permission by the internal revenue service to allow donors to invest with their endowments stanford and notre dame began offering the option this year and mit plans to in the future "having the endowment option will be a win win situation for both mit and our alumni " says judy sager director of gift planning at mit the trust option allows donors to share in the returns earned by university endowments which often have access to investments that are hard for individuals to hold on their own after a donor dies the trust proceeds go to the university one possible drawback tax rates on payments from the trust may be higher than some other investment options the strategy has worked for ms schneider and mr alberts self described "beach bums" who now live in miami beach "as far as i know this is about the best place to invest and be able to sleep at night " says ms schneider the couple had strong ties to the school ms schneider years old had taught french and spanish to theology students at the harvard divinity school for years in a summer program mr alberts was a staff assistant in the registrars office they funded three trusts at harvard from the sale of appreciated real estate the trusts pay them a handsome income and what is left when they die will go to harvard university endowments are among the most successful investors the harvard endowment returned an annualized over the years ended last june according to the school the s&amp p stock indexs annualized total return over that period was higher education endowment funds earned an average one year return rate of for the year ended june according to a recent survey conducted by the national association of college and university business officers in conjunction with tiaa cref the s&amp p returned over that period harvard and other schools have gotten these good results through an aggressive strategy that puts money into widely diverse assets such as hedge funds private equity real estate and even timber "you get a higher rate of return with less volatility " said david w scudder the chairman of aureus asset management a boston based wealth management firm mr scudder previously oversaw trusts at the harvard management co which runs the harvard endowment "endowments are in all these different asset classes that have very little correlation to one another " to invest alongside an endowment fund donors typically use a specialized version of a "charitable remainder trust " in which donors put money and receive a regular distribution for a set period of time usually for life after the trust ends the remainder of the assets must go to the charity donors who invest in charitable remainder trusts typically get an immediate deduction for the amount that is expected to ultimately end up with the charity some of the annual distribution that the donor receives however may be taxed as ordinary income rather than capital gains a donor could pay as much as tax on distributions rather than the capital gains rate but for many people the tax burden is offset by the higher returns endowments offer the option has been hugely popular at harvard the university has &# billion in its planned giving program and about &# million of that is invested through its approximately charitable remainder trusts about of the trust assets are invested through the endowment option "having the endowment investment option has been tremendously beneficial for harvard and our donors " said anne d mcclintock executive director of university planned giving at harvard "its something that our donors have asked about for many many years " indeed it was demand from harvard alumni that drove harvard and mr scudder to devise the arrangement "in the first year or two i was there the harvard endowment was doing quite well relative to the s&amp p and i cant tell you how many alumni came to me saying can you get us into the endowment " says mr scudder who left harvard in universities and donors both like the arrangement ms schneider and mr alberts are particularly pleased that they were able to stipulate that when they die the trust will go to the harvard divinity school to fund education on genocide "my fathers side of the family perished in the holocaust and i wanted to honor them and especially to devote my life earnings to the teaching of tolerance " says ms schneider
