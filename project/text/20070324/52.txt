pursuits books the war over virtue bluenoses oppressed th century britain or did they the making of victorian values by ben wilson penguin pages &# victorianism before victoria this is a familiar theme among british historians for whom the accession of queen victoria to the throne in is almost an incidental and somewhat belated event in what we now know as the "victorian age " that age is presumed to start at least five years earlier with the passage of the reform bill enfranchising the middle classes or before that in and with the acts emancipating catholics and giving greater political liberties to dissenters or still earlier with the essays of such eminent victorians as macaulay mill and carlyle in those eminently victorian journals the edinburgh quarterly and westminster reviews ben wilson has a special reason to go back even further to the late th century because his intention in "the making of victorian values" is to describe not so much the "making" of victorian values as the resistance to those values the books subtitle is "decency &amp dissent in britain " the "dissent" was most visible in the first of his three periods which is why that period occupies more space in his book than the other two combined and it was in the two later periods that "decency" i e victorian values made its greatest inroads mr wilsons "dissent " it should be made clear is not to be confused with the familiar religious idea of dissent indeed the dissenters the methodists together with their allies the evangelicals were the chief proponents of victorian values full disclosure in his preface mr wilson quotes my own description of the victorians as "candidly and proudly moralists " he also cites my distinction between modern "values " which are relative and subjective and victorian "virtues " which were based upon firm ideas of right and wrong mr wilson agrees with me that the victorians were firm moralists he also agrees with me that there is something of a revival of such moralism in america today but we differ most decidedly in our attitudes toward it whereas i have suggested that we have more reason than ever to be "respectful of victorian moralism " he is disrespectful and disapproving of the victorians and their american counterparts if i am as he implies of the party of decency he is of the party of dissent for mr wilson victorian morality was "rigid and restraining " "oppressive and unnatural " a form of "moral authoritarianism " above all it was "cant " cant is the mantra that pervades "the making of victorian values " it is not mr wilson says quite the same thing as hypocrisy in the sense of professing a code of conduct that is violated in practice but it is hypocritical "in its very essence knowingly unnatural in its restraint of instincts and emotions " we are repeatedly reminded of byrons tirade in against "the age of cant " provoked by the unfavorable reception of "don juan" two years earlier "the truth is the grand primum mobile of england is cant cant political cant poetical cant religious but always cant multiplied through all the varieties of life " for mr wilson the "cant of virtue" explains the attempt to impose a repressive system of morals and manners upon the people it explains as well the multitude of philanthropies charities and reforms that presumed to do good while in fact "depriving the poor of their pleasures and liberties " resisting this cant were those who valiantly tried to protect the "free and easy tolerant and gregarious culture" of the people the fairs and festivals pleasure gardens and public houses entertainments and sports that were the workers refuge from the hardship of their lives it was the dislike of "canters" that caused some people to object for example to the bill against cruelty to animals on the grounds that "the right to abuse animals" was among the legitimate pleasures and liberties of the people mr wilson admits that there were "excesses" in early th century british culture not only the cruelty and ferocity of some of the most popular sports cock and dog fighting bear and bull baiting but even of such innocent sounding entertainments as punch and judy shows adults and children roared with delight as punch a "bloody minded sadist " annoyed his neighbors knocked down a constable and finally killed his wife and child to take up with his buxom mistress at least mr wilson says punch was "free of hypocrisy" and "proudly antiauthoritarian " mr wilson does not deny the equivocal nature of the popular culture but "excesses " or "forgivable human foibles " hardly describe the gin drinking in public houses that often left men and women in a state of drunken stupor that was the frequent prelude to what we now euphemistically call "domestic violence" and "child abuse " nor were the "canting" reformers who tried to address this problem and drunkenness was a major social problem as mean spirited and scrooge like as mr wilson would have us think rather than preaching teetotaling or even limiting the number of pubs the reformers lowered the taxes on beer so as to encourage beer drinking rather than the more popular and potent gin drinking nor were the other reforms as repressive and oppressive as mr wilson would have us believe public houses and festivals music halls and theaters remained a vital part of the popular culture of victorian england mr wilson presents us with a surprisingly agreeable portrait of william wilberforce the most formidable and reform minded of evangelicals who was we are told charming eloquent and unquestionably sincere but the discussion of his great cause the abolition first of the slave trade and then of slavery in the colonies which occupied evangelicals methodists and radicals throughout this period is reserved almost entirely for the very end of the book where it appears almost as an afterthought other reforms dont fare much better all too brief mention is made for example of the increasing number and variety of schools available to the poor and nothing on the societies formed to encourage these enterprises the death penalty for petty offenses was abolished but the result we are told was that more offenses were made punishable by jail so too the improvement of conditions in jail is said to have had the effect of making judges and juries more willing to send prisoners there of the three factory acts in this period the last in limiting child labor and providing for schooling for older children who could work there is no mention at all the name of the chief sponsor of that bill lord ashley later lord shaftesbury a notable evangelical reformer and statesman does not appear in the book if "cant" is the rhetorical device echoed throughout "the making of victorian values " the idea of "social control" gives the book what coherence it has this is the common denominator that is presumed to underlie not only the victorian eras reforms but also a host of charities and philanthropies including those that seemed at the time and might seem to us today as humane and liberating for mr wilson the "cant of philanthropy and the systematic regulation of the poor" was designed to "remodel modern man " "to save the poor from themselves by encouraging sobriety respect deference and habits of industry" to promote in short the work ethic that was the not so secret guiding principle behind all that "cant" about morality the book jacket pronounces mr wilson "heir to the great radical historians of the twentieth century e j hobsbawm and e p thompson among them " yes but with a difference just as messrs hobsbawm and thompson sometimes make one nostalgic for the more rigorous if misguided economic determinism of marxism so mr wilson may make one nostalgic for their own radical version of social history for them such concepts as social control were meant to displace or mitigate the class struggle which had been the driving force of marxist history mr wilsons is a still newer mode of cultural history dependent upon an idealized and sentimentalized popular culture on the one hand and the oppressive image of "victorian values" on the other even radical history deserves better than this ms himmelfarb is the author of most recently "the roads to modernity the british french and american enlightenments" and "the moral imagination "
