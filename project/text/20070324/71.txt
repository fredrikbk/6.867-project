put some teeth into your college investment portfolio i enjoyed your article "whats a tooth worth a lot more than it used to be as most parents quickly discover" the journal report on your money matters march my wife and i first faced this question just over a year ago when our son who was nearly seven lost his first tooth without knowledge of the "going rates" for baby teeth we asked him what he thought was fair he asked for one penny for his first tooth but wanted us to double it to two cents for the second tooth which was also loose while this plan sounded cheap our son couldnt have imagined the genius of extending this progression were now up to cents for the forthcoming seventh loose tooth with the stipulation that once he receives &# for the th tooth all subsequent payments including the &# payment for no will go into his college savings account this seemed like an educational win all around and a pretty good story to share in math class john tagliamonte lexington mass as my children lost their teeth i would secretly put these teeth in a box on a strip of soft wax and record the date the loss occurred when my daughter presented us with our first grandson i gave her the box so that she could show to him her very own baby teeth as he lost his i hope she will do the same for him and that this may become a tradition in our family allowing the children to relate their experience of growing up with that of their parents as photos of your once small babies make you wonder where the time went so do their physical things henry e leibowitz d d s atlanta reading your article prompted me to retrieve from safekeeping a letter to the tooth fairy written by my daughter after discovering an apparently meager offering &# and a coin purse once she had recovered from a tearful outburst during which she accused the tooth fairy of "not liking" her she penned "dear tooth fairy i am very sorry for my rude behavior what is your name what is your favorite food what is your favorite color and season when is your birthday i left you cake cookies and a tattoo of a pony love anna p s i would prefer you bring &# but you dont have to " jennifer stevens denver
