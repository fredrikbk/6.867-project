pursuits style womens wear the gold in your closet investment grade bustiers online bidding wars erupt for second hand designer duds &# for a &# dress from h&amp m the stock market may be having its ups and downs this month but heres an investment that appreciated in just a week a blue silk bustier top from target the top designed by proenza schouler orginally sold for &# but because it was featured in a tv commercial and had already sold out at target its owner was able to sell it on ebay for &# this month women across america will go through their annual spring cleaning ritual clearing out their closets in hopes of recouping a few dollars from clothes they no longer like or just never wear but the market for reselling clothing is changing with some of the least expensive goods seeing big jumps in value and online auction sites letting shoppers effectively scalp hot selling items from h&amp m and target in particular its a big shift from the traditional approach in which shoppers resold their clothes after theyd worn them for a while and would fetch only a fraction of the purchase price among the items that have found buyers willing to pay substantial premiums a roland mouret dress that sold for &# at gap in january appreciated a sweater dress from the limited edition stella mccartney line that h&amp m sold in went for more than six times its original price on ebay this past january though its hard to predict precisely which items will ignite a bidding war the feeding frenzy for fast fashion is beginning to resemble the demand for high priced "it" handbags speculators have jumped in to snap up the clothes as soon as they hit stores and list them for sale on ebay even before a collection by madonna arrived at h&amp m in the u s this past week there were multiple bids on ebay for madonna sunglasses that h&amp m started selling march only in hong kong the irony is that these clothes created by designers such as style icon karl lagerfeld and the trendy viktor &amp rolf duo were intended to give the masses a chance to own designer duds theyre made from less expensive fabrics than the usual designer fare and feature lower quality tailoring with price tags to match but when fast fashion chains carry these designer collections for a limited time only and at only some of their stores the scarcity can drive up prices on the secondary market that "drives up the cachet and it drives up the price " says constance white style director of ebay which has more than two million listings in clothes shoes and accessories at any given time "logic isnt dictating the high prices its emotion " women who want to unload their designer clothes every year have far more options than in the past in addition to consignment shops an array of dealers have sprung up to help people unload their unwanted clothes online in exchange for a cut of the proceeds sales of apparel and accessories on ebay alone exploded to &# billion last year from &# billion in most designer clothes however dont fetch much with the exception of certain vintage couture items and brands with a cult following on ebay the most searched terms in apparel shoes and accessories are coach louis vuitton abercrombie &amp fitch and chanel there is also demand for certain items by designers norma kamali and ossie clark the prices typically reflect a garments condition as well as availability some dealers of course do a better job than others of unloading castoff clothes new yorker marlene provizer a personal shopper who has sold online for years for instance relies on her "book" of satisfied clients to match buyers and sellers just before she lists items on ebay that has enabled her to move goods promptly often at impressive prices she has sold about four of designer zorans &# tafetta evening jackets including one for &# to a return client "if people have already done business with you " she says "they come back to you again " for the most part women who sell their unwanted clothes dont expect to get a lot janis ehlers of boca raton fla regularly takes suitcases full of designer clothes to a consignment shop in washington d c that takes a cut of the proceeds she says she considers it "found money " the limited edition designer clothes made for target and h&amp m can fetch prices far above their original values on ebay because they are novelties that often sell out quickly at retail only a few styles are offered and theyre on sale for only a couple of months this is a contrast to a new generation of "designer" labels such as isaac mizrahis line for target and nicole millers nicole line for j c penney which are simply part of the year round mix at the stores and seem to command only routine interest in the secondary market for example in the past three months mizrahi items sold on ebay with an average price of about &# and none sold higher than their original retail price even mr lagerfeld who generated a lot of buzz when he did the first designer guest turn at h&amp m in wasnt a hit on ebay only items from his h&amp m collection which featured a lot of black and had a high fashion look were resold on ebay and the highest price was &# for a party dress that originally sold for &# sellers especially those looking to make a profit usually have to strike early two weeks ago triss budoff of houston spent &# at target on about proenza schouler items but missed the peak of the frenzy so far she has sold of them for an average of &# per item more than she paid meaning she is essentially breaking even after her costs to list the clothes still she isnt deterred she figures she can return anything she cant sell within days and get a full refund to increase her chances of cashing in next time she plans to show up at the store the first day the clothes hit target h&amp m and the other stores dont seem to mind because the guest designer programs are aimed more at generating buzz than sales volume target doesnt limit the amount of designer merchandise a shopper can buy because its goal is to make high fashion accessible to a broad audience spokeswoman amy von walter says h&amp m also says its making high fashion more accessible and allows people to buy as much as they want h&amp m said in a statement "while we prefer buying and selling to take place in our h&amp m stores there are no laws preventing private individuals from trading on the internet " teri agins discusses the market for used designer clothes saturday morning on abcs "weekend good morning america " check local listings the return in
