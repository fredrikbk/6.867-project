wto rules on patents compulsory licensing your march editorial "the thai flu" misses an important legal nuance regarding the rules of the world trade organization you state that the wto has "vague language" on intellectual property rights permitting compulsory license of a patent in a time of "national emergency" or for "public non commercial use " you go on to conclude that in recent episodes when the thai government granted such a compulsory license there was "no such emergency in this case " actually the rules of the wto are not vague article of the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips does not contain any limitation on the purposes for which compulsory licenses can be granted by a government thus compulsory licenses are not limited to purposes of national emergency if there was any doubt about this the wto member governments acted by consensus in in the doha trips declaration to state that "each member has the right to grant compulsory licenses and the freedom to determine the grounds upon which such licenses are granted " of course trips article also contains a number of requirements that a government must fulfill to grant a compulsory license e g paying "adequate remuneration" i am not taking a position on whether thailand has met the article requirements or on whether thailands action was wise for its economy or for its public health steve charnovitz associate professor of law george washington university law school washington
