industry news uaw faces uncertainty auto woes cloud contract strategy talks united auto workers union leaders will convene in detroit next week for a critical collective bargaining convention against the backdrop of hard times for the u s auto makers and suppliers that anchor the year old unions membership the convention scheduled for tuesday and wednesday is a longstanding ritual for the uaw in the runup to national contract talks with detroits big three which begin this summer in the past uaw leaders used the convention to rally their troops to seek improvements in job security pay and health care benefits but this year the uaw will confront intense pressure from the auto makers to give up hard won gains amid the most difficult environment for the unionized u s auto industry since the dark years of the recession and energy shocks of the early s complicating the uaws bargaining strategy this year will be the possibility that daimlerchrysler ag could sell its chrysler unit to private equity buyers ford motor co meanwhile is on track to lose billions in its u s operations this year as sales continue to fall general motors corp has rebounded from a &# billion loss in but has projected negative cash flow for despite a volley of new models the uncertain outlook for another big uaw employer parts making giant delphi corp which is in chapter proceedings also looms over this years bargaining in a march letter article posted on the unions web site uaw president ron gettelfinger said "there is a great deal of uncertainty in the auto industry right now which causes a great deal of concern among our members and their families were doing our best to address those concerns " at the same time gm and ford have announced plans to give bonuses or stock awards to top management reflecting the diverging markets for skilled managerial talent and uaw hourly workers who increasingly are measured against lower wage nonunion workers in the u s and elsewhere in the world in a gesture to the uaw ford said it would pay modest bonuses to hourly workers too gm disclosed thursday that it was awarding restricted stock to chairman and chief executive officer rick wagoner and other top managers for the first time in four years some uaw officials and retirees said friday they were baffled by the bonuses being paid to gm executives "why do they deem it necessary to reward these executives with exorbitant bonuses " asked rick vargesko president of uaw local whose members work at a gm metal fabrication plant in west mifflin pa recalling the unions acceptance of buyouts in the past two years to help gm rein in costs he added "i thought we were in this together are we saving this company or not " investors will be watching this years uaw talks closely in hopes that the big detroit auto makers can make further dents in their big unfunded health care debt to uaw workers the union made significant midcontract concessions to allow gm and ford to slice retiree health care costs and is also renegotiating work rules at the plant level in what amounts to a rolling renegotiation of the contract the uaw last year negotiated deals with ford on a plant by plant level that shaved &# million in costs the health care concessions at gm and ford in cut billions from long term liabilities last year the union approved massive attrition programs at gm and ford that saw more than hourly workers accept buyouts and early retirements the progress however hasnt been enough the detroit three continue to lose money in north america and post negative cash outflows largely because health care obligations are higher for detroit auto makers than asian competitors building cars in the south labor officials however are wondering how much more cutting the uaw can take "our productivity has increased but at this point it still seems like it isnt enough " says david green president of uaw local representing workers at gms lordstown ohio assembly plant "i dont know exactly how much more american workers are expected to give before the jobs go away " mr green says the lordstown plant has less than half as many workers as it did about four years ago and manages to produce the same amount of cars still the plant which produces fuel efficient compact cars is widely seen to be an unprofitable cog in gms sprawling manufacturing footprint in addition to health care and productivity improvements the "jobs bank" program that pays idled workers nearly full pay and benefits promises to be at the heart of negotiations and may inspire several conversations at the bargaining conference while attrition programs have bought out several former jobs bank members therefore cutting auto maker costs for laid off workers the existence of the provision could mean big costs for auto makers as they look to continue slimming the u s work force the uaws longstanding preference for so called pattern bargaining also may take a hit because each auto maker is in a unique situation gm for instance provides benefits for a significantly larger body of retirees than its competitors "each of the big three have a different strategic situation and require contracts that have to be tailored to their unique situation " says hal stack a labor professor at wayne state university in detroit "it certainly has affected pattern bargaining " kris maher and john d stoll contributed
