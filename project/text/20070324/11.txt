capital currents for the past few years the u s has generated insufficient domestic savings to cover its investment needs the difference has been covered by large capital inflows from abroad the counterpart of which is the much discussed current account deficit which has been running at unprecedented rates of of gdp the u s need for inflows from abroad to cover the saving deficit has coincided with a desire on the part of other countries to invest more in the u s driven by large trade surpluses and sometimes surpluses on the private capital account countries such as china have accumulated substantial reserves in their central banks the bulk of which have been invested back in the u s the size and the trend over time of this capital flow has become more pronounced in recent years this has raised concerns about its sustainability including whether it will end in a sudden and disorganized manner that sharply reduces growth in the global economy and causes problems in global capital markets and underlying the concern is a kind of puzzlement about the configuration of global savings one that runs counter to virtually every text book description the worlds richest country appears to be saving at a low rate and has to borrow from poorer developing countries to maintain its consumption and investment lets analyze this puzzle beginning with the u s the financial assets of u s households have risen rapidly in the past years at rates well above inflation the most dramatic increase occurred in household real estate principally housing at least some of these increases in asset values were not anticipated relative to the long term life cycle savings and consumption plans that households normally follow they represented a large unanticipated windfall not withstanding examples of irresponsible borrowing and lending behavior which is being vividly illustrated by the subprime debacle it nevertheless seems reasonable that u s households would consume a portion of their windfall capital gains or increased real estate equity over time the recent shakiness in the subprime mortgage market has created uncertainty as to whether this dynamic will be sustained certain creditors have fallen out of the market and the rate of mortgage default is rising increasing the risk of additional housing inventory coming to the market for sale more generally the potential pressure on house prices could also reduce households propensity to consume out of their accumulated equity windfall and in addition there is concern in the capital markets that global growth could be negatively impacted these concerns are worth monitoring carefully and they highlight a more general issue that has deep roots while individual consumption and savings decisions may have been largely rational that does not mean that the decisions of individual households "add up" properly in the aggregate sense in fact they easily might not have suppose counter to fact for the moment that the u s economy were a closed economy meaning not connected to the global economy that we know and suppose further not counter to fact the economy were running at close to potential output given the technological base so that there isnt much "spare" capacity in these circumstances the attempt to increase consumption in response to asset price increases would lead initially to excess demand and inflationary pressure the federal reserve would respond by raising interest rates or reserve ratios to limit borrowing in effect cutting off the aggregate demand increase economic variables would adjust borrowing and consumption would go down investment would likely fall and asset prices including housing would stabilize or fall for in a closed economy consumption including government expenditure and investment cannot exceed output either inflation or central banks react and either way in real terms the balance is maintained in an open economy like ours however we can consume and invest more than output by importing more than we export and we did hence the trade deficit however this ability is dependent on the ability and willingness of the rest of the global economy to accommodate the us desire for higher consumption by investing in the us that accommodation has been forthcoming from emerging economies generally including opec and china as well as from japan their initial reaction to their improved external trade balances has been primarily to recycle the funds to the "risk free assets " u s treasuries and agencies by financing u s consumption many surplus countries are also meeting their domestic objectives to promote exports increase employment and build up significant reserve cushions to deal with the possibility of sudden disruptions in global capital markets this constellation of conditions was largely unanticipated by both markets and policy makers and as a result it has been reflected in a host of unusual economic and market outcomes referred to as conundrums aberrations puzzles etc the most visible is the configuration of the global "imbalances" also of note is the excessive compression in risk spreads the unusual collapse in market volatility the inverted shape of the u s yield curve and the unusual disagreement among "fed watchers" about the size and direction of likely interest rate moves in the remainder of this year now to the future over time emerging markets will inevitably divert more of their assets to more sophisticated investments abroad that shift will have many effects some of which depend on the decisions taken by emerging economies while others depend on the evolution of the global context one effect will surely be to put upward pressure at some point on the cost of capital in the u s as the incremental demand for treasuries declines while the shift is inevitable it would be unlikely that the emerging economies as a group would deliberately take actions that directly undermine global economic markets there will also be domestic pressure on policy makers in emerging countries to gradually shift their emphasis away from the producer and towards the consumer that will mean lowering the savings rate relative to investment increasing consumption and letting it assume a more important role relative to exports and global demand in driving growth under this state of the world domestic consumption in the rest of the world picks up over time facilitating the needed adjustment in the u s the result is a gradual journey to a more normal relationship between assets and income returns with savings moving to a more normal long run pattern but this process is not automatic and faces significant disruption risks and it is particularly sensitive to "policy mistakes " among these policy mistakes protectionism measures in the u s would derail the global adjustment so too would the inability of emerging economies to navigate their complex policy challenges geopolitical shocks would also be a problem as they could undermine the free flow of goods and services finally significant "market accidents" that in the past have been associated with excessive leverage and triggered sudden and large portfolio changes and credit rationing would add to the policy complexity so where does all this leave us the current configuration of global imbalances while highly unusual is not a real puzzle it is the result of a series of individual decisions in both advanced and emerging economies that were largely rational when considered at the micro level these decisions reflected individual self interest and happened to coincide the aggregation of these decisions at the national and international levels raises considerable challenges as does the ability to maintain an orderly global reconciliation process over time the fundamental question therefore is whether these global considerations will be sufficient to minimize the risk of "policy mistakes" in a world
