remembrances john t gilbride captain of industry steered shipbuilder through tough times manning the helm of one of the nations largest shipbuilders john t gilbride weathered cyclic swings and long term declines in orders for three decades todd shipyards corp ended up foundering in bankruptcy shortly after he retired as chairman in but unlike most of the rest of the u s shipbuilding industry which sank with barely a trace todd shipyards today is back building ships if on a much smaller scale todd shipyards already was a storied company when mr gilbride joined in fresh out of the university of pennsylvania founded in brooklyn n y in it resulted from a merger of several companies one of which robins dry dock &amp repair co was run by his father predecessor firms to robins dated to and one had built the civil war era ironclad monitor orders by the navy and others during world war i boosted todds business prompting it to add sites in tacoma and seattle washington the company languished during the depression but things picked up with the passage of the merchant marine act of which created subsidies and tax breaks to stimulate domestic shipbuilding capacity mr gilbride would later become among the nations most vocal proponents of government aid to shipyards mr gilbride arrived at the company just in time for world war ii and the greatest output of naval tonnage in the countrys history in his mid s he supervised navy work at todds brooklyn yard where tens of thousands of workers labored to recondition private u s flagged vessels to make them fit as merchant marine transports to europe at eight shipyards around the nation todd boasted wartime construction of ocean ships everything from troop transports to destroyers to aircraft carriers and repaired and converted more vessels for a total of million tons of shipping the company employed a peak work force of more than many of them women and senior citizens after the war mr gilbride became general manager of todds los angeles division at san pedro calif where he generated enough business to keep the yard open despite slack peacetime demand conversions and repairs became todds main business although new keels were laid as well these included the fleet for disneyland a mississippi steamboat an old time square rigger and eight foot submarines in when todds president died suddenly mr gilbride who had been a director since was made president he began working on diversifying the business an attempt to overcome the boom bust cycle that was the industrys bane yet no matter how many new ventures he found for todd offshore oil rigs bridge spans insecticidal equipment it never changed the underlying unpredictability of shipbuilding a change of government priorities could mean thousands of jobs lost or even a yard shuttered "government officials dont seem to grasp the fact that shipyard skills are a national asset " he said in a speech but his warning had little impact and much to mr gilbrides consternation the government diverted defense dollars into nasas moon mission he labeled it "space o mania" instead of constructing a larger navy mr gilbride took his case to washington where as president of the shipbuilders council of america he lobbied for increased government support of domestic shipyards more and more business went to shipbuilding industries in europe and japan as the big u s yards many of them connected to bigger companies such as bethlehem steel languished or closed todd shipyards continued to prosper in some areas however constructing the nations largest floating dry dock at its galveston texas shipyard a center for oil tanker repairs that also handled the navys most modern nuclear powered vessels its pacific yards in san francisco los angeles and seattle built navy ships serviced the merchant marine fleet during the vietnam conflict and served the emerging alaska marine oil fields during the s todd began to abandon the commercial market and came to rely on navy contracts a strategy that looked good by the beginning of the s as president reagans secretary of the navy john f lehman announced plans for a ship fleet yet here mr gilbride apparently slipped making plans to concentrate on destroyers orders for them "never came through in the quantity they expected " says c larry french who was chairman and chief executive of san diego based national steel and shipbuilding company today known as general dynamics nassco who describes himself as a "friendly competitor" to mr gilbride as plans for the ship navy were scaled back and construction subsidies were nearly eliminated in the face of record federal budget deficits todd shipyards faced rough sailing much of its navy business was lost to east coast competitors such as the bath iron works corp in maine that enjoyed lower labor costs with todds navy contracts winding down it closed its brooklyn yard in mr gilbride retired in and the following year todd filed for bankruptcy protection closing its houston new orleans and san francisco yards in it shuttered galveston and los angeles as well leaving only the seattle yard intact when it emerged from bankruptcy later that year since then the company has concentrated on smaller scale projects such as modernizing the coast guard high endurance cutters and producing large car ferries mr gilbride meantime became
