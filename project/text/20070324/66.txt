pursuits sports golf journal breaking down the rules we puzzle through a class on golfs regs i wrote it what does it mean boo weekley was just trying to be a nice guy and it cost him big time in last weekends arnold palmer invitational on the pga tour mr weekley noticed that the man he was playing with tom johnson was about to hit the flagstick with his ball a rule violation that carries a two stroke penalty to spare mr johnson that fate mr weekley pulled the flagstick but in doing so he violated a different clause of the same rule if a ball is in motion you cant pull the flag without the ball strikers permission mr weekleys magnanimity cost him two strokes which translated to about &# in lost earnings in most sports players try to bend the rules wherever they can baseball pitchers try to sneak in a spitball and offensive linemen in football surreptitiously grab a defenders jersey golf is different golfers take pride in being maniacal about enforcing rules on themselves the problem is that most players and this includes many pros dont really know the rules there are only rules in golf which doesnt sound that daunting but to actually understand them you need to consult a second book that contains roughly decisions covering the rules sections subsections exceptions to the subsections and sometimes exceptions to the exceptions the usga gets more than calls or emails a year from golfers who got embroiled in a rule dispute and want the usga to weigh in in an attempt to better understand golfs intricate rule book i signed up for a four day &# workshop at usga headquarters in far hills n j i along with other people sat in a semi darkened room from to each day going over each rule one by one the goal was to master regulations like the one that did in mr weekley the difference between an attended flagstick and an unattended one the catch it sometimes has nothing at all to do with whether a person is actually near the flagstick the classs instructors were jesse barge of the pga of america and lew blakey of the usga who sits on the various committees that write and administer the rules dr blakey is sympathetic to golfers confusion even he will read something in the plus page decisions book and wonder "what does that mean and i wrote it " he confessed with a smile golf rules can be befuddling for several reasons from the existence of regulations created centuries ago that are no longer relevant to all the potential natural hazards that rules in golf have to account for in the class we had to follow some strict guidelines created because too many students try to hijack the discussion to talk about their personal beefs with particular rules we could ask no more than three questions a day and werent allowed to pose any theoretical "stump the instructor" queries some of the people in the class were pros at area clubs while others were rules officials looking to stay current one of the latter told me that when he plays recreationally he has to ignore rule violations because if he started pointing all of them out there wouldnt be any time left for golf the basic tenet of the rules of golf is this play the ball as it lies but because not all courses are perfectly maintained a greenkeeper spills chemicals on a green killing a swatch of grass for example or a rainstorm makes the sand in a bunker leaden golfers generally adopt a drop one here and keep going attitude while that can be acceptable in saturday morning four balls not foursomes as i now know youre not really playing golf youre playing your own version of golf on the last day of class we took a mind numbing question multiple choice test in my class no one scored the best was a by a very senior official who helped to write many of the rules she laughed when she announced her score saying "i may have a nit to pick with one of the questions " john paul newport is off this week email golfjournal wsj com
