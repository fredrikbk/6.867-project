politics &amp economics democrats pass iraq timetable for withdrawal house bill on funding ranks as pelosi victory bush veto is assured washington an iraq war spending bill advanced to the senate after democrats won house passage of the funding together with provisions requiring the withdrawal of most u s combat forces by september the narrow margin and almost certain veto by the white house guarantees changes will have to be made in the proposed timetable nonetheless the vote represents a major victory for speaker nancy pelosi d calif who has struggled for weeks to unite her caucus and overcome divisions on what is the best way to try to force a change in u s policy in iraq the &# billion measure funds the new combat brigades ordered to iraq by president bush in january and adds more money for military readiness at home and veterans health care programs but it also holds the iraqi government to political and defense benchmarks and sets a to month window for withdrawal depending on the progress made on these goals this strategy helped democrats hold their defections to just almost equally split between those who feared the party was going too far and those who wanted a stronger antiwar position but only two republicans joined in support and ultimately the president will have the upper hand in any situation where congress is so divided along party lines mr bush wasted little time aggressively attacking the house bill as having "no chance of becoming law" and a bit of "political theater" that risks delaying the pentagons request for the funds by mid april "the democrats have sent their message now its time to send their money " the president said his brusque tone suggested the white house would welcome moving quickly to a veto confrontation as a show of strength for its war policy senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said republicans will try first to "clean up" the house bill on the floor next week senate democrats still hope to find the votes to support at least the goal of withdrawal of most combat brigades by next april one question is whether republicans will step out of the way so a final package will move faster to mr bush for his expected veto beyond iraq the house bill also poses a challenge to mr bush on his budget policy at home more than &# billion is added to the presidents initial request including new disaster aid for farmers and the gulf coast the new emergency spending comes as the senate voted friday to approve a budget resolution adding &# billion to &# billion in discretionary spending on top of mr bushs budget request for the fiscal year that begins oct the higher budget ceilings are designed to expedite action on spending bills to keep government agencies operating an annual appropriations process that effectively collapsed in the last congress under republican rule but unless some accommodation is reached with the president the democrats risk a protracted series of veto fights with him the iraq bill may prove to be the first veto fight and could define mr bushs relationship with congress for the remainder of his presidency democrats certainly see the fight as a chance for congress to reassert itself not just on the war but also on domestic policy emotions ran high in a morning caucus having won power in an election influenced by voter unhappiness with the war rank and file democrats felt relief that they had found a position they could unite behind "it was inchoate when we won the election " said rep william delahunt d mass "there were feelings and a passion but to take that and put it into something that had some coherence was a challenge this was a real test of pelosis leadership and she passed it big time shes stronger now than ever "
