pursuits music rock in a hard place with the uso short on big name acts and the military trying to entertain troops in remote bases unknown bands are braving battle zones to build their fan base the st century answer to bob hope at a u s military base in al qaim a dusty town in the anbar province of iraq soldiers crowded into a storage building doubling as a concert hall for a night last year the entertainment was a six piece country band and a young nashville singer named carly goodwin few of the soldiers had heard of her but they wound up cheering dancing onstage and singing along some sat on the rafters above the makeshift stage as the war in iraq enters its fifth year the uso is having some trouble recruiting a list stars increasingly the militarys old bob hope style approach to entertainment is being partly supplanted by a different model the new approach relies on sending little known bands to the middle east in an effort to provide more concerts at more remote bases in combat zones this reflects the way troops are now being deployed many soldiers are posted in remote bases in active battle zones of iraq and afghanistan accessible mainly by helicopter troops are facing the longest armed conflict since vietnam and in many cases multiple tours of duty it also mirrors an entertainment world increasingly defined by myspace and "american idol " the divide between fringe and mainstream acts has gotten smaller as unknowns become stars on the internet and tv practically overnight that has created a receptive environment for up and coming bands hoping to raise their profiles by touring with the military but its raising difficult decisions for young musicians now wrestling with their own political views and fears of danger as they weigh tours to battle zones the group responsible for recruiting these bands is a little known division of the pentagon called armed forces entertainment last year afe sent more than small acts to camps around the world compared with the nonprofit civilian run uso which last year sent tours abroad mainly to big hubs like kuwait city and baghdad recently afe has been on the rise organizing a record number of concerts and ramping up its band recruitment efforts for the four members of edison a hard rock group the question of whether to go to iraq prompted some heated discussions the group had mainly been playing bars in connecticut and new york city when afe contacted singer ethan isaac to ask if he and his group would consider a tour to the middle east mr isaac had done an afe tour of europe with a previous band mr isaac and two other band members were enthusiastic but lead guitarist jonathan svec refused a staunch opponent of the war he worried about the symbolism of working with the military "are we the entertainment cog that gets thrown in to help keep the war machine turning " he remembers thinking he also had a paralyzing fear of flying in helicopters which would be the groups main transportation in iraq his bandmates suggested he try hypnosis or counseling eventually mr isaac signed edison up anyway and mr svec gave in worrying that he was being selfish mr svec assumed that his father who had served as a drill sergeant during the vietnam war would support the idea but instead when mr svec broke the news at a family party that he was going to iraq his father said "no youre not " and walked away three weeks before the band was to leave a friend of mr isaacs was killed in iraq by a roadside bomb and mr isaacs family asked him to reconsider mr isaac was shaken but says the tragedy made the tour seem even more important getting to iraq was a challenge of its own the group had to disassemble their amplifiers to meet weight restrictions on the commercial flights overseas half of their equipment got lost between england and the united arab emirates resulting in a day hiatus in dubai that almost scuttled the tour soon though the band was hovering over iraq strapped into the seats of a c jet as the pilot made a swerving combat landing to avoid potential enemy fire at their first shows they played to fairly reserved audiences partly due to the ban on alcohol but at forward operating base sykes near iraqs border with syria something changed with the temperature outside topping degrees edison took the stage in an air conditioned mess hall packed with several hundred soldiers the band launched into "helter skelter" by the beatles in front of the stage a camouflaged throng sang danced and pumped their fists some soldiers strummed their unloaded machine guns like electric guitars "it was the most moving musical thing that has ever happened to me " mr isaac says now back home edisons members say they often get messages on their myspace page from soldiers who saw them play overseas james lougee a member of the air force national guard drove six hours from his home in spring grove pa to a ski resort in new york to see edison perform last winter hed been in the audience at one of their iraq shows in fact it was the first rock concert hed ever seen last year afe organized tours overseas and a total of performances a record for the group which was founded in with a budget of &# million for fiscal afe is still much smaller than the uso which is funded almost entirely by donations and which relies on the afe to coordinate tours with the military in the last year for which tax records are available the uso brought in about &# million in donations and spent almost &# million on services ranging from tours to canteens but while the uso typically only marshals stars for one week tours to a limited number of bases afe recruits acts for stints of up to a month that reach many more outposts recently in an effort to attract more high quality bands afe has been working to boost its profile its hired a marketing agency which helped design a slick web site and new logo for the group its also taking part in more industry events making contacts with labels and sending more recruiters to clubs and music festivals touring with the military can translate to a boost in album sales for some bands pop punk group ballentine played for an audience of soldiers at guantanamo bay compared to the crowds of a few hundred it usually gets at home in l a singer niki barr who is about to leave for her fifth afe stint says she sees about a bump in merchandise sales after every tour rock group cinder road landed a record deal with emi and an opening slot on tour with "american idol" star chris daughtry after building a big fan following on afe tours bands arent paid for the tours but receive free lodging and a stipend of &# per person for each day theyre away in remote areas performers usually eat alongside soldiers in chow halls and stay in the same cramped quarters bands are banned from selling their cds and other merchandise on the bases to prevent competition with the military exchange stores instead afe gives bands up to &# to pay for promotional items such as t shirts cds and fliers which they give away to the troops some acts bring laptops and burn their music onto blank cds some in the music industry say afe is emerging as a force in helping bands get noticed "its filling a void theyre actually helping to break artists " says tamara conniff executive editor and associate publisher of billboard which plans to sponsor an afe tour of r&amp b bands all this has turned a marine captain named jesse davidson and several of his afe colleagues into unlikely arbiters of indie bands capt davidson served three tours of duty in iraq from to as a logistics officer in the infantry battalion that helped pull down the statue of saddam hussein in baghdad in he was given a new assignment sending rock bands to the war zone he had just left capt davidson mans a cubicle on the fourth floor of a building complex near the pentagon dressed in a service uniform of a khaki shirt and green pants his brown hair cut in the "jarhead" marine style he spends most of the day on the phone coordinating gigs once every two weeks he and his colleagues file down the hall to a conference room for a ritual theyve dubbed "afe idol " they gather before a flat screen tv connected to a dvd player and stereo system this is where they screen submissions partly as a result of its recruiting efforts afe receives dozens of applications from musicians magicians and comedians each month only a third are accepted on a recent afternoon the staff assessed a rock group from the midwest a video montage showed the leather clad band riding motorcycles and sweating it out at biker rallies capt davidson gave the band points for having an electric fiddle player a sign they could adapt to mixed military crowds "these guys straddle the line between country and rock " he said each band is graded on a scale of to in different areas a system that afe recently introduced to make the process more objective categories range from the fairly standard stage presence audience engagement to some particular to the military appearance sobriety profanity and religious references are considered red flags the biker band scored low on sobriety the video didnt show them drinking but they seemed at home in front of hard partying fans but a mix of s and s on other criteria meant theyd likely be accepted if a follow up phone interview went smoothly the next applicant a folk singer who played guitar on stage accompanied by instrumental tracks hed prerecorded in a studio didnt fare as well "someone doing this in front of a crowd of soldiers would get booed off the stage " said capt davidson as he aimed the remote control at the stereo "lets just stop the pain " last week afe went on one of its biggest recruiting missions yet fifty afe staff members and affiliates descended on the south by southwest music festival in austin texas a major industry event last year its first time at the festival afe sent five representatives who manned a table in uniform this time they opted for civilian clothes to blend in also part of the strategy never using the word "recruit" with bands during the four day event the group approached hundreds of bands and handed out metal dog tags that doubled as business cards in the evenings they moved quickly from one bar to another to check out acts at midnight wednesday in a bar called the viper room they saw one they liked reeve carney &amp the revolving band mr carney in a velvet blazer with a black scarf knotted around his neck was singing part of queens "bohemian rhapsody " in a high steady voice when the song was over daniel cook a former marine who works with afe to set up concert tours in the middle east raised his beer bottle and clinked it approvingly with his thick marine corps ring "ive got goose bumps " he said after the show he and his colleagues buttonholed mr carney outside the viper room the singer was enthusiastic about the idea of a tour mr carneys lawyer ken abdo also approved "its a very great marketing move that could put the band in front of thousands of open souled soldiers " he said while an iraq tour has clear publicity benefits for a little known act selling stars on the idea can be more difficult the uso has scored some new celebrities such as singer jessica simpson and rapper cent for iraq tours but its relied heavily on its old guard of regulars like al franken robin williams and wayne newton some entertainers affiliated with the uso say the group has had trouble bringing on new a list performers singer and cable tv host henry rollins who has been on seven uso tours says he hasnt been able to recruit other stars to tour neither has drowning pool a rock band that the uso calls one of its key ambassadors particularly to young musicians john hanson a spokesman for the uso says that in cases when top celebrities havent signed on they havent cited politics or danger as a reason but that scheduling is often an issue another challenge for the group mr rollins says is bringing on the kinds of acts that soldiers in their late teens and early s care about he says this could be a point of strength for afe "the days of wayne newton are kind of over "
