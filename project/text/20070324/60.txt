pursuits leisure &amp arts in the fray british actors arent better than our own its just that mainstream vehicles sell american performers short theres an old yarn concerning the collaboration between laurence olivier and dustin hoffman on the film "marathon man " it goes like this to prepare to play a torture victim kept awake for days on end mr hoffman forced himself to stay up for two straight nights when the actor loped into the studio the next day looking disheveled his lordship is alleged to have said to him "dear boy you look absolutely awful why dont you try acting its so much easier " mr hoffman himself debunked the story telling neal conan in a national public radio interview that hed stayed up all night not to prepare for his role but to party at studio but that hardly matters people love to tell this story because it serves to uphold the widely held belief that not only are british actors different from their american counterparts but they are better nothing could be further from the truth the conspicuous presence of british actors at the academy awards a few weeks ago marks the latest episode in a long history of adulation for u k performers at the expense of their american counterparts granted helen mirren judi dench kate winslet and peter otoole all deserved recognition for their fine work last year yet seemingly oblivious to the serious shortcomings of the oscars as a barometer of thespian talent the media have been trumpeting claims about the superiority of british actors recently in the los angeles times charles mcnulty saluted britains oscar nominees for combining "the best of american naturalism with a rich theatrical and literary heritage that recognizes drama as something more than a slice of life " writing in the guardian american columnist george saunders barely disguised a bad attack of anglophilia with a tongue in cheek tutorial aimed at persuading british oscar winners to stop being "too articulate and grammatical" during acceptance speeches "the way we americans prepare for a speech is we dont" history may be partly to blame for the unfavorable comparison of american actors and whats come to be known as the quintessential american acting system the method with british performers and their performance techniques consider the vast influence of english playwrights and actors on the american stage over the centuries from the early s professional performers began to migrate from england to the american colonies in search of new audiences bringing with them english plays american audiences were weaned on shakespeare and embraced touring british stars like william macready and charles kean despite the fact that th century acting in the u s had been closely associated with the method a naturalistic style of performance adapted from the teachings of the russian actor and director konstantin stanislavsky by lee strasberg in the s american acting professionals continue to look up to the english tradition to this day since the end of world war ii many young american actors have considered traveling to london to attend summer programs at major british acting schools to be a rite of passage but very few british actors train at american institutions many american actors yearn for what they perceive to be a strong subsidized acting culture in the u k and wish they could be as "steeped in the classics" and "immersed in the theater tradition" as their british counterparts there is indeed a strong case to be made for developing a solid background in the theater as an actor the stage nurtures such qualities as projection character arc and stamina more deeply than the fragmented media of television and film many great actors both british and american boast formidable stage careers some like marlon brando and maggie smith were able to adapt their skills to the screen yet to suggest that an immersion in classical literature and the theater is a prerequisite for good acting is preposterous johnny depp and renee zellweger consistently display impressive powers of transformation in film without the benefit of a theater background there are as many different approaches to the art and craft of acting in the u s as there are in the u k and british and american actor training reflects this diversity different approaches are better suited to different kinds of genres and roles and no single rigid system equips the actor for all potentialities whether an actor attends yale drama school or the london academy of musical and dramatic art he or she will take the same kinds of wide ranging courses from textual analysis and movement to voice and stage combat in so far as one can delineate distinct british and american acting styles which isnt really possible anymore the so called "british style" of acting with its focus on technical proficiency is not without its critics as royal shakespeare company member hugh quarshie puts it in "on acting " a book of interviews with u k and u s actors "the british have a reputation for their facility for speaking from the neck upwards but restrained passion is clearly not the only path to be followed " if perceptions of american acting are low its because the public is generally exposed only to american actors performances in mass market commercial movies and tv series that rarely exercise their range and talent the bland scripts stock characters and emphasis on special effects do more to mask an actors abilities than to display them performing in generally smaller films with more carefully crafted scripts and deeply developed characters british actors prevailed at the oscars this year for good reason unlike many u s performers they actually got to act to see a true performance by a great american actor often requires looking beyond the mainstream seeing willem dafoe do his green goblin impersonation in the "spider man" franchise is one thing watching him embody smithers in the wooster groups production of "the emperor jones" is quite another i dont have to tell you which is the more satisfying experience its unfortunate that hollywood and broadway have come to stand for american acting when much of the real talent lies beyond in nonprofit theaters like berkeley rep and chicagos steppenwolf from liev schreibers careening hamlet at new yorks public theater to steven eppss deliciously vile harpagon in the minneapolis based theatre de la jeune lunes "the miser " american actors consistently match their british counterparts in the classics meanwhile experimental and new play companies like new yorks mabou mines and san franciscos campo santo continue to nurture bold performance talent when in a recent poll the guardian asked "do the oscar nominations mean british actors now outclass their u s counterparts " of respondents unsurprisingly answered "yes " britain brags about its superiority in the acting stakes but lets face facts ms mirren didnt win the best actress prize simply for delivering a nuanced vulnerable performance as elizabeth ii americas apparently endless fascination with british royalty doubtless had something to do with it u s actors for their part should stop bowing and scraping at the monarchs feet ms veltman is the chief theater critic for sf weekly see related letter "letters to the editor film and stage acting subtlety vs boldness" wsj april
