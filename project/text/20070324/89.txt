the swaying palms of the costa del sol meet the beetles spanish infestation kills trees as mr schutte glasz tries to mount a defense torremuelle spain the killer struck first a year ago by september the death toll had reached five a month later much of this affluent community on spains southern coast was on red alert the victims decades old canary and date palms that towered over luxurious villas the executioner a red armored beetle with a snout "this is a plague " says ralf schutte glasz the neighborhoods vice president in charge of parks and gardens he has tracked the infestation of local palms the pests love affair with palm trees is altering the landscapes of municipalities resort hotels and wealthy homeowners across southern europe after ravaging coconut palms in asia and date palms in the middle east the insect has recently been introduced across the mediterranean thanks to the importation of hundreds of thousands of trees mainly from egypt now many of europes canary island palms have fallen prey to the red palm weevil in the past two years the hitchhiking pest has been recorded for the first time in cyprus greece turkey italy france and syria mediterranean islands from corsica and sardinia to sicily and crete have also become infested the weevils swift advance has alarmed officials at the european union a committee of the european commission on plant health met friday to discuss measures to prevent further importation of infested trees no palm pest is as aggressive and difficult to tame as the inch long rhynchophorus ferrugineus as it is known to entomologists native to southeast asia the insect has spread as far west as the canary islands off the northwest coast of africa spains costa del sol where mature palms are imported to adorn boulevards hotel grounds and second homes has been particularly hard hit it can take months or even years to detect the presence of weevils in a mature palms thick trunk by then its usually too late to save the tree to the weevils palm trees are "a five star hotel they have a party while they are inside " says abdulaziz mohammed al ajlan an entomologist in saudi arabia where some researchers estimate up to one million palms have been destroyed by the weevil since the late s in egypt the weevil has strengthened its grip since the early s as much as of the countrys palms are infested according to some researchers the weevil can fly miles to find a new host the female lays hundreds of eggs in the base of a trees fronds the young parts of its crown or open cuts of a freshly pruned tree once hatched the larvae eat out the trunk and the tree begins a slow death as the bug which can spawn several generations per year inside a tree digs tunnels and spins cocoons from fiber the process can take months or years depending on trunk size various methods are used to contain a local outbreak including chemical pesticide sprays which act as bug repellents for healthy trees but arent allowed in some urban areas and insecticide injections that are meant to kill bugs inside the trunk of an infested tree pheromone traps are used to lure weevils away from affected areas spain became the first european country to have the weevil known there as picudo rojo in the mid s in the government restricted palm importation which helped contain the damage but restrictions were eased in and infected palms have since been imported for developments on the countrys mediterranean coastline about palms have died in spain in the past four years and as many as more are infested estimates michel ferry a french agronomist in elche spain that city alone has lost palms in the past two years he says the weevils are eating into foreigners investments michael hilditch a quarry owner from england and his wife linda bought a villa overlooking the town of nerja in in part because of its nine canary palms in the past three years he has lost six to the weevil a mature canary palm can cost as much as &# to replace and transplanted trees often dont take to new soil a baby palm costs just a few dollars though he maintains a monthly pesticide regimen for the three survivors theyre still in danger mr hilditch recently traced a stray weevil on his terrace to an absentee neighbors palm he climbed over the fence into the neighbors yard and wrapped the tree in plastic until it could be removed disposing of an infected tree is a big production the leaves are cut off cocoons are collected and the tree is covered in plastic if it cant be cut down right away if a tree is left that way too long weevils can eat through the plastic removed tree parts are sprayed with pesticide then collected and burned or chopped up in a huge machine resembling a food processor and buried in torremuelle an unincorporated development started in the s and now home to many northern europeans the responsibility for waging the battle against the weevil has fallen on the volunteer vice president mr schutte glasz a real estate agent born in st petersburg russia has become a sort of resident expert on weevils for the areas homeowners when the palms began dying he contacted spanish entomologists palm specialists and pesticide makers and began advising owners on how to defend their trees he persuaded the nearby city of benalmadena to remove infested trees mr schutte glasz a former opera singer read studies on the weevils behavior and tested its strength he put one in acid it only burned part of its wings froze another in an ice cube when it thawed the creature became reanimated and killed one with a hammer it took five strikes driving in the neighborhood the fast talking year old pointed out the areas dead and dying palms some looked like giant wilted dandelions with drooping dried out leaves others appeared to be green and sturdy but mr schutte glasz could spot even the most subtle signs of infection "once you see symptoms of infestation the tree will die within a few weeks " he says at the home of loretta guidi an english born lawyer an infested canary palm whose crown had collapsed had been marked for demolition by authorities ms guidi says she is thinking of insuring her five other palms most of which were planted by her father more than years ago a healthy palm can live to be or years old when he visited mr schutte glasz noticed worrisome symptoms on another of her trees that seemed healthy to the untrained eye a few leaf tips were sliced and there was a slight tilt of the crown he tugged at the fronds and pulled out a cocoon the prognosis was clear the tree is a goner "theyve been in there for two or three years " he said to ms guidis surprise he recommended that the tree be removed "do you think well beat the beetle " ms guidi asked later "i doubt it " he replied "this is just the beginning "
