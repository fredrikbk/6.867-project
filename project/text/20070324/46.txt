marketwatch weekend investor chinese siren song remember bodisen next time you get the urge to invest in a chinese company with a hot u s traded stock and equally sizzling story remember the name bodisen biotech bodisen is among the swarm of chinese businesses that have become publicly traded companies in this country in recent years by merging into the shells of penny stocks otherwise known as reverse mergers these controversial deals help companies that might not otherwise pass muster with bigger exchanges to get a toehold in the u s mostly via over the counter markets that cater to mostly tiny companies the goal a patina of credibility bodisen is one of the relatively few small chinese companies that managed to pull off that trick in august the american stock exchange listed the stock the company did one better six months later with a much ballyhooed "dual listing" on the london stock exchanges small stock aim market the aim listing coincided with a peak in the companys stock in the u s at slightly above &# and a market value of more than &# million as this column reported on sept not all these small chinese companies are what they appear to be among those the column cited bodisen which despite its name isnt all that engaged in biotech it makes organic fertilizer and not just any organic fertilizer in a annual report filed with the securities and exchange commission bodisen said its "organic fertilizer products" have been "qualified" by the international standards organization sounds impressive but as previously reported in my online marketwatch column an iso spokeswoman said it doesnt certify products it certifies management systems bodisen hasnt publicly responded to the issue its annual filing for last year has been delayed its u s investor relations consultant didnt return phone calls there were other issues as well benjamin wey president of investment banking and consulting firm new york global group made pro bodisen presentations at investor conferences without telling attendees that he was the companys paid adviser bodisen said it "terminated" its relationship with the firm last year after i reported on mr weys presentations moreover mr wey who used to spell his name wei has had several scrapes with securities regulators including in oklahoma while not admitting or denying wrongdoing he has agreed never again to seek to do any brokerage or investment advisory business in that state mr wey didnt return a phone call by mid november bodisen started to unravel disclosing that it had received a letter from the amex seeking more information about its relationship with new york global group it also said the amex "expressed concern" about its internal accounting and financial reporting controls within days the company announced disappointing third quarter results that was followed two months later by the companys warning that its financial results would be disappointing among the reasons from the "truth is stranger than fiction" department road construction in front of one of its factories "which impacted the companys ability to receive supplies and ship products " the final blow came tuesday when the amex halted trading in the stock and bodisen said it expected to be kicked off the exchange the amex declined to comment bodisen shares still trading in london slumped on the news but that wasnt all the company which for months has seen investors from china dump millions of shares said it isnt sure who owns shares that originally were controlled by its current and former ceos bodisen also says it doesnt know whether the holders of those shares can file claims that would "constitute a material liability or materially impact the capitalization of the company " its unclear what that gobbledygook means but its no wonder the stocks trading in the u s remains halted the real shame is that bodisen was ever allowed to trade in the first place herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer and doesnt sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of dow jones which publishes the wall street journal email hgreenberg marketwatch com
