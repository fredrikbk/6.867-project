the week ahead our take on coming events biotechnology hot commodity on wall street usdas crop production report by lauren etter farmers are used to fighting the elements but lately theyve been buffeted by a new weather pattern winds from wall street the ethanol boom has pushed corn prices to near record levels and hedge funds and other hot money have been fueling the fire but lately theyve been pushing the price slightly down as they unload some corn futures positions in anticipation of a report that used to get little attention outside the midwest reaction to the u s department of agricultures "prospective plantings" report normally about as exciting as watching the corn grow is likely to show just how strongly wall street has gripped the corn belt due out friday the report will give a reading on how many acres of corn and soybeans farmers expect to plant this season any surprise in the report could bring a big swing in the price of corn corn has surged to more than &# a bushel up from about &# last year in response to a growing demand for corn based ethanol that new demand has attracted hedge funds pension funds and other speculators to the market further pumping up the price of corn and injecting more volatility into the market since last year open interest in corn futures has increased nearly in recent weeks the noncommercial traders have been selling off their long positions in corn driving the price down corn closed at &# a bushel friday down from &# a bushel last month that suggests investors are worrying the price of corn wont be as bullish as expected the fear is that collectively farmers might get overly excited by the rally plant too much corn and send corn prices plummeting if that happens investors will likely throw money at soybeans instead on the other hand if farmers plant fewer acres of corn than needed prices would skyrocket and funds might pile money back into corn this is the more likely scenario given that demand is coming from so many directions on top of the demand for biofuels corn exports are projected to increase by million bushels over last year its more likely that the big investors have retreated to the sidelines and are waiting for the usda report to guide them theres "a lot of pent up money getting ready to be thrown at this thing " says tim hannagan head grain analyst at chicago based alaron trading for farmers this planting season is perhaps the most important in decades last year million acres of corn were planted early estimates put this years corn crop at around million acres that would push corn acreage to its highest level since the end of world war ii even as wall street looms large farmers wont stop watching the weather forecasters have predicted the arrival of a cool wet spring and a hot dry summer while those would be damning conditions for corn growers directly affected thered be a silver lining for wall street since lower yields would keep corn prices high middle east summit could provide relevance for arab league by bill spindle the arab league has long been among the middle easts most irrelevant institutions often functioning to underscore arab disunity but the state arab leagues gathering on wednesday and thursday is shaping up as a rare moment in the organizations year history a meeting that might actually matter that is largely because of the unusual diplomatic blitz saudi arabias ruler king abdullah bin abdul aziz has orchestrated this year the kings initiatives have put the saudis at the fulcrum of each of the regions knottiest and increasingly intertwined problems these include iran lebanon israel and the palestinians and iraq which essentially constitute the agenda for the arab summit though the diplomatic offensive is saudi the stakes couldnt be higher for the u s and the bush administration whose interests and legacy abroad are closely tied to each item on that list yet president bush has ruled out diplomatic dealings with some of the regions most important players syria hamas hezbollah and iran that has created a void the saudis have filled at the center of much of this activity is prince bandar bin sultan king abdullahs security adviser and former u s ambassador prince bandar has been a close friend and ally of both president bush and his father but lately has had to show some distance in order to cement his relationship with the king that was evident this month when king abdullah invited the two big palestinian factions at each others throats in gaza to the saudi holy city of mecca there he midwifed a palestinian unity government that while dominated by the militant islamist group hamas also includes key members of the secular fatah movement headed by palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas that was quickly given a back of the hand by the bush administration which has refused to deal with the palestinian government while hamas considered a terrorist outfit by the u s is in charge but the unity government has partly ended the palestinian isolation with even the u s agreeing to meet with mr abbass representatives in the government only israel has rejected all contact with the unity government king abdullahs goal for the two day arab league summit is to try to forge a compromise on lebanon with syria that will pave the way for a more or less united arab world then relaunch a bargain the king then as crown prince first put to israel back in withdraw from palestinian territories to the borders before the arab israeli war in exchange for recognition from the arab world and a permanent peace of course every step of that road is rocky the relative peace in lebanon and between palestinian factions remains fraught with tension israel has called parts of king abdullahs arab offer completely unacceptable and the arab side is showing no willingness to alter it but from the uncharacteristic auspices of the arab league optimists hope might emerge a new dynamic that could offer promise telecom gear the new kid is lining up a punch by cassell bryan low the largely invisible but hugely important telecom gear industry gets a long awaited new player this week nokia siemens networks the joint venture of nokia corp and siemens ag officially opens for business april after several months of delays adding a formidable challenger to an already highly competitive market the venture with about billion euros &# billion in annual revenue will be the third largest supplier of telecommunications equipment by sales closely trailing telefon ab l m ericsson of sweden and alcatel lucent of france nokias clout as the worlds largest maker of mobile phones will likely give the joint venture an advantage when selling to telecommunications companies with wireless businesses simon beresford wylie a nokia executive who will head the venture says its scale broad portfolio and industry relationships will help it sell everything from radio base stations that help distribute calls through wireless networks to the gear that enables fixed line operators to offer internet access or television services over telephone lines the deal between the two european titans was agreed to last june as a response to consolidation among competitors including the merger of alcatel sa of paris and u s peer lucent technologies which was announced three months earlier it also came on the heels of consolidation of their customers the large telephone networks and competition from lower cost asian rivals a probe into corruption at siemens pushed back the start date for the venture with nokia originally planned for jan german authorities are focusing on alleged corruption at siemenss telecommunications equipment division the bulk of which will be part of the joint venture with nokia prosecutors suspect siemens officials diverted funds through sham consulting contracts to slush funds to bribe potential customers over several years siemens based in munich says it is cooperating with authorities and beefing up compliance it says any wrongdoing in recent years was the work of renegade managers nokia says the compliance processes at the new venture will be based on its system and practices and nokia siemens networks will have expanded programs for training and approval processes for hiring consultants among other matters the company said in a recent statement that said nokia executives have been frustrated by the delays "we were ready to go on jan " said mr beresford wylie in a recent interview "internally ive talked about frustration and grieving " he said of the delay nokia and siemens each hold a stake in the venture nokia will control four of the seven board seats with nokia chief executive olli pekka kallasvuo holding the chairmanship the venture will be based in nokias hometown of espoo finland nomura analyst richard windsor says the joint venture creates a formidable competitor in the wireless equipment business in part because of nokias strength in a broadband wireless standard known as wcdma the business for fixed line equipment "is more a question mark " he says "in terms of scale it is not going to be anything as big as alcatel lucent and wont have the weight that ericsson has "
