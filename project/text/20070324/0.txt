a triumph for pelosi thats how the associated press described yesterdays vote by the house to demand a u s retreat from iraq and in the perverse calculus of capitol hill we suppose it was speaker nancy pelosi has demonstrated she can pile on enough pork to bribe enough democrats to cobble together a bare partisan majority to "send a message" that has no chance of becoming law congratulations "today is an historic day " ms pelosi said on the house floor "the new congress will vote to end the war in iraq " but of course the bill does nothing of the sort if she truly wanted to end the war the speaker and her fellow democrats could simply have used their power of the purse to refuse to fund it but that would have meant taking some responsibility for what happens in iraq which is the last thing democrats want to do so they have passed a bill that funds the war while claiming it ends the war the bills "benchmarks" and deadlines certainly have nothing to do with achieving victory in iraq or assisting general david petraeuss campaign to secure baghdad they are all about the war inside the democratic caucus on the one hand they appease the antiwar left by pretending to declare the war illegal if certain goals arent met by iraqis or u s forces but on the other they allow "moderates" from swing districts to claim they are nonetheless "supporting the troops " acts of congress dont get much more cynical than that this is not to say the vote wont do considerable harm it will be noted by our enemies in iraq and will encourage them to inflict more casualties to further sour american support it will make it harder for iraq prime minister nouri al maliki to disarm shiite militias who can point to the vote and say the americans will soon be leaving and most disgraceful it will send a message to u s troops that they can fight on albeit without much chance of success and without congressional support the lengths that democratic leaders had to go to win their "triumph" betrayed its cynicism to get her narrow majority of votes ms pelosi and appropriations chairman david obey had to load it up like a farm bill &# million for peanut storage &# million for spinach growers &# million for dairy farmers all told some &# billion in vote buying earmarks of the kind democrats campaigned against last year even at that price they could win over a mere two republicans antiwar members wayne gilchrest of maryland and walter jones of north carolina we hope gop primary voters note those votes well given how the war hurt so many republicans last november this gop solidarity is notable and a credit to the minority leadership president bush was quick to denounce the vote yesterday promising a veto and we hope he keeps it up by bowing to their antiwar left democrats are once again showing that they cant be trusted on national security the president should drive that message home until congress gives him a clean war bill that gives our troops the money to fight our enemies without having to take orders from moveon org
