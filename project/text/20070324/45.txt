pursuits books calibrating deceit the lie detectors by ken alder free press pages &# throughout history people have spent much energy trying to spot lies from the ancient chinese practice of making a suspect chew rice a dry mouth supposedly unmasking a liar to the belief in india that lying makes your toes curl the search for an infallible lie detector has been colorful inventive and often misguided even today a surefire way of catching someone in a lie defined by st augustine as the distance between the public utterance of ones mouth and the secret knowledge of ones heart remains elusive in the early th century however scientists believed that they had found the perfect lie detector the story of how they hawked it using it for everything from crime catching to comic strip plots makes for a rollicking good time in ken alders "the lie detectors " mr alder director of the science in human culture program at northwestern university chooses chapter epigraphs from raymond chandler and dashiell hammett and like those mystery writers he takes as his theme the noir side of the human heart his book is populated by thieves and embezzlers in jazz age berkeley and los angeles by corrupt politicians rapists and murderers in chicago during the depression and world war ii and by traitors ex nazis and communist sympathizers across america during the cold war at the center of the action are leonarde and kay keeler the nick and nora charles of s chicago leonarde was the patentee and promoter of the keeler polygraph a contraption for measuring heart rate and palm sweatiness housed in a beautiful box that "extruded a thin scroll of lightly ruled paper on which two delicate pens left an inky red judgment " he had no formal education but became the "unofficial director" of the scientific crime detection lab at northwestern kay keeler a beautiful strong willed blonde was trained in a related branch of forensic sciences handwriting analysis using their interpretation of physical evidence and employing the polygraph as much for trying to extract confessions as for detecting lies the keelers helped solve some high profile cases of the day including graft in the chicago elections and a bombing by striking united mine workers in in their off hours they drank and cavorted with an endless stream of visitors in their th floor apartment on chicagos gold coast in the year after the screwball comedy "bringing up baby" appeared with katharine hepburn employing a pet leopard to woo cary grant mr adler writes "mr k brought home from the brookfield zoo a six month old baby jaguar which promptly slashed mrs k s stockings ripped her curtains and caused domestic mayhem another choice item for the press " this is typical of the delicious details that the author sprinkles throughout his lively history the keelers divorced in after leonarde had kay followed and uncovered her infidelities a satisfying little irony there the lie detector blindsided by his own wifes prevarications kay still in her s serving in the womens auxiliary service pilots during world war ii died in a plane crash in leonarde died of a stroke in at age along the way leonarde keeler managed to elicit some real venom from his erstwhile colleague john larson who was as staid and stodgy as keeler was flamboyant larson a physiologist who joined the berkeley police force in "the nations first cop with a doctorate a forensic scientist with a restless integrity" had become convinced that scientific methods of measuring pulse rate respiration and other bodily processes could be used to detect deception larsons scientifically inclined police chief encouraged him to collaborate with keeler the son of one of the chiefs friends over time as the mania for lie detection grew larson developed a single minded hatred of keeler and a terror of seeing the polygraph used for purposes beyond his original intent his goal had been not crime busting but diagnosis of the criminal mind a goal that was impossible in its modesty mr adler says since the machine was destined to take on a life of its own to mr alder the lie detector appealed to americans for much the same reason that two other trends were taking hold intelligence testing and workplace efficiency studies all three reflected a desire in the s "to replace personal discretion with objective measures and political conflict with science " just as the polygraph would redefine the lie in yes or no terms "iq redefined intelligence as a single factor g or taylorism redefined the workers task as a series of bodily motions " but all of it iq testing taylorism and the polygraph was a "charade " mr alder writes not science merely "the veneer of science " the american public fell for it out of gullibility and irrational fear "so long as the people fear the lie detector even if they suspect it is hokum they will never succeed in killing it " i enjoyed the authors skepticism toward broad claims of scientific authority for the polygraph and in general i agree with him lie detectors today barely altered from keelers original invention monitor bodily reactions that may correlate with deception or they may simply be the flutters of an honest person who is anxious about being under suspicion lie detector tests can be foiled by the deceitful or the results easily misinterpreted despite my appreciation of his criticism i think mr alder goes a step too far damning all lie detection machines as something akin to frankensteins monster less hyperbolic criticism might have better served his point mr alder ends with a quick description of contemporary efforts at scientific lie detection including the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalograms he leaves it to the reader to draw contemporary analogies to leonarde keelers morality tale but we should be even more wary of these new efforts at lie detection which are especially pernicious because they seem to let us peer directly inside the lying brain ms henig is a new york based science writer whose books include "pandoras baby" and "the monk in the garden "
