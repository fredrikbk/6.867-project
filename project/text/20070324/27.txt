democratic candidates fortunes may hinge on long term iraq plans washington the top contenders for the democratic presidential nomination dont differ much in their prescriptions for iraq over the next months u s troop levels should fall training of iraqi troops should rise and the u s should leave iraqs civil war to the iraqis differences emerge though as talk shifts to what the u s role should be come january when the victor in next years presidential election moves into the white house and that divergence could determine which candidate voters gravitate to as their focus shifts from managing the current situation in iraq to finding solutions to the long term problems presented by the u s presence or its exit for now sen barack obama of illinois and former sen john edwards of north carolina talk as if the war will be over by the next inauguration new york sen hillary rodham clinton says the next president is all but certain to inherit a situation at least as messy as the one today the leading republicans vying for their partys presidential nomination meanwhile all back a continuing troop presence "theres a tendency is some democratic circles to think that somehow iraq wont be an issue for the next president that the u s will be out and the debate will have moved on " said kurt campbell a former pentagon adviser under president clinton who heads a new centrist think tank the center for a new american security "unfortunately thats not likely to be the case " as voters begin to look more closely next year at what the candidates say they would do in iraq if elected the debate is likely to move beyond the current focus on critiquing the bush administration strategy of temporarily boosting troop levels the pivotal themes are likely to focus on how the presidential hopefuls would handle any fallout from a swift pullout from iraq or a continued u s military presence there leaders of the democratic pack have each put forward plans for a troop withdrawal mr edwards has long pushed the most aggressive approach including an immediate withdrawal of to troops mrs clinton and mr obama both backed a resolution defeated in the senate last week that set a goal to have all u s combat troops out of iraq by the end of march the senate proposal called for leaving some troops behind to fight terrorists mrs clinton has elaborated more on the need to preserve some troop presence a position that has drawn criticism from the left the momentum within the democratic party for a troop withdrawal gained force this week not just on the presidential campaign trail but on capitol hill house democrats on friday succeeded for the first time in winning passage of a spending bill for operations in iraq that requires removal of combat troops by september if the iraqi government fails to meet certain requirements but even backers of that legislation acknowledge it is unlikely to become law the more closely divided senate will at most pass a spending bill that would suggest a timeline but avoid a firm deadline and mr bush has made clear he would veto any bill that ties his hands and that he expects to be prosecuting the war through the end of his term "the democrats have adopted the position of not really addressing what the post departure scenario might look like because its very hard to do " said zbigniew brzezinski a national security adviser to president carter who said the u s should pull out "in a reasonably short period of time" in testimony last month before the senate foreign relations committee "naturally they have to argue that the whole vague horror theory wont happen but making the case for a rosier scenario with any specificity also isnt easy " and yet demands for more particulars are only likely to increase as the campaign unfolds in the most recent wall street journal nbc news poll taken earlier this month voters by a wide margin picked iraq as the governments top priority when asked to rank the issues they most wanted the federal government to address named iraq health care the next highest priority was named by just of those surveyed mrs clinton has offered additional details on her vision for iraq and is getting flak from many liberals for her plan the next president she has said "will inherit this situation with all of its complexity and all of its heartbreak " if she were elected she adds she would look after americas "vital national security interests" by leaving a troop presence in iraq well into the future to assure that al anbar province and other areas dont become overrun with al qaeda operatives mrs clinton has resisted posing specifics on troop numbers but her spokesman said she "would leave only a very limited number of u s forces in the region to carry out the reduced mission " mr obama has offered his own bill that calls for pulling out most u s troops by next march while leaving behind an unspecified number of soldiers to protect u s facilities train iraqi troops and "conduct targeted counter terrorism operations " the bill also proposes leaving some troops in the region "to serve as an over the horizon force to prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war " but mr obama continues to play to what his campaign considers his chief strength his early and strong opposition to the invasion though at the time he was an illinois state senator the main slogan on his campaign web site touts how he "opposed the war from the start " but obama aides insist the senator is under no illusions "he is very sober in his assessment of this and makes no bones about the fact that the situation in iraq is something that he would inherit were he to become president " one aide said mr edwards meanwhile has apologized for his senate vote authorizing mr bush to use force against iraq he says his call to immediately withdraw troops would show washington is serious about wanting iraqis to take responsibility for securing their country at the same time mr edwards says congress should cap funding at a level that would allow the bush administration to keep a maximum of troops in iraq while a diplomatic solution is hammered out beyond that he calls for a complete withdrawal of combat troops over the next to months without leaving behind any permanent u s military bases sen joseph biden of delaware though far behind in polls is the only democratic contender so far to have offered up a detailed long term plan for iraq the senate foreign relations committee chairman describes his plan as a middle path between mr bushs current escalation and the approach of his democratic rivals which he describes as "just leave and hope for the best " the biden plan calls for creating three regions for iraqs shiite muslim sunni muslim and kurdish populations and creating an oil sharing agreement that would provide all sides with a revenue base the proposal has drawn few adherents but mr biden hopes it will help him gain momentum in a crowded field mrs clinton and others say the time for such solutions has passed and that the u s no longer has sufficient leverage in iraq to implement such a plan republicans havent been shy about jumping into the breach accusing democrats of focusing entirely on bringing home the troops while ignoring the risks of a swift pullout or the long term u s stakes in the region in calling to keep u s personnel engaged in iraq the republicans leading their primary field cite the potential fallout from a withdrawal while this stance lashes the candidates to a risky policy it also equips them to talk now about how they would deal with their likely choices as president perhaps no candidate has been more hawkish on the potential stakes in iraq than sen john mccain "i cant guarantee success but i can guarantee the consequences of failure " the arizona republican said last month in language echoed by many other republicans "if we leave iraq you would see chaos you would see genocide and sooner or later we would be back " some observers said the lack of a longer range vision among most of the democratic contenders is understandable considering how volatile iraq remains "to talk too specifically now about what one would do in iraq in would be perilous at best " said james steinberg dean of the university of texass lyndon b johnson school of public policy and a former senior adviser to mr clinton but mr steinberg said the picture could soon change as the election draws closer he said all the candidates will acknowledge "that we will still have a significant number of troops there in and that the question then will be how to get them out " military campaign where the top democratic candidates stand on iraq hillary rodham clinton voted for senate resolution authorizing military force in october proposes to begin pulling out troops in days but avoids any set goal for complete withdrawal backs leaving unspecified number of troops in bases north of baghdad john edwards while in senate voted to authorize military force in october has since apologized for his vote proposes an immediate withdrawal of to troops with all combat troops out within months insists no permanent bases be left in iraq barack obama while an illinois state senator opposed invasion from the start calling it a "dumb war" proposes to begin withdrawal by may aims to have all combat troops out by april with a small force left to combat terrorists
