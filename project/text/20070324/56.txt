pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state wax on wax off im a retired american living in france one of the best vineyards in the morgon area has gone to a new style bottle and they use a very hard thick red wax that is almost impossible to remove and when you do lots of the small wax pieces end up in the bottle i managed to cut myself today in the process so i asked my wife to call the owner and ask why they are using it now he didnt really explain but said that i should just pierce the wax on the top of the bottle with my corkscrew and open it as always and the wax would pop off what exactly is the purpose of the red wax wayne a bartsch fontainebleau france over the years weve also struggled with wax cork sealers and weve also wondered why winemakers would make their wines so inaccessible its almost as if theyve issued a challenge how badly do you want to drink this wine just recently john had a devil of a time opening a bottle of chardonnay from californias brewer clifton winery that had a thick wax seal so as it happens john also asked his wife to call the winery and find out what that was all about dottie asked steve clifton half of the brewer clifton winemaking team how the heck you get to the cork "sink the corkscrew into the top and pull it out as though the wax is not there " he said the wax "will always break just at the edge of the glass we do everything we can here completely by hand and literally try not to use electricity so why should the final motion be driven by electricity and machinery each bottle is hand dipped" in nontoxic food grade wax he said mr clifton did offer a tip to make it easier "hold the wax in your hand for about seconds" before opening to warm it up a bit and make it more pliable so we bought another bottle of brewer clifton and tried it with our screwpull the process was slightly ugly little pieces of cork and wax broke off and fell to the table but it worked are old vines better several vineyards now label their wines as derived from old vines and one of these has become my favorite i wonder if you have run across this "old vine" phrase and i wonder what you think susan k ilka grand rapids mich while its certainly not always the case the idea is that older vines produce fewer but better grapes for a variety of reasons the remaining grapes have more concentrated flavor the vines have dug that much deeper through more layers of interesting rock and soil adding to the wines complexity and so on about years old is getting up there for a vine though some wineries claim vines that are more than a century old but heres the problem any winery can put "old vines" on the label there is no legal definition or industry consensus for the term which means wineries can define it however they choose or for that matter just make it up and put it on their labels as a clever marketing gimmick in the long run though all of us need some signs to help us select wines among the thousands at stores and if youve had good luck with wines labeled "old vines " wed urge you to keep trying that
