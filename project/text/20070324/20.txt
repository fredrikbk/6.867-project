fed official sees inflation falling to warns against trying to push it lower underlying inflation is likely to drift down to from its current level of but getting it much lower could prove painful for the economy a federal reserve official said the remarks by fed governor frederic mishkin suggest that getting inflation into what some officials call a "comfort zone" of to could involve prolonged high interest rates and greater unemployment for that reason other officials may prefer a higher comfort zone of around the question is central to the feds current debate over whether to adopt an explicit inflation target and if so what the target should be in a speech prepared for delivery to the federal reserve bank of san francisco friday evening mr mishkin said that in recent decades inflation has become more stable and less likely to rise or fall in response to lower or higher unemployment he attributed that to the feds greater success in adjusting interest rates to alleviate upward and downward pressure on inflation and to the publics expectations of inflation remaining more stable stable inflation expectations mean workers and companies are less likely to press for higher wages and prices in response to a price jump such as from an oil supply disruption thus a rise in inflation is more likely to reverse than to persist he said this means the inflation trend is less likely to rise in response to an overheating economy but once it does much higher interest rates and unemployment would be necessary to nudge it back down mr mishkin noted that surveys of economists and consumers and the inflation indexed treasury bond market suggest the public expects long term inflation of around based on the price index of personal consumption expenditures in january inflation by that measure was excluding food and energy "i think we can be reasonably optimistic that core pce inflation will gradually drift down" from that level mr mishkin said the process may be slowed as "the recent rebound in prices for gasoline and other petroleum products" feeds through into other goods and services but thereafter "we might expect inflation to move into better alignment with long run expectations and thus settle in around " but he said because inflation expectations are anchored at around he is "less optimistic" that actual inflation will "move much below" that level "in the absence of a determined effort by monetary policy a substantial further decline in inflation would require a shift in expectations and such a shift could be difficult and time consuming "
