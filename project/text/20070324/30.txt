hot topic europe old and new preparations for the european unions big th birthday party this weekend in berlin quickly degenerated into a petty brawl over the wording of the declaration for the occasion some countries wanted to push the blocs stillborn constitution others the euro still others christianity what a fitting tribute to the eus achievement were not kidding such intramural trench warfare be it over joint statements or milk quotas is blessedly far removed from the wars that characterized the five decades before the eus birth whatever its shortcomings the eu can justly claim credit for helping bring peace and prosperity to the continents million citizens the eus seeds were planted in by the franco german statesman robert schuman his proposal for pooling strategic resources coal and steel among a core of european countries would in his words "make it plain that any war between france and germany becomes not only unthinkable but materially impossible " the schuman declaration led to the european coal and steel community in which in turn paved the way for the treaty of rome that created a european community later christened "union " though it wont be widely noted in berlin this weekend the union would not exist without the u s which gave its strong backing from day one the marshall plan assisted the continents postwar economic recovery and an american military umbrella has since kept it safe whatever the trade or foreign policy disagreements washington hasnt wavered in its support for a stable rich europe this success has sometimes gone to european heads some in brussels truly believe they have created a soft power utopia that can talk its way out of any trouble such as a nuclear iran or islamic terrorism in reality its peace has always depended on the will to spend blood and treasure often american others especially the french imagine europe as a check on the u s "hyperpower " both delusions have helped keep the eu a small fry in foreign affairs to become a more mature player europeans will have to pull their weight in the likes of nato fortunately the eus power of attraction has been effective closer to home what begun as a club of six has grown to from greece spain and portugal in the s to the new members from the old warsaw pact the eu has smoothed the path from authoritarianism to free market democracy the blocs economic record is mixed this is still a europe of wasteful farm subsidies low growth and high unemployment with rising protectionism and a regulatory zeal unmatched anywhere in the free world yet the bad ideas tend to come from bad leaders when the brussels bureaucracy and dreams of creating a super state are checked by a vigilant media and national governments the europe construct itself can be market friendly in the past two decades the eu on balance has done more to open the door to greater competition than provide a back door as margaret thatcher feared for welfare policies why most crucially the treaty of rome was inspired by free market principles the eu is the worlds largest zone for the free movement of goods capital and people when individual countries have tried to blunt those freedoms brussels has often fought back with vigor the euro the worlds most successful currency union has lowered interest rates promoted internal trade by removing exchange rate risks and especially in the latin countries made it impossible for governments to inflate their way out of trouble europes diversity and growing size are also strengths for each dysfunctional italy theres a booming britain or estonia or denmark showing how market friendly policies pay dividends in a wider europe good ideas squeeze out the bad the eastern europeans have popularized low and flat taxes boom town london is home to hundreds of thousands of poles and frenchmen whose departure is an electoral issue in their native countries where politicians are realizing they must compete to keep their brightest at home on the edges of the continent a half circle running from spain to ireland to finland and down to eastern europe is a zone of strong economic growth in the middle the big powers of france italy and germany cry out for deeper overhauls as long as those economies are weak voters will be anxious about global competition and in turn skeptical about opening europe further this explains the current unease about further eu enlargement particularly to turkey and the backlash against freeing trade in services and cross border takeovers the continents leaders could do worse than use their berlin party this weekend to send the message that europes traditional openness to trade people new countries is the cornerstone of a half century of success these first principles from years ago are still worth fighting for
