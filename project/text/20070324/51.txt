pursuits books in a burmese prison an imagined life the lizard cage by karen connelly doubleday pages &# it is an unfortunate truth that of all the human rights atrocities that ever come to light in the world most end up as footnotes in government or ngo reports only the hardiest horrific few prompt calls to action real life tales of murder rape and violent incarceration are interchangeable items of news passing mentions on the bbc world service if that in the case of burma now officially named myanmar the atrocities have been going on for so long and have been committed with such awful regularity and sameness that they have come to seem as much a feature of the burmese landscape as the monsoon when the world becomes thus inured to the ghastly crimes of faraway regimes it is left to artists writers and filmmakers to re engage our attention karen connelly does exactly this with "the lizard cage " a thrilling depressing vital excoriation of the military junta that has ruled burma for decades the book is set in a prison close to rangoon sometime in the mid s the prison cells groan with supporters of aung san suu kyi the pro democracy activist and nobel laureate who lives under house arrest none of the prisoners is more famous than a man named teza a singer who has been banished to solitary confinement ms connellys minute attention to the hell of prison life is both repulsive and compelling teza fights to retain his identity in the face of repeated beatings starvation and appalling filth his poignant recollections of life before his imprisonment his girlfriend his mother the simple enjoyment of food and bathing are almost as hard to bear as the punishment scenes ms connelly also creates an extraordinary cast of prison grotesques including a tattooed gangster who spends his days having young boys walk up and down his back and a toothless duplicitous soothsayer who will betray anyone to reduce his sentence the regime has made wretches of them all the warders are violent machinating or guilt ridden while the prisoners struggle to survive as best they can caught in the middle of this misery is a year old boy orphaned when his father a low ranked prison warder is run over by a truck he makes his home in a shack at the edge of the prison and spends his days running errands avoiding the gaze of the deviant prison cook he does not even imagine escaping this hell until he is encouraged by teza and a sympathetic guard ms connellys novel is grounded in the accounts of those who survived burmas jails and escaped to the thai border she spent two years on the border living among the exiles her language and imagery evoke the short stories and poems that trickle out of burma by turns fearful and violent beautiful and rancid they speak equally of spiritual and physical escape the one always possible even when the other is forcibly denied reading "the lizard cage" is an uncomfortable experience not least because we do so in the knowledge that burma has not changed mr delves broughton is a writer in new york
