when price fixing makes sense bad law like a bad habit can be hard to break that adage will be tested on monday when the supreme court hears arguments in leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc a case that gives the court an opportunity to take a year old thorn from the side of american business leegin a small california manufacturer sells its brighton brand of leather belts handbags and other accessories through specialty stores across the country ten years ago the company began insisting that retailers respect its suggested minimum prices a strategy that helped the company carve out a niche among larger and better known brands in the competitive market for womens fashion accessories when leegin suspended shipments to texas based retailer psks for violating its pricing policy psks sued leegin under the sherman act this fight may look like an obscure skirmish between small players at a fringe of the fashion industry but it could bring about a major change in the law the case challenges one of antitrust laws oldest and most unreasonable doctrines laid down in dr miles medical co v john d park &amp son that resale price maintenance rpm agreements are illegal per se a blanket condemnation without regard for circumstances despite criticism from businessmen economists and lawyers the rule has survived almost a century dr miles sold patent medicines through a network of wholesalers and retailers under contracts specifying what prices could be charged to others park &amp sons purchased the medicines and resold them for less dr miles sued park parks defense was that the contracts were illegal restraints of trade the supreme court agreed with park declaring it illegal per se for companies to control the prices retailers charge consumers the decision was a mistake that has plagued antitrust law and american business ever since manufacturers have no interest in suppressing price competition to help increase profits for retailers a manufacturer with a meaningful monopoly can extract all of his potential profit from controlling the prices and quantities at which he sells and would have no concern for the prices charged downstream prices for products that dont have market power are constrained by forces outside the manufacturers control in either case the supreme court in miles misunderstood how markets work the context for rpm agreements also doesnt fit the supreme courts assumption that manufacturers were enforcing conspiracies among retailers rpms are common in markets where there is almost no possibility of effective cartels and typically concern products that arent likely vehicles for suppressing retail competition as in leegin the products protected from price cutting generally dont dominate markets rpms serve a different end they promote brand loyalty and thus brand value in highly competitive markets for differentiated but still largely substitutable products while manufacturers can do much to establish brand value not all of the factors influencing brand value are easily within a manufacturers control retailers can help or hurt by tilting sales toward or away from a brand through their choices on how to display it promote it service it or provide information about it all actions that affect consumers perceptions of product quality by reducing price competition among a brands retailers the rpm provides a profit margin that can make such brand enhancing behavior affordable and prevent competitors from free riding on a retailers investment in such behavior the makers of some brands succeed in the market by reducing price aggressively others by providing higher quality products the ability to choose from more products marketed in more varied ways provides options to serve a broad spectrum of consumer tastes and values including the values of economizing on their time of making products easier to understand and to use or of generating straightforward financial savings other antitrust doctrines allow manufacturers to lawfully promote brand value companies can vertically integrate manufacturing and retail operations they can also establish exclusive retail territories or require retailers to provide certain kinds of information or services to consumers who buy their goods they can even operate certain kinds of rpm programs that avoid agreement with retailers while most manufacturers with rpms are shy about publicity the ford motor company used to employ them to protect dealers who actually had to teach people to drive today the well known golf company ping uses rpms to give retailers incentive to invest in learning how to fit its clubs to players all of these practices used to be condemned under per se rules but the supreme court pulled back leaving determination of a particular practices legality to a "rule of reason" analysis balancing benefits to and burdens on consumers and competition the change recognized a consensus among scholars and judges that conduct promoting inter brand competition such as coke versus pepsi can be far more valuable to consumers than its cost in reduced intra brand competition but it left the dr miles rule as a land mine in this area of the law requiring expensive legal advice to avoid it prompting litigation for those who came near it and on occasion blowing up efforts to promote brands that increase consumer choice and economic value it is time now to give antitrust law another purgative taking dr miless per se rule off the books the leegin case gives the court an opportunity to promote competition and legal certainty thats good medicine for the economy as well mr cass is chairman of the center for the rule of law and dean emeritus of boston university school of law
