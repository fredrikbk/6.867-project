river road small cap value up in is in the top of funds in morningstar inc s "small value" category those that primarily buy shares of smaller companies that are deemed inexpensive based on factors such as share price to earnings per share aston river road dynamic equity income was up in it buys stocks of various sizes and morningstar currently classifies it as a midsize value fund where its return puts it in the first percentile of that category reflecting investors huge appetite for small stock funds as the category has outperformed for much of the past five years the small cap offering

million or so in accounts for pension funds endowments and other institutional investors the dynamic equity income mutual fund is much smaller at &# million while institutional accounts following its

out the small cap funds team the dynamic equity income fund looks for stocks with high yields dividend per share divided by the stock price as well as an opportunity for capital appreciation mr beck says "we target a minimum yield of " and "we look for stocks that are trading at a minimum of cents or less on the &# " in terms of how the managers see them properly valued also required an attractive business model and shareholder oriented management as of oct the fund had more than two thirds of its money in the financial sector and about in energy stocks top holdings included barclays

were rebranded when the amsterdam financial services company completed the sale of its u s mutual fund business to highbury financial inc of denver and the funds became part of its aston asset management llc unit of chicago while many asian funds focus on shares of rapidly expanding companies in the up and coming region matthews asia pacific equity income fund goes an old fashioned route it scouts for dividend paying shares the fund launched oct is the ninth offered by matthews asian funds of san francisco which morningstar calls a "first rate asian boutique " the &# million fund draws on matthews investment staff with professionals experienced living or working in asia researching potential holdings the new offering is philosophically close to matthews asian growth &amp income fund that fund owns many dividend paying common and preferred stocks making it "much tamer than most of its rivals " according to a november morningstar report in return for reduced volatility the fund has tended "to lag during strong rallies " as it did in and though it "has gained much more than the majority of its peers over the long run " the &# billion fund is closed to new investors neal frankle president of wealth resources group of woodland hills calif says dividend paying stocks "by nature are going to be companies that are a little more conservative " making the new fund a potentially interesting play for some risk averse investors david snowball who reviews funds in the annex section of fundalarm com a free web site about mutual funds likes the focus on dividends the fund is "apt to have moderate risk and offers the services of one of the best regional investment teams " he wrote last month lead manager is andrew t foster who also works on two other matthews funds morningstar notes that he has been with the firm since except for a break to earn a graduate business degree the funds biggest holdings as of nov included hong kong banking company hsbc holdings contract chip maker taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co and telecommunications company chunghwa telecom of taiwan the three countries with the biggest representations were japan at china hong kong at and taiwan at jesper madsen who co manages the fund anticipates japan may be better represented going forward "with the dismantlement of cross shareholdings and strengthening of minority shareholders in japan weve started seeing these companies move away from very low fixed dividend payments to now talking more about payout ratios and giving minority shareholders greater access to earnings " he says mr madsen says the investment team also seeks to lower risk by meeting with management of companies whose shares are bought "we have all the access we can wish for " he says however he notes that asia is volatile and investors should go in with open eyes the new fund carries a of assets expense ratio below the average asia stock fund ratio of wasatch advisors a salt lake city investment firm founded in believes "the more people looking at the problem the more likely to come up with a solution " says samuel s stewart jr lead manager of wasatch strategic income fund that is one reason there are people working on the &# million fund launched last february wasatch strategic income also seeks safety by focusing on income producing stocks "our point of distinction isnt on the stock size its on the ability to pay a growing dividend " says mr stewart a former chief financial analyst at a division of the securities and exchange commission the fund prefers stocks with a dividend yield of about to while every stock doesnt have that yield those with lower yields are expected to increase dividends he says the fund can also own bonds mr snowball likes that the fund aims to "systematically combine and periodically re weight three distinct sorts of income producing investments" blue chip stocks with relatively strong dividend yields shares of rapidly expanding companies that dont throw off a lot of income but are positioned to do so and value stocks that throw off a lot of current income and have the potential for a rebound "you wouldnt expect all three of those sorts of investments to be firing at the same time but you would expect that at least one of them would be hot in a capital appreciation sense at any given time and all of them would be paying you as you wait " he says this approach he adds contrasts with many mutual funds that "stock their portfolios with similar stocks " mostly large cap value shares with relatively modest dividend yields "which tend to cluster in two or three predictable areas like financials and utilities " that said the funds heaviest concentration as of sept was in the financial services sector at nearly among top holdings real estate investment trust redwood trust inc credit card and financial services firm capital one financial corp and home mortgage lender countrywide financial corp the fund is part of an evolution of wasatchs
