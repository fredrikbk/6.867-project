number of failed sites out of its magazines and some like office pirates from scratch and aol has had only mixed results with its content plays with less fanfare however turner has developed two of

of from more than annually a decade ago has forced the company and its rivals to look hard for other revenue streams unlike competitor viacom inc the parent of mtv nickelodeon and several other cable properties turner doesnt own most of the content that appears on its biggest networks tbs and tnt that means it cant repackage much of its television programming which includes popular sitcoms like "seinfeld" and dramas such as "law &amp order " for the web or mobile devices "turner is being forced to look elsewhere in businesses where theyre not as established " says pali research analyst
