bold redesign improves office but learning curve may be too steep for some users ribbon replaces menus next to the web browser microsoft office is probably the most used computer software product in the world its three main components word excel and powerpoint are the top business applications on computers and the fourth pillar of office microsoft outlook is the leading email calendar and contacts program so when microsoft makes significant changes to office its a big deal and the latest version of the software suite called office due out jan is a radical revision the most dramatic overhaul in a decade or more i dont use the word "radical" lightly the entire user interface the way you do things in these familiar old programs has been thrown out and replaced with something new in word excel and powerpoint all of the menus are gone every one none of the familiar toolbars have survived either in their place is a wide tabbed band of icons at the top of the screen called the ribbon and there is no option to go back to the classic interface in outlook the ribbon hasnt kicked out the menus and toolbars in the programs main screens but if you compose an email or set up a new contact or appointment youll see it as if this werent enough microsoft has also changed the standard file format for office files older versions of office on both windows and macintosh computers wont be able to read these new file types without special conversion software the new version can however read files created in the older versions on both windows and mac without any conversion software these changes in office while much less publicized are far bolder and more important than the mostly cosmetic user interface changes in the highly hyped new version of windows called vista which comes out on the same day after months of working with the ribbon and other new features of office i believe they are an improvement they replace years of confusing accretions with a logical layout of commands and functions they add easy and elegant new options for making documents look good and they make it much simpler to find many of the commands that office offers but had buried in the past so microsoft deserves credit for being bold and creative in designing office it has taken a good product and made it better and fresher but there is a big downside to this gutsy redesign it requires a steep learning curve that many people might rather avoid in my own tests i was cursing the program for weeks because i couldnt find familiar functions and commands even though microsoft provides lots of help and guidance its as if toyota decided to switch the position of choices on the automobile shift lever or motorola decided to rearrange the buttons on the cellphone key pad even if the companies could conclusively show that the changes made life easier many people would be annoyed at best and furious at worst in the case of the new office i think the changes are most beneficial for users concerned with the layout and design of documents the commands that are now better arranged and easier to find are mainly those that relate to formatting layout graphics and design by contrast basic composition and editing are aided by the new design either very little or not at all if you mostly compose plain word documents simple presentations and plain spreadsheets the new design may not be worth the effort to master it and you might want to stick with an older version of office people with the new version will still be able to read your documents and you can get free conversion software so you can read new files the other group of users who might be better off skipping office are power users who know many commands and have customized their menus and toolbars heavily the new office is much less customizable in fact you cant customize the ribbon to add favorite commands all you can do is customize a tiny minitoolbar in the upper left corner of the screen called the quick access toolbar for people who mostly control office via keyboard commands and rarely use menus and toolbars all of the basic keyboard commands are the same there are other nice additions in word outlook and powerpoint there is now contextual spell checking which points to a wrong word even if the spelling is in the dictionary for example if you type "their" instead of "theyre " office catches the mistake it really works in addition throughout office there is a function that translates a word or sentence into other languages in powerpoint and excel there are new better looking graphics for charts and tables and all the programs have live preview a feature long offered by wordperfect which shows a formatting change before you commit to it you can see what a new font or style would look like by hovering over the choice with the mouse outlook the least changed of the programs finally catches up to other email programs with a fast search capability and the ability to preview attachments without opening them but the ribbon is the biggest change its essentially a super toolbar divided into seven logical tabs which attempt to group similar commands each tab brings up a new version of the ribbon common file handling functions like open save and print arent on the ribbon they are accessed by clicking on a big round icon at the upper left called the office button which is roughly the equivalent of the old file menu clicking the office button also displays a much larger and longer list of recently opened files than the old file menu did and you can even permanently "pin" files to this list theres no doubt that some functions are quicker and easier in the new interface narrowing the margins in a word document now takes as few as three clicks compared with up to clicks and keystrokes in old versions applying styles to a word document is also easier the ribbon has a bunch of them in the home tab illustrated with big square icons that show what they look like and you can just click and apply the one you want but some less common tasks are harder without the old menus and tool bars such as adding a new word to the auto correct system like a lot of things in office over the years the new file formats have been instituted mainly to aid big corporations and organizations for consumers and small businesses the main benefit of the new formats is to shrink file sizes but that benefit is likely to be far outweighed by the hassles and incompatibilities they introduce luckily you can set up office to ignore the new formats and save your files in the old formats to be read without conversion software but some new formatting features may not be usable in the old formats free conversion software is available now at office microsoft com click on the downloads tab and select microsoft office file formats compatibility pack mac office users will have to wait until later in the year for microsoft to release converters that will allow their version of office to read the new file formats but a third party conversion program for word files only has already been released its called docxconverter and can be downloaded at www panergy software com for &# in another move that will likely annoy many consumers microsoft has stripped outlook from the low price home version of office this version which costs &# and can be used on up to three computers was formerly called student and teacher edition and now has been renamed home and student formerly you were supposed to have either a student or a teacher in your household to buy it though stores never checked this now that pretense has been dropped but this edition of office has been made less valuable for many folks it still includes word excel and powerpoint but now instead of outlook it has onenote a very nice program for creating and organizing notes and other research materials many home users would prefer outlook but to get outlook in office you either have to buy office standard for &# or buy a standalone version of outlook for &# if youd like to get more out of office especially in the area of how your documents look office is a big step forward and worth the steep learning curve it imposes if youre happy with office now or you mostly create plain documents where formatting and design arent high priorities it may not be worth the effort to buy and learn the new version
