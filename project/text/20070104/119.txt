ritual sacrifice not on my street some belgians say muslim tradition stirs ire of animal activists seat belting a sheep brussels at a slaughterhouse here last week mohamed mimoun wrestled a sheep between his legs and took a number he gasped it was a two hour wait to sacrifice his animal for eid al adha an important islamic religious festival "i should have done this at home like everyone else " he moaned that would have saved mr mimoun a long wait in drenching rain but it would have been against the law killing an animal at home to eat it is legal in belgium but a law expressly forbids the ritual slaughter of animals at home living cheek by jowl in brussels with the many bureaucrats who run the european union muslims in the city turned an estimated sheep toward mecca this year and cut their throats to celebrate the story of abrahams willingness to sacrifice his son to god eid al adha commemorates gods reprieve which allowed abraham to kill a ram instead of his son while some like mr mimoun head to official slaughterhouses many muslims fearing long waits kill their sheep illegally in their backyards and basements instead whether at a slaughterhouse or at home the practice raises the ire of animal rights activists for years they have held anguished protests against the manner in which the sheep are slaughtered arguing that the sheep should be stunned first to lessen their pain "its not normal to have thousands of sheep slaughtered like this in the middle of a major european city " says ann de greef a belgian animal rights campaigner on his way to the slaughterhouse mr mimoun was fined by a policewoman for transporting a live sheep in the closed trunk of his toyota by law it should have been in the back seat "she told me i needed to have a seat belt on the sheep " mr mimoun said the policewoman later said she was joking about the seat belt brussels muslim population has grown to more than of the citys one million inhabitants and what began two decades ago as a debate over animal welfare and hygiene has been transformed into a test of political might the result is a stalemate "we have the right to practice our religion " says coskun beyazgul head of the muslim executive office a state sponsored islamic authority while muslim authorities in france sanction the use of electronic stunning methods muslim authorities in belgium forbid it for the sacrifice to be completed in accordance with islam says mr beyazgul the lamb must die from a loss of blood while its head is turned toward mecca in saudi arabia birthplace of the prophet muhammad stunning the animals before slitting their throats he says could lead to the animal dying prematurely against islamic principles mr beyazgul is also against making donations of money to charity in lieu of sacrificing a live animal as many muslims do in the u s and other countries he adds that muslims here ignore the home slaughtering ban because belgian authorities arent willing to invest in enough capacity at legal slaughtering facilities while similar conflicts play out across europe the tensions are particularly acute in brussels europes political capital unlike france and other nations with large muslim minorities muslims in belgium arent concentrated in ghettos outside major cities they often live side by side with eu officials and other professionals in gentrifying urban neighborhoods one man got his lamb home last year on a leash "it looked like his pet " says pierre yves lambert a local political commentator and social worker "but everyone knew where it was going " to ease the strain on slaughterhouses city leaders have suggested the muslim community spread out the sacrifice over the three days of the festival which ended this year on jan nothing doing says mr beyazgul "everyone wants to kill their sheep in the morning of the first day " he says "they want to eat their sheep for lunch " the rush to slaughter so many sheep within hours led to catastrophe during last years festival a temporary slaughterhouse became overwhelmed with long lines and malfunctioning water and drainage systems in a hurry to get home some celebrants began slaughtering sheep on top of live sheep as large pools of blood formed in response belgian politician jean marie dedecker last year introduced a bill that would have required muslims to stun the sheep before killing them muslims protested and the bill died mr dedecker who hails from belgiums dutch speaking north blames laurette onkelinx belgiums justice minister and a french speaking socialist for its defeat "most of the muslims speak french and vote for the socialists and ms onkelinx needs their votes to stay in office " he says representatives of ms onkelinx did not return phone calls ms de greef and her group global action in the interest of animals scored a win in when they successfully sued to stop municipal authorities from placing collection bins on city streets for animals remains providing such bins is tantamount to sanctioning illegal home sacrifice she says "the muslims portray this as an attack on their religion " says ms de greef "but we think the law is for everybody " still authorities in several towns outside brussels continued to provide waste bins for last weeks festival drawing protests from ms de greefs group more than sheep were sacrificed in belgium this year for the religious festival mr beyazgul said but for muslims like year old mr mimoun who want to slaughter their sheep in legal facilities the annual festival can be costly mr mimoun paid a farmer &# for his sheep then he paid &# to have a certified muslim sacrificateur perform the ritual killing for him at the slaughter facility and hell have to pay a fine the amount of which will be determined by a judge for transporting the animal in the trunk of his car but mr mimoun who moved to belgium from morocco when he was years old said it was worth it "i am a belgian this is europe i respect the law " he said besides he added "i dont like blood "
