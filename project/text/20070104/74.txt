mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q in your column on high definition digital video recorders last week you compared the latest tivo model with a comcast recorder but cant you also record high definition programs with a windows computer a today a windows xp media center computer can receive and record high definition programs but only those broadcast over the air starting next month there will be some computers equipped with microsofts new vista version of windows that will be able to receive and record high definition programs from cable channels the upside of this compared with tivo and many cable company dvrs is that theres no monthly dvr fee beyond your regular cable bill however there are some downsides as with the new tivo you will have to call your cable company to have them send someone out to install gadgets called "cable cards" in these computers and as with the tivo these cable cards dont allow the vista pc to support certain interactive cable features like on demand programming also you will either have to connect this new pc directly to your tv something relatively few people have been willing to do in their living rooms or buy an additional "extender" box or buy an xbox game machine which can act as an extender box these extenders connect the pc acting as a dvr to your tv over your home network finally unlike a tivo or a cable company box these tv connected vista pcs will have to be maintained like any normal windows computer with all of the software updates security alerts and the like things people dont normally associate with their tv experience q can you explain what is the best way to convert old vhs c tapes to dvd a you have a couple of options you could send the tapes to a service that performs such conversions one that i have tested and like is called yesvideo it operates through retail photo stores where you drop off the tapes information and store locations are at yesvideo com some other companies let you ship tapes directly for conversion to dvd one is called nettapes at nettapes com however i havent tested nettapes and cant recommend it the other option is to buy a combo vcr dvd unit that has the ability to record or "dub" from the tape side to the dvd side i have tested some of these and they work ok just make sure the one you get can handle vhs c tapes q i have a windows pc at work using outlook which syncs with my palm treo i am using a macintosh at home do you have any suggestions about syncing with the mac i am not really happy with the mac version of the palm desktop which is all that palms mac software allows a theres a mac program called the missing sync that will allow you to synchronize a treo with apples own calendar and address book it can also synchronize photos music and folders and files between a mac and a treo it works either wirelessly or via a cable information and downloads are at markspace com theres also a version of the missing sync that allows synchronizing a mac with a windows mobile device including the palm treo w and the motorola q and if you want to sync a blackberry with a mac you can use a program called pocketmac available at pocketmac net i have tested the missing sync with a treo and it worked fine for me i havent tested pocketmac or the windows mobile version of the missing sync and thus cant recommend them
