quarterly mutual funds review hunting for returns picking a rocket ship carefully on a wild bond ride many scared investors quit with bad timing bonds took investors on a wild ride last year for individuals who bought or sold bond mutual funds the experience underscores the importance of matching what you own to your tolerance for risk and your investment horizon during the years first half top quality bonds such as treasurys performed dismally as inflation reared rising inflation erodes the value of the fixed rate payments that bonds make and many investors responded by selling bonds and consequently driving up yields which move inversely to bond prices for investors who remained in bond mutual funds that eroded total returns the overall gain or loss in a fund based on interest it collects and changes in the value of the bonds it owns investors have little patience for investments that dont do well according to numbers from amg data services of arcata calif many exited bond funds by early summer their timing couldnt have been worse inflation fears eased in august as energy prices fell sparking a big rally in bonds some funds then saw big inflows too late for the years best gains bonds arent flashy but over long periods the interest they pay accumulates to pocket those returns though you need to pick a fund you can stick with through market cycles you need to tuck it away and then go out and get a life people who may need to cash out in a year or two shouldnt buy funds that invest in longer bond maturities which tend to be more volatile rapidly moving in or out amounts to a wager on the direction and timing of interest rate moves something even professionals can flub "trying to time any market isnt a good game to play but folks do it anyway " says brian white a mutual fund specialist at brokerage ryan beck &amp co of new york "we preach a long term approach " it is also important to understand what bonds can and cant do having some money in bonds can reduce volatility in a diversified portfolio but bond gains will lag behind those of stocks in a strong stock market "bonds that are yielding cant deliver double digit returns " says mary miller head of fixed income investments at t rowe price associates inc risk averse investors might consider shorter maturity funds which are designed to generate decent returns through market cycles charles schwab yieldplus fund looks for attractive returns in sectors such as corporate and mortgage backed securities notes kim daifotis who heads the bond group at schwabs investment management arm among similar funds morningstar inc recommends fidelity ultra short bond and payden limited maturity you also can net good yields and avoid mistimed moves with a fund that invests in a wide range of sectors aig sunamerica strategic bond and t rowe price spectrum income are broadly diversified and periodically adjust allocations but not by huge amounts they take the worry out of where to go in the bond universe keep in mind that bond funds arent without risk although individual bonds pay back your upfront stake at redemption bond funds dont have a final maturity you can lose money in a bond fund if you invest as interest rates are heading upward and bond prices are falling the interest rate outlook remains clouded many wall street economists believe the u s expansion is slowing enough to let the federal reserve begin cutting short term rates by around mid yet last month years after the fed began raising rates in this cycle fed officials continued to warn that more rate increases may be needed to contain inflation "this story has been going on for so long that we call it goldilocks and the bears " says richard mercante senior managing director at aig global investment group in this climate it isnt a bad idea to keep some funds in a money market savings account or mutual fund such accounts can yield around more than some types of bonds and your principal amount wont fluctuate with market movements but once short term rates eventually start falling which would happen if the fed starts easing monetary policy to avert a recession bond funds could perform better than money market offerings indeed investors who switched to money market funds when the fed was starting to raise rates may have missed an opportunity an analysis by usaa investment management of san antonio texas suggests from mid through last august usaa income funds cumulative return totaled nearly in contrast a return in a money market fund in that span would have totaled about it calculates both figures assume reinvestment of all interest paid money market rates rose slowly during that period starting from a low level but even now that such rates are higher the usaa fund still has an advantage says manager didi weinblatt it benefits from the higher yields paid by the investment grade corporate bonds that make up the biggest portion of its holdings one oil company bond the fund bought in yields if investors stick with a bond fund for at least several years the compounding of those yields will generate enough income to offset dips in share value ms weinblatt says "but to get the income you have to be there "
