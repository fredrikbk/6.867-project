politics &amp economics business mobilizes to defend turf firms plot campaigns to counter effects of democrats agenda the industries that expect to take the biggest hits from the new democratic congress are scrambling their marketing public relations and advertising forces to shore up their defenses eager to demonstrate a sharp contrast with republicans who dominated capitol hill for years new democratic leaders are vowing to raise the federal minimum wage reduce oil company subsidies give the government bargaining authority in purchasing medicare prescription drugs shrink student loan fees and impose mandatory controls on emissions of carbon dioxide and other so called greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change the worried industries and their trade groups are responding by hiring new lobbying talent planning mass market ad campaigns and in some cases focusing on getting goodies attached to legislation that they would rather see killed but know they cant stop the petroleum industry for example is preparing an ad campaign that seeks to justify oil companies huge size and profits the drug industry is weighing a mass media counterattack of its own emphasizing the good performance of the medicare prescription drug program student loan titan sallie mae is rallying grass roots support from college administrators small business representatives are talking up tax breaks to offset what appears to be an inevitable increase in the minimum wage many businesses "are gearing up to respond" both to unfriendly legislation and to the prospect of congressional investigations says george crawford a former top aide to new house speaker nancy pelosi now with the law firm of king &amp spalding in washington he has attracted some big new clients in recent months including exxon mobil corp and drug maker amgen inc many businesses may find it challenging to win new allies among congressional democrats the petroleum industry for example was demonized as "big oil" by democrats last summer as gasoline prices soared now it faces vows by ms pelosi to move quickly to roll back oil company subsidies and use the money to establish a fund for wind solar and other alternative energy sources democrats are targeting breaks that include tax incentives for geologic research to find oil and favorable royalty deals for domestic oil production while details remain in flux some environmentalists estimate the changes would cost the industry &# billion to &# billion in the next decade in response the american petroleum institute will wage an image improvement campaign on television and in newspapers to show why big oil needs to be big "were now in a global market whether people like it or not " says red cavaney the groups president the industry contends that private companies hold only about of the worlds oil reserves and that to get access to more oil companies need to form partnerships with government owned oil companies which sit on about of proven reserves to do that mr cavaney says companies must show they have the capital and expensive oil finding technology to produce the oil other energy interests are focused on highlighting the costs of climate change proposals the national mining association which represents coal mining companies and mining equipment makers recently met with about staffers from the congressional energy committees to show off new tools the industry hopes lawmakers will use in writing legislation one is a new computer model that according to the association calculates the cost of climate change proposals for example a mandatory cap on coal emissions will produce higher electricity prices and job losses at companies that may have to shut down or move overseas because of rising energy costs according to luke popovich spokesman for the association the utilities lobby lead by the edison electric institute will deal with emissions controls by emphasizing its efforts to promote energy efficiency and suggesting ways the government could help the industry get new technology that reduces pollution drug companies and labor intensive businesses such as retailers and restaurants also stand to lose out in the democratic agenda house democrats have promised to pass an increase in the minimum wage to &# from the current &# they also have vowed to give the government the authority to bargain with pharmaceutical companies over medicare drug prices that was barred in a republican written law passed three years ago already critics of a minimum wage increase including the u s chamber of commerce retailers and small business groups are sensing defeat and focusing on securing the best deal they can in whatever legislation passes "were working with the administration and members of both sides to minimize the damage " with offsets such as tax breaks and regulatory relief says john gay senior vice president for government affairs at the national restaurant association mr gay says he realized the political world had changed when kentucky sen mitch mcconnell the new senate republican leader said after the november elections that he wanted to reach a deal with the democrats on the minimum wage and just before the holiday break president bush said in the strongest terms yet that he supports a &# increase in the minimum wage if it is paired with more help for the small businesses that will be disproportionately affected small business advocates such as the national federation of independent business want any minimum wage bill to increase the amount of new equipment their members can write off completely for tax purposes in the first year as opposed to depreciating over a number of years restaurateurs are pressing for a broadening of another tax incentive involving the accelerated depreciation of additions and renovations and some business interests are pushing for a three year rather than two year phase in of any increase in the minimum wage house democrats hope they can win a minimum wage boost without the concessions "give us a clean vote on our issue and dont tie us to other things that muddy the water " says rep dennis moore of kansas but industry lobbyists say democratic leaders acknowledge privately that a deal with industry is likely to be necessary to get the measure through the closely divided senate where votes are required to pass almost anything in contrast to those opposing the minimum wage issue the outlook for drug companies is brighter while a proposal to allow the government to bargain with drug makers over medicare drug prices is likely to pass the house it could face a tougher time in the senate the drug industry will argue that the prescription drug benefit has worked better than expected is popular with seniors and that congress shouldnt tamper with its fundamental features "messing with it and damaging it would not be a smart thing to do and we are going to encourage congress to think about that " says billy tauzin a former louisiana congressman who heads the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america the drug makers trade group he hinted that the industry is preparing a big ad campaign just in case if congress heads toward passing "anything like price controls we obviously have a big job to do " he says "if congress is reasonable and works with us to improve the program its a different matter " anne marie chaker contributed to this article on the agenda the energy industry small businesses and others are on the defensive on capitol hill preparing to counter legislation
