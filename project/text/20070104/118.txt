style tricks of the trade a designer folds a pocket square tommy hilfiger principal designer and director of the apparel company that bears his name never looks boring in a suit thats because he spices up his tailored look with colorful pocket squares stuffed in the breast pocket of his jacket the decorative accessories "complete a gentlemans wardrobe " says the year old mr hilfiger theyre back in style now after a year hiatus he says because european designers started using them in the past few years to accent menswear collections "men are starting to dress much more elegantly today " mr hilfiger says these days mr hilfiger often wears his favorite one a silk square with a paisley design in orange brown and gold with a navy blazer and a white shirt mr hilfiger first learned how to fold pocket squares from his father when he was a teenager he says he lays the square out on a flat surface and folds it twice into a square then folds about one third of it in to make it narrow enough to fit in his pocket for another look he sometimes folds the pocket square diagonally instead and then bends the corners up into three or four uneven points that stick out from the pocket he takes care to make the folds look haphazard and imperfect and never exposes more than an inch of the square from the pocket "you dont want it too high because it looks like you are trying to show it off " he says mr hilfiger says its ok for men to wear the same pocket square jacket combination over and over again but he recommends avoiding pocket squares altogether when wearing a patterned jacket and says men should always stick to either silk or cotton squares "never wear polyester " because it looks inauthentic he says one caveat silk squares must be dry cleaned while cotton can easily be thrown in the wash
