politics &amp economics capital feds ideal rate of growth could be slower in the future through the blizzard of data that descends on them daily federal reserve officials try to discern the way inflationary winds are blowing the direction of the u s economy and the economys safe speed limit "safe " in the minds of central bankers is the pace at which an economy can expand without generating rising inflation central bankers wield interest rates to keep the economys expansion as close to this growth rate as they can set rates too low the textbooks teach and demand can exceed supply and push up prices set rates too high and a glut of unused capacity will yield higher unemployment and lower inflation perhaps even falling prices today fed officials are relieved that the economy has been slower than what is sometimes called "trend" or "potential " they wanted slower growth to avoid an outbreak of inflation but a big question is what speed limit the fed should anticipate for the rest of this decade lately fed officials have been speculating that the safe growth rate for the u s economy in the future may be slightly slower than the annual growth rate of the past five years it is easy to cast this as an academic number clogged debate in fact it is an instance where what the fed thinks matters to all of us not just bond traders the feds estimate for trend growth determines whether officials will let the economy expand at say on average or just the difference sounds small but adds up over time an extra one quarter percentage point in annual growth would mean &# billion more goods and services for americans to share by an economys speed limit is largely defined by two factors how rapidly the number of workers increases and their "productivity " or how much each of them produces the fed doesnt disclose its precise projection for the safe speed limit a public summary of fed officials october meeting noted that "the staff had again reduced its projection for potential growth " the comment followed a research paper that argued that something significant is happening to the u s labor force growth is slowing and the phenomenon isnt temporary the aging of the big baby boom generation is bringing it to the brink of retirement and the proportion of women who work seems to have peaked nothing is certain here improved health and longevity or skimpier pensions may keep baby boomers working longer technology may reduce employers demand for labor immigration could increase fed chairman ben bernanke in a speech in november said "some slowing in the growth of the labor force seems likely over the next few years at least " fed board member susan bies has noted that a percentage point slowdown in labor force growth means it takes fewer new jobs to keep the nations unemployment rate steady jobs a month instead of a month productivity is particularly tough to forecast after a remarkable spurt that survived the bursting of the tech stock bubble the sept attacks and the energy price increases exacerbated by war in the middle east there are some signs that productivity growth may be slowing a bit from the pace of the early s former fed chairman alan greenspan made the call of his career when he saw before nearly anyone else that productivity was taking off in the mid s his successor hasnt yet joined the productivity pessimists "i remain optimistic " mr bernanke said in november "that the recent favorable productivity trends will continue " he pointed to the continued decline in the price of computer power and said that was spurring on biotechnology and other new industries while increasing the efficiency of old ones the just released minutes of the feds december meeting record concern that the underlying pace of productivity growth "could be weaker than currently thought " bank of america economists mickey levy and peter kretzmer point out in a recent research note that even if marked down a bit the potential growth rate of the u s economy remains higher than that of nearly any other industrialized country roughly for the u s by todays consensus versus or for continental europe and for japan that means the overall u s economy will be even bigger relative to europe and japan years hence than it is now it doesnt mean europeans and japanese will be miserable with a slower growing population it takes less growth to deliver rising living standards to each person a country with a population increasing a year has to have economic growth of a year just to break even the fed cant turn the dials on population growth or on productivity all it can do is try to gauge trends accurately continued strong productivity growth will lead the fed to tolerate faster economic growth that puts the onus on the rest of the society business unions workers regulators legislators schools to work at doing what is possible to maintain healthy productivity growth the secret to prosperity for our children and grandchildren mr
