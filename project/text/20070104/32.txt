dow on tap brian s wesbury you in time magazines person of the year was a machine the personal computer twenty four years later after being empowered by the computer the person of the year is "you " times cover sports a small mirror so we can contemplate ourselves the controller of the information age and think about all our blogs pages on myspace or facebook and videos on youtube the most interesting thing about this progression is that it did not result from consumer demand demand does not create wealth consumers were not marching in the streets years ago complaining about the fact that there was no way to share their daily activities and innermost thoughts with thousands of their closest friends people were not begging for personal computers email broadband the web or blogs entrepreneurs futurists scientists and the very early adopters birthed this technology todays average consumer was either clueless or still in diapers even though some of this technology existed in the s the economic environment of those times was not conducive to its rapid development or deployment tax rates were high and regulation was stifling this held back innovation creativity and productivity to offset this malaise many macroeconomists counted on the fed to hold interest rates low by printing more money which only stoked inflation the resulting stagflation created a lousy environment for new inventions in the early s tax rates were cut government interference in the economy was reduced and the fed followed a tight money policy as stagflation was cured entrepreneurs got to work in garages basements and cinderblock buildings todays technology promptly came to life even before its full usefulness was understood it took more than a decade for the internet and email to become real consumer products it was the supply of this technology that fueled its growth not the demand for it despite evidence from the past years a majority of the analysis and press coverage of our economy still focuses on demand as the driver of wealth creation as a result we hear that rising oil prices are like a tax on the consumer that will slow the economy or possibly lead to recession but this discounts productivity growth that allows higher costs to be absorbed moreover one persons spending is anothers revenue so while midwesterners pay more to heat their homes energy producers in louisiana wyoming texas or oklahoma are shopping online with all that newfound income money doesnt just evaporate for every debit there must be a credit the world is a closed system as far as the dollar is concerned even if we send more dollars to opec those dollars come back currency that leaves the country must return to purchase goods and services or make an investment this explains why our trade deficit with china is not a significant problem the dollars sent across the pacific rebound as investment or spending on goods and services such as the recent &# to &# billion contract with westinghouse electric co to build nuclear power plants in china while many fear that china might stop investing in the u s or sell its current investment holdings this is misplaced worry if china traded its dollars for euros then whoever stood on the other side of that transaction would hold those dollars facing the same choices of buying from or investing in america foreign investment reflects the strength of the u s as a safe and sound economy yes the earth is flat but american technology made it that way the argument that the u s cannot compete now that technology has leveled the playing field sounds like a michael crichton novel you know the story we invent something and it turns on us jurassic park the andromeda strain or even frankensteins monster this makes great fiction and who knows it may happen some day but the only way u s competitiveness will fall off the edge of the flat earth is if we place too many burdens on the entrepreneur unfortunately there are many who want to do just that based on a belief that the middle class is being squeezed or too much of the profits of enterprise are going to the owners of capital there is a push to raise taxes and redistribute more of our income but these beliefs are more political fodder than reality in the first five years of the current recovery inflation adjusted average hourly earnings have climbed a total of not great yet still much better than in the first five years of the last recovery starting in march when earnings declined by even so average hourly earnings are a terrible measure of income because they do not include tips bonuses commissions or employer paid benefits nonetheless the data show that low and middle income workers wages have performed better in the current cycle than they did in the same time period of the previous cycle and to top it off everyone who pays taxes faces a lower tax rate the process may be mysterious and magical at its core but it is completely understandable lower tax rates encourage innovation and risk taking the impact of this raises productivity and productivity raises living standards by boosting incomes or lowering prices it is true that corporate profits have climbed to a record share of gdp and it is also true that income gaps have widened but these can be positive signs not negative ones an economy without profits is a stagnant economy and income gaps have widened in every period of rapid technological advancement going back to the invention of the wheel the first to use a new technology and the entrepreneurs who push it to fruition benefit the most even as the new technology lifts living standards for all fighting these trends diminishes technologys ability to raise living standards if france had chosen to cut tax rates regulation and the size of its government in the early s while the u s continued on its path towards a social welfare state it would be the french who would be complaining about excess corporate profits and the income gap americans on the other hand would fret about a unemployment rate and march in the streets demanding job guarantees and shorter workweeks in an ironic twist because the personal computer has decentralized business activity and altered the structure of many industries the statistical machinery designed to measure economic activity has become increasingly inaccurate the newspaper help wanted advertising index has become useless the internet has spawned the growth of many companies with "no" employees these microbusinesses and an increase in self employment make it even harder to measure the total number of jobs or incomes legal documents and accounting programs are inexpensive and widely available on the web which means its easier than ever to start a new business but measuring everything perfectly is not all that important as long as policy is pointed in the right direction technology and productivity will continue to advance just like they have over the past years today tax rates are still low enough to boost investment and entrepreneurial activity at the same time the fed has not lifted rates to excess as a result both the demand side and the supply side of the economy in look solid another year of above real growth and a dow are on tap other than some further increases in inflation the only thing we should worry about is the "magazine cover jinx " if the university of texas football team can have its game winning streak ruined immediately after making the cover of sports illustrated then could be a tough year for "us " mr
