tenants may gain clout in office rental market office landlords had a heyday in as rents rose at the fastest pace in six years yet there are signs that conditions could be turning a little more in the favor of tenants newly released data by reis inc a new york real estate research firm show that office rents rose nationally last year the heftiest increase since the height of the technology boom in however the report also found that demand for new office space slowed sharply near the end of last year a sign that large rent increases may not continue demand for office space is measured by tracking the "absorption" rate a closely watched number that quantifies the change in the net amount of occupied space in the fourth quarter tenants in the nations largest markets absorbed a net million square feet of space according to reis compared with million in the third quarter and million in the second "it is clear that investors cannot expect the same pace of rent growth without a more cooperative level of net absorption " said lloyd lynford reis chief executive he noted that slowing growth in demand for office space tracks closely with the slowdown in employment growth in the second half throughout most of last year many companies took big blocks of office space hoping to lock in rents before they moved higher but several months ago the mood began to change real estate experts say "now people are waiting to see what will happen in the economy " said barry gosin chief executive of newmark knight frank a real estate services firm "its not an ominous sign but its certainly not as heated as it was " if companies continue to hold off renting more space landlords are unlikely to be able to command the hefty rent increases they saw last year in the fourth quarter the increases in effective rent the amount tenants pay after concessions were as high as in some markets and averaged nationwide real estate experts say it is too early for property investors to panic even at a time in which office buildings continue to sell at record prices and yields or initial returns on investments are at an all time low the national absorption number somewhat masks the strong demand that continues in some markets often in the very ones where record sales have caused mouths to drop said chuck schreiber chief executive of kbs realty advisors newport beach calif moreover mr schreiber said the biggest risk to the office market overbuilding doesnt seem to be a concern at least in many of the hottest markets as land and construction costs continue to limit new supply according to reis million square feet of office space should be opened nationally this year the highest level in several years but well below the million that opened in even so that amount of new construction is enough to put upward pressure on vacancy rates said reiss mr lynford the national vacancy rate finished last year at sustaining its tiniest drop in quarters at some of the cities that saw the strongest growth in effective rents in the fourth quarter will be hard pressed to replicate those numbers going forward mr lynford said flashy results in some markets over just one quarter could indicate that landlords cut back significantly on concessions designed to lure new tenants such as a year of free rent now mr lynford said to sustain similar levels of effective rent growth they must cut back further on concessions or drastically raise their asking rental rates options which may be hard to justify with demand slowing yet in houston a city that saw effective rent growth in the fourth quarter brokers said demand for space particularly in the central business district is as strong as they can remember thanks to the energy sectors continued growth though rents per square foot in houston remain low by the standards of pricier markets such as boston san francisco and new york some landlords there were able to raise their rates twice or three times in said steve biegel senior vice president for studley a tenant representation firm
