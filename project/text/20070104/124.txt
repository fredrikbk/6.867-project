the daily fix saban drops miami for alabama leaving furious scribes in his wake "i guess i have to say it im not going to be the alabama coach i shouldnt even have to comment on this i think ive said this over and over and over again " that was miami dolphins coach nick saban on dec in an excruciating back and forth with reporters the same nick saban who now is you guessed it the new coach at alabama after a five week saga mr saban signed a deal to coach the crimson tide reportedly worth &# million over eight years walking away from the remaining three years at &# million each on his dolphins contract after and campaigns cry havoc and let slip the columnists of war the miami heralds dan le batard first lets dolphins legend don shula do the hitting for him "he has run away from the challenge blatant lies likes to hear himself talk and then doesnt follow up on what he says" before bringing out the heavy lumber "the punctuation on the nick saban error is greasy dishonorable and cowardly " he writes "you know what he was as dolphins coach a failure a loser a gasbag and one of the worst investments dolphins owner wayne huizenga has ever made there has been nothing in franchise history that came with more expectations and fewer results than this hypocrite who fled at the end to avoid the hard questions one last time the tombstone on his dolphins career reads talked like a warrior acted like a weasel " wow but wait on espn com pat forde goes after all college coaches "theyre not going to tell the truth to us but we can tell the truth about them its this theyll say anything to get recruits on campus and theyll say anything to get media members off their backs when angling for a different job " he writes "and the panting attempts by school administrators fans other coaches and many media members to portray them as men of superior moral fiber needs to stop theyre coaches thats all that makes them part of a pack of lying liars who only lie when their lips are moving and sabans lips have moved most recently " if that seems unfair mr forde runs down a list of recent lies by coaches harrumphing that "its time to rename the american football coaches association the liars club i understand that im tarring a lot of good men and even a few honest ones with a broad brush but thats sabans gift to his profession " the statement that opened this column it was coaxed out of mr saban by the south florida sun sentinels dave hyde who doesnt seem that concerned about having been lied to "i never thought that statement to be worth more than an amusing sound byte " mr hyde writes "coaches lie to reporters thats a fact of life saban wasnt even the biggest name in south florida sports to lie wednesday in south florida " hold that thought the fix will come back to it the bigger issue mr hyde says "was lying to his players and staff biggest of all was his lying repeatedly to h wayne huizenga at least as the dolphins owner told it thats why i read saban all wrong lie to us join the club lie to the boss who was your personal atm card and vacation planner youve got to be colder than antarctica " on yahoo sports dan wetzel takes plenty of shots at mr saban the story of sending the plane back to east lansing is the fixs favorite but also focuses on the challenges facing the crimson tide "this used to be one of the premiere sic jobs in the country " he writes "back when alabama cared more about football than anyone else when it commanded the most tv time when it built the biggest and best stadium it was the program of the south now it isnt the program of the state alabamas natural advantages have been chipped away by scholarship limits widespread television coverage parity facility construction booms across the country and athletic director mal moores unique knack of hiring the absolute worst guy for the job " alabama mr wetzel writes keeps turning "to instant gratification hucksters and suckers there was mike dubose the flop from opp his hometown who was perfect except for his habit of winning four games a season breaking ncaa rules and sleeping with his secretary there was dennis franchione who was a fine coach but didnt care about bama and left for texas a&amp m after two seasons there was mike price who never coached a game because one night he got drunk and invited back to his hotel the worlds hungriest stripper who ordered the entire room service menu finally there was mike shula who was a good looking guy with a famous last name unfortunately he couldnt coach his way out of a houndstooth bag and now they go with saban " whew that was fun one of mr sabans former teams had a good day yesterday at the superdome notre dame couldnt handle lsu or its foot quarterback jamarcus russell threw for yards and two tds as the no tigers ran away in the second half to beat the brady quinn and the no fighting irish appraising notre dames ninth straight bowl loss the chicago tribunes rick morrissey asks "is there such a thing as a moral victory for a powerhouse program such as notre dame ok how about a moral first half will the kelly green clad crowd accept that didnt think so " in the new orleans times picayune john deshazier praises a reunion of old friends "sugar bowl new orleans missed you new orleans the sugar bowl missed you granted the forced separation was only a year a grain of sand on the beach of a year old bowl game but it felt like a dog year watching from afar as preparation and execution of a game that has become entwined in the fabric of new orleans were done elsewhere while new orleans concentrated on stitching its split seams a sew job that remains a work in progress " miami heat coach pat riley began an indefinite leave of absence yesterday because of hip and knee problems handing his team yes they are the nba champs over to assistant ron rothstein which brings us back to dave hyde and his contention about coaches and lies "riley does have knee and hip problems but he mostly has a team make up problem he needs a vacation he probably deserves one in this crazy heat season too " the sun sentinels mike berardino doesnt come out and call mr riley a liar perhaps because hes already disgusted "if pat riley has said it once hes said it a thousand times since that shimmering night in dallas more than six months ago when it comes to championships you either defend them or you disgrace them this nightmare heat season may have swung irretrievably toward the latter with wednesdays latest round of bad news " the statue of liberty play that ended monday nights fiesta bowl "looked like it was hatched in a seventh period p e class " writes josh levin in slate before reviewing similar examples of coaching nonconformity in this years bowl games "what all these bowl games revealed once more is that college football is a game ruled by innovators and aggressors " he writes "compare that to pro football a stolid inertial sport in which the coaches compete to see who can be the most risk averse " so why not transplant college football offenses to the nfl as mr levin explains there are a host of reasons why its not that simple tip of the fix cap to readers max
