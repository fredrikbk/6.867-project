junk turns golden but may be laced with tinsel junk has never been so fashionable the ranks of companies whose debt is rated below investment grade known as junk are swelling a sign of increased borrowing and a growing appetite for risk by investors seeking high returns back in the debt of slightly less than a third of u s industrial corporations tracked by standard &amp poors was rated junk by the late s more than half were and now of the pie fits into that category a record according to a new s&amp p report "junk bonds used to be a bad word on wall street " says joe bencivenga who used to be a bond analyst at wall streets junk bond house drexel burnham lambert in the s "they have since gained a lot more respectability " mr bencivenga is a co founder and head of research at plainfield asset management a hedge fund the rising tide of junk points to glacial changes in the nations financial markets and to more explosive short term trends back in the s many companies needed high credit ratings to persuade debt investors to lend them cash otherwise they had to rely on banks as financial markets became deeper and more sophisticated investor tolerance for risky bonds rose investors get bigger interest payments on bonds from riskier companies to compensate them for the possibility of a default today many bank loans even fall into this risky category and they are bundled together and sold to investors almost like bonds more recently a boom in leveraged buyouts is pushing a growing number of companies into speculative territory a worrisome development to some junk bond booms in the late s and late s ended painfully "people forget the bad times and remember only the most recent good times and i fear thats the case right now " says edward altman a finance professor at new york university who was one of the first academics to study junk bonds in the s ratings services like s&amp p moodys investors service and fitch ratings assign a range of rankings to companies based on their perceived ability to repay debt s&amp ps rankings go from triple a rock solid companies like general electric co that are sure to pay it off to single d which are already in default companies with the highest credit ratings pay lower interest rates bond investors make money on interest payments they can also make or lose money on the underlying value of the bond which goes up if the perceived risk of default goes down and vice versa these days triple a companies are nearly extinct just six nonfinancial corporations bear the label now the common currency is single b a level one step below the official junk standard of double b single b companies have grown to of the odd nonfinancial nonutility corporations tracked by s&amp p today from in the club includes names like neiman marcus group inc and toys "r" us inc both recent debt heavy buyout targets it also includes ford motor co and general motors corp whose low ratings result from auto sector troubles four seasons hotels inc gap inc and even nasdaq stock market inc hover a wrung above at double b in all of the large companies that make up the s&amp p have junk ratings most junk rated companies though are small young or lesser known companies says nicholas riccio an s&amp p credit analyst and author of the report titled "the rise of b rated companies and their staying power as an asset class " the interest companies pay on their debt is tax deductible unlike dividends paid on stock thats one reason debt is seen as an appealing way to raise money companies that have little debt are often pressured by investors to add more to capture the tax advantage and to reward stock investors by buying back shares paying dividends or funding expansion plans the risk is that their chances of default rise as they borrow more money investor appetite for high yielding risky debt is a force behind the buyout boom in which private equity firms buy corporate stock and finance the acquisition with heaps of new bonds or loans back in the s companies like r h macy &amp co and duracell inc were similarly loaded with debt in buyouts that sent their credit ratings tumbling macy ended up in bankruptcy proceedings while duracell managed to pay down its debt and became an investment grade company before it was bought by gillette co in the outlook for investors who hold junk bonds today could be similarly mixed among a sample of around single b companies that tapped the debt markets for the first time in just have paid off their debt according to s&amp p a third of the group defaulted or went into bankruptcy proceedings another third have been acquired on average during the past years of junk bonds have gone into default in and defaults spiked to more than of junk bonds outstanding the default rate was only last year one reason for the surge of interest in the lower rated debt but mr riccio isnt sure it will last "most people think they are smart enough to get out when they should " says mr riccio of s&amp p "the question is who will be left holding the bag "
