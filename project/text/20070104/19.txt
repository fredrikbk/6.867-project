big dig mongolia is roiled by miners huge plans world class deposits spur battle for spoils makeover for toxic bob oyu tolgoi mongolia when robert friedland first set foot on this desolate land in the mining magnate saw a windswept desert some rocks and the opportunity to turn mongolia into the worlds next big natural resources play since then his vancouver based company ivanhoe mines ltd has spent more than &# million to develop what may become one of the worlds biggest copper and gold mines more than a thousand workers are on site performing exploration work and preparing to dig a hole deep enough to fit the eiffel tower if all goes well oyu tolgoi could double mongolias gross domestic product and help lift the landlocked nation of nomadic herders out of poverty mongolias response protesters have burned mr friedlands image in effigy in the capital city of ulaanbaatar last spring the mongolian parliament imposed a tough new windfall tax on copper and gold exports and government officials still havent approved a final investment agreement for ivanhoe and its partners a pact they need to begin large scale production that means it could be several years before the project gets off the ground if ever mongolias conflicted approach to mr friedland and other foreign mining investors reflects a dilemma thats emerging across the developing world as poor nations grapple with the dazzling opportunities and mounting pressures of a global commodity boom the surge in commodity prices in recent years has triggered an avalanche of new investment in mines much of it in economically stagnant nations like mongolia but the lessons of past commodity cycles suggest that many resource rich nations dont benefit from their natural bounties in the long run either because of rampant local corruption or the rapacious behavior of foreign companies this has made governments more cautious about dealing with would be investors and created many new headaches for ambitious mining companies in the case of mongolia ordinary citizens are finding it particularly hard to know whom to trust many of the countrys new foreign investors are companies from china and russia with murky corporate structures and little apparent desire to employ mongolians local critics fear such companies will have little accountability for their impact on the environment then theres mr friedland whose estimated &# billion project would create the largest mine mongolia has ever seen and be the countrys biggest ever foreign investment the american entrepreneur brings his own baggage along with his promise of mining riches environmental activists and others in the u s and elsewhere have often referred to mr friedland as "toxic bob " the nickname derives at least in part from his alleged role in the contamination of a colorado river in the s and s he vigorously contests the allegation ivanhoe also has a joint venture with a state owned mining company in myanmar which is ruled by a military junta decried by the u s and others as one of the most oppressive regimes in the world in a london based advocacy group known as mines and communities called him "by far the most roguish of all mining entrepreneurs " in part because of his myanmar investments ivanhoe is nurturing a different image in mongolia it is spending heavily to bring doctors to rural mongolia and to restore an important buddhist monastery destroyed by communists in the s it has helped mongolia repay millions of dollars in debts to the former soviet union more than of ivanhoes employees in the country are mongolian if it proceeds oyu tolgoi could yield billions of dollars in tax revenue moreover many mongolians believe that ivanhoe whose stock is traded on the new york and toronto stock exchanges is more transparent and accountable than the chinese and russian alternatives its credentials became even stronger in october when ivanhoe announced an agreement with anglo australian miner rio tinto to jointly develop its project rio tinto is among the worlds largest mining companies mr friedland a year old with wavy brown hair who also holds canadian citizenship said in an interview that hes confident a deal will be signed with the government he says his controversial past has little or nothing to do with the debates surrounding mining in mongolia and insists that oyu tolgoi represents a golden opportunity for the mongolian people "when a mine is big its normal its absolutely normal to use the french its de rigueur to see a fairly extensive period of time under which these things are discussed " he says "were quite sanguine" about the situation in mongolia he adds whatever happens the deal "has to evolve as a win win situation" for everyone the outcome certainly is important for mongolia a nation four times the size of germany but with just million people little industry and no ports mongolias annual gdp is about &# billion which is less than the annual earnings of walgreen co the american drugstore chain its per capita income of &# adjusted for differences in relative living costs is lower than bangladeshs scores of former nomads now live in sprawling camps that ring the hills outside of ulaanbaatar many of them unable to find work but mongolia is blessed with coal iron ore copper and gold as commodity prices have soared these resources have become more important over the past months mongolia has entertained visits from president george w bush then japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and senior envoys from china and russia mr friedland meanwhile is one of the richest men in the world with an estimated net worth of &# billion according to a recent forbes magazine survey his background is not that of a typical mining executive in the late s he was a student activist he spent much of the s traveling in india where he studied sanskrit hindu culture and buddhism he also lived on an oregon apple orchard with his friend steve jobs who eventually co founded apple computer inc according to news accounts mr jobs and an apple spokeswoman didnt respond to requests for comment about mr jobss relationship with mr friedland in an interview with the wall street journal in the s mr friedland said he became interested in mining after stumbling upon an abandoned gold mine on property he was developing for a timber venture with mr jobs in the mid s mr friedland helped open a gold operation in the colorado mountains known as summitville according to the u s environmental protection agency runoff from the mine carried toxic materials including copper into the nearby alamosa river killing aquatic life and threatening irrigated farmland downstream in summitvilles parent company filed for bankruptcy and left the site u s officials declared the area a superfund site and sued mr friedland to date the epa and colorado have spent about &# million to clean the area and the epa says regulators will have to build a water treatment facility to be operated in perpetuity to finish the job an attorney for mr friedland says environmental problems in the alamosa river were caused by natural phenomena and drainage from past mining in the area not troubles at summitville he says the epa unfairly singled out mr friedland as a scapegoat in part because of his wealth mr friedland reached a voluntary settlement with the u s and colorado governments in through which he paid &# million without admitting wrongdoing u s officials now say summitville was a major source of contamination in the area but not the only one the u s government reimbursed mr friedland &# million in legal fees by the time of the settlement mr friedland was on to bigger and better things including a giant nickel find called voiseys bay a company mr friedland invested in discovered the deposit in the s while searching for diamonds in canada the company then sold out to canadas inco ltd for about &# billion the deal was so big that it made mr friedland an instant hero among mining speculators world wide mongolia was a natural choice for mr friedland to try next for decades it had survived on handouts from the soviet union which treated the country as a satellite state when the soviet union fell mongolia hoped mining would stabilize its reeling economy and it approved generous incentives to attract foreign miners one of the more promising sites was oyu tolgoi a haunt of camels and nomads close to the chinese border south of ulaanbaatar which was mined for copper as far back as three thousand years ago australian miner broken hill proprietary now bhp billiton drilled exploratory holes there in the late s including one that stopped meters short of a rich deposit but it didnt find enough minerals and decided to sell out ivanhoe executives decided to take a chance and paid nearly &# million for rights to the area the company kept drilling holes and in it detected significant copper and gold deposits by independent assessments confirmed the find an enthusiastic mr friedland appeared in mongolia astride gobi camels and wearing fur hats at the site ivanhoe built a spacious mongolian "ger" tent camp for workers and visiting dignitaries as further exploration cranked up but ivanhoe lacked one critical document a long term agreement with the mongolian government to guarantee tax rates royalties and other legal frameworks for the project financiers and mining companies often demand such arrangements in high risk areas before they commit money ivanhoe moved quickly to demonstrate its commitment to the country it bought &# million in mongolian government securities to help mongolia retire old debts to the russian government it began a series of charitable efforts including one that recently paid expenses for a mongolian woman to scale mount everest ivanhoe also worked the political aisles in early former u s secretary of state james a baker iii whose law firm baker botts llp represents ivanhoe spoke to senior mongolian officials about the benefits of foreign investment in a news release ivanhoe touted mr baker as an "especially close friend of mongolia" and "welcomed" the governments cooperation in completing a long term agreement a spokesman for mr baker said he was unavailable to comment but he confirmed that mr bakers visit to mongolia included ivanhoe business and that the firm still represents ivanhoe by however a deal still wasnt done political tensions over how to exploit mongolias natural resources were growing other mining companies were sweeping across the country reports circulated that chinese investors were making under the table deals for mining rights shiny black humvees driven by mongolians and foreigners cashing in on the incipient mining boom began snaking through the ulaanbaatar streets many mongolians feared their democratically elected government was too corrupt to manage the land grab or to ensure the benefits were broadly dispersed some also worried the mining projects would cause extensive environmental damage ivanhoes oyu tolgoi project does pose environmental challenges the mine will require huge quantities of water and some mongolians fear this could alter the desert areas fragile ecology ivanhoe says it can operate without depleting local water sources "mining isnt going to help us " grumbles year old battsogt batkhuyag who was found packing up a tent on a grim hillside in ulaanbaatar one recent afternoon he had wandered to the capital a year earlier after failing to get a job at a mine in another city closer to oyu tolgoi locals say theyre happy to see more mining because it will mean more economic development still "i cant tell which company is the worst and which is the best " says j badamtsoo a year old nomad sitting in her tent on a hill several hours across the desert from oyu tolgoi "id prefer it if it were mongolians " she says comments by mr friedland at a florida investor conference didnt help touting the oyu tolgoi project he predicted that developing part of the mine would be like making "t shirts for five bucks and selling them for &# " copies of the speech surfaced on the internet and later were cited by critics of foreign mining companies in mongolia and elsewhere tensions came to a head last april when protesters gathered in ulaanbaatars central square although they had a number of complaints against their government not all of them related to mining ivanhoe and other foreign mining companies became easy targets the protesters burned a doll representing mr friedland in a top hat along with effigies of several top government officials the debate took a strange turn when antimining forces organized a chaotic news conference in ulaanbaatar to denounce ivanhoes work elsewhere one speaker called mr friedland a "canadian grave digger " according to a transcript provided by ivanhoe and displayed photos of bullet riddled bodies allegedly related to ivanhoe activities in myanmar later it turned out the man was operating under an assumed identity the organization he worked for an advocacy group with offices in washington d c and thailand called earthrights international confirmed he was an employee but said it could not stand by the mans claims ivanhoe launched an ad campaign to counter what it called "disgraceful lies " mr friedland says ivanhoe is proud of its work in myanmar and that its operations there have had a positive local impact the company has also said it intends to divest itself of its joint venture there in the future the florida speech mr friedland says was taken out of context and "used for domestic political purposes" by protesters who misunderstood that he was talking about a high grade portion of the mine that is more profitable than the overall project he says the effigy burning was "quite an honor" but says the protests were "ludicrously" blown out of proportion adding that street rallies are common in mongolias rambunctious young democracy especially when the country emerges from its bleak winter "we dont have any problem at all with an intense dialogue or these young groups of people that are expressing their opinions even if theyre misguided " he says "its all ok because over time the truth will out " in may however mongolian government officials acted in a surprise move the mongolian parliament approved new windfall taxes on gold and copper exports mongolia later revised its investor friendly mineral laws to allow the government to take up to stakes in certain mining assets its unclear how compensation would be determined mining companies and industry analysts decried the changes and ivanhoes stock price fell by more than one fourth though it has since recovered mr friedland stepped aside as ivanhoes chief executive officer the company elevated john macken a former executive at freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc s giant grasberg mine in indonesia to take over mr friedland became executive chairman and says he is no longer taking part in the negotiations with the mongolian government mongolian officials are divided over the wisdom of the governments mining policy changes in an interview in august mongolian prime minister m enkhbold worried that the windfall tax was "not good" for the countrys future government officials are currently debating possible revisions yangug sodbaatar deputy minister of mongolias ministry of industry and trade took the other side "if its so terribly bad the mining companies should leave but i think the serious investors will stay " he said in october ivanhoe unveiled its own surprise the deal with rio tinto under the terms of the arrangement rio tinto agreed to buy a &# million stake in ivanhoe with the option to invest an additional &# billion or more in the future enough to make it ivanhoes largest shareholder tom albanese an executive at rio tinto who was recently tapped to be its next ceo says the company was keen to get in on the ground floor of one of the worlds biggest new mining projects he says rio tinto was heartened by recent talks with senior government officials who have reiterated support for foreign investment and a long term mining agreement many analysts believe that rio tintos involvement in the mine increases the odds that an agreement will be reached soon even so rio tinto which reported &# billion in profit in the most recent full year for which data is available structured the deal so it can exit if the project fails to make headway "before we put more in were looking forward to working with the mongolian government to get" a long term agreement mr albanese says whatever happens the slow progress to date likely means oyu tolgoi cant be operational until at the earliest meanwhile copper prices are slipping after hitting a peak of more than &# a metric ton last year prices have since retreated to below &# a metric ton many analysts believe copper prices will go lower though remain above historical averages in the coming years mr friedland says ivanhoe will keep plugging away but on mongolias schedule "the last thing to do or for our company to do is to lecture the mongolians about their policies " he says "we are very bullish on mongolia getting it right through their own internal democratic process " jargal byambasuren in ulaanbaatar contributed to this article
