moving on for a fresh start to try setting your sins on fire a few hours before midnight on new years eve people lined up at a church in west palm beach fla and set their sins on fire its a ritual dating back centuries and its being embraced more widely each year in spiritual circles people write down their regrets fears and shortcomings then light the paper to symbolize a spiritual cleansing many churches offered such "burning bowl" services this new years and people are marking other life transitions from weddings to prison paroles with similar ceremonies at unity of the palm beaches church each parishioner was handed a piece of flash paper which burns instantly real estate developer mitchell schwartz says he wrote about tempering urges such as envy and he felt a certain release when his flaming paper "just vanished " he likened it to a ship on the horizon it was there and then it wasnt he visualized his shortcomings disappearing in just that way as a piano tinkled speaker lori woodley encouraged congregants to write down "whatever is blocking you from becoming all that you are in all your greatness " clutching their papers people of all races and ages walked to the front of the sanctuary where they touched their lists to a candle each paper flashed and was gone congregants were also given envelopes and a second sheet of paper to write out goals for the sealed letters were collected and will be mailed to them in november so they can consider their progress "be ostentatious gaudy incredible " said rev ken williamson "scare even yourself write that thought down the one that made you say no i cant think that no i cant have that " travel tour operator nina fogelman years old included lots of specifics in her letter including the dollar amount she hopes to earn this year "if i tell my cars gps that i want to go to the east coast it wont know where to send me " she said "but if i give an address in brooklyn ill be taken there " i attended the one hour service to report on it and since i have few new age tendencies i didnt intend to write out my flaws at first but i did and it was a soul searching exercise i wrote about how i lose my temper with my three daughters how i dont fully appreciate my wife how i love them all completely but show it too sparingly the service also led me to think about comedian rich vos whom i recently interviewed he told me he chides optimistic revelers when he performs on new years eve "people always say this will be my year well what about the last years what makes you think that all of a sudden everythings gonna turn around for you " perhaps what makes us so optimistic is the human need for hope and the innate yearning to improve when new york cantor judith steel performs marriages she has couples write out their shortcomings during wedding ceremonies as she holds up the burning papers "i feel like im the statue of liberty " she says she asks guests to look at their spouses and forgive each other eliot weinstein and marcy aronson were married by cantor steel last year but they didnt share their lists with each other "what we wrote was sealed away for no one elses eyes " says mr weinstein "it made it more sacred " the couple had been together for a decade "eliot knows my shortcomings so he knows what i wrote " says ms aronson but burning the papers "was like a new start " cantor steel was born in germany and in at age months was a passenger on the ss st louis that ship carrying jewish refugees was turned away by cuba and the u s it returned to europe where many passengers including cantor steels parents died in concentration camps cantor steel was hidden by a french catholic family "what ive learned from my life " she says "is that its good to remember your past but you cant dwell on it " for her the burning ceremonies are a reminder that "we need to concentrate on the here the now and the joy " email jeffrey zaslow wsj com
