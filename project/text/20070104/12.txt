bush faces hurdles delivering on his balanced budget vow washington president bushs pledge to balance the budget by will be easier to project on paper than to actually achieve white house budget chief rob portman says mr bush who declared the balanced budget goal in a wall street journal op ed piece and a rose garden speech yesterday plans to show how he will achieve his goal in the fiscal budget request next month balancing the budget wont come from tax increases but from tax receipts fueled by a growing economy and restrained government spending mr portman says but getting to a balanced budget by will require some big assumptions among them the presidents budget is unlikely to reflect the full cost of the wars in iraq and afghanistan and the cost of preventing the alternative minimum tax from affecting more middle class americans "what were very likely to see is a budget thats very unrealistic " said james horney senior fellow at the center on budget policies and priorities a liberal think tank "its not going to be hard for him to put together a budget that on paper shows a balanced budget but it is going to include a lot of unlikely assumptions " mr bush inherited a surplus and on his watch because of an economic downturn tax cuts and spending on homeland security and the war the deficit widened to a peak of &# billion in since then it has come down to &# billion in fiscal and is projected at &# billion for mr bush credited his tax cuts with spurring the growth that has helped trim the shortfall the most recent white house forecast issued in july projected a &# billion gap for the latest year for which it made projections the congressional budget office estimates the u s will run a &# billion deficit in assuming mr bushs tax cuts are made permanent mr portman said growth has been stronger than expected and the white house is now projecting annual revenue growth of to up from its july prediction of growth in mr bush urged lawmakers to "keep this economy growing" by making his tax cuts permanent and also called on them to restrain "wasteful" spending his comments sparked skepticism on capitol hill with the incoming house budget committee chairman questioning how the bush budget will reach its balanced budget goal "there are some major questions raised and unanswered about whats included and whats not included " rep john spratt d s c said "for example what does the budget assume with respect to the outyear costs of the war in iraq and afghanistan " the white house has largely financed the costs of iraq and afghanistan outside the normal budget process through "emergency" supplemental spending bills approved by congress while the white house recently began including one or two year cost estimates for the war those amounts have been far less than what has been requested and approved at the same time the white house hasnt included the cost of fixing the amt estimated to cost &# billion a year in its long term projections the amt was designed to prevent upper income earners from avoiding paying taxes altogether but it was never indexed for inflation and has come to affect many middle class families mr portman said no decision has been made about whether to include amt overhaul in the budget projections but that the administration has long assumed any fix will be "budget neutral" and wont drive up the deficit brian riedl a budget expert with the conservative heritage foundation think tank said the white house will need to show some progress in taming costs "those growth rates must be reduced in order to balance the budget any time soon " he said
