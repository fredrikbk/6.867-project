home &amp family cranky consumer sampling organic baby food services families discover good taste comes at a high price to start our children off on the right foot we bought our share of parenting books and signed up for parenting magazines and web sites then we discovered services that help time strapped parents by sending fresh and often creative combinations of organic baby food to their doorsteps on a regular basis we couldnt resist the idea so we along with three other families tested five organic baby food delivery companies in los angeles boston new york city and seattle some of these businesses will deliver anywhere in the u s the testers ordered a weeks worth of food from each service or up to &# while the companies delivered as promised such as peas that tasted like they were fresh off the farm the outsize prices mean these organic meals may be best reserved for special occasions or for truly picky eaters while happy baby doesnt deliver directly the new companys frozen offerings arrived at our front door via fresh direct a new york city area grocery delivery service when we opened the boxes and saw the frozen cubes of food we were skeptical of how they would taste let alone look after a second microwave blast per cube but the peas had that just picked shine and were yummy too even our toddler emma gobbled up the peas other hits with our month old were the grrreat greens danjou pears organic spinach and organic mango and the sweeter potatoes one drawback happy babys frozen dishes arent as convenient as jarred food to bring to a restaurant emma was less of a fan of homemade baby a los angeles based organic baby food company that delivers anywhere in the u s after orders are placed via its web site the plastic containers of food arrive in about three days in a nifty refrigerated pack she needed to be pushed to eat the yummy yammys and sweet potatoes texture may have also been the problem most of the offerings are aimed at babies under months old only the yummy yammys were appropriate for our month old still she gobbled up the piwi a mix of pears and kiwi and the just peas homemade babys organic food at &# per four ounce jar and &# delivery charge per bundle however can quickly become an expensive habit after failed attempts to order from orgaganics we turned to new york city based evies organic edibles to tempt bostonians sophia and julia nine months old started by former flight attendant evie failla evies organic edibles promised and delivered food tailored for the family albeit a couple of days later than expected we ordered dishes including lentils risotto and chicken with vegetables after a phone consultation in which ms failla was responsive and upbeat all were delicious but required a little extra motherly attention the turkey meatloaf turned from "yuck" to "yum" after we topped it with ketchup the chicken with winter vegetables became a winner after a quick whirl in the blender and some apple sauce to thin it out but the biggest fans of evies organic edibles were us parents we ate as much of the food as our kids started by friends mischelle davis and andreanna vaughan sprouts began to deliver its organic baby food to seattle area residents in september intrigued we placed an order by picking up the telephone and speaking to mischelle who helped us understand how the service worked based on our chat one morning we ordered six dishes including the veggie medley spinach beans and peas and apple sauce for a one year old that night the frozen entrees arrived in a reusable cooler pack with shoulder straps to deter tampering sprouts wove a band through the zipper toddler elliott couldnt get enough of the fruit medley blueberries and bananas but inexplicably turned his nose up at everything else convenience unfortunately wasnt something elliott appreciated los angeles based bohemian baby offered such an interesting list of options including cuban black bean and butternut squash and risotto that we were eager to sign up our toddler clive nearly two years old ordering was simple fill out the service agreement specify whether you want once or twice a week delivery and then make your selection from the emailed menu two days before the delivery date we opted for the "big baby pack" eight jars instead of racking our brains over the a la carte options the next night the jars were delivered in a reusable cooler pack to our front door it took three tries before the company delivered to the back porch as we requested clive had his favorites which included the potato au gratin and
