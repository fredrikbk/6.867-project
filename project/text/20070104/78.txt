package valued at about &# million including &# million in cash severance mr nardelli failed to reignite home depots slowing sales and sagging stock price other problems compounded his troubles his autocratic style clashed with a freewheeling culture fostered by the companys founders his aggressive handling of the companys most recent annual meeting where no outside directors were on hand and limits were set on shareholders questions outraged some investors and the pay package that had lured him to the company became a lightning rod for criticism that the board felt compelled to address mr nardelli grew tired of the constant battering he was taking in the press and on wall street according to a longtime acquaintance and resented being blamed for home depots share price when other chief executives such as general electric co s jeffrey immelt escaped such criticism board members agreed over the past few weeks that mr nardelli should step down according to the second person familiar with the events mr nardelli years old reached agreement with the board in a meeting tuesday in dallas far from the companys atlanta headquarters "there was no smoking gun " this person says "the board and bob reached agreement that it was time for a change " pay was a central factor in luring mr nardelli to home depot from ge after he lost a three man race to become ceo there and it loomed large as he left mr nardelli received compensation valued at more than &# million over his tenure at home depot with a hefty chunk of it in stock options in the fiscal year ended jan the board awarded him a &# million bonus and about &# million worth of restricted shares in december activist investor relational investors llc began pushing home depot to establish a special committee to review the companys strategic direction and management performance and to explore possible alternatives including a sale of the company it also alerted home depot it planned to nominate at least two directors at the companys next annual meeting in may yesterday barney frank d mass chairman designate of house financial services committee lambasted mr nardellis exit package citing the rise of home depot shares on the news "some defenders of ceo pay argue that ceos are rewarded for increasing the stock or the overall value of the company but judging by todays market reaction mr nardellis contribution to raising home depots stock value consists of quitting and receiving hundreds of millions of dollars to do so " he said in a statement the stock yesterday rose cents or to close at &# a share mr nardelli who could not be reached for comment for this story will be replaced by frank blake home depots vice chairman and executive vice president who headed strategic initiatives among other areas the new ceos compensation package is still being determined said a home depot spokesman mr nardelli faced tough times for big retailers that have limited options for diversifying home depot and wal mart stores inc ratcheted down their growth projections because new stores were stealing too much business from existing ones wall street no longer views these retailers as growth stories and their stock prices have languished home depots share price fell during mr nardelli tenure which began in december the company is locked in a fierce battle with lowes which boasts newer brighter stores and a better image with many shoppers lowes stock has risen in the past six years when he came to home depot mr nardelli had run mines and locomotive factories for general electric but lacked retail experience short balding aggressive and hard working he was known at ge as a great manufacturing executive and he pushed ge power to record profits during the s but in he was passed over to succeed chief executive john f welch jr a decision that took him by surprise according to people with knowledge of those events at that time the number of high growth markets in the u s without home depot branches was dwindling fast new stores increasingly prospered only by stealing business from nearby home depots the company was struggling to maintain earnings growth of annually a target it had hit with ease for years the company shocked investors in october with a profit warning that sent the stock tumbling in one day that setback spurred the board to recruit mr nardelli to replace chief executive arthur blank one of home depots founders and inspirational leaders mr nardelli set out to stamp out the decentralized "cowboy culture" of the company home depots founders had allowed store managers to run their stores as autonomous fiefdoms with little regard for uniformity or efficiency this entrepreneurial spirit had made home depot one of the hottest growth stocks ever and its store count doubled nearly every four years its surging stock price made hundreds of early employees millionaires mr nardellis management style was a stark contrast to that of home depots paternalistic founders bernard marcus and mr blank who were treated like heroes during store tours and personally tutored employees on customer service mr nardelli often appeared uncomfortable donning the retailers trademark orange apron and dealing with front line employees one on one the pressure to grow intensified in the face of extraordinary returns from lowes which outperformed home depot in same store sales lowes often chose to build across the street from aging home depot outlets it outpaced home depot in appliance sales by giving the merchandise more space and by training dedicated salespeople lowes attracted more female shoppers with brighter cleaner stores home depot now mimics many of these lowes techniques mr nardelli moved to cut back on higher paid full time employees with experience as plumbers or handymen and to rely more on part time workers with less experience answering home improvement questions from customers frequently mr nardelli found himself fending off questions about deteriorating customer service and about whether cost cutting was the cause of that every few months home depot management would roll out another program aimed at improving customer service from employee bonuses to customer call buttons but none appeared to have any lasting effect looking for another engine for growth mr nardelli decided to expand into the building supply business spending more than &# billion over the past two years to acquire more than wholesale suppliers their customers range from utilities needing poles to builders looking for lumber to cities in need of fire hydrants but selling to the construction trades is a much different business from mass merchandising tools and paints contractors rely on longstanding relationships with suppliers and trained salespeople many associate the home depot brand with do it yourselfers and soccer moms pushing shopping carts and avoid the stores some analysts and investors worried that home depot was snapping up supply businesses with lower profit margins than home depots existing stores mr nardelli took criticism for not investing more money into renovating home depots aging stores and for not hiring more seasoned employees capable of offering better home improvement advice at home depots annual meeting last may with disappointment over shareholder returns mounting mr nardelli ignited a firestorm by refusing to respond to investor concerns about his hefty compensation and for enforcing a strict time limit on comments from the floor the same month the company surprised investors with a decision that it would no longer report quarterly same store sales a key industry benchmark arguing that the expansion into building supplies had reduced the importance of that measure mr nardelli was forced to reverse that decision the following quarter to make matters worse home depot was also swept up in the scandal over backdated stock options in mid december it wrapped up an internal investigation that concluded that the company routinely backdated stock options for years and as a result understated compensation expense by &# million the practice started in and ended just before the arrival of mr nardelli with fiscal sales of &# billion the home improvement retailer is one of the largest companies to admit to backdating stock options during the previous two decades the company was run by founders mr marcus and mr blank but neither founder received stock options the company wouldnt say who did receive the awards and who made the decision to backdate them as criticism over his performance and pay mounted mr nardelli defended his record home depot he frequently pointed out had posted earnings per share growth in excess of for four consecutive years one of only two companies in the dow jones industrial average to do so "there is hardly a financial metric you can point to where we havent made progress " mr nardelli said in an interview last may "we are going through an enormous transformation sometimes transformation is unsettling not only internally but also externally to wall street " by late november the boards review of mr nardellis pay package was coming to a head home depot was paying mr nardelli even more than the amount promised under his contract thanks in part to bonuses the board awarded him due to growth of sales and diluted earnings per share a pay consultant retained by the compensation committee concluded that he was making more than his industry peers according to a person familiar with the situation in discussions with the committee mr nardelli had agreed to forgo some perks but not his guaranteed bonus or supplemental pension his demands were a problem for some board members this person says directors would have been happier if he had been more "willing to make concessions on his pay package "" says the acquaintance of his but mr nardelli felt further concessions would represent an admission that he didnt deserve what he had earned the acquaintance says board members realized that if they stuck strictly to the terms of mr nardellis written contract and did not give him anything more his compensation was likely to be lower in fiscal than in according to the person familiar with the matter for that reason the board decided in november not to try to amend the contract the directors tentatively agreed that mr nardellis fiscal bonus would be less than in but no final decision was reached this person says the friction over pay was a factor in his departure this person says directors met informally several times late last year prior to their final meeting on tuesday with mr nardelli ralph whitworth co founder of relational investors says mr nardellis departure wont deter his firm from seeking board representation "this paves the way for a review of the companys strategy " mr whitworth says "this wasnt about who but about what about a strategy that was way off track " the board briefly discussed but did not pursue one alternative going private according to two people familiar with the matter mr nardellis successor mr blake is a former ge colleague of his mr blake offered the advantage of being an established insider that spared home depot a protracted period of uncertainty during an external search and eliminated the need for it to dole out any "make whole" payments to anyone leaving another company as mr nardelli had received directors are still working out final details of mr blakes pay deal they already have decided that mr blake wont have an employment contract as ceo the second person familiar with the matter says and that elements of his pay package will resemble "what shareholders have been asking for " see related article "business executives fatal flaw failing to understand new demands on ceos" wsj jan
