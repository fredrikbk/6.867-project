glimpses behind the shoji screen ehon the artist and the book in japan the new york public library through feb those who lament the march of electronic media and fear that the printed book may be an endangered literary form should visit "ehon the artist and the book in japan " on view at the new york public library through feb the ehon or "picture books " collected here which date from to the present include bound volumes folded manuscripts and sacred hand scrolls the term "book" applies only loosely to these widely varied visual meditations some of which dispense with text altogether allowing the pictures to supply the narratives ehon are collaborative works incorporating calligraphy poetry illustration and paper making thus concentrating the skills of many artisans into single storytelling gems from prayer scrolls to bawdy comic books and political satires they remind us that books are not merely conveyances for ideas but also tactile things to be admired hidden in drawers or passed around scholars from all over the world have long made the new york public library with its world class spencer collection and miriam and ira d wallach division of art prints and photographs a place of pilgrimage this includes researchers from japan which remarkably lacks an ehon collection of similar stature now the vaults have been opened for the most comprehensive public exhibition of ehon ever but though the show is groundbreaking its a quiet kind of blockbuster serenely lit and relatively free of crowds and hype which makes it a particularly apt showcase for the intimate and often antiheroic works displayed roger s keyes the shows guest curator notes in the exhibition literature that ehon artists have tended to "embrace any subject however humble or imperfect " and westerners whose associations with japanese art are limited to stylized ocean waves shogun warriors and idealized geishas are likely to relish the shows idiosyncratic glimpses of private life unfolding with gusto in the inner courtyards of a formal and stratified society the ehon are ordered around five themes "art of the book " "origins " "heaven " "earth" and "humanity" with the last three described as a traditionally asian taxonomy but the humanity revealed is arguably the most engaging element the expressive faces and human foibles explored in some of the books are even more arresting than the flora mountains and calligraphy that while exemplary tend to reinforce the idea that japanese art is too lofty or serene to be accessible some of the best ehon here demystify segments of japanese society that were traditionally cloistered from view and particularly from the foreign gaze for example actors and courtesans for centuries casteless outsiders in japan were favored subjects of ehon artists "trailing willows" by omori yoshikiyo allows the vitality of such citizens to spring from the page it trains an unsentimental but admiring spotlight on the red blooded working women of shimabara the government sanctioned pleasure quarter of kyoto the subjects are depicted as assertive and complex hardly the subservient vessels often conjured in the western imagination in one plate a prostitute is seen actually assaulting a client in another one man is rebuffed in favor of a more sensitive lover domestic and street life are also revealed torii kiyonagas "colors of the triple dawn" leads readers through the rituals of dawn on the first day of the new year from a first bath viewed as if peering into a forbidden inner sanctum to the first stroke of the calligraphy pen to the years virgin transaction between merchant and customer the quotidian is elevated and an event as mundane as a visit to the barber is adequate inspiration for an elaborate image as in a book of illustrations for "the coast road poems" by ueda akinari the artists kawamura bumpo and watanabe nangaku revered akinari and their volume of prints has a breezy quality well suited to the poets syllable verses about ordinary japanese folk met along a roadway "i pat down my shaggy hair long and unkempt as a backcountry road ill hack my way through tomorrow when i reach the capital " the unofficial undocumented and unmentionable from eroticism to the atomic bomb are taken on by ehon artists in ways that make the books seem a cultural counterweight to formality and restraint the ambiguous use of text or in some cases its absence allows the reader to "write" the story in his own way or simply to admire the pictures and let his mind wander into unsanctioned territory in many cases the books are encased in boxes or folded in fabric suggesting an interactive relationship with the reader who must approach the contents in deliberate stages utagawa kunisadas "weighing the goods of love " from the s employs lavish packaging as a form of seduction encased in a protective box and in tantalizing layers of silk the book depicts an updated incarnation of the prince from "the tale of genji " gazing at the moon unaware that a group of swooning women are hidden nearby the gorgeous red and blue jewel tones of the pigment are matched by saturated passages of text "how id love to see your moon maned steed gallop through the clouds this autumn evening" that are only as suggestive as the readers imagination is fertile just as intriguing as these voyeuristic moments are japanese perceptions reflected in hundreds of prints produced between and of foreigners who were allowed to settle in a segregated port south of edo hashimoto sadahides "observations of the open port of yokohama " by turns crudely anthropological and witty seems to suggest mixed feelings about the westerners who excited both rapt curiosity and calls to expel the "barbarians " bushy sideburns and meaty faces depict the strange other whose customs are regarded as outlandish "the americans wash their children clean with special soap " reads one caption to an image of an oddly proportioned boy being scrubbed in a washtub not the most elegant image perhaps but just as satisfying in its way as the most exquisite japanese courtesan or hibiscus flower ms finnerty writes on culture for the journal
