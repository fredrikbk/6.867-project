americas best ambassador is a piece of parchment the declaration of independence by david armitage harvard university press pages &# everybody knows that the american declaration of independence announced that "all men are created equal" and that they should enjoy "certain unalienable rights " especially "life liberty and the pursuit of happiness " these phrases are taken from the now iconic second paragraph yet the immediate purpose of the declaration by the representatives of the united states of america to give the document its proper name in july was to be found in the opening sentences these spoke of the need to explain why the north american colonies had decided to secede from the british empire the "opinions of mankind" to which the appeal is made are not those of some global public hanging on the every emancipatory word but the governments of the european great powers in particular france and spain from whom the rebels urgently needed help it is a commonplace that every generation interprets the constitution anew in the light of its own concerns what is less known is that the declaration of has undergone a similar process of metamorphosis thus slave holding southerners tended to focus on the declaration as an act of state creation rather than on its emancipatory message northern abolitionists such as lincoln of course cited the documents proposition that all men are created equal as a mandate for the crusade against slavery more so than the constitution however the declaration has also become a global document a piece of intellectual and political common property that has transcended the circumstances of its creation and perhaps even the intentions of its authors surprisingly this afterlife has not received systematic and "global" treatment by historians and david armitage is to be congratulated on his concise and well written study of the declaration as to use his own words "an event a document and the beginning of a genre " he shows that it was first and foremost an "international" document driven by the need to establish the legitimacy of the united colonies within the state system and thus their right to conclude alliances against britain mr armitage also reminds us that the colonists who had observed the splintered fate of poland in with trepidation feared partition at the hands of the great powers if they did not play their diplomatic cards right later the claim to sovereignty and the extraordinary resonance of the phrase that all men were created equal inspired many imitations some such as the white rhodesians unilateral declaration of independence stressed the assertion of political independence most such as the vietnamese declaration of emphasized both sovereignty and equality among men there are also clear echoes of the american original in the declarations of venezuela liberia and israel if there is a weakness in mr armitages account it lies in his tendency to place the declaration in the context of the struggle between "empires" and "states " this is perfectly understandable the americans broke away from an empire after all and most of the declarations surveyed in this book were products of th and th century decolonization mr armitages emphasis on imperialism and its discontents is also part of a broader swipe at "analysts and cheerleaders who unofficially use the language of empire" on behalf of the pentagon and the white house he may have his harvard colleague niall ferguson in mind here who has argued that the u s is in denial about its imperial vocation and should embrace it more openly and thus more effectively in fact the american revolution was no revolt against imperialism americans regarded themselves as joint stakeholders in the british imperial project some such as john adams had been predicting since mid century that "the seat of empire" would be transferred from britain to america after besting the french and spanish in the seven years war in which americans believed they had played a decisive part many colonists looked forward to reaping rewards in the ohio valley and beyond their quarrel with london began not with the british effort to tax the colonies but two years earlier with the proclamation of by which americans were forbidden to engage in further westward colonization the last straw was an act passed by the westminster parliament in transferring the lands in contention to the jurisdiction of the formerly french colony of quebec it foreclosed the option of western expansion and threatened to re encircle the colonies the issue lurks quietly but unmistakably in the passage in the declaration part of a list of grievances about "enlarging the boundaries" of a "neighbouring province " the creation of the u s was therefore seen by contemporaries as the birth of a new empire a "mighty empire " as one enthusiast put it at the time americans broke with london in order to set up an even more ambitious venture of their own which would eventually stretch from sea to shining sea herein lay the real radicalism of the american revolution the territorial dynamic it unleashed proved to be far more fatal to the european empires than the example of american democracy itself in time the expansionist impulse led to the peaceful absorption of french louisiana and the rather more violent despoliation of large chunks of new spain which made up the future california texas and new mexico little did the french and spanish ministers who read the declaration in realize that the appetites of the "imperial republic" they helped to create would make the defeats of the seven years war look like well a tea party mr simms teaches modern european history at the centre of international studies cambridge university
