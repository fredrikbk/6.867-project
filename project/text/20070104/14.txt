business behind nardellis abrupt exit executives fatal flaw failing to understand new demands on ceos robert nardellis demise as chief executive of home depot resulted in part from his failure to understand how profoundly the job of ceo has changed in recent years mr nardelli was old school in an interview last fall as his public relations problems were compounding he acknowledged he had gotten "too focused on the idea that you do your job you take care of your numbers and the rest will take care of itself " some of mr nardellis numbers were hard to argue with in six years on the job he doubled home depots sales and more than doubled its earnings what mr nardelli missed however is that in the post enron world ceos have been forced to respond to a widening array of shareholder advocates hedge funds private equity deal makers legislators regulators attorneys general nongovernmental organizations and countless others who want a say in how public companies manage their affairs todays ceo in effect has to play the role of a politician answering to varied constituents and its in that role that mr nardelli failed most spectacularly there were plenty of other reasons a board might want to dump him he provided no return to shareholders he pursued a controversial strategy of expanding into the low margin wholesale business and he accepted an exorbitant pay package but other ceos have survived similar criticisms mr nardellis failure to do so reflects at least in part his inability to adapt to a new era of greater scrutiny "i used to play football " he said when asked about the challenges of being a public company ceo today "in football you always know the score now its like we are ice skating and youve got a bunch of judges on the sideline shouting out the scores " as failures go mr nardellis isnt half bad he walked away with an exit package of &# million and that figure was calculated before announcement of his resignation boosted the potential value of his stock options yesterday much of the package is due to the rich employment contract he negotiated with the home depot board before leaving general electric co where he was one of three finalists to succeed jack welch mr welch convinced his board to give all three finalists large batches of stock options telling board members they would have to make good on only one mans options one director says upon leaving ge the board was told the two runners up likely would use those awards to negotiate pay at their next jobs which is exactly what mr nardelli and james mcnerney who is now ceo of boeing did yet mr nardellis extravagant pay became his biggest problem it prompted an attack from shareholder advocates like richard ferlauto who runs investment policy for the american federation of state county and municipal employees one of the nations largest labor unions mr ferlauto helped organize protests at home depots annual meeting last year prompting mr nardelli to commit his gravest political error aware of the protests to come he convinced other board members to stay away from the meeting and restricted shareholder questions to one minute that sealed his public image as a callous and entrenched corporate leader and even prompted a call from his former boss mr welch in response mr nardelli belatedly tried to become a politician he went on a "listening" tour to visit of the companys largest shareholders and he granted interviews to a number of television and newspaper reporters he apologized for his ham handed handling of the annual meeting but he didnt apologize for his pay package and he didnt reduce it that left him vulnerable last month when an investment firm relational investors llc announced it was mounting a proxy battle to put new directors on the home depot board ralph whitworth who heads relational said his complaint had less to do with mr nardellis pay than his strategy mr whitworth believes home depot erred in expanding into the contractor supply business but mr nardellis weakened standing greatly increased the odds that mr whitworth might win his proxy battle so home depots directors acted first raised in a blue collar family and educated in public schools mr nardelli was upset when informed by mr welch that he had lost out to ivy leaguer jeffrey immelt for the top job at ge he believed he had been a better performer building revenue at the companys power turbine business from &# million in to &# billion in but subsequent events have confirmed the wisdom of mr welchs choice like mr nardelli mr immelt has struggled with a languishing stock price but in addition to generating good operating results mr immelt has played the ceos political role with great skill he has tied his own pay closely to performance he has eschewed the kind of employment contract that is now rewarding mr nardelli he has reached out to a wide range of constituent groups and he has adopted a number of popular initiatives such as his "eco imagination" program which among other things includes an effort to reduce ges emissions of greenhouse gases as a result mr immelt wins awards graces magazine covers and is widely praised as one of americas best ceos procter &amp gamble co s a g lafley is another ceo who has learned the lessons of the post enron era instead of catering just to shareholders he makes a broad appeal to "stakeholders" a group that by his definition includes shareholders employees customers consumers and the communities in which all these people live when i asked him last year whether that makes his job sound like that of a global politician he responded "like it or not we are in a global political world ive concluded im in it anyway and i might as well deal with it anyway " no one exemplifies the new ceo more than wal mart chief executive lee scott when mr scott found his company under attack by a well organized political campaign he responded in kind he reached out to his opponents took polls of opinion leaders and hired political consultants he also embraced environmentally friendly policies improved employee health care coverage and began advocating policies like an increase in the minimum wage mr scott insists the environmental positions hes taken and the other policies hes adopted are all good for the companys bottom line in an interview in his office in bentonville ark last year mr scott said "the generation of people i work with like a g lafley who has been here in this office in the last two months or jeff immelt who has been in this office in the last three weeks feel there is a business reason to do this " taking the political route may be necessary to success in the post enron world but it alone is not sufficient citigroup ceo charles prince has tried to appease his critics by making ethics a hallmark of his time at the top but that hasnt helped the banks lagging performance or silenced its critics in any event its clear mr nardelli never bought into the approach favored by his colleagues like mr immelt mr lafley and mr scott instead he fretted that the corporate system is under attack "i am very concerned with the future of business and the capitalistic system in this country " he said last fall expressing his concern about the repeated attacks on public companies "somebody has yelled fire in the auditorium if you stand back youve got to say that we as a country should share a growing concern as it relates to the capitalist system the things that got us to where we are are under attack " one consequence of the increased pressures on public companies and their ceos mr nardelli noted is a rush of both money and talent into private equity which is shielded from many pressures that affect public companies "not everyone can go private " he said not everyone but how about mr nardelli he wasnt giving interviews or any hint of his plans yesterday but his strong background in operational management his distaste for the public spotlight and his hefty severance check in need of investing may make him the perfect candidate for a private equity firm see related article "moving out amid a pay dispute home depots chief faced board
