rep frank offers trade offs on labor goals washington businesses wondering how to deal with the democrats taking charge in congress today have a blunt offer from a top lawmaker in the majority support our priorities and well support yours the "grand bargain" laid out by rep barney frank represents a road map to how democrats may strike deals to aid unionization expand health care coverage and find common ground on other issues while giving businesses concessions on immigration trade and investment in practice it may be difficult for mr frank either to deliver his partys side of the deal or find a partner with whom to bargain still the massachusetts democrats remarks may represent a guiding philosophy to how capitol hills new majority will try to use popular unease over growing income inequality flat wages and soaring executive pay as fuel for legislative priorities many democrats exploited those concerns in winning novembers midterm elections "there are two outcomes possible " mr frank said yesterday in a speech at the national press club "either people will join with us in solving the health care problem getting a humane immigration policy good rules that welcome responsible foreign investment going forward with trade with reasonable environmental and labor standards allowing people to join a union and we will then be able to go forward in a pro growth way engage with the rest of the world implement productivity enhancing technology " alternatively he said conservatives can "continue union busting" and leave a growing number of people without health care "then people should not be surprised when there is no renewal of trading authority if you have resistance to sensible immigration policy thats the choice that has to be made " mr frank takes over as chairman of the house financial services committee giving him formal sway over key business concerns ranging from regulation of mortgage companies fannie mae and freddie mac and executive pay but not big issues such as trade taxes and health care that means his influence may be as much philosophical as practical his influence "is more as a thinker than someone who has a big stick " says andy laperriere a policy analyst for the brokerage firm isi group inc "in terms of who democrats look to for someone who thinks about important economic issues frank is influential " but mr laperriere said "its not clear how such a grand bargain can be agreed to on the business community side exactly who is the business community thousands of major companies and hundreds of trade associations " some of mr franks proposals are largely symbolic he plans hearings over the next two years on the causes consequences and responses to increased inequality and weak wage growth he also urged federal reserve chairman ben bernanke not to blame higher wages for inflation mr frank has signaled a willingness to support renewing the presidents authority to negotiate trade deals and then submit them to congress for only an up or down vote which expires this summer but he wants those deals to contain environmental and worker protections trade deals however are under the jurisdiction of the ways and means committee headed by new york rep charles rangel in a telephone interview mr frank acknowledged his limitations "what im trying to do is create a political climate where this sort of thing would be possible " he said
