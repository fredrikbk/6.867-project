corporate democracy ultimately means improved shareholder value henry manne defines "corporate democracy" in a way that is unrecognizable to those advocates for greater shareholder rights who use that expression as shorthand for trying to improve the corporate governance system to increase and in some cases begin to establish accountability of directors and management to shareholders "the corporate democracy oxymoron " editorial page jan we do not see the political system as the model for determining when and on what issues shareholders should vote we do not advocate contested elections or nominations to be made "willy nilly" his words we do support requirements that directors must receive a positive vote by a majority of shares cast directors be elected annually and in very limited circumstances would permit a significant segment of shareholders to nominate directors at companies that have failed to generate the support of a majority of its shareholders this is not a political statement or based on a hidden agenda but common sense economics for shareholders who have invested in companies that lack accountability his ideas that poor performance and compensation excesses are the product of "regulatory interference" rather than corporate governance deficiencies and that a return to pre would make the world a better place will appeal to few to the contrary our goal of improving corporate governance is a private sector remedy which we believe will increase investment performance and ultimately benefit the private enterprise system which prof manne espouses peter clapman president and ceo governance for owners usa scarsdale n y prof manne was correct when he stated "we need corporate activists today more than ever but we need them to lobby and argue for repeal of our many costly and ill serving bits of corporate regulation " one of the most "costly and ill serving bits of corporate regulation" is sec rule a which hinders shareholders from nominating director candidates and causing their names to appear on the corporate ballot its major cost is that it prevents effective corporate director accountability at the thousands of corporations with publicly traded stock other "bits of corporate regulation" allow less than effective directors to entrench themselves with unrestricted access to shareholder contact information and the corporate purse prof manne states that "the selection of managers including the board of directors is ultimately a function of majority shareholding not any political type shareholder election process " however he does not explain what method he prefers to determine the will of the majority of shareholders and the supposed merits of his unspecified approach there is no "hidden agenda " "corporate democracy" means enhanced competition for corporate stewardship and accountability that translates into improved shareholder value les greenberg chairman committee of concerned shareholders culver city calif
