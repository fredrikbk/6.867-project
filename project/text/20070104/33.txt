energy from another backyard canada takes on projects unpopular with americans saint john new brunswick the oil and natural gas industry is increasingly looking to canada as a home for big energy projects americans dont want in their backyards a patch of coniferous forest near here on canadas atlantic coastline represents both the promise and the challenges of that approach the land owned by closely held canadian energy company irving oil is earmarked for the possible construction of a barrel a day crude oil refinery that would cost &# billion to &# billion the first new refinery in the u s or canada in more than years irving hopes a refinery if it chooses to build one would be operational by the challenges include drawing international partners and a skilled work force to the sparsely populated area as well as convincing locals that the changes are for the better the refinery development is the cornerstone of a concerted regional attempt to construct a huge "energy hub" in new brunswick supplying the markets of boston and new york with gasoline natural gas and eventually petrochemicals and related products that would increase u s energy reliance on canada which already supplies of its imported oil and oil products and about of its imported natural gas the effort is the latest sign of increased interest just outside u s borders in part to supply the u s market two liquefied natural gas where gas shipped from overseas in transportable liquid form will be processed for consumer use are planned for british columbia mexico also has drawn interest in august an lng terminal on the countrys east coast owned by royal dutch shell plc of the u k total sa of france and mitsui &amp co of japan accepted its first delivery others are planned for mexicos west coast intended to supply some gas to southern california but mexicos energy infrastructure is less developed and the nation faces its own supply concerns the rise in u s energy demand shows no signs of easing despite higher prices as supplies world wide become harder to find the country also has been slow to invest in the infrastructure necessary to bring extra imports to consumers due in part to concerns about the cyclical nature of the energy business also hurting matters is the widespread not in my backyard attitude "nimby" for short toward new industrial investment which has notably delayed development of lng terminals in the u s saint john which is conveniently close to the u s northeast has both a natural deepwater port that could accommodate more shipping and a large amount of unused land suited for industrial development irving oil which already has a barrel a day refinery at saint john that exports petroleum products to the u s also is building an lng terminal there in conjunction with spanish energy company repsol ypf sa with plans to import about one billion cubic feet of natural gas a day to meet u s demand irving is in talks with potential partners and is gauging local support for the possible new refinery with an eye to applying for a refining permit early this year local officials hope that will contribute to the economic regeneration needed by saint john a city hard hit by the decline of both the shipbuilding industry and atlantic cod stocks the campaign of new brunswicks recently elected premier shawn graham focused on making the province a leader in energy generation "canada has been a reliable supplier of energy to the u s and thats something wed like to expand " said irving oil president kenneth irving grandson of the company founder "as long as we keep getting local encouragement were going to try our best to make this a reality " the company says it is negotiating with potential oil supplying partners though it wont disclose names to attract a partner irving is touting the potential refinery as a processor of heavier grades of crude oil which are tougher to refine and which oil producers can find harder to sell in world markets irving and local supporters hope to win locals and attract skilled labor which has left the region in recent years due to a lack of work and the oil sands boom in faraway alberta last month regional advocacy group atlantic canada published a brochure in albertas major cities seeking to draw workers back to eastern canada by illustrating the regions affordable living and laid back lifestyle the irving family owns many local businesses in fields from construction and shipbuilding to forestry and newspapers the familys local dominance has led some locals to question whether the regional government is holding irving oil to full account in the new brunswick legislature capped property taxes on the lng terminal at canadian dollars us&# a year for years opponents of the deal say thats about a tenth of what u s based anadarko petroleum corp will pay in taxes on the similarly sized though less expensive bear head lng terminal in nova scotia "irving oil has so much power in saint john and new brunswick that people are afraid to stand up to them " said leland thomas a founding member of the group friends of rockwood park which opposes the route chosen for the pipeline to the lng plant "theyre not paying full value for what theyre getting " city officials claim the property tax cap was vital to ensure the lng terminal was built in saint john at the time mayor norm mcfarlane said the decision "would rest well for the next years here " some locals still see the terminal as a safety hazard with a terrorist attack on lng facilities a particular concern "were taking all the risk and yet all the supplies are going to the u s " said carol brown a saint john restaurateur who refuses to refuel her car at irving oil stations irving oil says its had a largely positive response from the local community the company believes its policy of consulting with locals about the project at an early stage before applying for any permits have been made will enable it to convince them of its merits "the information weve had so far has been very encouraging " said mr irving "we believe this project has the right balance of aligning commercial interests along with those of the community "
