the numbers guy counting internet users remains a guessing game in a column last month i wrote about the methods behind a u k marketing firms ranking of the most popular online videos the firm viral factory was forced to improvise in arriving at some of its estimates for videos that debuted before the youtube era when email not the web was the preferred tool for sharing yet even todays videos generally watched on sites that count each view and publish the numbers can be hard to track just another reminder that on the internet supposedly the most quantifiable medium users remain hard to count to understand the video numbers predicament consider the site vidmeter com which launched this week its software crawls major video sites including youtube and grabs the stats they display vidmeters editors sift through the top videos and tally total views taking into consideration that the same video is often posted on multiple sites sometimes the same video is posted many times on a single site there were different versions of a popular "saturday night live" clip on youtube on a recent check according to vidmeter vidmeter does its crawl each day and ranks videos on views over the most recent hours theres more detail here and the rankings are listed here though be aware that the site doesnt filter results some videos contain adult content vidmeter is a "fun side project" for now said san diego based web site developer brian holt he said he may sell ads or charge for in depth tracking in the future but adding up view counts is difficult because different video sites included in vidmeter have different definitions for what constitutes a viewing for instance every time someone clicks play on a video at vsocial inc a site that aims to sell premium video services to businesses it counts as a view even if the video playback is stopped immediately and even if there were multiple clicks from that same computer on the same day chief executive mark sigal told me yet on revver a site that shares ad revenue with users who upload videos a view is only counted if the viewer watches all the way through and downloads an ad at the end the site also tries to put a cap on multiple views from the same computer by monitoring internet protocol addresses a spokeswoman said youtube declines to disclose how it counts views of videos much to the frustration of tech pundits like billionaire investor mark cuban who has questioned the stats on his blog "were not totally convinced by youtubes tracking " matt smith managing director at london based viral factory told me in an interview last month he explained that he too had seen sudden spikes in view counts for certain videos "we use it and share it with our clients but weve noticed some really weird anomalies " other internet "stats" also raise questions search engines google yahoo and aol released year end lists of the most popular search terms as theyve done in the past but its not always clear how the lists are compiled and the methodology can be curious google removes references to itself and its own products like searches for "google video " said a spokeswoman also google tracks how much a particular term increases in popularity over time rather than its overall popularity that distinction wasnt made in some press reports including an article in abc news that reported "more people searched for the web site bebo com than anything else " bebo is a social networking web site that launched in yahoo removes all company names generic terms "movie " "football" and technical jargon "email " "mp" even though such terms are probably quite popular those details werent mentioned in widely reprinted associated press coverage of the pre eminence of "britney spears" on the list aol meanwhile removes adult terms and company names a spokeswoman said as a business blog noted the variation in methods helps explain what blogger nick carr bemusedly observed was an almost complete lack of overlap between the three lists one exception "american idol" appeared on both the yahoo and aol lists for instance googles list includes social networking sites bebo and myspace video site metacafe the online dictionary wikipedia mininova used for peer to peer file sharing the techie terms "radioblog" and "wiki" and the generic term "video " only the world cup and the telenovela rebelde broke up the computer centric focus but given yahoos restrictions on the list it ended up with a nontechie celebrity focus eight entertainers were in the top terms with "wwe" for "world wrestling entertainment" and "american idol" rounding out the list and aol which allows general terms had a decidedly generic list the only exception alongside terms like "tattoos " "dogs " "maps" and "cars" was "american idol " how large is the impact of filtering i asked all three companies to share with me what their top lists would look like without the filtering but all declined another recent internet counting controversy flared up around a company that freely publishes stats about itself san francisco based linden lab the maker of the virtual world second life reports how many "residents" have logged in over the last week fortnight month and day period it also reports a total population of "residents" for its online world but the majority of the total population hasnt been active on the site in the past two months and further skewing the numbers each avatar or virtual persona is considered to be a distinct "resident" in second life even though users can create multiple online characters for this the company has been criticized by internet consultant and new york university adjunct professor clay shirky on the blog valleywag he also challenged the reporters who claim that second life has a million or more users even though most "residents" are inactive according to second lifes own stats only a little more users are logged in at any one time in response to mr shirky linden lab chief executive philip rosedale cited to me the stats available at the link above and added "we go further than most other private online companies in being this transparent and this has always been a core part of our culture internet firms often use sign ups site traffic and return visitors as proof of momentum and we go beyond that in the granularity of our data " thanks to everyone who posted to the
