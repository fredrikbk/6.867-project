quarterly mutual funds review whats new try another question does this innovation make sense mutual fund companies love to roll out new offerings in the past two years they have created more than funds given the volume it isnt surprising that many are retreads of what already is out there for example funds focusing on large company stocks were among the new things last year when there were more than available still there have been some innovations in recent years some worth their while others worth avoiding for investors it comes down to this question how do you judge whether something newfangled holds promise "innovation is a double edged sword " says don phillips a managing director at mutual funds researcher morningstar inc "the ability to innovate is a positive for investors in that your get a deeper and wider tool kit but we also get a lot of bad innovations whole product categories that dont serve investors well " five years ago for instance fund companies rolled out "principal protection" funds that guaranteed shareholders their investment back after a certain number of years while also promising exposure to gains in the stock market thanks to their complicated inner workings many investors paid huge fees to earn returns that barely exceeded the bond market more recently fund companies have rushed to capitalize on the popularity of hedge funds by offering mutual funds that use similar techniques "long short" funds have attracted tons of money but the performance of these funds has been all over the place some losing money every innovation carries its own pros and cons and investors should do their research before taking the plunge here are some approaches that many financial advisers consider worth a review abcs of etfs exchange traded funds are one of the hottest areas through november more than etfs launched in the u s and the category totaled more than &# billion under management in more than products next year according to some estimates another etfs will be introduced in the u s unfortunately many are gimmicky using unproven strategies making lofty promises but investors shouldnt throw the baby out with the bathwater exchange traded funds resemble index mutual funds but trade on exchanges like stocks vanguard group which offers both etfs and conventional index funds suggests its etfs are best for buy and hold investors those interested in etfs trading flexibility or those with a big lump sum to invest up front because investors must pay a commission every time they trade shares of an etf they probably dont make sense for investors who rebalance their portfolios frequently have a small amount to invest or invest on a weekly or monthly basis many investors are drawn to etfs because they can get broad market exposure at lower cost than they do with conventional mutual funds run by stock pickers who "might not even beat their benchmarks " says joe keenan a managing director for global fund services at bank of new york who works with etfs there are several ways investors can capitalize on the array of etf products in a recent report morgan stanleys global wealth management unit offered a "core satellite" approach that involves selecting a few broad market etfs and supplementing them with niche offerings the firm recommended etfs that track the russell index the dow jones wilshire index and the morgan stanley capital international u s broad market index as core options because they provide the "broadest exposure" to the u s stock market a moderate risk portfolio for an investor with &# to &# million included in u s stocks mostly large companies in foreign shares including in europe and in bonds mostly investment grade products investors could supplement the core etfs with mutual funds whose stock picking managers have track records of beating the market in areas like small company stocks where active management often has rewarded investors better than the benchmark indexes analysts at morningstar offer simple advice when using etfs like keeping them in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiencies and minimizing trading to hold down brokerage costs etfs also can be used for sophisticated strategies investors can buy options on etfs or bet on their decline through short positions to help hedge risk many many options generating income will be a goal for more and more fund investors as baby boomers head to retirement bonds are good at reliably kicking off a stream of income but these days interest rates arent all that high and reaching for bigger yields in areas such as high yield bond funds introduces credit quality risks to a portfolio plus bonds arent great for investment gains no small thing for retirees who can expect to live for decades after they stop working stock funds which generally deliver investment gains over the long term tend to do a lousy job paying income including those focused on dividend paying stocks that is because to cover expenses funds are required first to use money earned from dividends and other investment income after which there may be little left for investors the average equity income fund yields according to lipper inc a slew of etfs have emerged that focus on paying dividends and because of their low expenses do a better job than most conventional funds however these etfs often concentrate on financial stocks or other big dividend paying sectors an alternative becoming more common funds that layer in an income producing strategy based on stock options for some investors all this may be reason enough to say "no thanks " "some people say options that sounds like derivatives which they are " says duncan richardson chief investment officer at eaton vance corp "theres a negative bias that goes with that term but this is a use of derivatives to lower your risk and not increase it " options give an investor the right to buy or sell a stock at a specific price at the most basic level a mutual fund using an options strategy would earn income known as a premium by selling an option on a stock in the portfolio that gives that another investor the right to buy the stock at a given price in the future in practice funds often sell options based on stock market indexes whichever way the premium income translates into income paid out to investors yields on these funds have been running from to according to lipper there is a trade off if the stock or index rises above the specified price the investor is likely to exercise the option which means the fund has given up some potential gains for the sake of the premium income as a result during big rallies funds using this strategy are likely to lag behind pure stock funds "investors have to recognize that these are a hedged product and the expectation can not be that theyll participate fully in an up market " mr richardson says and very high yielding funds run the risk of having to dip into fund assets potentially selling stocks to maintain those big payouts the most popular format for the options strategy has been closed end funds which sell a set number of shares to the public and trade on an exchange like a stock in november eaton vance launched a closed end fund that uses options and it became the largest closed end fund offering in history pulling in &# billion investors who prefer conventional mutual funds also have some options last year goldman sachs asset management introduced an options strategy conventional mutual fund and allianz global investors converted a traditional growth and income style fund to an options using fund "not all investors are comfortable with closed end funds " says kristina hooper head of product management for equities at allianz age based wisdom for investors who want a one stop solution one of the biggest innovations in recent years has been age based mutual funds they are also known as target date or life cycle funds so named because investors are supposed to pick them with a retirement date in mind they promise diversification wrapped up neatly in a single mutual fund they invest in a mix of mutual funds both stock and bond and gradually move from heavier stock concentrations to heavier bond concentrations as the investor approaches the designated retirement date as simple as the concept is investors do need to do their homework a target date fund from two different fund companies can be built very differently for instance t rowe price retirement fund has about of its money in stock funds and about in bond funds whereas vanguard target retirement fund has about in stocks and bonds the heavier allocation in stocks at t rowe price group inc reflects the firms belief that as americans live longer stocks would provide the higher returns needed to sustain income on an inflation adjusted basis for many years after retirement says spokesman steve norwitz about years after the target date the t rowe allocation becomes fixed at in stocks some funds invest in real estate funds or emerging markets funds which may affect the riskiness of the investment for instance alliancebernstein retirement strategy fund invests about of its portfolio in the real estate sector and russell investment groups lifepoints strategy fund holds about of its money in emerging markets investors also "should look at what happens when the fund hits that target date " says shauna ginsberg an analyst at financial research corp while t rowe price adjusts the mix for decades after the target date is reached others like vanguard adjust for years to years other fund companies leave the stock and bond mix as it is on the target date barclays global investors for instance merges its lifepath target date funds into its lifepath income fund which holds about in bond funds and in stock funds another factor to consider the performance of the underlying funds and the track record of the managers of those funds among useful questions does the fund company include its best performing funds in the target date portfolio how experienced are the managers also as investors are meant to hold these funds for decades they need to pay attention to the cost costs have a significant impact on returns over many years yet expense ratios on these products can differ widely some portfolios are composed of ultra cheap index tracking funds while others with funds headed by stock pickers may be quite expensive and some fund companies layer management fees on top of the expenses of the underlying funds while others dont expenses range from about of assets to about the average is ms ginsberg says
