a world free of nuclear weapons nuclear weapons today present tremendous dangers but also an historic opportunity u s leadership will be required to take the world to the next stage to a solid consensus for reversing reliance on nuclear weapons globally as a vital contribution to preventing their proliferation into potentially dangerous hands and ultimately ending them as a threat to the world nuclear weapons were essential to maintaining international security during the cold war because they were a means of deterrence the end of the cold war made the doctrine of mutual soviet american deterrence obsolete deterrence continues to be a relevant consideration for many states with regard to threats from other states but reliance on nuclear weapons for this purpose is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective north koreas recent nuclear test and irans refusal to stop its program to enrich uranium potentially to weapons grade highlight the fact that the world is now on the precipice of a new and dangerous nuclear era most alarmingly the likelihood that non state terrorists will get their hands on nuclear weaponry is increasing in todays war waged on world order by terrorists nuclear weapons are the ultimate means of mass devastation and non state terrorist groups with nuclear weapons are conceptually outside the bounds of a deterrent strategy and present difficult new security challenges apart from the terrorist threat unless urgent new actions are taken the u s soon will be compelled to enter a new nuclear era that will be more precarious psychologically disorienting and economically even more costly than was cold war deterrence it is far from certain that we can successfully replicate the old soviet american "mutually assured destruction" with an increasing number of potential nuclear enemies world wide without dramatically increasing the risk that nuclear weapons will be used new nuclear states do not have the benefit of years of step by step safeguards put in effect during the cold war to prevent nuclear accidents misjudgments or unauthorized launches the united states and the soviet union learned from mistakes that were less than fatal both countries were diligent to ensure that no nuclear weapon was used during the cold war by design or by accident will new nuclear nations and the world be as fortunate in the next years as we were during the cold war leaders addressed this issue in earlier times in his "atoms for peace" address to the united nations in dwight d eisenhower pledged americas "determination to help solve the fearful atomic dilemma to devote its entire heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death but consecrated to his life " john f kennedy seeking to break the logjam on nuclear disarmament said "the world was not meant to be a prison in which man awaits his execution " rajiv gandhi addressing the u n general assembly on june appealed "nuclear war will not mean the death of a hundred million people or even a thousand million it will mean the extinction of four thousand million the end of life as we know it on our planet earth we come to the united nations to seek your support we seek your support to put a stop to this madness " ronald reagan called for the abolishment of "all nuclear weapons " which he considered to be "totally irrational totally inhumane good for nothing but killing possibly destructive of life on earth and civilization " mikhail gorbachev shared this vision which had also been expressed by previous american presidents although reagan and mr gorbachev failed at reykjavik to achieve the goal of an agreement to get rid of all nuclear weapons they did succeed in turning the arms race on its head they initiated steps leading to significant reductions in deployed long and intermediate range nuclear forces including the elimination of an entire class of threatening missiles what will it take to rekindle the vision shared by reagan and mr gorbachev can a world wide consensus be forged that defines a series of practical steps leading to major reductions in the nuclear danger there is an urgent need to address the challenge posed by these two questions the non proliferation treaty npt envisioned the end of all nuclear weapons it provides a that states that did not possess nuclear weapons as of agree not to obtain them and b that states that do possess them agree to divest themselves of these weapons over time every president of both parties since richard nixon has reaffirmed these treaty obligations but non nuclear weapon states have grown increasingly skeptical of the sincerity of the nuclear powers strong non proliferation efforts are under way the cooperative threat reduction program the global threat reduction initiative the proliferation security initiative and the additional protocols are innovative approaches that provide powerful new tools for detecting activities that violate the npt and endanger world security they deserve full implementation the negotiations on proliferation of nuclear weapons by north korea and iran involving all the permanent members of the security council plus germany and japan are crucially important they must be energetically pursued but by themselves none of these steps are adequate to the danger reagan and general secretary gorbachev aspired to accomplish more at their meeting in reykjavik years ago the elimination of nuclear weapons altogether their vision shocked experts in the doctrine of nuclear deterrence but galvanized the hopes of people around the world the leaders of the two countries with the largest arsenals of nuclear weapons discussed the abolition of their most powerful weapons what should be done can the promise of the npt and the possibilities envisioned at reykjavik be brought to fruition we believe that a major effort should be launched by the united states to produce a positive answer through concrete stages first and foremost is intensive work with leaders of the countries in possession of nuclear weapons to turn the goal of a world without nuclear weapons into a joint enterprise such a joint enterprise by involving changes in the disposition of the states possessing nuclear weapons would lend additional weight to efforts already under way to avoid the emergence of a nuclear armed north korea and iran the program on which agreements should be sought would constitute a series of agreed and urgent steps that would lay the groundwork for a world free of the nuclear threat steps would include changing the cold war posture of deployed nuclear weapons to increase warning time and thereby reduce the danger of an accidental or unauthorized use of a nuclear weapon continuing to reduce substantially the size of nuclear forces in all states that possess them eliminating short range nuclear weapons designed to be forward deployed initiating a bipartisan process with the senate including understandings to increase confidence and provide for periodic review to achieve ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty taking advantage of recent technical advances and working to secure ratification by other key states providing the highest possible standards of security for all stocks of weapons weapons usable plutonium and highly enriched uranium everywhere in the world getting control of the uranium enrichment process combined with the guarantee that uranium for nuclear power reactors could be obtained at a reasonable price first from the nuclear suppliers group and then from the international atomic energy agency iaea or other controlled international reserves it will also be necessary to deal with proliferation issues presented by spent fuel from reactors producing electricity halting the production of fissile material for weapons globally phasing out the use of highly enriched uranium in civil commerce and removing weapons usable uranium from research facilities around the world and rendering the materials safe redoubling our efforts to resolve regional confrontations and conflicts that give rise to new nuclear powers achieving the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons will also require effective measures to impede or counter any nuclear related conduct that is potentially threatening to the security of any state or peoples reassertion of the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and practical measures toward achieving that goal would be and would be perceived as a bold initiative consistent with americas moral heritage the effort could have a profoundly positive impact on the security of future generations without the bold vision the actions will not be perceived as fair or urgent without the actions the vision will not be perceived as realistic or possible we endorse setting the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons and working energetically on the actions required to achieve that goal beginning with the measures outlined above mr shultz a distinguished fellow at the hoover institution at stanford was secretary of state from to mr perry was secretary of defense from to mr kissinger chairman of kissinger associates was secretary of state from to mr nunn is former chairman of the senate armed services committee a conference organized by mr shultz and sidney d drell was held at hoover to reconsider the vision that reagan and mr gorbachev brought to reykjavik in addition to messrs shultz and drell the following participants also endorse the view in this
