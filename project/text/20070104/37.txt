everyone is capable of pulling off a stylish individual look "you should never be intimidated by fashion " he says "it is meant to be fun " mr fords approach to high fashion has always been a blend of innovation and accessibility a characteristic that has caused some critics to deride him as more of a marketer than an artiste but mr ford shrugs "i have always had very mass tastes mass taste on a high level and im proud of it " he says mr fords mission as a designer was always "to be ahead of the curve but never too far ahead " he says his own personal style is a variation of an open shirt with a blazer "i never wear a tie " he says "tight things around my neck give me a headache " since he left gucci mr ford has worked on several projects introducing tom ford sunglasses that average &#

luxury goods mr fords tenure at gucci occurred during a pivotal moment in high fashion when gucci lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton and prada group transformed the international fashion scene into multi brand billion dollar empires fueled by demand for &# and up "it" handbags the new status totems from then on upscale designer togs would be referred to as "luxury goods " steeped in red carpet hype and snob appeal today however consumers no longer want to have the same thing at the same time "now everybody wants to have something different " mr ford says "a woman doesnt necessarily want the same bag her friend has that is part of the appeal of vintage fashion you dont see yourself coming and going its something that you found " next spring mr ford will launch new individual fragrances under his eponymous label marketed by estee lauder the idea is "to give everyone something they will be able to latch on to " he says "people want the ability to be an individual and that is why luxury keeps growing " trends such as the expansion of the customized dior handbag line suggest other companies also share his vision for the first time coach introduced last fall a collection of handbags and accessories that can be monogrammed with up to three initials cheap chic will stay chic as more mass chains from h&amp m which has most recently teamed with viktor &amp rolf to target which has deals with isaac mizrahi and others produce low priced designer clothes and accessories high fashion is becoming more democratic than ever before sitting in his london home mr ford says he himself is wearing a pair of levis and a t shirt his t shirts are always "from gap or banana republic or some underwear label " he notes such basic togs can hang in a womens closet alongside say a &# chanel jacket because "the same chord is authenticity " he says "the idea is that good design should be affordable to all " "with target for example you go in there and find something that is a great price and wonderful for its intrinsic value this is democratization of fashion i love this high low concept " he says adding "there is all this accessibility everything is now online " logos lose their luster during his years at gucci mr ford used the gg logo as a launch pad for creating cachet updating it and putting it on everything from shoes to handbags to dog beds nowadays designers of every stripe high and low plaster logos on a broad array of merchandise so that logos no longer carry the connoisseurship and cachet they once did "i never thought logos were the way to sell products " he says too often they are showy labels that dont represent merchandise that is high quality a logo is "only as valuable as the brand it represents " mr ford says "people now are maybe more suspicious of that hollow product behind the logo " still he understands why many consumers are fixated on wearing logos it demonstrates they belong to an elite group "its just part of human nature " he says celebrity marketing is here to stay "it has become so formulaic the celebrities and the party pictures that run all over the world and i am just tired of it " says mr ford who spends part of the year at his home in los angeles "i have a lot of friends who are actors and actresses and in some cases all this publicity centering on fashion hurts their careers it demystifies them you get so tired of seeing someones face on an advertising billboard " in several luxury goods makers including versace veered away from stars to showcase models in their ad campaigns yet celebrities continue to dominate most fashion advertising and product endorsements and a growing number of stars including gwen stefani and beyonce have been pushing their own fashion lines "in a way it is understandable that celebrity marketing thrives they are a constant in our lives in a way they have become our family " mr ford says "you can move from one city to another but you can pick up a magazine and know what lindsay lohan is doing you know everything about them " sensual is the new sexy at gucci mr ford was the designer most responsible for ushering in the ultra sexy style of the s there have always been sexy fashions but that decades look from low cut pants to gowns with plunging necklines sizzled with sex appeal "right now sexiness in fashion has given way to sensuality" a more subtle look he notes but "everything is cyclical " says mr ford sexiness in fashion "is never going to go away because we are human beings and that is one of our fundamental drives our attraction to other people " the reality is that while beauty standards come and go people "want to look beautiful and want to look attractive in clothing "
