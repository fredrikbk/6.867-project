seeking new ways to track viewership questions for george shababb company tns media research title chief operating officer marketers for years were content with simply knowing how many people watched the shows that their ads supported no longer pressure is mounting on companies to demonstrate that advertising has concrete effects on sales and image so advertisers are demanding more than numbers they are seeking granular information about how audiences behave while watching programs and ads taylor nelson sofres which has been in the audience measurement game for a long time is working to come up with new methods and technologies that seek to reveal not only the number of people experiencing certain ads but also much more about how they experience them at tns media research a taylor nelson sofres unit george shababb supervises the development of products and services used to measure u s digital audiences in recent months tns has struck deals with directv group and cable systems owned by charter communications and time warner inc s time warner cable these pacts allow tns to prepare information about how audiences view tv on a second by second basis based on information collected by a cable set top box there are limits to what it tracks it cant track when people leave the room for instance but tnss service can give advertisers an idea of how viewing patterns change when programs go to a commercial break for example by analyzing how viewers channel surf on a second by second basis media buyers could try to determine whether long commercial breaks prompt more viewer migration than shorter ones or whether viewers of sports programs exhibit different types of behavior than viewers of non sports shows says tracey sheppach a vice president at publicis groupes starcom usa which is using some tns data below mr shababb years old discusses some of the new things advertisers want to know about audience behavior and looks at some emerging tv venues that could draw additional interest from madison avenue the wall street journal you have been out striking deals with directv and different cable systems to track subscriber viewing patterns through the use of digital set top boxes but while your service can track viewers as they view second by second it cant break things down demographically or tell when viewers leave the room with so many firms looking to provide new forms of research on how people watch tv what will you do to improve your service mr shababb we have been exploring alternative metering devices and have actually field trialed these devices in the u s this metering technology is designed to use in digital homes what these meters do is allow us to determine when a person is in the room through use of a passive approach where the sample respondent is asked to carry a meter about the size of a luggage tag these meters are in development and undergoing field trials we do have a solution and that is a combination of some innovations in metering approaches together with statistical modeling that brings together the homes tuned for set top boxes with the number of people per home through the use of the new meters wsj how will services like yours deal with viewers who are increasingly using digital video recorders to watch programs on a delayed basis mr shababb it is our belief that increasingly the dvr will not be a standalone component but will be part of the overall service the dvr capability in some cases has already been embedded in the set top boxes and one of the really good things about collecting data is that dvr activity when someone is using a dvr does come through in terms of dvr development we are seeing a number of variations on the theme if you will beyond what may be in the marketplace today where some of the cable systems are talking about having a dvr capability that is housed on the server end there is a very interesting service that time warner has announced called "start over " where a home that has access to the service can within the time frame of a program go back and start the program from the beginning so lets assume you have a show that you like and it airs at p m in the evening and you get home at and you miss the beginning of the show you have the opportunity to enable a start over of the program as a subscriber you dont have to remember to record the show from an advertisers perspective one advantage of the service is where they have disabled the fast forward capability you cannot skip or fast forward through commercials wsj how might someone use the data you are providing from the set top box what things are possible now and what might be possible a year from now if you are able to roll this out in more widespread fashion mr shababb that information is being used to understand how channels are doing particularly a lot of the smaller channels that very often arent rated today people are using the information in a traditional sense beyond that we do have the ability to see when a dvr is being used we have the ability to measure video on demand however there does need to be more development done we are doing work in the area of the electronic program guide where we are working to develop new metrics related to how you navigate through the guide if you think about it for a moment in a digital home where you have to channels the guide is the gateway to the content if you will for the channels understanding how people navigate within the guide how much time they spend with various features of the guide is going to be increasingly important the guide itself may prove to be a very important advertising medium in and of itself wsj madison avenue is full of talk about measuring consumer "loyalty " "engagement" and "stickiness " what is everyone really looking for mr shababb there are a variety of definitions what i think people would like to know is when a commercial or program airs how much time are people actually spending with the commercial or the program for example if a commercial airs for seconds how much of that commercial is viewed admittedly that is one way of looking at engagement not necessarily the only way but that is a key metric that we are working with clients on it is a quantitative measure of how much time people spend with content so i guess thinking about it what do people want or what does the term "engagement" mean i guess i would look at it as the amount of time that a viewer is willing to spend watching a particular piece of content
