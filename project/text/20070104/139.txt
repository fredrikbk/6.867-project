why manufacturing shows resilience u s manufacturing is showing surprising resilience in the face of a sharp slump in autos and housing and in the coming year it is expected to expand roughly in line with the overall economy a closely watched manufacturing index turned positive in december reversing a decline the month before that had sparked gloom about the outlook for the sector new orders and production both edged up last month while pricing pressures eased norbert ore an economist at the institute for supply management which released the report yesterday said some manufacturers are suffering including makers of housing related products from bricks and backhoes to rugs and refrigerators "but there are also pockets of strength " he said such as oil exploration and aerospace manufacturing is just one part of the nations economy that has been sending mixed signals lately another report released yesterday suggests the u s job market may have shed workers in december private employment fell a seasonally adjusted last month according to a report by automatic data processing the payroll processing company and macroeconomic advisers an economic forecasting firm the government releases its monthly jobs report tomorrow separately the u s commerce department said yesterday that total construction spending fell in november to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of &# trillion that report also offered a mixed picture with residential construction down from the previous month the eighth consecutive monthly decline while nonresidential construction of hotels and office buildings rose manufacturing is coming off a boom that prompted producers to expand factory construction rose last year and in many cases manufacturers ended up with bloated warehouses as economic growth cooled in recent months while the economy expanded an estimated last year manufacturing output surged that is likely to change "what youre going to see going forward is a manufacturing sector that instead of growing a lot faster than the overall economy will be growing more in line with the economy " said david huether chief economist at the national association of manufacturers forecasters expect the u s economy to expand about this year the manufacturers alliance mapi an arlington va policy and research group is predicting a "pronounced slowing" in manufacturing growth this year for instance household appliance production is expected to decline and output of heavy duty trucks to fall surging demand for cellular phones and digital televisions is set to push up semiconductor shipments this year and shipments of airplane parts machinery production has been one of the bright spots for manufacturing during the past two years and overall is expected to remain robust but daniel meckstroth one of the groups economists noted that output of construction machinery is expected to slide in as a result of the housing slump while output of oil and gas machinery is expected to grow and industrial machinery one nagging problem is inventories as long as producers are stuck with excess goods they will be focused on curbing output in line with demand the latest ism report showed customer inventories stood at in december the third straight month above which indicates that inventories are too high inventories of autos are particularly large van jolissaint chief economist of auto maker daimlerchrysler ag said he thinks most of the big production cuts already have been made in his sector and that conditions should improve by the second half of the year particularly if employment and income gains dont falter as the year progresses he added the housing sector should bottom out too "im actually pretty optimistic not from the auto point of view but from the point of view of the overall economy in " mr jolissaint said many u s manufacturers are counting on exports to soften the blow of slower growth at home nordson corp a westlake ohio maker of machines used to spread adhesives on assembly lines sells two thirds of its machines outside the u s and says surging exports have more than offset the drop in sales at home the company expects strong overseas growth to continue this year some sectors face an uncertain future "we saw the contraction in housing hit us fairly rapidly this last fall " said fletcher steele president of pine hall brick co in winston salem n c sales at the closely held company plunged in november from a year earlier and were down in december he said pine hall which sells more than of its bricks to homebuilders has idled half of the eight kilns in its four factories in north carolina and georgia the company normally builds inventories during the slow winter months but this year mr steele isnt sure how much inventory building he will do the recent decline in commodity prices has been a double edged sword for manufacturers less costly commodities which translate into lower raw materials costs are a welcome break for factories after several years of hefty increases yesterday sharp declines in metals prices pummeled mining stocks sending freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc plunging &# or to &# as of p m new york stock exchange composite trading many manufacturers however built up supplies of metals and other commodities when prices were high anticipating further price increases those companies now are stuck with pricey stockpiles and are unlikely to feel any immediate relief from lower raw materials prices another uncertainty dogging manufacturers is the value of the dollar ronald defeo chief executive of terex corp a westport conn maker of mining and construction machinery says he worries the dollars value could continue to fall relative to other major countries while the weaker dollar benefits his big factory in redmond wash which makes aerial platforms that are exported world wide it hurts his crane and other equipment operations in europe rafael gerena morales
