the evening wrap dems big day the th congress convened with democrats holding the gavel for the first time since the republican revolution and while the new leadership has a far reaching agenda just what accomplishments theyll have to tout to voters in is anything but clear democrats grabbed the reins in the house and senate today for the first time in years and they wasted little time in telling everyone within earshot just how differently things will operate on the hill "the democrats are back " cheered nancy pelosi the freshly minted speaker of the house "the election of was a call to change not merely to change the control of congress but for a new direction for our country " the party has a load of initiatives it wants to get cooking in its first hours back in command including cropping earmarks out of the federal budget and granting minimum wage earners a raise lobbying reforms are also high on the agenda president bush has signaled support saying hell accept a minimum wage increase if it is linked to small business tax breaks and claiming hes as eager as anybody else to give earmarks a swift kick out of town sen harry reid the new majority leader promised that "our efforts are going to be to work in a bipartisan basis in an open fashion to solve the problems of the american people " sounds great but those comments and similar crooning about cooperation by the president in recent days paint a picture of opposing baseball managers trading handshakes at home plate before the first pitch once the skippers waddle back to their respective dugouts the games on and indeed both sides have already dealt some brushbacks president bush in an op ed published this week in the wall street journal recited all the bipartisan homilies but also made it clear that tax increases are beyond the pale and that he expects to push forward with the war in iraq and not start a rush for the exits but democrats chalk up their electoral success to widespread voter discomfort with the war effort and they didnt shrink from renewing their call for a change in course "nowhere were the american people more clear about the need for a new direction than in iraq the american people rejected an open ended obligation to a war without end " ms pelosi said today the democratic majority on both sides of the hill is slim and in the senate it is particularly tenuous as south dakota democrat tim johnson convalesces from a brain hemorrhage for now as ambitious as the democrats seem the most likely scenario is a legislative traffic jam that leaves both parties digging their nails into the steering wheel much to the delight of wall street which typically prefers gridlock in washington for all the soothing talk theres rough stuff ahead partisan enmity snuck out when staffers with rep heath shuler a freshman democrat said staff employed by charles taylor the eight term republican he is succeeding wiped out operating systems on their office computers that called to mind the hijinks in the waning days of the clinton white house when staff liberated the w keys from computers to the chagrin of fresh faced bush workers the stakes are high and partisanship dies hard

hardest hit was the gap which saw december sales at its namesake and old navy outlets take a dive banana republic stores had merrier results but overall gaps sales at stores open at least a year plummeted gap wasnt alone in its holiday misery a half dozen or so other clothing retailers took a hatchet to their outlooks about the only apparel chains not slinking off to sulk in a dark closet

biggest retailer of them all reported december sales that were slightly better than the brass in bentonville had expected them to be climbing amid a forecast for flatness but it also said this months sales will likely climb just to news that taken with all those chopped down outlooks among apparel chains casts doubt on hopes for a post holiday gift card bounce gift cards are unquestionably popular and since stores cant book a gift card as a sale until after the recipient redeems it money collected in december may not show up as money spent until january or later that along with higher levels of

disappearance over indonesia of an adam air flight carrying more than people got a little murkier after a top aviation official said the pilot didnt issue distress signals or report mechanical problems before disappearing contradicting earlier reports the development piles another layer of ambiguity onto an already vexing crash indonesian officials at first claimed that the plane had been recovered along with around a dozen survivors but the government climbed down from that story too and the plane is still missing it isnt unheard of for planes to be lost for days aviation experts say particularly in areas of low population density and difficult terrain such as the indonesian archipelago but the mystery is traumatizing for family members of passengers and will likely make it much
