the six sigma factor for home depot departure of ceo nardelli brings into focus a management technique he championed the departure of robert nardelli as home depot inc s chief executive was largely seen as a result of his big pay package terse management style and failure to lift the atlanta home improvement companys stock price at a time when the housing boom was at full bore but it also is an example of "six sigma" a quality boosting methodology made famous by jack welch mr nardellis former boss at general electric co not panning out as promised developed at motorola inc in and licensed by that company for corporate use six sigma was one of several so called process management techniques that took off at u s manufacturing companies facing challenges from higher quality japanese products these techniques aimed at increasing efficiency and cutting costs have since been widely applied across industries such as retailing and financial services six sigma "languished until jack welch embraced it in the late s " says thomas davenport a professor of management and technology at babson college in massachusetts now qualpro inc a company that markets a competing process management technique has issued a study comparing the stock performance of companies that adopted six sigma with the performance of the standard &amp poors stock index qualpro has done work for lowes cos home depots main competitor given that the study was issued by a six sigma competitor it isnt surprising that the comparisons arent flattering motorola the company that markets six sigma declined to comment on the qualpro report mr nardelli didnt return calls home depot declined to comment a number of former ge executives including w james mcnerney jr former ceo of m co dave cote ceo of honeywell international inc and mr nardelli helped spread the six sigma word but have seen their companies stock prices lag since announcing the adoption of six sigma on july home depot shares are down compared with a rise in the s&amp p over the same period the stock rose more than yesterday on the new york stock exchange to &# after mr nardellis resignation honeywell shares are down since its six sigma announcement in early january compared with a fall in the s&amp p shares of m are off about since late december versus the s&amp p s climb ge shares rose sharply in the s but theyre down since july when the company adopted six sigma compared with the fall in the s&amp p "six sigma is not the end all be all " said robert ferris a spokesman for honeywell "it is simply a set of process tools we would never suggest that a companys performance is solely linked to the adoption of these tools " some proponents of six sigma say stock price is too simplistic a measure of the programs effectiveness "quality programs are not designed to be measured by a companys stock price " says jeffrey pfeffer professor of organizational behavior at stanford universitys business school and a six sigma advocate improvements generated by six sigma he adds "may or may not be reflected in the stock price " charles holland qualpros founder and ceo disagrees "there surely is enough smoke in the study to let you know there are problems with six sigma " he says "over a period of five years or more share price is an excellent indicator of whether youre getting better as a company " of the companies reviewed in the qualpro report underperformed the s&amp p index from the time they launched their six sigma programs through dec other underperformers include lockheed martin corp ford motor co and xerox corp six sigma companies that beat the s&amp p include caterpillar inc federated department stores inc starwood hotels &amp resorts worldwide inc target corp and whirlpool corp beside offering advice to lowes qualpro has worked with retailers big lots inc carmax inc and circuit city stores inc the knoxville tenn firms "multivariable testing" method a technique that allows companies to test many changes in procedure at once rather than individually lags behind six sigma in popularity the six sigma system trains selected employees in its techniques to monitor measure and improve processes and to identify and eliminate waste and defects these employees are distinguished by a colored belt system much as karate students are ranked the highest six sigma rank is a master black belt regular black and green belts work under these masters "if six sigma is one of the process religions it seems to have the biggest priesthood in these black belts " babsons mr davenport says one of the criticisms of six sigma is its reliance on this group of specially trained employees particularly in the retail sector where staff turnover tends to be higher than in some other sectors during the past couple of years management analysts and investors also have questioned whether six sigma is suited to help firms expand through technology innovation and human interaction the retail sector in particular "is a very human thing with lots of people going through your store wanting to talk to somebody about buying a chainsaw " says jeff matthews general partner at ram partners a hedge fund in greenwich conn "thats a lot different than running a light bulb plant efficiently " ram holds an "insignificant" stake in home depot mr matthews says mr nardelli centralized operations and invested in computer systems that allowed the huge store base to function more productively but he also cut staff which mr pfeffer the stanford advocate of six sigma says isnt consistent with the programs advice to drive fear out of organizations or to invest in the work force "you cant do just one little thing " mr pfeffer says "low cholesterol is just one measure of health in the same way quality management is just one piece of the puzzle but not the answer to the whole puzzle " see related letters "letters to the editor money depot the huge rewards of failure for some ceos" wsj jan
