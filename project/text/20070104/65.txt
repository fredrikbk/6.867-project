investors look to loan servicers more than ever for mortgage bond investors it isnt just who makes the loan but who services it with an increasing number of financially stretched homeowners falling behind on their mortgage payments investors in securities backed by subprime loans are paying more attention to the ability of mortgage servicers to manage delinquencies and defaults just as they are more closely scrutinizing the quality of loans lenders originate "from an investors perspective you are looking for servicers that are aggressive in flushing out delinquencies early " said andy chow who manages a &# billion portfolio of mortgage bonds and other fixed income assets for seneca capital management in san francisco mortgage credit strategist peter dimartino at rbs greenwich capital said he cant overstate the importance of servicers in mitigating loan losses "there is an adage out there " he notes "that says once you buy a bond you are buying the servicer " loan servicers collect fees for performing such tasks as collecting monthly payments and contacting borrowers who fall behind on their loans lenders retain some mortgage loans on their books but most are sold to investors in the form of mortgage backed securities big lenders often service their own loans including those that have been sold to investors but in many cases wall street firms that create mortgage backed securities select a servicer mundane as those servicing tasks sound a recent fitch ratings analysis found that loans handled by servicers rated rps the highest ranking by the rating firm experienced fewer losses and lower loss severity than those managed by servicers rated prs defined as "fully acceptable " the highest rated subprime servicers according to fitch include big lenders such as countrywide financial corp wells fargo &amp co and h&amp r block inc s option one and servicing specialists like litton loan servicing lp a unit of credit sensitive asset purchaser c bass llc in december fitch placed the servicer rating of amc mortgage services inc on "rating watch evolving " meaning its rating could remain "fully acceptable with noted strength " be upgraded or downgraded depending on its financial situation but analysts thomas crowe and kathy tillwitz said the servicing portfolio of amc part of acc capital holdings corp in orange calif is experiencing increasing delinquencies and its cost of servicing is higher than the industry average "our servicing operations are performing better than or equal to others in the industry " amc spokesman chris orlando said credit rating firms generally rank servicers based on their financial stability and the quality of their loan administration and default management processes a servicers rating can affect the amount of money issuers of mortgage backed notes need to set aside to cover losses in order to achieve a given rating ranging from triple a to triple b for each of the various classes of their bonds however some analysts and traders said rating firms servicer ranking hasnt had an impact on the pricing of mortgage backed securities as it is rather static at the same time they said a servicers ability to recover losses on defaulted loans likely will have more sway over pricing if as expected by some economists the worst housing slump in six years continues and past due mortgages keep rising "investors are increasingly interested in servicer quality " said rod dubitsky head of credit suisse groups asset backed securities research group "but they still tend to tier price bonds more based on a servicers financial strength than its servicing quality because financial strength is easier for investors to get their arms around while loss mitigation skills are difficult to measure " those skills he said "will have a greater impact on spreads on mortgage bonds going forward as we approach the twin buzz saws of increasing payment shock and slowing home price appreciation " mr dubitsky said his team is accelerating its efforts to evaluate servicers loss mitigation skills in another sign of the importance of servicing quality wall street firms are looking to acquire mortgage servicers in addition to lenders as part of their strategy to boost their mortgage bond business as recently as last month morgan stanley closed its acquisition of saxon capital inc a glen allen va company that specializes in servicing subprime loans as well as wholesale lending borrowers with poor or limited credit histories or with high debt relative to income promise greater profit opportunities for lenders and investors as they pay higher rates than more creditworthy borrowers subprime mortgages make up of total mortgage loans outstanding and the pool of subprime mortgage backed securities has widened more than fivefold between and subprime loans also boast higher default risk the majority of those loans carries fixed rates for the first two or three years and then resets to market rates the mortgage bankers association estimates about &# trillion to &# trillion of adjustable rate mortgages are due to adjust to higher payments this year about half of that amount is expected to get refinanced into fixed rate mortgages or other types of loans ahead of the reset but at a time when home prices are declining in many parts of the country subprime borrowers have fewer choices to tap into their homes to pay down debt the seasonally adjusted delinquency rate for subprime mortgages jumped to in the third quarter of compared with for the same period in according to the mortgage bankers association the highest since recent studies by ubs ag and by rbs greenwich capital also show that subprime loans made and securitized in are going into foreclosure faster than loans made in previous years because of the way mortgage backed bonds are structured investors care if a servicer is able to liquidate in a timely fashion nonperforming loans and properties taken back due to foreclosure known as real estate owned assets or reos the longer the property is on a servicers book the bigger the losses the rationale explains mr chow of seneca lies with the "excess interest " or the difference between the interest payments from the borrowers and the coupon paid to investors in the mortgage backed bonds such excess cash flows can be used to make payments to the investors if a loan defaults "thus a diligent servicer could trap excess cash flows for the benefit of the strength of the asset backed deal structure " mr chow said "if on the other hand the servicer delays in liquidating reos " he said "the excess interest escapes" and the credit risk increases for investors some investors also are questioning who shoulders more blame for the soaring delinquencies lender or servicer joseph lydon president and chief operating officer of accredited home lenders holding co a subprime lender and servicer said "the best servicing in the world isnt going to cure bad loans " the companys servicing operation is rated "above average" by standard &amp poor corp and moodys investors service and viewed as "fully acceptable" by fitch what sets accredited apart from others mr lydon said is "a feedback loop" linking servicing to production which allows the company to make adjustments to its underwriting guidelines based on how loans perform over time the san diego lender is cutting back on piggyback loans which allow consumers to borrow as much as of a homes purchase price and stated income loans or loans that disclose income but dont require verification many servicers also have strengthened their borrower outreach and education programs to prevent foreclosure borrowers never contact their servicers in more than half of all foreclosure cases industry surveys show and delinquent borrowers often dont know there are alternatives to foreclosure among the common options a servicer can offer are forbearance which temporarily delays or reduces payments and loan modifications which change payment terms for a fixed period "we try to have very very early intervention " said richard cimino president of loan servicing at new century financial corp a subprime lender and servicer in irvine calif
