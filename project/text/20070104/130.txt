the morning brief deciphering the move from dni to state the abrupt shift of national intelligence director john negroponte to deputy secretary of state raises a lot of questions about the bush administrations views of intelligence priorities about its plans for iraq and about why mr negroponte would agree to what amounts to a demotion answers to the last one may be the most evident when mr negroponte was tapped to be the first dni almost two years ago it seemed like diplomatic skills were among the top criteria for an official chosen to ride herd over intelligence agencies whose legendary inability to work well together was blamed in part for failures to stop and the faulty judgments on iraqi weapons of mass destruction mr negroponte a career official at state who served as ambassador to mexico the philippines honduras the u n and post invasion iraq seemed a reasonable choice and despite the partisan times the senate approved his nomination putting aside concerns about his role in the iran contra scandal but there hasnt been much public evidence the intelligence community has successfully put aside those rivalries a willingness to move from cabinet level to a sub cabinet position may be explained by what people close to mr negroponte tell the los angeles times that he wasnt happy trying to integrate sometimes adversarial agencies but it will translate into two vacancies at his office following former deputy dni michael haydens transition to cia director back in may creation of the dni position was one of the primary recommendations of the commission but was initially opposed by the bush administration and the white house decision to put its needs at the state department first may foster doubts about its backing of the intelligence communitys new structure sen susan collins the departing republican chairwoman of the senate government reform committee tells the new york times she is "disappointed that negroponte would leave this critical position when its still in its infancy there are a number of people who could ably serve as deputy secretary of state but few who can handle the challenges of chief of intelligence " still secretary of state condoleezza rice has had difficulty finding a replacement for former deputy robert b zoellick who left last summer for a post at goldman sachs mr negroponte had refused past entreaties to take the job and he wasnt the only one as the washington post reports and less than three weeks ago he told the post he planned to stay at dni through the end of the bush presidency administration officials interviewed by the n y times wouldnt say "whether mr negroponte was moving because the white house saw him as uniquely qualified for the diplomatic post or because president bush was dissatisfied with his performance as intelligence chief or whether it was a combination of the two " but a senior u s official tells the wall street journal he will be playing a central role in executing mr bushs new strategy for iraq his talents and experience will be welcome at state where simultaneous crises in the middle east and elsewhere may be overwhelming a team that has lost several top officials in recent months and where some foreign diplomats complain theyre having difficulty getting top level attention on "even urgent issues except for critical items related to the middle east " the l a times says government officials who told many national news media about the as yet unannounced personnel change also suggest that the leading candidate for the dni job is j michael mcconnell a retired navy admiral who like gen hayden headed the national security agency adm mcconnell has worked closely with the new defense secretary robert gates and with vice president dick cheney when the latter was defense secretary the n y times reports the l a times says adm mcconnell currently a senior executive at consulting firm booz allen turned down an offer to succeed gen hayden as mr negropontes deputy but had stayed on the administrations radar the nardelli debacle as a case study home depot shareholders were clearly delighted with the departure of contentious chairman and chief executive robert nardelli but other chieftains of corporate america may also be happy to drop from their ranks one more leader whose compensation helped generate a reputation for greed in the executive suite home depot shares ended the day up at &# after the company announced mr nardelli and the board of directors mutually agreed he should go his own way along with a &# million severance package and would be replaced by longtime colleague and vice chairman frank blake as the atlanta journal constitution reports executives and directors at the giant american home improvement retailer declined to explain the split in june the boards compensation committee decided to review mr nardellis recompense and he submitted a one page list of perks he would give up that included personal use of home depots six corporate jets one person involved in the matter tells the wall street journal but he wouldnt negotiate on his guaranteed &# million annual bonus and the hefty supplemental pension arrangement he had obtained this was despite the fact that mr nardelli "failed to reignite home depots slowing sales and sagging stock price" had an autocratic style that clashed with the company founders freewheeling culture and had exhibited "aggressive handling of the companys most recent annual meeting where no outside directors were on hand and limits were set on shareholders questions " which had outraged some investors the journal says journal columnist alan murray argues mr nardellis exit came from his failure to understand how much a ceos role has changed since the new millennium began "in the post enron world ceos have been forced to respond to a widening array of shareholder advocates hedge funds private equity deal makers legislators regulators attorneys general nongovernmental organizations and countless others who want a say in how public companies manage their affairs " mr murray notes "todays ceo in effect has to play the role of a politician answering to varied constituents and its in that role that mr nardelli failed most spectacularly " mr nardelli had been aggressively recruited to home depot six years ago from general electric after he lost out on a bid to succeed jack welch to jeffrey immelt this put him among the many ge executives to take their vaunted six sigma training and experience to welcoming companies elsewhere but his departure now raises what the new york times describes as "the question of whether g e executives are so bankable when they switch to new companies " experts tell the times that while ge executives seem to succeed at companies that are a lot like ge "big industrial firms that are dominant in their fields or that need an infusion of manufacturing and research discipline or that must grow by acquisition" they have more trouble at retailers like home depot which "require more fingertip feel to manage " time warner seeks dvd coexistence trouncing onto the battlefield as a

brawled for the support of studios in a bid to assure their technological standard doesnt end up as the latest betamax the times notes this "clash of corporate titans and their incompatible machines has left some consumers bewildered and has slowed the introduction of what is intended to be the next great thing in home entertainment " warner brothers now hopes "to spur sales of new dvd players and movies by gaining the support of retailers and cajoling rival studios into making their film and television libraries available in both formats on a single disc " also of note detroit news
