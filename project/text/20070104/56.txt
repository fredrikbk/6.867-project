hospital caters to chinas wealthy and poor innovative heart center uses market economy to subsidize treatment tianjin china at the teda international cardiovascular hospital just outside beijing patients can choose from six levels of service at the lowest end for about &# a night patients must share a small room with others the biggest suite at the hospital on the other hand costs about &# a night and occupies half the floor of a building it offers satellite television an indoor garden a conference room two bedrooms a massage chair and a private gym "its just like an airplane " says liu xiaocheng the hospitals president "in the front of the plane they have the first class in the middle business class at the end they have the economy class but theyre all going to the same destination its the market " dr lius bed heart hospital is an anomaly in china where the state is struggling to provide health care at a reasonable cost to its more than billion people while a small slice of chinas urban elite have western style health insurance the vast majority of people are left to fend for themselves paying out of their pockets to see doctors and buy medicines for costly surgeries most people are simply forced to borrow from relatives and friends some are denied treatment if they cant pay so the chinese government which regulates the costs of medicines and fees at public hospitals has opted to keep those prices as low as possible to ensure that poor people can at least afford to see a doctor and get basic care those public hospitals are often costly for the government to maintain eating up state subsidies privately owned hospitals which account for only around of chinas some hospitals may be run more efficiently and have more freedom in what they charge patients but many chinese citizens cant afford them dr lius hospital is trying to steer a course between those public and private extremes striking a balance between the universal access the communist system once promised and higher efficiency a market mechanism can bring he appeases communist officialdom with cheap medical care for impoverished orphans while simultaneously courting chinas wealthiest patients with the &# a night suite born in into a family of doctors dr liu says he has seen firsthand the failings of the old communist model during the cultural revolution he and his family were among the tens of thousands of educated chinese who were forced to relocate to the countryside where his family worked on a military farm planting corn soybeans and rice he eventually made it to medical school and studied in brisbane australia for several years during the s a time when china was beginning to open up to the outside world then he decided he wanted to return to china to help reform the health care system dr lius experiment has received support from the tianjin economic development area a special government run industrial zone teda invested about &# million to build the hospital which opened in september the teda cardiovascular hospitals business model "should be the trend in the medical industry " says chi changgui the now retired former director of the bureau of social welfare in teda "i believe more hospitals should and will follow this model in the future " dr liu hopes to eventually make a profit from patients like jiang xing a hong kong based businessman the year old mr jiang made the trek from hong kong for a cardiovascular checkup in tianjin because his friends recommended the hospitals services he spent two nights in one of the hospitals top suites with his wife and two other friends paying several thousand dollars for the privilege "this hospital is top notch in terms of its medical equipment medical care and all the other services " says mr jiang dr lius hospital looks nothing like chinas aging state run facilities the floor of the main lobby is polished marble flat screen televisions entertain patients in the waiting areas and automated teller machines are on hand to dispense cash theres a separate vip waiting room for the higher paying patients but the differences are more than cosmetic to keep his margins healthy dr liu runs his facility with market like efficiency he subcontracts work such as cleaning food laundry and security to a company based in the southern city of shenzhen and he has done away with the lifetime contracts that are commonplace in the public hospital system where bloated pension programs drive up costs all of the hospitals some full time employees work on one or two year contracts hes also not afraid to fire people "we run the hospital like a corporation the other ones are under the regime coming from the soviet union " dr liu says "planned economy very low efficiency wasted resources " dr liu expects the venture to turn a profit within a few years the hospitals revenue has been climbing rapidly dr liu says rising from around &# million in to an estimated &# million in but the government still subsidizes part of its operating costs in december china heart group a venture capital group with offices in hong kong and beijing signed a preliminary agreement to buy a stake in the hospital from the local government the terms are still under negotiation officials gave dr liu their support in part because he offers some beds at the hospital that cost only &# a night that price is approved by the government and it allows poor people to have some access to the system yu songting a year old boy with a congenital heart defect took a hour train ride with his mother yin ruiting from their home in northeastern heilongjiang province to tianjin because they had heard this hospital was the best and offered the operation they needed at a relatively cheap price altogether his hospital expenses totaled about &# compared with the &# to &# other hospitals told the boys parents they would charge besides offering cheap service doctors at the hospital have built up good will with local authorities by performing more than operations on orphans over the past three years on one afternoon in one of the hospitals operating rooms about a dozen doctors huddled around a seven month old orphan from shaanxi province her chest was split open as the doctors worked to correct a birth defect in her chicken egg size heart for such operations on orphans the government pays dr liu about &# apiece a price that doesnt quite cover his costs but dr liu says he doesnt mind because his work with orphans persuades the local government to let him raise prices for his richest patients in effect high margin business for the wealthy subsidizes care for the poor "if everyones satisfied why not whats wrong with it in the supermarket you can buy whatever you want " he says "why not in the hospital " juying qin in hong kong contributed to this article
