weekend journal books up from anomie the gum thief by douglas coupland bloomsbury pages &# any underemployed overly cynical young adult is liable to find himself stamped as genuine generation x merchandise but it has been years since the novel of that name was published now that its author douglas coupland is closer to retirement than college a question presents itself has his and my generation lived down to its reputation for avoiding work fending off adulthood with nunchucks and nurturing frail whimsy with tasty morsels of irony no not really and well kind of "the gum thief " mr couplands latest novel finds his demographic cohort even more gainlessly employed than when it began this time the bored characters sleepwalk the floor at a staples superstore but mr coupland himself puts the lie to the myth of the gen x underachiever with novels and several works of nonfiction behind him not to mention a produced screenplay and a canadian tv series in development he is a zola of the latchkey kids childhood nostalgia was once a central obsession of mr couplands characters as was the rush of technology but his recent books have largely stopped chasing the zeitgeist as a result their shelf lives have lengthened "the gum thief" almost harks back to samuel richardson in its epistolary structure and mr couplands characters no longer keep their emotions fenced off between quotation marks roger a drunk in his s who lost his son in a car accident and his wife after he had an affair builds an unlikely friendship with year old bethany long out of school but still a goth who dresses like vampira and has nothing in common with him except their workplace even staples divides them since its no shame for a girl her age to work there while rogers bedraggled presence among the young ballpoint pen stockers serves as a warning here is what the future will look like if you dont do something to change it roger and bethany barely talk to each other but he is curious enough about her to write in her voice a fake diary entry which she discovers while peeking in a notebook that he leaves in the break room annoyed but interested she admits that he has one or two aspects of her down cold she writes a response proposing that they continue to communicate the same way without ever speaking or even acknowledging each other in person "i cant believe im writing this to a total perv like you " she scribbles "well its something to kill time here at shtooples " the entire novel is composed of quirky communiques not just notebook entries but scribbled professorial responses to writing assignments a christmas card a store memo letters sent by fedex we learn only what the characters choose to tell each other which can be quite a bit bethanys mother a former high school classmate of rogers who is now a three time divorcee as lonely as he is writes to warn him to leave her daughter alone but later comes to rely on his advice as if the two were raising bethany together we sense that all three of these figures are damaged but not wrecked their covert intimacy starts to free them from their troubles roger who had been kicking around an idea for a novel called "glove pond" that borrows heavily from the plot of "whos afraid of virginia woolf " is finally inspired to write it for bethany to her delight the book includes a satiric self portrait of a loser who like roger and most coupland characters is in a permanent state of mourning for his departed youth its also misanthropically funny "bloody guests theyre never anything but trouble first they arrive and then they sit there and eat your food " roger writes in his heros voice in his notes to bethany roger admits that hes an alcoholic "if you type lush into google im the first hit" discusses his sons death and castigates himself for destroying his marriage in typically deadpan coupland shorthand he compiles a list headed "thorpe roger " in which a few lines catalog his journey to woe one item on the list "unable to afford halloween candy so he sits in basement apartment with all the lights off " bethany opens up too describing her own experience of loss and sharing the fruits of a writing class in which she was asked among other things to write about how toast feels when its being buttered she turns the assignment into brilliant parodies of various literary forms e g a "pilgrims progress" style seaborne epic a sci fi sketch at a less playful moment she writes "much of the time i want to be dead " mr coupland has been raising the stakes since "generation x " his debut in which three friends living in the sterile air of palm springs trade quips about meaningless white collar duties that mr coupland famously dubbed "mcjobs " once mr couplands barbs flew in all directions now his compassion does bethanys mother fears that "the chance of my falling in love again is zero " echoing the plain middle aged woman in mr couplands novel "eleanor rigby " who says simply "i may or may not snore theres never been anybody to tell me one way or the other " in contrast the pups of "generation x" sound merely petulant "all things seem to be from hell these days dates jobs parties weather could the situation be that we no longer believe in that particular place or maybe we were all promised heaven in our lifetimes and what we ended up with cant help but suffer in comparison " a secondary theme of mr couplands beneath the macroeconomic unease of "generation x" and the techno frenzy of "microserfs" has always been the family as a gravitational drag on the psyches and ambitions of its younger members but now family has moved to the foreground and ceased to be a joke the restless youth of "generation x " which includes a chapter titled "eat your parents " cringed at their parents as pests who "earnestly try not to inflame but their comments contain no scale and a strange focus " to the drifting cast of "the gum thief" a father missing a son a woman minus a husband and a daughter without a father a family looks less like a punch line than a lifeline mr coupland remains a funny novelist but he has become a poignant one as well mr smith a film critic for the new york
