four essential points of antitrust enforcement holman w jenkins jr s criticism of the ftcs antitrust challenge to the whole foods wild oats merger and his more general critique of antitrust enforcement misses four essential points "lessons of a food fight " business world aug first the value of antitrust enforcement is that it substitutes for more onerous sectoral regulation in the same article he criticized the fccs interest in open access to the internet under chairman deborah majorass leadership the ftc has urged caution in approaches to regulating the internet both in principle and as a matter of political reality the argument for light handed sectoral regulation is more persuasive if vigilant antitrust enforcement keeps markets competitive second in merger review parties settle the easy cases so the cases that go to court are necessarily the close calls one can debate whether the agencies are currently drawing the line in exactly the right place but these debates should not obscure the more general value of merger review allowing merger to monopoly would be a mistake and simply banning merger to monopoly is probably not the right place to draw the line third the challenge to the whole foods wild oats merger was the result of heightened requirements that merger challenges be based on facts and economic analysis mr jenkins ridicules the staples home depot challenge but the facts were that prices were lower in cities where those companies competed directly against each other than in cities where they did not similarly the ftc challenge to the whole foods wild oats merger was based on more than whole foods ceo john mackeys ill considered statements fourth the ftc can approve mergers but cannot block them without court review because of this asymmetry there are good reasons for the agency to make its best case when it has economic evidence to indicate that a merger might harm competition inevitably there will be cases like the whole foods wild oats merger when it does not convince a court that the evidence is sufficient that is how the system is supposed to work michael a salinger professor of economics boston university school of management boston mr salinger director of the bureau of economics at the ftc from july to june
