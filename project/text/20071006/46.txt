the jobs machine we interrupt this fear of recession with a word from the job market the labor department reported yesterday that the u s economy created new jobs in september along with upward revisions of jobs for july and august this is the latest sign that the recent financial panic is beginning to look more like a summer squall than an economic climate change thats certainly what equity investors seem to be saying as they once again bid up shares yesterday stocks have regained the heights lost during the august scare so most people who held on for the ride havent lost anything but a little sleep credit contagion aside the greatest fear among economists has been that the housing implosion will cut into consumer spending yet nothing influences consumers more than a healthy jobs market they really start spending less when they see their neighbors out of work and fear they could be next so far this isnt happening job growth has slowed from the pace in but it remains strong enough to accommodate most new entrants to the workforce and thus keep the jobless rate stable up from even better for consumer spending income growth remains strong average hourly earnings for non supervisory workers were up for the month and are now up in the last months real wages after inflation climbed by in the months that ended in august these income gains are stronger than those at a comparable stage of the recovery in the s and this is money in consumer pockets that will help to offset lower home prices all of which should make an impression on the federal reserve which cut interest rates by basis points last month on grounds that housing and the credit mess might tank the entire economy the housing recession still has a long way to run and will reduce overall growth by a percentage point or so for many months but maybe the central bankers should recalibrate their economic forecasts before they commit more rate cutting later this month the dollar remains weak and commodity prices are still in record territory the last thing we need is for the economy to ride out the feds housing boom and bust only to meet rising inflationary expectations on the other side meantime lets be grateful for the incredibly resilient u s growth machine
