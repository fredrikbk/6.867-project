weekend journal entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies the best new dvds our film critic on fall releases worth seeing from othello to funny face a pile of dvd boxes on my desk has grown into a leaning almost teetering tower its time to devote a column to new dvds that deserve your attention you could spend an enjoyable day or more steeping yourself in "valentino " a two disc flicker alley collection thats notable for its entertainment quotient home video premieres and digital reconstructions of four previously unavailable silent features as well as for the depth and devotion of its scholarship once youve explored the treasure trove of supplementary material which includes rare film clips audio recordings slide shows and photographs you may understand as you have not before i certainly didnt why rudolph valentino so revered and reviled in his time was the most mysterious figure of the silent era "valentino " along with other exemplary releases from the same company is available at flickeralley com these days its the fate of many foreign films to pass quickly through theatrical release on their way to dvd that means delayed but at least eventual gratification in the case of such standouts as "black book " the heroine of paul verhoevens elegant thriller set in holland during world war ii is rachel stein a former cabaret singer and current drop dead beauty played by carice van houten concealing her jewishness by dyeing her hair and changing her name rachel becomes a resistance fighter extraordinaire "black book" is similar in theme to ang lees "lust caution" but takes itself much less seriously thats a plus in my book can it be the th anniversary of "funny face " the musical nosegay to paris starring audrey hepburn and fred astaire yes it can and paramount has commemorated the occasion with a new dvd that boasts in a manner of speaking three featurettes as supplementary material two of them are dull and one is a fatuous exercise in studio self promotion the movie itself can be embarrassing the heroines adventures in left bank existentialism the age disparity between the two stars which as pauline kael noted way back when the script emphasizes by trying to ignore but its also enchanting when hepburns ardent bookstore clerk turned fashion model is on screen wearing givenchy costumes and singing timeless gershwin songs against timeless parisian backdrops two of the four discs in a technically impeccable shakespeare collection from warner home video come as welcome new digital versions of deservedly celebrated productions kenneth branaghs "hamlet" and max reinhardts "a midsummer nights dream" with james cagney as bottom and mickey rooney as puck the third is a corrugated curiosity george cukors "romeo and juliet " with leslie howard and norma shearer as stiff overage stand ins for the deathless though deathful young lovers but oh the fourth in a just world the entire warners publicity department would be on burbanks ramparts trumpeting the arrival of the first dvd version at least the first one playable on north american players of laurence oliviers revolutionary and magnificent "othello " when this film version of the now legendary production of the national theater of great britain opened here in i was newsweeks movie critic and i wrote of it "laurence olivier has set othello free he has emancipated him from acting conventions that made the moor of venice an eagle scout with special merit badges for probity and innocence that sentimentalized him into the gentlest of warriors who did in desdemona only because of iagos beastliness " i went on to describe oliviers athletic ebony skinned othello yes the actor defied political correctness by doing the film in blackface as a dangerous fool even a monster since then the film has been available here if at all only via vhs tape now on this pristine new dvd oliviers enormous portrayal is as heartbreaking as it is daring partly because frank finlays iago is such a vivid model of modern malignity and because maggie smiths desdemona is so lovely in this age of effortless celebrity we cheapen the currency of compliments by bestowing them too often oliviers "othello" reminds us what it means for a performance to be great recently i tracked down another relatively new and triumphant rendering of shakespeares material on dvd orson welles as "falstaff " a feature film directed by welles which has also been known mostly in europe as "chimes at midnight " i say shakespeares material because the bard scattered falstaffs immortal remains throughout four separate plays welles undeterred pulled them together into a single film of operatic excess bacchic camaraderie and at its time the greatest battle scenes since eisensteins "alexander nevsky " the cast includes jeanne moreau as doll tearsheet margaret rutherford as mistress quickly john gielgud as henry iv and keith baxter as prince hal netflix has several versions of verdis opera "falstaff " but the only digital version of welless "falstaff" that i could find for use on north american region players was via amazon the dvds imported from brazil arent cheap i paid almost &# and the quality isnt wonderful then again neither was the quality of the original which was underfinanced and problem plagued throughout its sporadic production no matter the performance and the achievement are intact "citizen kane" wasnt welless only masterpiece
