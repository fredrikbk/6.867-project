weekend journal leisure &amp arts declarations the trance barack obama has a great thinking look i mean the look he gets on his face when hes thinking not the look he presents in debate where they all control their faces knowing they may be in the reaction shot and fearing theyll look shrewd and clever as opposed to open and strong i mean the look he gets in an interview or conversation when hes listening and not conscious of his expression its a very present look he seems more in the moment than handling the moment ive noticed this the past few months since he entered the national stage i wonder if im watching him more closely than his fellow democrats are mr obama often seems to be thinking when he speaks too and this comes somehow as a relief in comparison say to hillary clinton and president bush both of whom often seem to be trying to remember the answer theyd agreed upon with staff whats the phrase we use about education hit search function hit open right click "equity in education is essential tim " you get the impression mr obama trusts himself to think as if something good might happen if he does what a concept anyway ive started to lean forward a little when he talks but he doesnt stand a chance right his main competitor mrs clinton is this weeks invincible she broke through for the first time in a big national poll saying they would support her a full points more than obama her third quarter fund raising beat everyone elses "its all over but the voting " said rep tom petri who will probably get pummeled a bit by the campaign for premature triumphalism but he only said what a lot of people are starting to think some democrats seem proud they already know who their candidate is unlike those messy republicans who havent been able to resolve the issue but should it be resolved before people vote has the democratic party noticed it actually has some impressive candidates they should not be written off and when you think about it its weird that theyre being written off joe biden used to seem mildly giddy vain but in a small way not a big and interesting way big is lbj ah will impose mah will small wheres my hair sculpting gel but it has been years since he became a figure in washington and in the past few years in particular he has been ahead of his peers on iraq ahead with warnings ahead with tripartite thinking ahead with a seriousness and sobriety about the fix were in he is the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and hes been reading daily threat reports for a long time he is impressive why dont the democrats notice chris dodd is the head of the senate banking committee and nothing if not sophisticated in the post world sophisticated is not so bad hes been in the senate years in earlier years his thinking on government his assumptions about what can and should be expected of it veered from the utopian to the world weary and were sometimes both at once but if you listen to him and watch him in debate you might legitimately conclude this is a candidate who understands how it all works and what time it is hes one of the grown ups anybody notice mr obamas experience as we all know is as limited as mrs clintons which is to say limited indeed she has held elective office for only years before that she was first lady of arkansas and then first lady of the united states he has held national office for only years and before that was a state legislator for eight years but he has impressed people and not with money resume or clout but something rarer natural gifts thats not nothing big talent is rare and deserves consideration and yet the democrats remain in their hillary trance not all of course each candidate has his band of supporters his little base mr obama is fortunate to have one with the grace and vigor of ted sorensen john f kennedys great staffer and speechwriter who told me this week "i am supporting obama " he has known and liked the other main candidates has "no objection to a female commander in chief and no ill feelings stemming from the clinton stains on the escutcheon of the white house " but mr obama is "the one serious potential nominee of the democratic party who is most likely to win" and most likely "to end the tragic occupation of iraq on terms compatible with our countrys best interests and traditional values " when i asked if his support was connected in any way to the idea of breaking away from the bush clinton bush rotation he said "above all i believe this country needs change and continuing the year hold on the white house of the same two families is not my idea of change " that to me gets to the heart of the problem and the heart of the trance mrs clinton is so far ahead so early on for the same reason mr bush was so far ahead so early on in and after only six years as governor with no previous offices behind him it is the nature of modern politics a political family gains allies retainers supporters hangers on admirers associates in house machiavellis the bigger the government the more ways allies can be awarded which binds them more closely your destiny is theirs members of the court recruit others money lines spread person to person company to company board to board mover to mover the most important part is the money lines power is expensive the second most important part is the word "winner " the bushes are winners the clintons are winners we know this theyve won the bushes are wired into the republican money line system the clintons are wired into the democratic money line system for a generation two generations now they have had the same dynamics in play only their friends are on the blue team not the red or the red not the blue they are both groups up and ready and good to go every election cycle they are machines there are good people on each side idealists the hopeful those convinced the triumph of their views will make our country better and there are those on each side who are not so wonderful not so well meaning not well meaning at all and some are idiots but very comfortable ones is this good for our democracy this air of inevitability is it good in terms of how the world sees us and how we see ourselves or is it something we want to break out of like a trance it would be understandable if they were families of a most extraordinary natural distinction and self sacrifice but these are not the adamses of massachusetts were talking about youve noticed right
