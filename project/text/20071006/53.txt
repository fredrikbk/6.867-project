toward an america free korea the most important issue in this weeks pyongyang summit between north koreas kim jong il and south korean president roh moo hyun may be an item not formally on the agenda namely the future of the u s south korean military alliance the question of american forces in korea is begged inescapably by thursdays joint north south declaration which proclaims that the two koreas "need to end the current armistice regime and build a permanent peace regime" and which further affirms the goal of "unification on their own initiative and according to the spirit of by the korean people themselves " what would the korean peninsula look like under such an arrangement one feature would almost certainly be the end of the u s alliance with the republic of korea rok pyongyang has long maintained that it will not accept a permanent arrangement for the peninsula that permits the continued presence of "imperialist forces " if seoul wishes to contemplate a confederation with north korea it must also prepare for a world without the u s rok alliance by many measures to be sure the alliance qualifies as a signal historical success since washingtons military guarantee to seoul has deterred another war on the korean peninsula and helped assure stability throughout northeast asia in the process it also facilitated south koreas own remarkable political and economic development into a liberal democracy and one of the worlds affluent economies but it is no secret that the u s rok alliance has been under growing strain for some time in recent years the military relationship has been beset by tensions that reflect fundamental differences over the perceived objectives of the alliance most critically u s and south korean policy makers seem now not to agree about the nature and urgency of the "north korean threat " or the appropriate responses to it no longer supported by the same shared sense of purpose that characterized it in earlier decades the alliance today appears to be heading into a more unhealthy and uncertain middle age despite this deterioration there has been remarkably little serious thought given in either country to what the world would look like if the alliance ceased to exist or what elements of it must be maintained for mutual korean and american interests last month in seoul a conference of american and south korean specialists spent two days attempting to puzzle through just what korea and the northeast asian region would look like in the absence of a us rok alliance not surprisingly there were questions on which the group did not approach consensus most importantly the future of north south relations most striking however were the many areas of broad agreement simply stated the sense of the group was that a future without the u s alliance would amount for south korea to an "unhedged bet " just how would seoul face heightened risks in a post alliance world let us count the ways military readiness there is no doubt that replacing the u s contribution to south koreas defense would be immensely expensive to the extent that it could actually be replaced american forces in south korea are far more than "trip wires" and "trigger pullers " they provide surveillance intelligence command and control and missile defense capabilities that seoul simply does not possess and would have to develop on its own at very considerable expense to maintain a credible deterrent posture in times of crisis south korea would also lose access to the range of "flexible deterrent options" the two sides have developed to bring more u s forces into the region when necessary as well as to the american nuclear umbrella if war occurred the u s might ultimately come to seouls assistance but only after delays that could cost many korean soldiers and civilians their lives economic performance dramatically higher defense expenditures would in the first place put a substantial additional burden on seouls national budget more generally south koreas economic prospects would also likely suffer in a post alliance world in the longer run international and domestic investors would almost surely lose confidence in the country without the assurance the alliance provides against a recurrence of hostilities on the peninsula to the extent that trade "follows the flag " the countrys trade patterns would also shift away from the u s and towards greater dependence upon china while the u s rok alliance does not appear to be a major driver of bilateral economic relations it does nonetheless provide incalculable but possibly non trivial economic benefits would washington be as willing to fight for a free trade agreement with south korea if seoul was not a military ally much less step in to help with the economic reconstruction of northern korea if the pyongyang regime collapsed in a post alliance era alternative security alliances or alignments south korea inhabits an historically dangerous neighborhood in addition to north korea the other nearby countries are china russia and japan without a u s military alliance where would south korea turn for a partnership to enhance regional security even a summary review emphasizes the obvious all other candidates for a northeast asian alliance are far less attractive than the u s from south koreas standpoint none of them could compensate fully for the loss of an american military guarantee and many of them might require significantly greater sacrifices of sovereignty than does the current pact with washington without a local ally however south koreas only other option would be armed neutrality a modern day return to koreas dreaded fate in the past as "a shrimp among whales " a nuclear crisis in south korea if forced to pursue a wholly independent self defense in a hostile security environment seoul would face overwhelming pressures to develop its own nuclear arsenal indeed the rapidity with which participants at the conference american and korean progressive and conservative arrived at this conclusion was chilling especially given the likely implications for regional stability further nuclear proliferation and south koreas international standing the "humpty dumpty" problem the participants at the conference discussed a whole variety of scenarios under which the alliance could come to an end amicable or acrimonious gradual or abrupt carefully planned in advance or suddenly sundered in the midst of crisis in none of these scenarios however was it possible to posit an easy way to piece the us rok military relationship back together again if at some point in the future seoul decided to seek a renewed american security guarantee it is difficult to forge a military alliance under the best of circumstances efforts at re engagement where each side would try to select only the items most attractive to its own interests are most unlikely to reconstitute a robust and resilient relationship an end to the u s rok alliance we should emphasize is by no means in the cards for now but the two countries do not have to wait for the negotiated end to inter korean hostilities or a formal termination of the u s rok alliance to reap a harvest of strategic risk some of those same dangers might also accrue well before an official end to the alliance if the structure is allowed to weaken and to decline in credibility only by realizing what is actually at stake can we expect the two sides to take the steps necessary to sustain and indeed strengthen an alliance that remains very much in both
