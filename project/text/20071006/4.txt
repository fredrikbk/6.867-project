cloudy outlook for the sunshine state your article "is florida over " page one sept seems to suggest that population growth in florida has come to a screeching halt nothing could be further from the truth although some indicators point to a slowdown over the past year or two indicators such as building permits electric customers and homestead exemptions point to substantial population increases data shows that florida continues to receive a large net inflow of migrants from other states and record numbers of foreign immigrants are settling in florida taken as a whole these data suggest that population growth in florida has slowed from the exceptionally high levels observed earlier in this decade but remains high compared to growth in other states i have been making population estimates and projections in florida for more than years and have seen many ups and downs in annual growth rates perhaps the most dramatic were in the s when annual population increases topped early in the decade but plunged to less than following a severe recession that didnt herald the end of population growth in florida of course the states population has more than doubled since the mid s from less than nine million to more than million its economy climate and quality of life will most likely continue to attract many newcomers especially from abroad in the years to come and the population is likely to grow by some three million per decade is florida over i wouldnt bet on it stan smith director bureau of economic and business research university of florida gainesville fla the florida legislature is ignoring seasonal residents pleas for equal treatment for the simple reason that we cant vote they cater to their electorate who are happy to have someone else pay the bills how can the state hope to attract new people with this discriminatory policy can you imagine the downward pressure being exerted on this huge real estate market seasonal residents are mature usually retired homeowners who are law abiding and who contribute substantially to the economy while using limited services they are more than willing to pay their fair share of taxes if this arrogant denial of the equal treatment of the law of a whole class of people is symptomatic of a system in decline and if it isnt addressed then yes florida is over john d grossi manchester n j although i agree with much or your article i have to provide some perspective to your statement that floridas two tiered tax system which is the result of the homestead exemption and a annual assessment cap hits newcomers and part timers harder than longer term residents weve lived in our home for years and were tired of being labeled the bad guys we built a very modest home with the intention of retiring here the homestead exemption and assessment cap allowed us enough predictability and stability to plan and budget our expenses we pay around &# annually and now the media and some government officials say that we should pay &# based on current market value we couldnt afford this now much less at retirement these newcomers to florida presumably knew what their property tax and insurance rates would be when they purchased their properties how is it now my problem that they dont like the fact that someone else is paying less last year we were excited to hear that florida was considering abolishing the property tax and replacing it with a sales tax finally savers and financially responsible residents would be rewarded and encouraged finally everyone was going to have to pay their fair share but that ended when the media got going and convinced the freeloaders that they were entitled to the hard earned money out of the pockets of the most productive citizens in florida rosemary kammerer st augustine fla
