the week ahead our take on coming events economy euros rise is set to spark some european fireworks by adam cohen the euros steady climb against the u s dollar is hurting european exports prompting politicians to lash out at the european central bank the u s trade deficit and chinas tightly controlled currency these complaints will likely get a loud airing in luxembourg on monday at a meeting of finance ministers from the countries that share the euro a regular gathering known as the eurogroup ecb president jean claude trichet attends these meetings and this time he will have to deflect a drumbeat for interest rate cuts french president nicolas sarkozy was a solitary strident voice when the euro was at &# but last weeks move above &# forced even the intervention shy germans to call for action "the strong increase of the euro against the dollar worries me " german economy minister michael glos said last week after the currency reached a new peak the ministers main task on monday will be forging a common european stance before the group of seven meeting in washington d c later this month markets will look for signs that the finance chiefs want strong medicine an ecb rate cut or even a coordinated effort to prop up the u s dollar the finance ministers likely will suggest the g finance chiefs and central bankers issue a statement urging the u s to pursue a stronger dollar and calling for china to let the yuan float more freely previous g statements have stressed only that volatile currency swings and global imbalances are bad for economic growth the u s is eager to repeat its calls for china to untether the yuan but isnt likely to acquiesce to language about the dollar so the european finance ministers may look for relief closer to home pressuring the ecb to help ease the euros rise the central bank held its key rate at on thursday and its expected to keep rates steady through the end of the year to ward off inflation the federal reserve by contrast cut its benchmark rate percentage point last month to help steer the u s economy through the subprime mortgage crisis diverging interest rates are a key factor in the widening euro dollar gap and while european politicians have tip toed around the central bank save for mr sarkozy who has demanded a rate cut for months mondays meeting could showcase growing strains in the ecbs relationship with national governments "we are in de pen dent " mr trichet said stressing each syllable when asked last month whether the central bank would bend to political pressure if mr trichet wont cut rates direct support for the dollar could be an option when the euro languished near u s cents in the ecb the federal reserve and the bank of japan together bought billions of euros propping up the currency intervention is an unappetizing prospect the u s and europe would have a tougher time pressuring china to let its currency float freely if they dont practice what they preach and intervention is no guarantee of success the u k government lost billions in when it tried to keep the pound pegged to the mark but if the euro keeps climbing something more than firm language will be needed european exports which become relatively more expensive as the currency rises are showing signs of slowing hurting everyone from french fashion houses to german auto makers europes economic recovery long awaited and still shallow could be in peril if the trend persists earnings alcoa may offer blueprint on coping in markets storm by robert guy matthews even though alcoa inc announced that it will take an &# million charge to sell its consumer packaging and automotive related divisions plenty remains to be seen when it reports third quarter earnings on tuesday as one of the first multinationals out with quarterly earnings alcoa will show wall street how corporate america is weathering the tighter credit weakening dollar and a continued strong demand for commodities across the globe the bulls arent likely to be disappointed and the bears wont see too much to wring their hands about either in other words the upside of commodity demand will help offset the downside of credit woes as for the weaker dollar the bag is mixed for alcoa as it is for many other multinationals wall street often looks to alcoa to set the tone for the earnings season since it has its toe in several sectors of the economy including manufacturing retail and commodities and does business on six of seven continents it is a major mining company a big supplier to the worlds construction aerospace automotive and consumer packaging markets and a huge user of energy including coal and electricity if it is unexpectedly socked by higher energy prices other big energy consumers might report the same if its aerospace business shines that could mean good news for that part of the economy for alcoa the downsides for the third quarter are a softening in aluminium prices marginally higher energy costs and a seasonal slowdown in some markets notably automobiles says ubs analyst brian macarthur demand for aluminium especially in china remains strong but the rate of growth should be more measured in the third quarter the big question is whether that represents a pause in growth or a plateau aluminum prices have fallen about &# a metric ton to about &# since june but that drop could be somewhat deceptive says lloyd ocarroll an analyst with davenport &amp co he says that the decline is more related to fund selling rather than a crash of aluminium industry fundamentals "recent financial volatility stemming from a fallout in the subprime mortgage markets hurt base metals prices as investors seem to be selling in anticipation of slower world wide growth " mr ocarroll says "the fundamentals however continue to be very tight in our view with no change in days supply of inventory over the past three months " if alcoa reports third quarter softness in aluminum prices they should rebound in the first quarter of meanwhile sustained demand in china is proving to be a double edged sword alcoa mines much of its minerals in australia which also supplies china china is consuming so much of australias minerals that energy shipping and labor are in short supply thus higher priced which in turn means higher costs for alcoa with the australian currency strong against the u s dollar alcoas cost to unearth and ship raw materials are even higher if the aluminum is sent back to the u s and sold here but alcoa is also exporting aluminum products out of the u s so it profits from the weak u s dollar too the degree to which the weak dollar as well as the commodity boom and financial volatility factors into alcoas earnings could signal how other companies will fare in the third quarter as well beverages gatorade streak eases but pepsi can maintain star player by betsy mckay when pepsico inc releases its third quarter results thursday investors will be looking closely for evidence that its big sports drink gatorade is on a rebound sales of the drink which pepsico acquired as part of quaker oats co in slowed beginning in the fourth quarter of last year as a result of competition from enhanced and plain bottled water price discounting by competitor coca cola co s powerade retailers reducing their inventories and other headwinds sales even declined in the second quarter coming off a increase in sales in the same period in gatorade is important to pepsi it is the companys second best selling brand globally after pepsi cola with &# billion in sales last year part of pepsis problem is that gatorades pace is naturally slowing after four years of sales at breakneck speed when pepsi says annual volume growth topped pepsi says new product lines the demand after hurricanes in and and other factors boosted sales now pepsi says it expects annual gatorade sales growth to reach the "high single digits" over the long term more in line with pepsis growth rate when it acquired the brand competition has intensified from other products particularly waters gatorade used to draw many consumers like jason levy a year old manager for a staffing company in baltimore who often chugged the sports drink to wake up in the morning after playing golf or basketball or to cure a hangover now he drinks vitaminwater instead the popular enhanced water brand acquired in june by coke "i feel better after drinking vitaminwater " he says calling gatorade too heavy and sweet analysts say gatorade sales of which still dwarf those of enhanced waters is poised for a second wind bill pecoriello an analyst with morgan stanley expects gatorade to post volume growth "in the mid single digits" for the third quarter helped by hot weather and some discounting to draw consumers back from powerade pepsi is in talks to hammer out a gatorade sponsorship deal with tiger woods that could be valued at more than &# million and whose global popularity would boost the drinks profile both inside and outside the u s a pepsico spokesman confirmed the talks but declined to comment on the expected value of the deal the company also plans to launch soon lighter beverages in the gatorade line to attract consumers such as mr levy the new drinks include g a low calorie drink aimed at athletes off the field that is set to make its debut at the end of this year robert van brugge an analyst with sanford bernstein &amp co expects gatorades volume to rise about this year and between and in in line with the companys long term target "by the first quarter they should have the negative headwinds behind them " he says
