weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece monument to a mercenary donatellos gattamelata portrays an adroit tough guy anatomy of a classic padua italy about giorgio vasari who more or less invented art history and definitely invented the term "renaissance" wrote that sculptures of his fellow florentine donatello "possessed so much grace and elegance and such a fine sense of design that they were considered to be more like the distinguished works of the ancient greeks and romans than those of any other artist who has ever existed " praise indeed in an era when antique sculpture was admired as it had not been since the fall of rome because of donatellos fame vasari says the signoria of venice commissioned him to erect a memorial to a condottiere mercenary soldier who had served the republic heroically donatello "created the bronze horse which now stands in the piazza of the church of santantonio in padua in this work donatello displayed the snorting and whinnying of the horse as well as the great courage and ferocity vividly expressed in the artfulness of the figure riding it " vasari writes "not only did it amaze everyone who saw it but it continues to amaze everyone who sees it today " vasaris description still holds emerging from one of paduas long narrow streets into the ample piazza of santantonio your attention is captured not by the sprawling brick church but by the tall plinth in the corner of the space crowned with donatellos enormous masterwork nothing diminishes the fierce majesty of the monumental bronze not the pigeons on the condottieres head and the horses ears and tail not the nearby stalls selling postcards cold drinks and tacky religious articles saint anthony of paduas hometown church is a popular pilgrimage site and the kitsch factor is high you gaze upward as amazed as viewers were in donatellos time and vasaris by the statues clarity sculptural inventiveness and forcefulness at first its difficult to decide which is more potent the war horse or his rider the stallion is huge and nervy with an impossibly thick neck and immense haunches nostrils flaring eyes wide he turns his elegantly articulated head slightly pricks his small ears and raises one foreleg the rider sits easily erect bareheaded wearing vaguely classical armor he raises a baton of office controlling the reins with one poised wrist then you notice the enormous sword at his side and the long spurs the robust calf and the implacable set of his jaw and suddenly theres no doubt about whos in charge the intersecting angles formed by the sword the reins and the baton sharply contrasting with the suave curves of the muscular horse create a forward thrust that implies movement and draw your eye upward to the stern face this dignified balding man with his steady gaze effortlessly dominates his powerful mount despite his deceptively relaxed posture and calm demeanor its an effective metaphor for the career of the man depicted erasmo da narni an adroit tough guy known as "gattamelata" "honeyed cat " the nickname seems to encapsulate both his character and his methods what does vasari say "great courage and ferocity " vasari believed that the great "rebirth" that he chronicled in his "lives of the most eminent architects painters and sculptors" came about because italian artists like the ancients were again looking hard at the world around them in gattamelata donatello demonstrated his knowledge of equine anatomy with the fragile tracery of veins and tendons that animates the great bulk of the horse but he also looked hard at antiquity the memorial reprises a celebrated equestrian bronze of marcus aurelius the one that until pollution forced it indoors stood on romes campidoglio a replica now substitutes the statue survived medieval weapon makers assaults on available metal because it was believed to depict constantine the first christian emperor rather than an expendable pagan the mounted figure one arm extended imperiously inspired a long line of later memorials beginning with donatellos gattamelata the first monumental equestrian bronze since roman times a few years before donatello began working on his huge sculpture the thrifty florentines had commissioned a painting of an equestrian statue from paolo uccello as a memorial to an unreliable english born condottiere sir john hawkwood but the free standing gattamelata was unrivaled from its completion in until the s when andrea verrocchio produced the intimidating bronze of the condottiere bartolomeo colleoni in full armor standing tensely in his stirrups in front of santi giovanni e paolo venice unlike gattamelata who was honored by a grateful serenissima colleoni paid for his own monument leonardo da vincis unfinished rearing horse and rider in milan its life size clay maquette destroyed by invading french archers in the early th century descended from marcus aurelius by way of gattamelata as did augustus saint gaudenss th century monument to gen william tecumseh sherman at fifth avenue and th street yet donatellos marvelous emblem of assurance and subtle power remains uncontested its elegant profile radiating authority against the clear sky and rosy brick of the piazza del santo as it has for more than years ms wilkin is the curator of "color as field american painting " opening in november at the denver art museum
