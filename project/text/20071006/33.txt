remembrances james w michaels as editor of forbes he forged a sharp edged capitalist tool by stephen miller as editor of forbes for nearly four decades james w michaels favored notes short and acerbic "this is stenography " he often wrote of copy that lacked point of view "congratulations this is a masterful job of interviewing an interesting and colorful man and getting precisely one quote " he wrote about another article or responding to obscure statistics he might scrawl "hows your wife " in michaels speak that meant "compared to what " one statistic was clear two decades after mr michaels

publications including the wall street journal "it was entirely michaelss magazine and his vision and style " says rick edmonds a media business analyst at the poynter institute while fortune was known for longer articles and business week for a survey of the weeks news forbes specialized in "having a fresh take and holding businesses accountable from a small investor viewpoint " mr edmonds

lawyers and the national education association forbes began grading mutual funds and publishing lists of executive compensation and of the wealthiest americans one thing he taught was to buck conventional wisdom in he published a prison house interview with junk bond king michael milken at the time a reviled wall street figure "mike milken is a chastened man " mr michaels wrote "he deserves a fresh hearing " the story ran words nor did he hesitate sometimes to break the usual mold of business journalism at an editorial meeting stewart pinkerton then deputy managing editor proposed a story on the burgeoning business of country music all he had was a one sentence description and mr michaels was famed for skewering unprepared editors mr michaels said simply "theres our cover " so garth brooks showed up on the march issue though forbess ad campaigns called it the "capitalist tool " it was a tool that if need be could turn on big business mr michaels liked to refer to the magazine as the "drama critic" of business he displayed on his office wall what he said was a quote from a rival editor "forbes theyre nasty venal people " in decennial anniversary issues the magazine published lists of the decline of leading corporations of decades past "it is always safe to take counter cyclical positions in a cyclical world " mr michaels told ad week in the son of a

widely distributed up story began "mohandas k gandhi was assassinated today and as if by pre arrangement savage rioting broke out in bombay " forbes was a nine man operation when mr michaels joined as a mutual fund reporter in by mr michaelss account it still operated along the lines of its founder b c forbes "hobnobbing with the tycoons " but in malcolm w forbes took over and with his balloon and motorcycle rides faberge eggs and occasional appearances in lederhosen provided the ad sales and the glamour mr michaels provided the editorial rigor mr michaels could be as contrarian in life as in editing he rarely socialized with publishing professionals and encouraged his staff to abstain as well he distrusted electric typewriters but plunged into word processing and the internet which allowed him to send his line by line editing from his rhinebeck n y country house at age he took up scuba diving in mr michaels retired as editor and took a job as group vice president at forbes inc
