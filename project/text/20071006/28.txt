merrills &# billion bath bares deeper divide after big write down tied to mortgage debt oneal asserts control merrill lynch &amp co s announcement friday that it would take a &# billion hit is exposing the weak oversight exercised by top merrill executives as it became a big force in the mortgage securities business wall street has been reeling from the recent credit crunch tied to questionable home mortgages with several companies taking multibillion dollar write downs but merrill is taking the biggest charge and is the only major u s firm so far that has said it will report a loss for the third quarter the announcement gave a boost to merrills shares which rose &# or to &# in p m trading friday on the new york stock exchange that reflected investors relief that merrill is trying to put the problems behind it the broader stock market was also higher with the s&amp p index hitting an all time high the dow jones industrial average gained to just shy of a record merrill lynch best known for its symbol of the bull and its "herd" of brokers pitching stocks to retail investors had become deeply involved in the mortgage business by this year that was despite an assurance to investors just three months ago that its exposure was "limited" and "contained " at one point merrill had amassed a portfolio of at least &# billion in risky assets people familiar with the situation say the ballooning exposure to these assets which fell in value amid soaring defaults by homeowners prompted the firm on wednesday to oust two of its top credit market executives osman semerci and dale lattanzio the executives believed the crunch was "just a hiccup " but merrill chief executive stan oneal concluded that their estimates of the assets value were overly optimistic people familiar with the firm said there were cheers and high fives on the debt trading floor after the exits were announced says a person who was there the ouster was surprising because mr oneal and one of his top executives ahmass fakahany had been seen within the firm as big backers of mr semerci the two ousted executives oversaw collateralized debt obligations which are securities backed by pools of mortgages and other assets their group got "caught out" with a large position in these securities in a "game of musical chairs " said someone familiar with the firm mr oneal lost confidence in the executives ability to manage the business said another person close to the firm in a brief interview mr semerci disputed a suggestion that he had placed a greater emphasis on market share than on risk controls he declined to comment on issues of valuation mr lattanzio couldnt be reached for comment in a statement friday mr oneal said that "while market conditions were extremely difficult and the degree of sustained dislocation unprecedented we are disappointed in our performance in structured finance and mortgages " in a minute video message to merrill employees yesterday mr oneal accepted a share of the blame for the losses saying "i missed it " in july before the market worsened merrills chief financial officer jeff edwards said in a conference call with investors that the firms exposure to subprime mortgages was "limited contained and appropriate " these mortgages are typically made to borrowers with poor credit records and their value has plunged this year "this is a black eye " said analyst michael mayo of deutsche bank ag "theres no free pass for a &# billion write down it shows they could have been more conservative in writing this down all along " credit rating agencies maintained merrill lynchs current credit ratings but revised the outlook to negative standard &amp poors said fridays announcement "raises concerns over merrill lynchs risk management practices in allowing such a large exposure to build " a lower credit rating can increase a companys borrowing costs merrills earnings warning brought to nearly &# billion the total amount of write downs recorded by major banks and securities firms including merrill lehman brothers holdings inc morgan stanley goldman sachs group inc citigroup inc ubs ag deutsche bank and bear stearns cos the actual losses are even greater because they have been reported after fees offsetting hedges and gains recorded by the financial firms due to declines in the value of their own debt merrill wasnt able to trade its way out of its problems analysts noted because it was one of the biggest creators of collateralized debt obligations these instruments are created by buying various kinds of debt often risky mortgage backed securities pooling them together and using them to back the issuance of new bonds the bonds which are sold to investors come with different levels of risk and return as the biggest seller of cdos merrill had bought a large amount of mortgage securities and built a "warehouse" of these debt instruments to add capacity merrill paid &# billion for subprime mortgage originator first franklin in january a deal which mr oneal conceded friday was poorly timed the write down means merrill will report a loss of about &# million or cents a share for the third quarter after showing quarterly operating profits averaging over &# billion for the past four quarters this means merrills earnings will likely decline from &# billion for not counting charges but should still top the &# billion level of mr oneal said he believed the losses are "contained " and the firm needs to take such risks to serve clients and generate shareholder returns merrill has strengthened its risk controls he added and doesnt plan a broad retreat from such markets or broad job cuts it was the big push into cdos combined with some personnel changes last year that led merrill astray according to firm executives merrill which had a small share of cdo underwriting before started a big push that year that took it to the no spot from through this year its annual cdo underwriting volume swelled to &# billion in from &# billion in according to dealogic a data provider more than two thirds of the volume comprised cdos backed by subprime mortgage bonds fees on such deals typically total about of the face value of the debt which would bring merrills estimated fees for on such deals to roughly &# million merrill was holding assets for over two dozen pending cdos when the market for subprime mortgage bonds began turning south earlier this year according to a person familiar with the matter prices for subprime mortgage bonds and mortgage cdos have dived from to since february with much of the decline taking place this summer after investor demand for them dried up some insiders say the departure of jeff kronthal who oversaw credit real estate and structured products until his july ouster may have contributed to merrills problems in addition to opposing the first franklin purchase mr kronthal worried that merrills exposure to cdos was too great according to people familiar with the matter after mr kronthals departure these people said mr semerci and his cdo team led by mr lattanzio continued amassing the risky assets these people said and didnt back down even when demand ebbed earlier this year in internal conversations with senior merrill executives this year messrs semerci and lattanzio argued against major markdowns in the value of the assets but after the market turmoil merrill decided to value the assets at seriously depressed consensus market prices that created bigger losses than merrills senior executives had anticipated the new valuations in many cases were lower than where messrs semerci and lattanzio believed was necessary mr semerci at one time worked in tokyo and reported to dow kim who ran merrills capital markets division there mr kim announced plans to resign in may he was told to leave his merrill office this past week david reilly and serena ng contributed to this article corrections &amp amplifications merrill lynch &amp co chief financial officer jeffrey edwards said on july that the firms exposure to subprime mortgages at two bear stearns cos hedge funds was "limited contained and appropriately marked " mr edwards wasnt referring to merrills overall subprime position as incorrectly stated in a moving the market article july the same comments were cited in page one articles saturday and monday about a &# billion write down merrill announced friday without making clear the assurance was limited to the bear funds wsj oct
