weekend journal entertainment &amp culture music teaching my son to respect the boss as springsteen launches a new tour one devoted fan tries passing on his passion when youve spent more than years following a musician buying every new release catching every tour enjoying the music through everything from an eight track tape player to a video ipod it seems only natural to want to share the intensity of the experience with your year old son "jesse how would you like to go with me to hartford to see bruce springsteen on the opening night of his latest tour " long pause "who else is playing " it is as it was fully intended to be a body blow how could i have failed so miserably as a father its hard to explain to a young teenager or for that matter many of my middle age peers the continuing key role mr springsteen has played in the assorted chapters of my life my memory is filled with joyful scenes wildly dancing to "rosalita" with my friends kip and rachel in a roach infested west philadelphia college apartment camping out all night on south street to score tickets for the "darkness on the edge of town" tour seated in the th row on the floor of earls court in london in with my sister and a row of colleagues and friends two of whom had flown in from the u s just to see the boss reunite with the e street band then there was the time in maryland when my wifes friend who had never seen mr springsteen perform live before turned to me after he and the band had exited the stage following one of "the river" shows all she could utter was "where does he play next " its always possible of course that some of the groups jesse now listens to franz ferdinand the white stripes keane wolfmother will still be touring and releasing great new material decades from now but in the itunes era when a kid can with a few mouse clicks download a hit song for a buck then go back to instant messaging with friends it seems that longevity let alone loyalty isnt the point rock n roll history is also largely irrelevant according to jesse many of his high school friends have never even heard of bruce springsteen who just turned tuesday nights hartford show which marked the release of mr springsteens new cd "magic " was not at least technically speaking jesses first springsteen concert in when we were living in london i managed to get two tickets at wembley arena for one of the early shows on "the rising" tour jesse had just turned and although i could have traded the extra ticket for the queens jewels i decided it was time to take him to his first rock concert the small boy stood with the crowd through the bands powerful opening numbers "the rising" and "lonesome day " then both new and a classic "no surrender " then he sat down curled up in his seat and fell into a deep sleep it hadnt helped that the clocks had been set back an hour that fall day or that my wife out of legitimate concern had insisted that he wear earplugs i did manage to awake him briefly during the encore for "born to run " when everyone in the arena now illuminated with floodlights stood on their seats pumping their fists into the air but to a sleepy child it must have seemed a bizarre dream he closed his eyes again and didnt open them until morning these days though at least at home jesse is as much a rebel as some of the characters in mr springsteens trademark songs my son reluctantly agreed to come to hartford mainly i think because it was a rare chance to stay up late during a school night over jesses intense opposition i played the new "magic" album in the car on the way to the concert jesse insisted the opening number "radio nowhere" a high octane guitar driven rocker with the intensity of mr springsteens earlier "because the night" or "light of day" was simply a rip off from the band green day my suggestion that green day might have been more influenced by mr springsteen than the other way around went as mr springsteen sings nowhere as we headed down interstate in connecticut jesse launched similar cheap shots at other new songs mainly centered on mr springsteens vocal abilities but once mr springsteen and the e streeters hit the stage at the hartford civic center opening with a fiery version of "radio nowhere " i noticed a subtle change coming over my doubting son he was slowly swaying to the beat in my completely biased view no one performs better live than mr springsteen his shows offer a jolt of pure energy passion and just plain fun that ive never seen equaled by countless other artists his bandmates each a remarkable talent feel by this point like an extended family mr springsteen married one of them singer patti scialfa having caught every tour since i find that his studio songs particularly in the last years really are just drafts and cant be judged until theyve been given a chance to evolve usually over months on the road thats certainly true of "magic " his first release with the e street band since "the rising " his response to the tragedy and arguably his best work since the megahit album "born in the u s a " on a first listen "magic" seems somewhat overproduced and a bit disjointed but on stage as usual its a different story already a new song like "gypsy biker" apparently about the death of a soldier in iraq is far more raw and powerful performed live than the muted version on the recording same with "last to die " unequivocally mr springsteens take on the iraq war "wholl be the last to die for a mistake " he sings over and over as with any established rock star its the old songs that bring the crowds back for more mr springsteen rewarded the first night audience with many including seven from the s ranging from "night" and "shes the one" off his "born to run" masterpiece a friend once accurately observed "there isnt one bad note on that record " to "badlands" and the "promised land " only "darkness on the edge of town" struck me as a bit rusty for me the shows absolute highlight was "thundercrack " a song i had never heard performed live mr springsteen introduced it during the encore as being from "the original e street band" days meaning pre other than bootlegs it wasnt commercially available until the "tracks" collection of archival material its a silly rollicking tribute to a girl whos a wonder on the dance floor and it dates to the "rosalita" period when his music was far more loose and experimental with lyrics that were anything but political the song begins with the band chanting "her brains they rattle and her bones they shake whoa shes an angel from the innerlake " from there it slowly builds to a saxophone laced frenzy just before the encore an inebriated concertgoer spilled beer on jesses shirt i took that as an opportunity to ask if he might be interested in one of the bruce springsteen t shirts on sale in the lobby to my surprise and delight he agreed to look at the selection and he even let me buy him one even more amazing he wore it to high school the next
