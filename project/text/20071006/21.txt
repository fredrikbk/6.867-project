in this film industry it really helps to be a blockhead young cineastes find lego a congenial medium for the age of youtube in the three minute film "cognizance " a hit man on his way to his next target wordlessly reflects on his life he walks past shoppers browsing in stores children on a merry go round a young couple embracing finally he spots his intended victim across a busy street and as the soundtrack music by coldplay swells he reconsiders and drops his gun in an alley as the killer turns and begins to walk home he finds himself facing the barrel of another mans gun a subtle smile crosses his placid yellow face as the screen fades to black one reviewer said he was "overwhelmed with emotion" by the film another called it "a gleaming gem " adding that it was "required viewing for anyone interested in our little plastic world " "cognizance" is one of hundreds of movies known as "brickfilms" that are getting attention on youtube and other video sharing sites amateur filmmakers use lego pieces to create characters and scenes sometimes spending months painstakingly arranging and rearranging the blocks before the camera re creations of famous moments in "star wars" and "titanic " faithfully rendered in the primary colors of lego pieces and stitched together from thousands of stop motion frames have drawn hundreds of thousands of viewings many of the productions are original films with elaborate plotlines soundtracks and voice overs the growing genre is driven by a lively online community of would be spielbergs who swap tips on message boards about tackling the unique challenges of the medium lighting is a constant headache given the highly reflective coating on lego pieces and their tendency to melt into brightly colored blobs when they are placed too close to a hot light and then theres the fact that most standard issue lego people come with one fixed expression a rather goofy smile that can take some of the cinematic oomph out of what is meant to be a passionate love scene or a tragic situation "theres only a few points of articulation on the actual character so how do you show something with only the arms moving up and down " says michael green the year old new york university film major who made "cognizance " in many ways the path from childrens toy to youtube has been a snap for lego many of the people in their twenties and thirties who are making brickfilms today spent their childhoods playing with the blocks and now find themselves with access to relatively inexpensive video tools that can be used to bring their creations to life lego group in billund denmark has encouraged the filmmakers it recently held a star wars based film contest and is considering others re enactments of mainstream movies tend to be peoples first exposure to brickfilms says joshua leasure a year old acoustical engineer who operates brickfilms com which has emerged as the main hub for lego filmmaking "then what happens is that after a while you stop seeing legos as toys you get used to seeing them moving around and acting " he says "from a film perspective it becomes just another medium " "i was still in junior high playing with legos and the internet and i collided " says robinson wood of san jose calif whose "frankenstein" and "grace" are often cited by fans as classic brickfilms in mr woods plastic retelling of mary shelleys monster tale which some viewers have found too violent for a film made from childrens toys he used red clay to simulate blood and achieved the sound of breaking glass by dropping a peanut butter jar eight feet onto concrete in the futuristic and also violent "grace " mr wood needed to come up with a scream to be used in a scene where the hero falls off a ledge despite some apprehension he went into his garage and belted one out "it was definitely a very real and very loud scream " he says "i was scaring myself " david pagano a year old animator in new york said he first began experimenting with filming his legos in the seventh grade using his fathers old video camera the process today uses higher quality equipment but is considerably more time consuming stop motion animation is made by manually positioning objects while a camera takes a series of pictures mr pagano and most other brickfilmers shoot movies at frames per second that means for just one minute of film still images have to be taken each one requiring a tiny movement of the characters in a scene so that the action appears fluid some brickfilms are made from more than images computer video editing software is used to assemble the films and add voices music and other effects for someone interested in trying animation brickfilming unlike claymation is a cheap forgiving medium "with claymation you cant take apart and reuse parts from sets or characters " says zach macias a year old filmmaker in novato calif "once you create one of those two items you need to go out buy more materials and restart the process of set construction and character sculpting with lego you can take apart sets to use pieces and still be able to readily reconstruct any set if necessary " many brickfilmers say they often reuse bricks the red pieces in the roof of a house for instance may appear in the next scene as part of a car mr maciass "mirrored perspective " which alludes to platos allegory of the cave begins with an expansive black background he filmed it by alternating between shooting against a black t shirt and a blue screen and wrapped paper around his lights to keep them from overexposing the background when the main character gazes into a mirror the reflection is created by a second lego figure whose moves and lighting had to be done in sync a digital effect could have accomplished the same thing mr macias says "but where would be the fun in that " as brickfilmers try to one up one another with increasingly creative special effects they find themselves drawing from an unusual list of household items artists realized that they could simulate shattered glass by slowly cutting apart plastic wrap or a clear sheet of sugar in lewis chens "repent " one shootout briefly goes into "bullet time " a slow motion effect made popular in the movie "the matrix " in which a character floats through the air while dodging enemy fire the year old arcadia calif college student says his minute film took him six months to make but perhaps the most debated issue in the community is dialogue the painted goofy smile has so vexed some filmmakers that theyve taken to sanding it off and painting on a frown or look of surprise as the story warrants others use computer tricks to animate characters mouths when they speak but nathan wells a year old in eureka calif considers himself a lego purist "i do not paint cut or modify lego pieces in any way " he says without any lip motion though it can be difficult to tell which character is speaking some creators get around the problem by asking other brickfilmers to contribute digital audio tracks so each character gets a unique voice mr wood doesnt like that approach because voices are recorded separately "its very inhuman in some ways because the actors dont interact " he avoided that problem in "grace" by getting his father brother in law a friend and a handful of uncles and cousins to supply voices during a family party "i told them it would be amazing " he said "because theyd be in a real movie "
