how to pilot a fund through a storm the pressure was on for andrew feltus and tracy wright when they took over as managers of pioneer high yield fund this spring research firm morningstar inc was questioning the mutual funds long term prospects noting that the pair were less proven during bear markets than their predecessor margaret patel the well known high performing manager who has been called the queen of junk bond funds after she left pioneer in march investors pulled roughly &# million from the fund that focuses on "high yield " or junk bonds those rated below investment grade then as credit markets swooned this summer many investors lost millions if not billions of dollars the new managers survived their first big test by staying calm and sticking to a conservative buy and hold strategy the pioneer fund ended the third quarter ahead and was ranked no among the largest junk bond funds by morningstar showing that even amid the turmoil it was possible to make money in junk bonds the &# billion fund had no exposure to the risky subprime mortgages that had shaken financial markets as the credit crisis intensified mr feltus and ms wright reminded one another to stick to their long term plan and tried not to overreact to dramatic moves in the market as mr feltus puts it it is a matter of keeping ones head even when it seems "panicking might be a rational decision " they avoided hastily selling off assets when the market calmed in august and september they began selectively buying junk bonds they believed had become underpriced the funds gain for the third quarter compares with a loss of for junk bond funds overall and a loss of for funds with more than &# billion in assets according to morningstar in the first three quarters of the year the pioneer fund gained tops among its largest competitors compared with a overall gain for junk bond funds investing in volatile assets like junk bonds often means minimizing losses in lousy periods as much as posting huge numbers when a market is booming the fund lost in july while junk bond funds overall lost "you cant let other peoples panic panic you " ms wright said "you have to take a deep breath and say this is what we thought two weeks ago this is what we think today right " the new managers continue to follow ms patels basic approach during the nine years she ran the fund a "value strategy" that eschews moving in and out of positions "were not traders " mr feltus said "were really trying to take a medium to long term view and pick good companies " among the funds biggest holdings are &# million in bonds issued by freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc which account for of the fund and &# million in bonds issued by millennium inorganic chemicals of assets still mr feltus and ms wright say a few changes they made after they took over in the second quarter helped the fund weather the storms that followed they pared the funds risk profile by cutting its stock exposure to from they sought to reduce volatility by reducing its stake in convertible bonds which can be converted into company stock in another defensive move they parked slightly more than of assets in cash an unusual level for a fund that generally seeks to keep all its assets in higher yielding investments lawrence jones a morningstar analyst who wrote the firms evaluation of the fund in may said in an interview that those cash reserves gave the fund "a little dry powder" to take advantage of lower prices and higher yields that became available after junk bonds sold off mr jones added however that a bear market of little more than two months isnt long enough to know how the fund will perform under a sustained downturn ms patel made her reputation during junks bear market of returning more than to investors during that period even as similar funds lost she left pioneer investment management inc a unit of milan based unicredit spa to manage funds for evergreen investments a unit of wachovia corp among them is evergreen balanced fund a stock and bond fund that returned in the third quarter compared with for similar funds according to morningstar she hasnt publicly discussed her reasons for leaving pioneer and through a spokesperson declined to comment for this story pioneer officials note that mr feltus years old has a record of success advising and running other funds at the company he spent six years as manager of pioneer global high yield fund which has an international focus in contrast to the domestic focused pioneer high yield fund the &# billion global fund returned an average annually in the five years ending monday compared with for the merrill lynch global high yield and emerging markets plus index ms wright a former investment banker at merrill lynch became a high yield analyst at pioneer in michael ward an investment adviser with linsco private ledger in albany n y whose clients have nearly &# million in pioneer high yield fund said mr feltus and ms wright didnt just "pull a rabbit out of the hat" in the quarter but rather have a well crafted strategy that will work over the long haul in putting their own stamp on the fund ms wright and mr feltus pared bonds issued by paper and industrial firms which tend to suffer during economic slumps in turn they added bonds from energy and health care firms which generally do well no matter what the economy is doing the managers also began buying syndicated bank loans big loans to companies by a group of banks that pool their resources to fund the loan these loans often provide high yields and because they are higher in the capital structure than junk bonds their recovery value is usually higher if the borrower runs into trouble mr feltus said when prices dipped sufficiently on bonds from junk rated companies they admired this summer they started buying in early august for example they added to their holdings of bonds from nco group inc a debt collection firm it made sense mr feltus said because the companys focus meant that it does well when the economy isnt booming "the goal wasnt to call the bottom " mr feltus said "but we thought prices were attractive enough that we could weather the storm very well "
