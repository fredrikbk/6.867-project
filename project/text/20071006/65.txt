weekend journal food &amp drink eating out like a sturgeon tasting kentucky paddlefish roe that could pass for sevruga caviar louisville ky the majestic but undervenerated ohio river reaches the widest point about a mile in its mile saunter from pittsburgh to the big muddy just west of this citys bravely reviving downtown louisville although it is the nations th largest city and home of the eponymous slugger is rarely associated with caviar but the ornate hotel seelbach on fourth street honors the ohios rival to the roe of the caspian sturgeon with as much respect well not quite as much as it extends to aged single cask bourbon in its storied bar even for a louisville booster however it must be hard to get excited about the eggs of the shovel snouted paddlefish the source of kentuckys own caviar and yet this homely and very large sturgeon lookalike has lately swum into the fine dining limelight paddlefish polyodon spathula routinely grow feet long and exceed pounds hunters go after them with bow and arrow or large snagging hooks their flesh is oily mounted trophies have been known to ooze oil down walls but their eggs are the beauty part they are black and tasty and very sought after since the worlds most prized caviar from beluga sturgeon in the caspian and black seas has been banned by the u s since so the ohio river basins sturgeon roe taste alike is suddenly a glamour puss instead of an ugly cousin paddlefish eggs have lately been cropping up at high end venues indeed domestic caviar including farmed california sturgeon and wild hackleback roe are on menus such as petrossian in new york beluga central since as well as thomas kellers french laundry the ritz carlton in sarasota fla and hip mas in greenwich village petrossian mail orders paddlefish caviar for &# for ounces compared with &# for its best caspian osetra but how does paddlefish caviar compare with the "real stuff " to find out we flew down to louisville to taste these tiny dark briny eggs on their home ground we could have gone to tennessee but the idea of feasting on paddlefish caviar in the elegant main dining room of the seelbach was irresistible chef todd richards has created a fresh menu with revamped traditional ideas yukon potato poached in ham hock broth and his own inventions sunny side up truffle quail eggs i had prepared for this test in the maxs bar downstairs with a glass of cognac like pappy van winkle bourbon upstairs it seemed appropriate to switch to triple distilled kentucky vodka filtered through diamond dust very smooth so was the caviar but if you object to applying that word ultimately a loan from ancient persian to home grown stuff you have other choices that jingle nicely paddlefish roe goes by many vernacular names among them spoonfish and chataluga but for me caviar will do fine my problem is with the seelbachs overstuffed presentation several little blini pancakes chopped egg white chopped egg yolk all of it overwhelming two little dabs a quarter ounce of tiny eggs on noncorroding little mother of pearl spoons but a couple of strategic tastes of the stuff was enough to remind me of my first taste of chataluga back in the s the nutty mildly salty taste was just dandy the little eggs dont however each make an individual impression the way that caspian sturgeon roe can at its best but only russian mafiosi can get hold of opulent charcoal grey mild and civilized beluga eggs nowadays for the rest of us paddlefish may look like a tarry smear but in a blind tasting they make many folks think they are eating sevruga a prized caspian sturgeon variety with small eggs and a buttery flavor so there is no reason to get sniffy the next time you see paddlefish caviar on a menu the price is right and in my book lightly salted eggs from almost any fish are worth downing with a flute of vodka do i refuse bright red salmon roe at sushi bars or extra marine flavored flying fish roe tobiko or even very fishy tasting barracuda roe which i once ordered at a little place on the santa monica pier nyet that would be un american we live in a country where fish eggs are a part of our heritage in the late spring when the shad are bursting with roe in the hudson or the chesapeake who could possibly reject them in favor of endangered caspian products as big as a calfs liver and darkly wonderful with bacon shad roe is something even slowfooders ought to love local wild and with as tiny a carbon finprint as you could ask for in the meantime you can get your feet wet paddlefishwise by watching these ungainly prehistoric giants gliding around in the tennessee aquarium in chattanooga testing the waters with their sensitive spatulate snouts email me at eatingout wsj com
