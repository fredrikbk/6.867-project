how safe is the soaring stock market rise is driven by view of where safety lies but some see dangers investors who just weeks ago were fleeing stocks now think its safe to return driving the markets to a record high in the past week their hope that the worst is over much of the buying is driven by the notion that stocks are a safer bet than risky debt and other investments at the heart of the summers market meltdown but there are some who question whether the market is being complacent "this story is not over " says steven romick manager of the &# billion fpa crescent fund "there are a lot of risks in the market " among them for the first time since the terrorist attacks corporate profits are expected to post a third quarter decline the companies in the standard &amp poors stock index are now expected to see a drop in operating earnings a figure that doesnt yet reflect the sizeable hits announced on friday by merrill lynch &amp co washington mutual inc and alcoa inc all three are in the s&amp p merrill lynch on friday said it would take a &# billion hit because of losses in complex bonds stemming from this summers market meltdown washington mutual meanwhile warned that net income will fall in the third quarter because of problem loans looking at earnings forecasts s&amp p analyst howard silverblatt says "is there light at the end of the tunnel or is it an oncoming train " soaring stock prices suggest that investors see a strong rebound in earnings and wall street analysts share that view predicting that corporate profits will only shrink for one quarter before rebounding strong in the fourth quarter and holding that momentum through next year fridays stock gains were fueled by an unexpectedly strong employment report suggesting that the economy has enough strength to avoid recession the dow jones industrial average gained points or up from its mid august low the s&amp p index closed at a record high even stocks that announced problem earnings jumped merrill lynch gained and washington mutual rose in fact says fritz meyer senior market strategist at aim investments many are betting that even the third quarter wont turn out to be as bad as feared "my hunch and maybe what the market is hunching is that were going to get an upward surprise to third quarter earnings " he notes that during the first half of the year many companies posted better than expected profits "the pattern has been too persistent not to think that " investors are banking on a solid earnings rebound in the fourth quarter in large part based on the assumption that the economy will continue to grow albeit at a slower pace earnings on s&amp p companies are expected to grow by in the final three months of the year according to s&amp ps data particular strength is anticipated in health care technology and telecommunications companies "were not seeing the recession scenarios in earnings expectations " says thomas loeb chairman of mellon capital management which manages &# billion fpas mr romick argues however that there is a big risk in underestimating the impact that the housing market collapse will have on consumers that could in turn bleed over to non u s economies that still rely heavily on demand from americas buyers and are expected to be an important prop to corporate earnings "this is the first time in years or so where home prices have declined nominally " he notes at the same time that americans have been borrowing against their houses in effect using them as "atm machines " the impact on the consumer behavior may not yet be fully felt he says still some investors argue that stocks are the best option among a lackluster crowd of options aims mr meyer says u s stocks look good from a valuation standpoint the s&amp p is trading at times s expected earnings a ratio that while not as attractive as a few weeks ago is "still cheap " indeed the bond market isnt presenting much of an attractive alternative unless there is a substantial worsening of the economy the prospect for substantially lower interest rates which would trigger a rally in bond prices since interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions doesnt appear to be in the cards and while the additional yield offered by corporate bonds or other non u s treasury offerings is higher than earlier in the year that difference is still historically low except in the most battered and trickiest corners of the bond market "we find equities very attractive to the alternatives " says mellons mr loeb in mr loebs portfolios such as the &# billion vanguard asset allocation fund which he co manages of assets are in stocks "its an aggressive" posture he says even if stocks seem attractive to other investments holding them requires a stronger stomach today than a year ago between july and late september roughly half the trading sessions featured swings in the s&amp p of at least by contrast in all of and combined there were less than trading days trading
