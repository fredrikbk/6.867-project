weekend journal books the sweet lowdown about weight gain blaming the refined carbs of sugar and starch good calories bad calories by gary taubes knopf pages &# diet research is a field where alas hucksters often pass for experts government findings rely on weak "association studies" and theory trumps rigorous investigation for decades diet "researchers" have issued a uniform message the fattening of america is the result of consuming too much food and exercising too little the increase in obesity goes the thinking has brought with it a rise in diabetes and the cholesterol laden fatty foods that go hand in pudgy hand with obesity are of course the cause of heart disease science magazine correspondent gary taubes is a dissenter from this orthodoxy in "good calories bad calories " he proposes that obesity is not related to the quantity of calories we consume or to how many calories we burn but to the quality of calories the bad ones he says come from refined carbohydrates found in starchy food and sweets as mr taubes points out before fatty foods became a culinary pariah in the s it used to be common knowledge that carbohydrates were the source of weight gain he notes that even tolstoy took a moment to pass along some sage diet advice in "anna karenina" when he had count vronsky skip starches and sweets as he slimmed down for the novels crucial horse race but in recent decades mr taubes writes "it was the butter rather than the bread the sour cream on the baked potato that put on the pounds " a fat free carb heavy diet was regarded not only as a healthy regimen but also as a route to losing weight "this was one of the more remarkable conceptual shifts in the history of public health " mr taubes writes mr taubes the author of "nobel dreams" and "bad science" has a gift for turning complex scientific principles into engaging narrative he makes a fascinating case that refined carbs have a deleterious effect on our health weight and well being sugars especially high fructose corn syrup are particularly harmful he says probably because the combination of fructose and glucose overloads the liver with carbohydrates and elevates the bodys levels of insulin the hormone that governs fat accumulation the more refined the carb the more fat storing insulin we secrete often in surges after especially carb rich meals but the danger from refined carbs is not just that they cause weight gain mr taubes suspects that they are the dietary cause of heart disease diabetes and perhaps cancer when "diet scientists" blame fat consumption for ill health effects they too often depend on mere correlation yes diagnoses of heart disease rose at a time when carbohydrate consumption apparently decreased and total fat consumption increased but this isnt evidence just anecdote and it passed for too long as dogma mr taubes says even when undermined by hard evidence if observational science is going to influence thinking he suggests then consider this change in the american diet the level of annual per person sugar consumption has undergone a spectacular increase from less than pounds in the s to our current pounds "in effect americans replaced a good portion of the whole grains they ate in the nineteenth century with refined carbohydrates " mr taubes writes even as late as the national academy of sciences page "diet and health" report made little attempt to differentiate between refined carbohydrates and unrefined or complex carbohydrates such as those found in fruits vegetables and whole grains the "low fat" theory even influenced the governments familiar "food pyramid " both the original and the revision thus gaining a federal imprimatur even if it sounds plausible that a diet laden with highly processed carbs is at least in part a cause of obesity and perhaps diabetes it remains just a theory one still resisted by many mainstream diet researchers whatever recognition the carb theory has received in recent years owes as much to mr taubes as to anyone in he wrote a much discussed article for the new york times magazine called "what if its all a big fat lie " his book is a kind of extended treatment of that article with more research and reporting just last week in new york magazine mr taubes went after another cliche of the healthy living corps by asserting that exercise doesnt help us lose weight it actually can cause weight gain by making us hungrier be advised "good calories bad calories" isnt a diet book although it may change your eating habits instead its a highly readable treatise on the origins of modern theories about food and health it is also an engaging portrait of the cast of researchers involved in developing the study of diet however incomplete it remains mr taubes doesnt make the mistake of asserting that low fat diets dont have merit he says simply that fat avoidance shouldnt come at the cost of ignoring other promising ideas about diet and illness diet is such a broad and elusive subject that no single approach should prevail to the exclusion of all others yet as mr taubes observes plenty of scientists remain wedded to pet theories and work tirelessly to advance them such a parochial approach is a danger in any scientific field atle selberg the winner of the fields medal in mathematics once remarked that "a person with a fixed idea will always find some way of convincing himself in the end that he is right " this according to mr taubes has unfortunately characterized the history of diet science causing us to cling to old thinking and to become a nation devoted to fat free muffins even as we try to squeeze into ever tighter airline seats dr gottlieb a physician and fellow at the american enterprise institute was until recently a senior official at the food and drug administration
