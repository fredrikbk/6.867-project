cross country csi mississippi in january mississippis supreme court took an unusual step in the murder trial of year old tyler edmonds the court tossed out the testimony of the medical examiner who had conducted the autopsy of the body the reason the medical examiner in the case dr steven hayne had testified under oath that he could tell from the bullet wounds in the body that edmonds and his sister simultaneously held the gun to fire the fatal shot of course as the court concluded it is impossible to make such a determination from examining bullet wounds former columbus miss police chief j d sanders has been trying for years to draw attention to dr hayne "theres no question in my mind that there are innocent people doing time at parchman penitentiary due to the testimony of dr hayne " he says "there may even be some on death row " in addition to state supreme court justices and police officers defense lawyers crime lab experts and state medical examiners have all made public their concerns with his practice and with the testimony he has contributed to hundreds of cases over a year career although dr hayne refused to speak with me the concerns about him start with his own words according to his comments on the stand he performs anywhere from to autopsies a year the national association of medical examiners name says a medical examiner should perform no more than autopsies per year after the organization refuses to certify an examiners practice "you cant do it " says vincent dimaio author of forensic pathology widely considered the professions guiding textbook "after autopsies you start making small mistakes at youre going to get mental and physical strains on your body over and youre talking about major fatigue and major mistakes " for much of his career dr hayne has conducted autopsies as well as held two research and hospital positions and testified in court two to four times per week after reviewing one hayne autopsy in a homicide case dr harry bonnell who sits on names ethics committee sent a strongly worded letter to the defendants attorney describing dr haynes conclusions as "near total speculation " the quality of his report "pathetic " as a result of dr bonnells letter the prosecutor dropped the murder charge and the defendant pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter another medical examiner reviewed dr haynes autopsy in a homicide and characterized his work as "near complete malpractice " in that case dr hayne had determined that a woman had died of "natural causes " the diagnosis was later changed to homicide by blunt force to the head according to the medical examiner who performed the second autopsy dr hayne hadnt even emptied the womans pockets a standard autopsy procedure no one has been prosecuted in the case dr hayne declined repeated requests from me to comment dr hayne isnt a board certified forensic pathologist at least as the term is understood by his peers the american board of pathology is considered the only reputable certifying organization for forensic pathology dr hayne failed the boards exam in the s he still testifies in court that hes "board certified " but thats a reference to his membership in the american academy of forensic examiners which he has said publicly certified him without requiring him to take an exam part of the problem in mississippi is a lack of oversight elected county coroners and district attorneys shop out autopsies to private practice medical examiners the county pays doctors &# for each autopsy plus extra for other tests and services dr hayne has dominated these referrals for years a strong indication that coroners and district attorneys are happy with his work and the state supreme court although it tossed out his testimony in the edmonds case didnt stop him from testifying in other cases but a medical examiner should be independent and find facts irrespective of their value to the prosecution mississippi law calls for a certified state medical examiner to oversee the process of shopping autopsies out to ensure that they are conducted by reputable physicians but mississippi hasnt had a state medical examiner since the last two people to hold the office actually tried to rein in dr hayne but met with considerable resistance the most recent dr emily ward left after the states county coroners petitioned for her resignation the state legislature has refused to fund the examiners office ever since "dr ward came in here and tried to clean up the system " says andre de gruy who directs mississippis office of capital defense counsel the public defender office for death penalty cases "hayne and the coroners got together and chased her out " consider jeffrey havard convicted and sentenced to death in for the murder his girlfriends infant daughter the indigent havard asked the trial court for money to hire his own expert to review dr haynes findings a crucial part of the states case he was denied havards attorneys were able to get former alabama state medical examiner james lauridson to review dr haynes autopsy for his appeal though the second autopsy raised real doubts about havards guilt mississippis supreme court declined to even consider it ruling that it was new evidence and should have been introduced at trial thats not an uncommon ruling from an appellate court but it illustrates just how important it is that state expert witnesses be reputable credible and accountable before ever stepping onto the witness stand mississippis leaders including gov haley barbour should put an immediate end to dr haynes autopsy operation the state also needs to revisit every criminal case in which dr hayne has testified finally mississippi needs to implement significant reforms as to how it conducts autopsies it could start by requiring all contracted medical examiners to at least meet the professions minimum standards until then a cloud of suspicion hangs over every murder conviction that comes out of the states courts mr balkos feature article on steven hayne appears in the november reason magazine where he is a senior editor
