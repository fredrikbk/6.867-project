weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink st louis party central a number of readers have written to ask where that most essential of american institutions the cocktail party got its start in particular ive been asked whether i can verify the wikipedia claim that alec waugh once a popular british novelist and essayist on the good life but now best remembered as evelyns older brother "invented" the cocktail party sometime around in london alas for all the things wikipedia manages to get right this is not one of them alec waugh himself noted that the first cocktail party in england was hosted in by painter c r w nevison who was looking for some diversion between tea and dinner if youve ever seen nevisons harrowing world war i trench scapes paintings populated with contorted corpses youll understand why he would want a compensatory drink or two but for all the claims that it started on the london social scene the cocktail party is a decidedly american invention indeed by brits appalled at the americanization of england would cite the insidious invidious influence of talking pictures jazz bands and cocktail parties credit or blame depending on your point of view for the first "cocktail party" ever thrown can be assigned to mrs julius s walsh jr of st louis in may the st paul pioneer press reported that "positively the newest stunt in society is the giving of cocktail parties " the paper credited mrs walsh "a leader in society activities" in st louis as being "responsible for the innovation " mrs walsh had invited guests to her house a mansion "equipped with a private bar" on a spring sunday at high noon some guests came to the party straight from church some had spent the morning in "a motor promenade of the boulevards " the party lasted one hour the "interregnum preceding oclock dinner " the walshes were not the first to organize a party around an alcoholic beverage and even before the first cocktail party so called the walshes themselves had hosted a "baby party" at the st louis country club at which they and their friends dressed as toddlers and sucked cocktails out of baby bottles the principal antecedent for the cocktail party comes from september when mrs richard s dana introduced the concept of an "egg nog party" in the society resort of lenox mass parties she would throw every autumn for years when the goldenrod was in blossom following the lead of the lenox "cottagers " it became the height of gilded age fashion to host a party around a bowl of eggnog by the aught years such parties were popular in st louis and the memory of them provided the inspiration for the walshes cocktail party but by the time they hosted their sunday afternoon gathering in eggnog was hopelessly old fashioned cocktails were the thing but what cocktails plenty of bronx cocktails gin dry vermouth sweet vermouth and orange juice were served as well as plenty of clover leafs gin grenadine lime juice and egg white garnished with a mint leaf the stylish young men of st louis ordered a raft of highballs "some with scotch and some with rye or bourbon whisky" along with gin fizzes and at least one mint julep "for a former gentleman of virginia " one woman chilled from "driving all forenoon in her limousine " sought to warm herself up with a potent sazerac whiskey sugar and peychauds bitters in an absinthe rinsed glass and yes there were martinis and manhattans but it is a measure of the venerability of those essential drinks that "a few who had been to church were old fashioned enough" to order them at the walshes house that day "the party scored an instant hit " the st paul pioneer press declared and within a matter of weeks cocktail parties became "a st louis institution " the account was picked up by other newspapers and no doubt inspired imitators across the country but cocktail parties might have been a mere fad if it hadnt been for the onset of prohibition as eric burns puts it in his book "the spirits of america " "hitting the sauce had once been a public activity the eighteenth amendment now converted it to a more personal occasion within the old four walls " generally private if not furtive affairs cocktail parties didnt get much newspaper coverage in the not so dry days of the volstead act the first cocktail party to get much ink in the new york times for example was a scandalous evening of drinking at san diegos hotel del coronado one evening in april the commander of the local marine base brig gen smedley d butler arrived at an officers party at the hotel and found one of his subordinates col alexander s williams to be crocked it might have all been ignored had butler not loathed williamss politics which were left enough of center to be described as "anarchistic " and so butler had the man charged with intoxication the court martial that followed in the "cocktail party case" was something of a sensation with a parade of junior officers perjuring themselves attesting to williamss total sobriety old smedley suffered a nervous breakdown attributed to "worry over the coolness toward him by society since he made charges of intoxication" against williams the opprobrium felt so acutely by the general is some indication of the high esteem in which society already held the institution of the cocktail party to do a cocktail party right take a cue from the first cocktail party on record mrs walsh wasnt stuck in the kitchen muddling fruit for old fashioneds she had hired "a white coated professional drink mixer who presided behind the polished mahogany " dont make the mistake of relying on a caterer to provide a bartender i have found that the men and women who work behind the bars at catered affairs almost never have a clue about how to make drinks most caterers wouldnt think of taking their wait staff and letting them run the kitchen but they dont hesitate to put the untutored in charge of the bottles if you are looking for someone to make cocktails at a party find a "professional drink mixer" at a good bar spend some time testing his or her skill and if youre satisfied hire away its worth mentioning that the site of the first cocktail party still stands in the catholic archdiocese of st louis bought the walsh mansion at lindell blvd and it has served as the local archbishops residence ever since perhaps the archdiocese will be inspired to erect a plaque of some sort commemorating this essential event in american history and why not after all many of the walshes guests that sunday noon had spent their morning in church email me at eric felten wsj com
