weekend journal sports golf journal the battle over a golf ball a patent challenge highlights controversy around pro v titleists cash cow i spent a lot of time this week poring over the surprisingly interesting court documents from a lawsuit that bridgestone sports brought against acushnet the parent of titleist bridgestone contended that some of titleists balls most notably the phenomenally successful pro v models infringed bridgestone patents on monday after two years of bickering in a delaware court the companies quietly announced that they had reached a settlement as in most out of court settlements the companies provided scant details about the terms of the deal but in press releases they did divulge this much acushnet a unit of fortune brands agreed to pay royalties under several bridgestones patents and the companies will share certain other patents without exchanging royalties what makes this suit more than just the usual skirmish between competitors is that the pro v is one of the most profitable products in golf history three fourths of the pros on tour use the ball since its introduction in titleist has sold more than &# billion worth of them and the pro v accounts for upward of of the premium golf ball market the suggested retail price is &# a dozen or &# a ball compared with a third as much for many perfectly good mass market balls bridgestone isnt the only company going after the pro v in court callaway filed a similar infringement suit last year also in a delaware court based on the patents it inherited in from acquiring top flite that case is scheduled to go to trial in december an acushnet spokesman had no comment on either lawsuit beyond the companys terse press release about the bridgestone settlement for the uninitiated the pro vs success is part of a veritable revolution in golf ball technology that kicked in full force around previously the vast majority of tour pros used a completely different type of ball its core was wrapped in tightly wound elastic threads and its cover was made of a soft rubber called balata which gave the pros the feel high spin and control they needed to work their magic around the greens but the balls scuffed easily the pros often put a new ball into play every other hole and didnt fly as far as the more durable lower spinning solid core balls that everyday players typically used starting in the s however manufacturers began learning how to make multilayer solid core balls with seemingly miraculous properties they had reasonably soft covers and spun nearly as much around the greens as the balata balls did but when hit hard with drivers and long irons spun much less and flew farther than balata balls the secret lay mostly in the material composition of the cover and the cores many of the new balls had three or even four layers the deepest inner layers were designed to respond primarily to the most powerful clubhead blows generating distance while the shallower layers were designed to respond to the force from less aggressive finesse swings providing more spin and better feel a few pros started using such balls in the early s but the concept proving moment came when mark omeara won the masters using the solid core strata ball by top flite two years later titleist introduced the pro v and within a year virtually every player on tour had switched to solid core balls of those two thirds switched to the pro v in large part because titleists marketing strategy internally dubbed the "pyramid of influence " had long been to pay as many pros as possible to play its products on the theory that amateurs will follow and they did almost overnight the pro v became golfs "it" ball given that other companies were marketing comparable balls even before the pro v made its debut its not surprising that intellectual property disputes would arise acushnet bridgestone and callaway all base their claims on patents dating back to the early s or before bridgestone incidentally is no bit player despite having only an share of the u s market its balls are well regarded by industry insiders and highly popular in its home base of japan the company also manufactures nikes balls including those that tiger woods plays the public filings in these cases although carefully stripped of trade secrets are filled with fascinating tidbits including testy exchanges between lawyers "bridgestone is asking for a mulligan here" who knew for instance that titleist got its start when an avid amateur in massachusetts missed a foot putt to lose a match in convinced that his ball had wobbled he x rayed it afterward at a friends dental office and discovered that indeed the core was off center and immediately set out to build a better ball in one exchange in the bridgestone suit the judge marveled at how "crowded" the art of golf ball manufacturing is that is how subtle the differences often are from one patent to the next this strikes me as good news for golfers and helps explain why golf balls especially at the high end are virtually indistinguishable for everyone except the very best players not that this will stop us from wanting to play the pro vs of the world in golf what you believe about a product is at least as important as what you know email me at golfjournal wsj com
