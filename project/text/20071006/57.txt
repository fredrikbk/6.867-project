triple a ratings grade on a curve making it difficult to assess risk when it comes to bond ratings all triple a grades arent created equal thats one reason debt rating companies such as standard &amp poors moodys investors service and fitch ratings have met such criticism over their role in the subprime mortgage crisis the trio of rating companies owned respectively by mcgraw hill cos moodys corp and frances fimalac sa has served as bond market gatekeepers for decades publishing letter grades designed to keep nervous investors out of risky bonds but as the bond market has grown more complex ratings have evolved to mean different things depending on whats being rated while all ratings refer to the likelihood of default some newer more complex bonds dont default in the same way or at the same pace that old fashioned corporate bonds do for instance when corporations issue debt the triple a rating is the gold standard awarded to only about a dozen companies such as general electric co and berkshire hathaway inc but in the trillion dollar market for mortgage securities triple a ratings are as common as corner coffee shops indeed in dollar terms more than half of the mortgage bonds outstanding including those backed by risky subprime loans boast the top triple a rating the same goes for collateralized debt obligations which pay investors higher interest rates than corporate and municipal bonds with the same ratings the proliferation of triple a ratings has made it easier for pension funds and other investors to pile into newfangled bonds that recently have been losing market value at an alarming rate the sheer volume of these ratings is noteworthy now that investors across the globe have lost confidence in the ratings and values of some bonds hundreds of mortgage related bonds have been downgraded in recent months amid a decline in housing prices regulators from the securities and exchange commission and attorneys general in new york and ohio are looking into issues including whether credit rating firms close relationships with wall street influenced their ratings improperly during the mortgage boom for both companies and mortgages a triple a rating means the chance of default is remote companies with that rating have the financial wherewithal to withstand blows to their business and still make their interest payments theres an alphabet soup of ratings below that the lower a bond is rated the bigger the chance its issuer wont be able to make the payments companies care so deeply about their bond ratings that when they are making strategic decisions the impact on their bond rating will often be a serious consideration while companies have to earn their bond ratings mortgage securities are designed with their ratings in mind critics such as joseph mason a finance professor at drexel university say rating firms could be more influenced by their relationships with the few wall street firms that repeatedly create mortgage securities than they are with corporate issuers where business is spread across thousands of companies ratings firms deny there is anything improper about their dealings with wall street and say they have policies to maintain independence and transparency they also point to an sec officials recent comment that the conflicts of interest are manageable mortgage bonds are backed by pools of home loans most of which are expected to keep paying even if some loans go bad the companies that package them deliberately fashion some bonds to pay higher yields but also to absorb any losses first those bonds get lower ratings since the first losses are assigned elsewhere other bonds are designed to be much safer in some pools more than of the loans would need to go bad before a triple a rated bond would take a loss that sort of scenario looked unlikely until this year when delinquencies among certain pools of subprime loans hit unprecedented levels and continue to rise in the months ended sept moodys lowered its rating on triple a subprime bonds about of the aaas it had assigned in the market from subprime bonds issued in fitch recently cut triple a ratings and s&amp p dropped ratings on eight both small parts of the subprime market over a few days in august s&amp p lowered the rating on two hard hit structured vehicles from aaa to cc a rating on the brink of a default an s&amp p spokesman said that type of deal was rare downgrades this extreme are certainly uncommon in the corporate bond world moodys says it hasnt had a triple a bond default since macys then under previous management defaulted in the early s after losing its triple a rating a few years earlier s&amp p hasnt had a default of a triple a corporate bond in the past decade either "the corporate rating is tried and true " says h sean mathis an executive at valuation advisory firm miller mathis ratings on structured mortgage products by comparison were created recently "as the product of a model " a credit suisse study found that ratings on asset backed securities which include some mortgages were more stable than corporate bond ratings but were more likely to fall sharply when downgraded ratings firms point out that through last year mortgage bonds and other structured deals overall proved less likely to default than corporate bonds the five year default rate for investment grade structured bonds was about of dollars raised from to compared with a rate of for corporate bonds according to moodys s&amp p which has a stricter definition of default says triple a structured bonds defaulted within five years only of the time since compared with of the corporate triple as those figures however dont take into account current problems in subprime mortgages for "asset backed" bonds issued from to about rated triple a defaulted within five years according to research by credit suisse that represented about of triple a asset backed securities much of it in "ugly sectors " such as manufactured housing says rod dubitsky a senior strategist at credit suisse moodys says the recovery rate in such defaults is usually high lessening the impact of the defaults
