u s economy down not out overall health is seen in face of deceleration job gains lift optimism employers added jobs last month and a previously reported jobs decline in august was revised away cheering markets but the details of the government data bolstered predictions that the economy is downshifting to a slower speed "its a healthy report well above expectations " said bruce kasman chief j p morgan economist the stock market agreed pushing the dow jones industrial average to and the s&amp p to a new record markets concluded that the report diminishes the likelihood that the federal reserve will cut its target for short term interest rates at its meeting at the end of october but details of the report reinforced the view that u s economic growth is slowing as the deteriorating housing market and credit market turmoil take a toll the unemployment rate rose by one tenth of a percentage point to its highest in a year driven by a substantial increase in the size of the labor force that overwhelmed job growth "employment not vigorous but not recessionary either" was the headline of a client note by michael moran chief economist at daiwa securities america inc jobs losses were highest in manufacturing and residential construction in september temporary jobs fell for the seventh month in a row and the pace of job creation outside of government slowed "the private sector jobs are really the underlying driver of the economy " said nigel gault chief u s economist at global insight an average of jobs per month were created in the private sector in the third quarter mr gault said during the same three months a year ago the average was with the latest data forecasters at macroeconomic advisers a st louis firm estimate that the economy grew at an annual rate of in the third quarter down from the second quarters the employment report is among the most closely watched of the governments economic indicators "the real reason we focus so much on the employment report at this point is because job growth is the main factor helping to underpin income growth " said david greenlaw chief u s fixed income economist at morgan stanley he said that as the declining housing market creates a negative "wealth effect" on consumers wage growth is one of the few remaining sources driving consumer spending the engine of economic growth the labor department also said employers added jobs in august erasing its previous estimate of a job decline it also said employers added jobs in july up from the previously reported the unanticipated decline in payrolls in august that was reported last month contributed to the feds decision to cut interest rates by half a percentage point at their september meeting "if the fed had this data instead of the original august data would they have still gone half a point well never know " said mr greenlaw "but thats the talk floating around trading rooms " much of the revision was caused by recalibrating seasonal fluctuations in government employment including teaching "the revision is all about the government employment numbers " mr gault said "basically the government is telling us the statisticians got it wrong the first time and now they fixed it but that doesnt tell us that much about the underlying health of the economy " in a speech in philadelphia fed vice chairman donald kohn said "once we get through the near term weakness caused by the extra downleg from the housing contraction and any spillover from tighter credit conditions i am looking for moderate growth with high levels of employment " but mr kohn cautioned "you should view these forecasts even more skeptically than usual we do not know how financial markets will evolve and we do not know how households and businesses will respond to financial developments " mr kohn acknowledging that many observers had expected a quarter point rate cut in september defended the bigger move as "not an unreasonable first approximation of what might be required to keep the economy on a sustainable growth path" in the face of uncertainty about how quickly markets would recover "i thought " he added "that economic performance would be better served by the federal reserve taking its chances on responding too much or too rapidly to the turmoil in financial markets rather than acting too little or too slowly " the labor department said average hourly earnings rose by cents last month a gain of since last september a bullish sign for consumer spending but a worrisome one for those preoccupied with the risk that inflation is accelerating in a
