the weekend interview with john dingell some inconvenient truths washington at the beginning of every congress michigan democrat john dingell offers a bill to create a national health insurance system the same bill first offered by his father in as the longest serving house member that means mr dingell has been offering the exact same legislation for oh years now such tenacity might explain why his own party is alternating between fury and worry over mr dingells role in todays great energy debate democrats took over congress vowing to make global warming a top priority and house speaker nancy pelosi planned to notch a quick victory with a bill that was long on political symbolism and cost if short on actual emissions reductions standing in her way has been mr dingell much to the speakers consternation the powerful chairman of the energy and commerce committee is insisting that any bill should actually accomplish something and that its pain be borne by all americans rather than just his detroit auto makers in recent months he has been circulating his own proposals for hefty new taxes on energy gasoline and homeowners ideas that are already giving the rest of his party the willies his position arguably makes mr dingell the lone honest broker in the global warming debate but it also makes him a headache for all his democratic friends whod prefer he just play political nice for his part the year old dean of the house as feisty and courtly and colorful a congressman as youll ever find is unrepentant "i wasnt sent down here to destitute my district and i wasnt sent down here to destitute anyone else ive got a responsibility to legislate but ive got a responsibility to legislate well im going to be honest with the american people about this and say look here fellas this is what were going to have to do to you to fix global warming you tell us whether you like it or not " for the record big john doesnt think americans will like it but he finds that a poor excuse for not telling them the facts as he greets me warmly insists i occupy his best chair and allows me to take in his striking office decorated with the many horns and heads the avid hunter has bagged over the decades he talks about the immense pressure he was under earlier this year to write a quick energy bill that included everything from new standards for light bulbs to a massive new system for regulating c ms pelosi wanted a bill by the fourth of july she even set up a new "select committee on energy independence and global warming " headed by rep ed markey to hurry the work mr dingell who dryly notes that hes worked on "three or four" energy bills in his life instead bucked his leadership by refusing to include the complex issues of climate regulation and auto standards in the bill the house passed this summer mr dingell said he explained that democrats had a responsibility to put forward a bill that was both "truthful" to the american people as well as one "that works " and that takes time "probably in the years ive been in this place its going to be the single hardest thing ive confronted " adding to mr dingells reluctance to hurry is that he feels many of the current climate proposals bumping around congress are neither honest nor adequate most would set up a cap and trade program much like that developed in europe following the kyoto protocol mr dingell notes how easy it is to rig a system like that and points out that the market for c emissions that europe did set up has already fallen apart "europe has shown that this is hell to make work theyre going back to the drawing board again with no assurance they wont make the same mistakes they did before " he adds that a cap and trade system alone doesnt convey the real cost of climate change since it puts its primary cost on companies which then pass that burden on to consumers via higher prices its a hidden tax he says which is precisely why so many politicians like it "i havent found many environmentalists or economists saying cap and trade works but that approach happens to be politically easiest because people can say the program isnt a tax which is a bare faced lie as you know " another worry of the energy committee chairmans is that many of the proposals for cutting emissions arent fair in that they dump a disproportionate amount of the costs on a few industries thats particularly the case with proposals to raise the corporate average fuel efficiency cafe standards which would require detroit auto makers to design much more efficient cars many democrats want to raise the fleet average to miles per gallon by while mr dingell and fellow house members wants to phase it in over a slightly longer period as one of the authors of the first cafe standards in the s he worries that todays new members dont always consider the financial consequences of big environmental bills "there are a lot of people here who dont understand the auto industry " he says "if you phase these numbers in too soon you force engineering in ways that cant be done and you end up forcing a situation where people have to make cars that dont sell or dont run or cost too much and they go broke doing it " this complexity is why he also insisted cafe standards be treated separately from the earlier energy bill and he still thinks theres big potential for congress to do irreparable damage "i worry that with mistakes or bad handling i could shut down the american auto industry and that holds real terrors for me " that being said mr dingell has made clear to the auto industry that his colleagues are intent on seeing some sort of cafe hike and that the industry would do well to support him "i told them your best interest is in going with me and let me tell you why you are going to hate the bill i give you but its going to be a bill with which you can live if you dont work with me youll still get a bill and youll hate it but it will be a bill you cant live with " so if the current proposals for a climate program arent workable what does mr dingell think is the right equation he says hes committed to a bill that makes drastic cuts some to emissions reductions by since anything less wont do much good he also thinks any climate program needs to include an array of powerful tools that will allow policy makers to truly influence how much energy people use all this argues for new energy taxes he says because higher energy prices are one of the few things that cause people to cut back consumption while mr dingell has yet to unveil his broader climate auto legislation he has been releasing broad outlines it will include a cap and trade system but alongside that will be a big new carbon tax probably around &# a ton an estimated cent a gallon increase in the gas tax and an end to the mortgage interest deduction for americans who own homes larger than square feet taxes he argues will give policy makers more options in influencing behavior he uses the example of a gas tax "why would i do that first of all it means i can reduce the use of gasoline and i can make it easier for cafe to work " but he also explains that it allows policy makers to "differentiate between fuels " by taxing gasoline but not diesel for instance he hopes to get more people into diesel cars that would further reduce emissions he argues " since diesel gets "about a to fuel benefit " finally mr dingell says new taxes and the revocation of the mortgage interest deduction are the only way to truly spread around the sacrifices necessary for significant emissions reductions "people have got to understand that addressing the problem we have as the largest user of energy and emitter of greenhouses gases is not something that will exist without pain it is ultimately going to evolve into a significant cost for everybody and significant changes in lifestyle everybody is trying to tell everyone that we can do this without any pain to you and well just stick it to so and so but in my bill everyone is going to put their farthing in the collection box nobody will put in too much nobody too little but nobody will get out of it " all this tax talk scares the dickens out of mr dingells democratic colleagues and he knows it gas prices are soaring and most members would prefer to commit hara kiri than propose legislation that would raise them further ditto the idea of meddling with the politically explosive mortgage deduction house democrats still have painful memories of when vice president al gore convinced them to pass a broad energy tax on btu british thermal units usage "i knew id catch hell for introducing a carbon tax because i also did for voting for btu before as a matter of fact that vote probably cost democrats control of the house everyone around here is scared to death of it " admits mr dingell he understands that many of his colleagues would prefer he just get out of the way and let them collect some political credit for quick climate legislation but hes past that point "im years or more in this business and ive learned to play for the long haul when i was a kid around here i was like the other guys saying dont worry about the cost someone else has to worry about that today i dont want to have someone say dingell you jackass look what you did to us " given his past skepticism on climate change and his concern for the auto industry mr dingell also knows that he stands accused of floating a politically unpalatable carbon tax for no other reason than to sabotage any climate bill he denies it vehemently "when i sent the staff out to find out about this i said look you go out and find the facts i dont give a damn about the politics i got no end of hell and everybody has said im insincere my response is that ive never introduced a piece of legislation that i didnt intend to pass " he admits to some frustration that hes not getting more support "the administration just huffs and sits back and says were not interested in working on this industry is absolutely demoralized on this issue my colleagues are running around making speeches about what ought to be done but very few have experience in the matter " if mr dingell has learned anything in his time in washington its to call them as hes sees them and when i ask how many votes he thinks hed get if he offered up his legislation tomorrow he chuckles and says "well at least one " i mention that many of his fellow democrats are still hoping to slip some sort of climate legislation and cafe rule into the smaller energy legislation on which the house and senate are about to start negotiations how does he intend to block that offensive he chuckles again and says "if you have any ideas let me know " not that hes about to give up which gets back to his legendary tenacity he tells me about working on the clean air act amendments of "i remember people said dingell what a great job you did on clean air you passed it on the house floor in hours and i said "yeah it only took me years to do it " will years from now he have seen his climate proposal through this evokes more than a chuckle its a giant laugh "before years are up im going to seek my permanent career " he quips what i ask could possibly follow odd years of washington jousting "hunting fishing and chasing a gorgeous blonde around the bedroom " ms
