weekend journal leisure &amp arts fresh contexts and favored formats with new cds several leading jazz vocalists and instrumentalists focus on points of origin and comfort zones for singers dee dee bridgewater and luciana souza that means exploring personal roots in fresh musical contexts for pianists matthew shipp and myra melford and for reedman marty ehrlich it involves returning to favored formats dee dee bridgewater red earth a malian journey ddb records emarcy universal &# despite her place in the top rank of american jazz vocalists and her crossover success dee dee bridgewater has often felt displaced "im always trying to fit in somewhere " she once told me this new disc which finds ms bridgewater and her band in collaboration with a cast of malian musicians and singers is no further pose its the manifestation of a new sense of self thanks to ms bridgewaters alliance with multi instrumentalist and producer chieck tidiane seck with mr seck as guide ms bridgewater began her immersion in malian music by sitting in at jam sessions singing wordlessly in the company of harp like koras lute like ngonis and calabashes drums made from gourds she penned english lyrics to traditional malian tunes and found rapport with some of malis leading instrumentalists ngoni virtuoso sekou "bassekou" kouyate here on "children go round demissenw" and kora master toumani diabate "bad spirits bani" on several songs she shares the spotlight with leading malian female singers including african superstar oumou sangare the contrast of vocal styles is fascinating though malian music lends itself comfortably to blues "red earth" mostly transcends this connection yet on the title track when the blues do take hold ms bridgewater delivers them with bite and nuance in tandem with griot fatomata kouyate they sing of the red earth of bamako in mali and of bridgewaters birthplace memphis tenn conflating the two into a single fertile soil luciana souza the new bossa nova verve &# its become de rigueur to translate pop tunes into jazz vernacular and brazilian bossa nova has long been a part of both traditions but what about treating pop songs as bossa tunes and who better to tackle that task than singer luciana souza born in brazil the daughter of bossa composers shes also a graduate of american jazz academies with degrees from berklee college of music and the new england conservatory and shes a strong conceptualist with fine albums of her own design including two grammy nominated projects the soft strums of guitarist romero lubambo ms souzas frequent duet partner and countryman support this "bossa fication" of songs written and previously recorded by the likes of joni mitchell randy newman and leonard cohen james taylors "never die young" seems stiff to the forms natural lilt but most tracks work showcasing ms souzas confident yet still advancing skills the least likely song choice elliot smiths cryptic "satellite " ends up the clearest realization of her theme far from the aloof trifles that often caricature bossa ms souzas vocals are direct and always informed by the drama of the lyric she weaves a narrative about love romantic and mystical that reaches its climax with a cleverly syncopated version of the beach boys hit "god only knows " mathew shipp piano vortex thirsty ear &# since his arrival in new york more than years ago matthew shipp has become a darling of the downtown improvised music scene much of his recent work for the thirsty ear label has explored new terrains hip hop and electronica with mixed results but last years "one" found him alone at the piano with stirring sometimes hypnotically satisfying results here mr shipp returns to the piano trio format joe morris better known as a guitarist plays bass though he lacks the authoritatively woody tone and propulsion of mr shipps usual bassist william parker mr morris nonetheless crafts lyrical low end lines that ably anchor mr shipps spidery improvisations drummer whit dickey rises to the task of managing mr shipps ebb and flow approach to rhythm swinging overtly on just two selections mr shipp has crafted a distinct language out of knotty phrases like the title tracks figure which suggests both "caravan" and "night in tunisia" dense chords emphatic crashes and bright accents all of it draws on free jazz and insider bebop and on the mood shifts and energy flow of alternative pop this is his personal sonic universe and somewhat unexpectedly it achieves a goal elusive to most free jazzers and alt poppers accessibility marty ehrlich &amp myra melford spark palmetto &# two versions of marty ehrlichs "hymn" frame this duet recording with pianist myra melford the first begins with clipped tones from mr ehrlichs alto saxophone answered by ms melfords staccato stabs mr ehrlichs tone grows fuller his notes slowly forming phrases with ms melford sliding gently into two hand gospel form on the second ms melford plays the tune outright for nearly two minutes until mr ehrlich find a sidelong entry note from there the two begin something of a deconstruction these musicians each insider heroes of jazz for well more than a decade can find many avenues in and out of a given musical situation this disc is dominated by savvy original pieces especially two powerful linked tunes by ms melford and mines the work of other undervalued composers robin holcombs "up do" proves a showcase for mr ehrlichs technical mastery and expressive range andrew hills "images of time" offers an example of the duos ability to express balladry and bebop without convention throughout glorious details abound a note grows gnarly then flute like near the end of "images of time" drone like piano overtones color the start of "night " helping to frame mr ehrlichs clarinet melody mr ehrlich and ms melford both play in and lead numerous groups of varying instrumentation this pairing documented previously on s wonderful "yet can spring" arabesque is an important home base mr blumenfeld is a katrina media fellow with the open society institute documenting the experiences of musicians in new orleans he writes about jazz for
