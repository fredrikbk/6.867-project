of america corp for one lost longtime customers and attracted protesters when it launched a credit card for undocumented immigrants early this year but out of the spotlight demographic reality is prompting private investors to embrace the latino opportunity banks are opening to serve spanish speaking customers both in states that have long had a high concentration of hispanics such as california and newer settlement areas such as the southeast about such banks often headed by former executives of the big players and backed by private equity investors are slated to open or have

almost exclusively in cash in some cases hispanics use one of the few pre existing latino banks such as puerto ricos banco popular which has operated in the u s since the s the new banks say that they can cater to immigrants specific needs for nontraditional services in a way that large financial institutions normally wouldnt "we will provide financial literacy mentoring and hand holding to take them from the cash economy to utilization of bank products and services " says mark martinez senior lending officer at solera the federally chartered bank hopes to expand in colorado home to about hispanic owned businesses and then cross state lines last year james montgomery former chief executive of great western bank a savings and loan sold to washington mutual inc in began drafting a plan

own group especially in the hispanic market " the hispanic banks provide an array of services at lower costs than shops where immigrants typically go bilingual tellers help undocumented customers
