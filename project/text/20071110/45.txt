the week ahead our take on coming events energy high drama if not more oil expected as opec gathers by neil king jr with oil prices tickling the historic &# a barrel mark and politicians urging producers to loosen the taps the timing couldnt be better for next weeks rare gathering of opec heads of state in riyadh saudi arabia right well not so fast the summit of leaders of the organization of petroleum exporting countries only the third of its kind since the cartels birth in is sure to make for some splendid theater irans feisty president mahmoud ahmadinejad will be there so will venezuelas chest thumping leader hugo chavez both could take verbal shots at the u s for the iraq war or other perceived infractions a move that would make things uncomfortable for saudi arabias king abdullah summit host and longtime u s ally but dont expect opecs presidents and potentates to plunge into the nitty gritty of supply and demand or to huddle over whether to boost output in coming months for one basically all of the opec countries are in rare agreement that they are not to blame for the recent price spike which has seen the per barrel price of the high end u s benchmark crude rocket to nearly &# from just under &# in early january opec supplies around of world oil demand which now stands at around million barrels a day when they last met in september opec oil ministers agreed to boost output by barrels a day starting nov and look what happened oil continued to head skyward the issue opec argues is not too little oil on the market its speculators the falling dollar and logistical bottlenecks in the supply chain that are jacking up the price so the group insists it will address other things while in riyadh energy conservation the environment preserving a balanced oil supply the summits slogan is nothing if not alliterative "providing petroleum promoting prosperity and protecting the planet " if you want real policy decisions opec officials say wait till early december when the groups oil ministers convene for their quarterly session this time in abu dhabi the united arab emirates there are other reasons that opecs heads of state will probably shun the supply issue messrs ahmadinejad and chavez form the core of an inner club within the group that wants to make all they can from their slowing export stream its not in their interest to endorse a supply increase right now to bring down oil prices and quiet critics in washington some oil analysts are predicting that opec will powwow over the supply issue and could even announce an output increase while in riyadh its rationale that the falling dollar jitters in the worlds stock markets and the growing mortgage lending crisis in the u s could touch off an economic slump particularly in the u s the worlds largest oil consumer thats a formula that opec is keen to avoid so announcing an output boost might calm the waters a bit so far saudi oil minister and de facto head of opec ali naimi is staying mum only saudi arabia has real capacity to spare meaning that mr naimi controls the tap that matters most so all ears will be perked for whatever he says presidential race iowa democrats have politics on their dinner menu by christopher cooper in a political season marked by unprecedented fund raising a never ending debate calendar and super size media buys its perhaps comforting to see a homespun tradition hold sway saturdays jefferson jackson dinner in des moines gives democratic presidential candidates an equal chance to flog their agendas before a rapacious crowd of partisan voters less than two months before the iowa caucus the first time delegates will be selected to the conventions held downtown in a former hockey rink that resembles a massive tin roofed barn the dinner sponsored by the iowa democratic party gives even statistical laggards a star turn six contenders will deliver speeches in a gabfest emceed by house speaker nancy pelosi beyond the events populist appeal cheap seats cost &# the rubber chicken dinner signals that the meaty part of the iowa caucus campaign has begun in earnest iowas caucus with its complicated rules and voting constituency that put a high premium on eye to eye contact with candidates has a deserved reputation for elevating also rans to contender status new york sen hillary rodham clinton may be the far away front runner for the nomination in national polls but in iowa shes in a cage match with contenders john edwards a former north carolina senator and sen barack obama of illinois mr obama isnt just pumping up the locals when he tells iowans in the polished stump speech he delivers in tiny burgs from rock rapids to keokuk "you will select in all likelihood the next president of the united states " the clinton campaign aside practically every strategist in the race agrees that a good showing in iowa on jan is do or die for their candidates for mrs clinton anything less than a second place showing could deal a serious blow to her skyrocketing candidacy for iowans the dinner marks the last chance to get an unvarnished look at the candidates onstage without the restraints of stopwatches and an agenda concocted by reporters beyond the top three candidates delaware sen joseph biden connecticut sen christopher dodd and new mexico gov bill richardson will speak unlike the iowa debates scheduled for december candidates can talk uninterrupted about anything they please but like everything else this cycle the dinner named for presidents thomas jefferson and andrew jackson has added some girth a record people have purchased tickets to the event up from in the event began friday evening with a "sign war " in which five sharp elbowed staff members from each campaign were allowed to storm the empty auditorium for two hours and festoon the walls with banners "its pretty intense " says carrie giddins spokeswoman for the democratic party in years past one tactical consideration has been the candidate entrance in then front runner howard dean underscored his populist pitch by settling in the cheap seats of the upper balcony a brilliant move in the minds of political tacticians he ended up losing the caucus leading to his famous "dean scream " but this year secret service staff assigned to both the obama and clinton campaigns may put a crimp on such freelancing moves as with standard debates where a blind draw is held to determine podium position a hat draw was held to set the candidate order for the speechmaking mr edwards drew what might typically be seen as the best marble his talk was scheduled to begin at p m saturday des moines time while this assures him at least some coverage in the big east coast newspapers its a minute victory for this event saturday night perhaps more than any other night the advantage will go to those who strip down their beltway rhetoric and play to the peanut gallery crowd
