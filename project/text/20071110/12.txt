grassley is off the mark sen charles grassley r iowa apparently didnt read your "the grassley visa tax "editorial of nov "investing in america making things worse " letters to the editor nov his first two paragraphs made statements that were blatantly false spoken like a true politician no successful business hires an h b visa holder just to fire an american worker because of the shortage of trained and competent workers high tech workers are paid the prevailing wage rates sen grassley is overlooking the term of the h b visas no business wants to train a worker who will leave in a short time successful businesses are built on the expertise of long term experienced workers h b workers are attractive because there are not skilled americans available sen grassley should consider the interests of the country as a whole instead of pandering to special interests and he should consider legislation to improve the performance of americans instead of making false accusations to polish his image claude rumsey las vegas
