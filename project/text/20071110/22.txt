mercks quasi victory there are times when discretion is better for business than valor and so it probably is with mercks decision yesterday to settle the legal battle over vioxx for what amounts to the bargain price of &# billion if that figure sounds expensive remember that this was a liability once forecast to threaten the life of merck itself by committing to fight each and every individual case rather than pre emptively surrender to a mass class action the company has saved itself billions from the clutches of the tort bar plaintiff lawyers were obliged to prove in court that vioxx caused a particular clients heart attack or stroke and often the evidence wasnt there the media hysteria correspondingly petered out another turning point came with the denial of class action status to vioxx plaintiffs both in a federal court last november and in the new jersey supreme court this fall with those victories merck was able to sidestep the kind of catastrophic class action risk that had trial lawyers salivating at the time of this weeks settlement mercks record in federal court was four wins and one loss while it was and in state courts the number of new cases had decreased and the rate of dismissals was on the rise so while management had to weigh the psychic value of future vindication against the bottom line there are other ancillary payoffs to the settlement one is helping to rehabilitate the vioxx name and removing the drugs notoriety as a sticking point for investors on news of the settlement merck shares were up when the market closed on friday mercks early decision to pull the drug off the shelves may have been the cautious choice but ample evidence has since emerged that vioxx is a good drug when used for the right reasons the small cardiovascular risk posed by vioxx as revealed in mercks own trials was only seen in patients who used the drug continually for a year and half that didnt stop many whod only used it for days or weeks from getting in line to sue but the evidence was strong enough that an fda advisory panel in recommended that the drug with a new safety label go back on the market meanwhile doctors in specialties from orthopedics to geriatric medicine continue to see such cox inhibitors as an important option for those who dont tolerate similar drugs that are tougher on the stomach for other patients with hip and knee problems drugs like vioxx can provide pain relief that replaces or delays the need for surgery mercks legal strategy served its shareholders well in the end reducing a liability once estimated by some wall street analysts as high as &# billion in settling the company weighed the &# billion plus the benefits of more legal certainty against annual litigation costs running at more than &# million to fight a backlog of cases with some plaintiffs merck management still has a drug business to run and the settlement will reduce its legal distractions we have no doubt that the company has been hearing all along from doctors and patients who would like to have vioxx restored as a treatment option lets hope thats another result of yesterdays quasi victory
