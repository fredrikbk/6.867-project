pakistan tension rises as police block big protest bhutto detention dims political alliance hopes islamists gain ground islamabad a week into emergency rule tensions between pakistans two most influential political leaders are close to boiling over deepening the countrys political crisis at a time when a violent islamist insurgency is gaining ground early friday hundreds of pakistani police cordoned off the home of former prime minister benazir bhutto to head off a masive rally she and her backers had planned to protest the imposition of emergency rule on nov by the military backed president pervez musharraf ms bhutto was confined for more than hours as police blocked roads and access to the site of the rally before pakistan security officials said they had lifted a detention order it wasnt immediately clear early saturday whether ms bhutto is now free to leave her house but state run pakistan television citing the interior ministry said she has been asked to restrict her movements near home for the next few days ms bhuttos forced confinement came just weeks after she struck a political deal with the embattled gen musharraf the arrangement was intended to guide pakistan toward democratic elections and a return to civilian rule after eight years under a military backed government under the deal ms bhutto who heads pakistans largest political party hoped to emerge as prime minister in a new government with gen musharraf continuing as president on the condition that he give up his current dual post as armed forces chief that prospective alliance is now in danger of falling apart gen musharraf promised thursday to hold parliamentary elections by mid february and resign as military commander "soon " but ms bhutto said she was skeptical of those pledges "i had been talking to him about a road map to democracy " ms bhutto shouted to reporters in an impromptu press conference friday from behind the cement barricades that now surround her islamabad residence "he chose another way and imposed a state of emergency weve ended negotiations " ms bhutto said she hadnt been served any arrest order and called her detention "illegal " but unlike other politicians allied against gen musharraf ms bhutto hasnt openly called for his ouster despite her sharp remarks she has left the door ajar for resurrecting a political relationship by insisting only that gen musharraf end emergency rule resign his military post and commit to a specific election date ms bhutto claimed that about of her supporters have been rounded up across the country in the past few days members of gen musharrafs government said the number of detentions was exaggerated but acknowledged that arrests were made "sometimes we need to restrain them from breaking the law so you arrest them " said deputy information minister tariq azim in a telephone interview the stakes in this game of political brinkmanship are high for all concerned ms bhuttos hopes for a political comeback after years in exile could end in failure if the government succeeds in muzzling her gen musharraf could face a wider backlash from pro democracy pakistanis fed up with military rule and if more people take to the streets while islamist militants capture more territory gen musharraf could find himself in trouble with his one steadfast source of support the military pakistans army has long been the countrys most powerful institution but its heavy hand in both politics and business under gen musharraf has led to calls for a retreat to the barracks from the boardrooms that public resentment combined with demoralizing setbacks in the campaign against islamist insurgents could generate enough support within the military to consider a change in leadership some analysts suggest for now there arent any concrete signs that pakistans military is edging away from gen musharraf in moves likely to shore up his support the president has tapped loyal aides for the armed forces top jobs if and when he leaves his post as commander gen musharraf has nominated intelligence chief lt gen ashfaq kiyani to take over his job and there are no indications that lt gen kiyani is about to shove aside his boss and patron gen musharraf also has seeded scores of former servicemen into pakistans government winning loyalty and buttressing his control over civil institutions for her part ms bhutto has consistently called for the restoration of democracy since her role as leader of the pakistan peoples party likely would catapult her back into power at the same time shes been careful about putting too much pressure on gen musharraf perhaps fearing that his abrupt exit could create a leadership void that militants might exploit indeed a breakdown of gen musharrafs tentative alliance with ms bhutto a pro western secular leader who served two terms as pakistans premier in the late s and s would mark another setback in his fitful campaign to combat islamist militants in recent weeks pro taliban fighters have taken control of several towns police stations and former pakistani army outposts along the countrys northwestern border with afghanistan "now the militants from the tribal regions are trying to establish control they are fighting pakistan troops and killing innocent people " ms bhutto told reporters who stood atop the armored personnel carrier outside her home "we have to save pakistan from dictatorship of talibanization " gen musharrafs imposition of emergency rule has so far yielded few signs of success against an islamist insurgency militants continue to build strength in their border enclaves the bush administration has provided pakistan almost &# billion in assistance since the sept attacks most of which has gone to the pakistan army as reimbursement for fighting militants a major challenge has been motivating pakistani security forces to fight their countrymen hundreds of paramilitary troops and police have surrendered or been captured in recent months but some analysts say gen musharraf has been more preoccupied with solidifying his political control in pakistan than with making sure his troops are properly led ms bhuttos detention however temporary is expected to increase pressure on the bush administration to cut certain types of aid to pakistan senior u s officials have voiced their resistance to any such stoppages arguing they would undercut counterterrorism operations against al qaeda but they said that each step gen musharraf takes against his political opposition will increase the democratic controlled congresss efforts to cut aid more broadly ms bhuttos treatment could jeopardize broader u s hopes of a bhutto musharraf alliance to counter the islamist threat "the concern i have is that the longer the internal problems continue the more distracted the pakistani army and security services will be in terms of the internal situation rather than focusing on the terrorist threat in the frontier area " said secretary of defense robert gates speaking to reporters on his plane home from a weeklong visit to asia during the day in islamabad pakistans capital hundreds of police ringed ms bhuttos home they laid down coils of barbed wire and blocked access to her house with the barricades and an armored personnel carrier police equipped with riot gear and bamboo batons dragged away several of ms bhuttos supporters outside the house though senior members of her party were allowed to visit her and to address reporters since emergency rule was imposed the countrys chief judge has been dismissed from office and several other judges apparently have refused to take new oaths of office the government also has blacked out television channels and deprived citizens of the right to gather for political reasons while bringing thousands of security forces onto the streets of islamabad lahore and other cities critics liken the moves to previous periods of martial law in pakistan how long these emergency measures will last is still unclear on thursday gen musharraf pledged parliamentary elections will be held by mid february but didnt set a specific date he also reiterated that he will resign his military post "soon " but again didnt say specifically when that might be ms bhutto has criticized his remarks as "vague" and has demanded gen musharraf give up his post as army chief by next thursday when his current five year term as president formally expires last month pakistans electoral college comprised mainly of provincial and national lawmakers aligned with gen musharraf re elected him to a new five year term opponents challenged the legality of that vote before pakistans supreme court on the grounds that gen musharraf was legally obliged to resign his military commanders post before seeking re election gen musharraf still needs the supreme court to dismiss the legal challenges against his re election in order to have it confirmed arguing his right to run as a presidential candidate gen musharraf submitted a written promise to the supreme court to step down as army chief by the time his current term ends but he linked that pledge to the condition that the court validate his election gen musharraf and his supporters say he will step down as army chief once he is sworn in as president but not before but the courts ruling has been delayed in the days since emergency rule has been imposed the government hasnt been able to recruit enough new supreme court judges to fill vacancies left by the seven who were dismissed or resigned one of the lawyers challenging gen musharrafs candidacy aitzaz ahsan who is also president of the supreme court bar association has been arrested many pakistanis still express doubts that gen musharraf will follow through with his promises to hold parliamentary elections and leave his army job no matter what the outcome of the court ruling they note that in gen musharraf announced that he would retire from the military by the end of he didnt citing the nations security situation and the erosion of support among his political allies that u turn prompted a storm of criticism from those who said gen musharraf doesnt intend to step down "musharraf will never give up power " imran khan the former pakistani national cricket team captain turned politician who initially allied himself with the general before turning against him said in an interview last month meanwhile anti government violence continued to mount yesterday a suicide bomb attack at the residence of a federal cabinet minister in peshawar killed at least four people the minister was unhurt separately two pakistani soldiers were killed in an attack on a post in the district of swat in the northwest frontier province paramilitary troops and police in the area have recently surrendered to islamist militants who have been gaining strength local residents said heavily armed militants were patrolling the towns of madayan matta and kwazakhela once popular tourist destinations militants have hoisted flags inscribed with verses from the koran above government buildings they have also established islamic courts in areas under their control pakistani security officials suspect they are supported by foreign al qaeda fighters including arab and uzbek guerillas who have set up training camps in the nearby mountains some political analysts said the battle with militants poses a grave challenge to pakistan but also presents an opportunity to force the nations military and civilian leadership into a working partnership one thats been absent since gen musharraf took power "both the pakistani army and the pakistani politicians will ultimately need a strong link and cooperation with the u s " says frederic grare a south asia scholar at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington d c "musharraf may very well survive politically but then he will have to silence the civil society which has been so far at the forefront of the opposition " jay solomon in washington and yochi dreazen contributed to this article
