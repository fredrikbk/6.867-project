weekend journal books notes from noel revealing the steel behind a gleaming urbanity the letters of noel coward edited by barry day knopf pages &# an th century essay "on the beauty of epistolary writing " admonished "one who either in conversation or in letters affects to shine and to sparkle always will not please long " it comes as something of a relief then that noel coward often dismissed as a superficial sparkler did not always try in his letters to please with his cleverness this is good because "the letters of noel coward" is nearly pages long that much wit would quickly pall in fact much of the correspondence in "the letters of noel coward" is very serious indeed editor barry day has done a superb job with the collection organizing it into four sections "beginners please " "the years of grace " "noels war" and "shadow play " these in turn are interspersed from time to time with an "intermission" to trace the correspondence of several of cowards most important friends and colleagues including marlene dietrich and somerset maugham what emerges is the portrait of a complex charming driven serious and frankly courageous artist as might have been expected the collection is a feast for lovers of the theater coward had a classic stage mother the shrewd and willful violet coward was determined that noel would save her from the horrors of a dull lower middle class life and he did becoming the toast of a glittering international set he treated violet with devotion and sent an endless stream of letters to her "you wont have to wait very much longer before your rheumy old eyes are gladdened by the sight of your ewe lamb " he wrote in to "darlingest " coward seems never to have doubted his path as a man of the theater he also seems never to have doubted his life as a homosexual but as mr day notes coward was extremely private about his romantic life and virtually never alludes to it except in a joking way i suspect that this discretion was as much a matter of taste and the social conventions of his time as anything else but cowards unconcern with sexual orientation also allowed him to be a mainstream artist the politicizing of the theater in the s and s left him bemused and angry there are many surprises in "the letters of noel coward " we learn for instance that he didnt like gilbert and sullivan or oscar wilde "what a silly conceited inadequate creature he was " coward wrote of wilde "and what a self deceiver " we learn that coward instantly loved the u s on his first visit in "america is the place to get on i should always like to have a little working model of broadway at night just to take out and look at when i feel depressed " evidence in the letters of cowards generosity of spirit especially after his critical star had fallen in the late s and s is an unexpected pleasure by then he was considered an artistic tory and held in contempt by young playwrights of the kitchen sink school who were interested in gritty realism yet even john osborne "look back in anger " fell under his spell coward regularly attacked the osborne generation in public "the theater must be treated with respect " he wrote in "it is a house of strange enchantments a temple of dreams what it is not and never will be is a scruffy illiterate drill hall serving as a temporary soap box for propaganda " yet when osborne sent him a letter in asking him to stop the broadsides "you may find it hard to believe " osborne wrote "but there is more goodwill and kindliness here for you to draw on than you might expect to find" coward replied "i really am very grateful for your letter it gave me a sharp and much deserved jolt " as mr day writes "from then on the two men became friends along the way he was seen and understood by many who became his friends virginia woolf detected a danger in cowards early success and wanted to lure him into her bloomsbury group to save him "from being as clever as a bag of ferrets and as trivial as a perch of canaries " noel coward taking his cues from lytton strachey now thats something to ponder but even if coward can rightly be said to have written some slight works while trying to do too much he still gave us plenty of gems including "hay fever " "cavalcade " "tonight at " "private lives " "blithe spirit" and a bevy of marvelous songs from the romantic "ill see you again" to the comic "mad dogs and englishmen " perhaps the richest surprise in this collection is the section that deals with cowards life during world war ii in the early stages of the war before americas entry he was recruited by british intelligence to gather information in the u s about american attitudes toward britains fight with nazi germany while coward was in the u s his reputation suffered terribly back home as the press accused him of abandoning his country in its hour of need nothing could have been further from the truth coward was making a serious contribution to the war effort but because he was enjoined to silence he appeared to be shirking his duty "my disguise would be my own reputation as a bit of an idiot a merry playboy i was the perfect silly ass " he chafed at his enforced silence but it was not entirely without compensation he had a quiet private meeting franklin roosevelt in a man "who knew everything " coward wrote fdr was "full of candor advice and honesty and of course that immense personal charm id have done anything he asked me to do " high praise indeed from one of the most charming men of the past century once america had joined the battle against germany coward returned to england and soon silenced his critics after writing "blithe spirit " one of his most successful plays in just a weeks time he threw himself into making a film based on an earlier play "cavalcade " which told the stories of a group of sailors whose ship has been torpedoed and who float at sea clutching a life raft waiting to be rescued because of cowards previous connection with the royal navy through his friend dickie later lord mountbatten the admiralty was all for it the ministry of information however fought tooth and nail against the project as did oddly winston churchill himself the ebb and flow of cowards struggle to make the film as reflected in the letters are fascinating and give a clear picture of what a strong tough minded man he could be the resulting movie "in which we serve" starring coward who co directed with david lean was a triumph cowards enemies promptly did a volte face and asked him to make a similar film about the british army instead he exhausted himself entertaining troops in the worst theaters of combat until the end of the war the story of cowards final decades is not entirely grim he fought his critical eclipse with humor and real gallantry "p s after all ibsen and shaw got bad notices didnt they once and what i always say is that we writers must be brave and true and stand by not lie on our convictions " weary of marlene dietrichs obsession with the ravages of time he mused "how foolish to think that one can ever slam the door in the face of age much wiser to be polite and gracious and ask him to lunch in advance " for many cowards dazzling success in his mid s as a cabaret performer in the unlikely venue of las vegas in was a surprise but we learn that given the depth of his experience in the music hall and revue genres where he achieved his first great triumphs in britain as a singer composer and lyricist this turn onstage was merely the resumption of one of his crafts not the invention of a new one in the s he again fought opprobrium at home this time engineered by the labour government for seeming to evade taxes in his native land by settling elsewhere first in jamaica later in switzerland but coward who denied the tax dodging charge felt entirely justified in moving given his treatment during and after the war by "official" britain the whole theatrical community believed that he should have been knighted for his wartime work and when the award was finally bestowed in sir alec guinness spoke on behalf of other knighted actors when he wrote "we have been like a row of teeth with the front tooth missing now we can smile again " because mr day has included so many letters from so many of cowards friends and colleagues what emerges from the "letters" is the portrait of an age as well as of a man such context makes clear for instance that he wasnt witty in a vacuum he was surrounded by bright funny people as might have been expected he was embraced in new york by the wits of the algonquin round table alexander woollcott and edna ferber were lifelong friends with ferber it was love at first tease coward noting the severe cut of her suit joked "why edna you almost look like a man " "thats funny " she replied "so do you noel " mr days interpolations and comments are illuminating and often touching in their restraint the whole book is history of the most valuable kind it tells us what a highly gifted artist felt was important at often dire times in the world cowards descriptions of his experience are laced with wit and courage dame judi dench has written of his letters that they are "gloriously english " amen to that mr herrmann who has directed cowards "private lives " will appear in an episode of nbcs " rock" on jan
