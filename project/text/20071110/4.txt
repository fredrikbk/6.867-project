cancer eats away at society at all levels i wholeheartedly agree with samuel waxman and richard gambino that we are making significant advances in new research into and treatment of cancer that should be supported "the new ways we fight cancer " editorial page oct yet much of what is proposed will not be available in the places where the cancer burden is heaviest the low and middle resource countries where of all deaths due to cancer occur and where in many countries it has already surpassed infectious disease as the leading cause of death cancer is rapidly becoming a global pandemic incidence and death rates are rising in many of these countries with cancer killing more people in the developing world than hiv aids tuberculosis and malaria combined a key factor in these rising rates is that many low and middle income families in developing countries lack proper access to cancer education early detection and treatment methods as a consequence cancers are often diagnosed too late and there is needless suffering from inadequate palliative care in addition the tobacco pandemic has been one of our more successful exports and in spite of some strides in recent years in implementing laws aimed at reducing tobacco use it will still kill hundreds of millions in this century if we do not improve our ability to intervene the american cancer society is sharing its expertise on cancer research education and treatment with cancer control organizations and practitioners in developing countries we are working to build capacity and awareness in those countries and fostering a survivorship movement to destigmatize the disease thereby enabling our partners to better address issues such as access to cancer detection and treatment programs new approaches to research and treatment have had positive results with the declining cancer death rates in the u s but we in developed countries must ensure that the results of these new approaches also reach those in developing countries who are suffering needlessly from treatable diseases elmer e huerta m d president elect american cancer society atlanta dr peter b bach makes several good points about maximizing cancer treatment benefits in his recent article "well never cure cancer " editorial page oct recommending that we should make sure every proven pain reliever is on every pharmacists shelf is not one of them my husband and i both pharmacists operated a community pharmacy for seven years during that time we were robbed at gunpoint during the day and our pharmacy was broken into for drugs at night another pharmacist i knew was forced to the floor pistol to the back of his head when his store was invaded for drugs there is a financial factor also involved it is economically unfeasible for every pharmacy to carry every drug in case someone might need it someday every pharmacist is happy to carry or order for next day delivery any drug for a specific patient when needed is it unreasonable to expect a patient to obtain a one or two day supply of a very expensive infrequently prescribed medication from a hospital or cancer treatment center many communities also have a pharmacy which specializes in providing a variety of pain medications to hospice services i hope dr bach reconsiders his recommendation other accommodations to patients needs are available joan rouse lincoln calif
