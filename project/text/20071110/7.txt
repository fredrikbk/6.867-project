cross country the other philadelphia story philadelphia in his new book "heroic conservatism " michael gerson a former speechwriter for president george w bush claims that hostile house republican leaders and cynical west wing officials undercut the presidents faith based initiative reducing it to culture war fodder true but thats only half the story the other half is unfolding in places like philadelphia where the social movement that begat the initiative continues to gain steam over the past seven years the number of faith friendly state and local officials in both parties has grown and they are moving mountains philadelphia might just have easily been a city where faith based initiatives petered out the city is run by a democratic mayor john f street and is in a state that is becoming solidly democratic pennsylvania has come up blue in a string of presidential elections stretching back to and last year voters ousted sen rick santorum a christian conservative republican he lost his bid for a third term in part because he failed to win support in philadelphias suburbs but the rejection of republican christian politicians doesnt mean rejection of a faith based approach to social problems a study "the other philadelphia story " by university of pennsylvania researcher ram a cnaan found that religious fervor for providing social services remains vibrant his researchers gathered information often visiting from nearly all of the citys congregations they confirmed previous estimates that these congregations supply services that would cost the city at least a quarter billion dollars a year to provide these services include food pantries drug and alcohol prevention programs homeless shelters health screening day care crime watch anti violence programs welfare to work programs in welfare to work and a few other areas faith based organizations are the plurality social service providers secular nonprofit organizations for profit firms and government agencies bring up the rear faith based groups that have received federal state or local government grants have expanded their services without dampening their religious identities or suffering anything worse than the paperwork hassles that typically come along with public funding a burden to be sure but not the one many feared that faith based organizations would drop their faith based approach to solving social problems one reason why the faith based approach is taking root and growing in the city of brotherly love is mayor street he is one of scores of mayors and local officials across the country who have set up a local faith based initiative office or who have made supporting faith based organizations a large focus of their tenure in office one program mayor street is particularly vocal in supporting is "amachi " which focuses on mentoring children of prisoners the name comes from an ibo nigerian word meaning "who knows what god has brought us through this precious child " amachi is spreading like wildfire across the country in a half dozen years it has grown from nothing to nearly programs in states involving over churches and over mentoring matches some of which are funded by the u s department of health and human services another amachi convert is texas gov rick perry a republican his state is among the that now have their own office of faith based initiatives a dozen of these initiatives have persisted even after the governors office has changed hands or parties a recent case study by byron johnson at baylor universitys religion research institute focused on the ohio governors office of faith based and community initiatives which has lived on under the states newly elected democratic gov ted strickland ohio michigan wisconsin and many other states have made strides in leveling the playing field for religious nonprofit organizations by following the presidents lead in taking a pragmatic bipartisan approach ironically the biggest obstacles that remain for faith based organizations receiving government funding are now in washington some of those obstacles are within the bush white house where some gun shy staffers are intent on placating libertarian activists who blame the president and spending for the gops recent woes and the faith based initiative as one reason for runaway spending legacy minded loyalists of the president however need to keep in mind that on childrens health insurance preschool education and other issues mr bush risks giving historians reason to see "compassionate conservatism" as nothing more than anti government conservatism in religious drag there is however reason to commend the white house jay hein a republican and evangelical christian with a bipartisan head for policy is now heading up the presidents faith based initiative under his leadership it has begun to regain respectability among diverse religious leaders it may yet receive significant support from washington if not under this president then under his successor no matter who he or she is several presidential candidates including democrat hillary clinton and republican mike huckabee are offering a faith based social policy vision that reads like a page from mr bushs presidential campaign hymnal whatever washington does or fails to do however the faith based armies of compassion will keep on serving the poor while winning disciples in places like philadelphia mr diiulio was the first director of the white house office of faith based and community initiatives and is the author of the just released "godly republic a centrist blueprint for americas faith based future" university of california press see related letter "letters to the editor negative attitudes and myths hinder welfare" wsj nov
