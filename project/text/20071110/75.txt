whites great hope barack obama and the dream of a color blind america portland maine isaiah oliver a year old white social worker grew up in this overwhelmingly white city and attended the predominantly white university of richmond in virginia ask him why he supports barack obama and he says its because of the candidates race "because hes black it makes me want to believe that he will change things " says mr oliver leaving an obama campaign rally here "it feels like you are part of something thats starting to change american politics its the cool factor hes a rock star " as he campaigns across the country sen obama the son of a black father and a white mother is both revealing and tapping into a changed racial landscape especially among younger whites after decades of often bitter polarization and racial tension on issues ranging from the spread of civil rights to affirmative action many whites say they are drawn to sen obama precisely because they think his mixed race background reflects americas increasingly diverse population and projects a more optimistic vision of the countrys racial future sen obamas candidacy whether it succeeds or not appears to mark a turning point in race and politics in america it is prompting significant numbers of white americans to consider voting for him not despite his racial background but because of it "obama is running an emancipating campaign " says bob tuke who is white and is the former chairman of the tennessee democratic party "he is emancipating white voters to vote for a black candidate " sean briscoe a year old white who writes a political blog in nashville is one "obama doesnt come with the baggage of the civil rights movement focusing entirely on the race issue " he says "he went from hawaii to indonesia he has been in all these places where you get an appreciation for people who arent like you " two decades ago jesse jackson broke new ground by challenging whites to consider a black mounting a serious run for the presidency now sen obama and a new generation of black candidates are running campaigns that make whites feel good about themselves these younger black politicians including massachusetts gov deval patrick and tennessee senate candidate harold ford jr are like sen obama seen by many whites as proof of the countrys racial progress and their own sen obama "doesnt steer away from race but makes sure that everything he does is influenced by his bi racial identity " says harvard law school professor charles ogletree who knew mr obama as a law student and is advising the campaign "obama has learned the lessons of the failed candidacies of jackson and rev al sharpton and married that with the smoothness of colin powell " says scott reed a republican strategist "he has triangulated against all of them " sen obama continues to trail sen hillary clinton by substantial margins in national polls even with white support he could become the equivalent of eugene mccarthy in or howard dean in candidates who stirred fervor among white college students and intellectuals but were unable to win the nomination sen obama and his campaign aides declined to be interviewed for this story but his own writings and conversations with people who know him suggest his approach is both politically savvy and rooted in his own experiences he has always lived between two worlds he is the son of a mother from kansas and an african father who separated when he was two years old he lived in indonesia for a time as a child when his mother married an indonesian and then with his white grandparents in hawaii he excelled at elite institutions such as columbia university and harvard law school then worked in a black chicago neighborhood friends say that double life has affected not just his personality but also his politics "obama knows this is a majority white country " says mary pattillo an african american professor at northwestern university who has known sen obama for years "he is acutely aware how his discussion of race and racial politics will be interpreted and received by whites we who work in the white world are always mindful of not making whites feel threatened you cant get angry as a black person working in white america to get a message across black professionals are always thinking about the perfect balance of assertiveness and non threateningness " unlike sen clinton who regularly invokes the history making achievement she could make by becoming the first woman president sen obama rarely mentions race directly in his campaign speeches here in portland he emphasizes the "core decency of the american people" and his experience "bringing people together to get things done " he ends with a story about meeting an elderly woman in a small town in south carolina who asked him if he was "fired up" and "ready to go" leading to a call and response chant that brings the crowd to its feet sen obama never mentions that the woman and the town are black "barack is aimed at trying to get as much of the white vote as he can in order to win " says ronald walters former campaign manager for jesse jacksons presidential campaign the challenge facing black candidates like sen obama who have national ambitions says mr walters "isnt whether theyre black enough its whether theyre white enough " race remains a wild card in american politics candidates such as mr ford who narrowly lost the senate race in tennessee last year have often come close to election only to find race flaring at the last minute to blunt their momentum "obama knows that just because people are saying one thing doesnt mean they will vote that way " says tim king the african american head of a charter school in chicago who has known sen obama for a decade "no one ever really knows what people do once they close the curtain in the voting booth " sen obamas popularity among whites also stirs uneasiness among many blacks in the latest wall street journal nbc news poll sen obama trails sen clinton among black voters to "there is a lot of debate among blacks over how appealing obama is to white folks " says mr king "people are saying is he too likeable to white people " "obama doesnt really push people to consider what diversity really is " says alfred defreece a black teacher at eastern michigan university who says many of his white students favor obama "he is close enough to what is a tolerated white norm very much what is palatable and acceptable and good " mr defreece says he wonders whether sen obama would be able to aggressively push social programs that help blacks in poverty and end discrimination at the same time mr defreece also reflects the countrys changing racial landscape the woman he lives with is white sen obamas rise reflects the ways american race relations have changed in the past years the expansion of the black middle class the rise of blacks to positions of prominence in business academia and government and a general lessening of racial tension about of whites and of blacks describe black white relations as "somewhat good or very good " according to a recent gallup poll about of whites and of blacks say they support interracial marriage in the latest wall street journal nbc news poll of registered voters said they believe voters are prepared to elect a qualified african american as president a dramatic increase from when just said they thought america was ready to elect a black president in the current poll just of voters say voters today are ready to elect a qualified hispanic as president and a qualified mormon sen obama runs stronger among younger voters who are at the forefront of many of these changing attitudes from their embrace of hip hop music to the diversity they encounter on college campuses and he runs strongest among whites in their s and s who have lived through the racial changes of the past decades in the latest wall street journal nbc news poll sen obama trails sen clinton among democratic primary voters by percentage points overall and by virtually the same amount among white voters alone but his deficit is smaller to among voters aged to and he runs even with sen clinton among voters aged by contrast he trails sen clinton among voters over by more than points "ive met people who reminded me of obama at high school " says mae mouk a white year old assistant in a washington d c law firm who grew up in baton rouge la "i have dated outside my race i had friends in high school and college who were in interracial relationships i look at race differently than my grandparents and parents " most whites of course still live in largely segregated neighborhoods and have attended predominantly white schools even on more diverse college campuses blacks and whites tend to live in separate worlds but many young whites pride themselves on being open minded and on having been exposed to the rhetoric and reality of diversity "i dont see race as a big issue " says mr briscoe the nashville blogger "most younger people can go in between the different communities and can get along with people of different backgrounds its a more multicultural way of life i have friends of all different colors i can listen to rap music " sen obama "is a citizen of the world " says david bartholomew a white law student at boston college law school "obama and my generation we see the future of the world as countries evolving together because of his background he can speak to a wider range of people than any other candidate he can speak globally " younger voters like mr briscoe and mr bartholomew embrace sen obama born in and too young to have marched with martin luther king jr as a post civil rights candidate but his approach and campaign rhetoric consciously echo the hopeful spirit of the early civil rights days in his autobiography written before he entered politics sen obama tells the story of his kenyan father drinking with friends at a bar in hawaii when a white man objects to being in a bar "next to a n " "the room fell quiet and people turned to my father expecting a fight " sen obama recounts "instead my father stood up walked over to the man smiled and proceeded to lecture him about the folly of bigotry the promise of the american dream and the universal rights of man " the white man ends up buying sen obamas father a round of drinks in the book sen obama looks back wistfully to the early s a "fleeting period" that promised "a bright new world where differences of race or culture would instruct and amuse and perhaps even ennoble " by the late s both the rhetoric and substance of the civil rights movement had sharpened with the rise of black power and groups like the black panthers who accused whites of being racists leading to an eventual white backlash and decades of black white hostility and anger "the secret to martin luther king was that he flattered white americans that you are better than you think you are " says shelby steele a black research fellow at stanford universitys hoover institution "the very essence of obamas appeal is the idea that he represents racial idealism the idea that race is something that america can transcend thats a very appealing idea a lot of americans would truly love to find a black candidate they could comfortably vote for for president of the united states " richard harpootlian a white lawyer and former state chairman of the south carolina democratic party was in college in when king was assassinated he recalls going down to atlanta to walk in kings funeral cortege "they played the i have a dream speech with his line about judging his children not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character " mr harpootlian recalls on that day "i thought we were never further away from that vision when i met barack obama i felt as id never felt before that he typifies what dr king was talking about " at the obama rally here year old nick wright a high school senior is one of the few african americans in the crowded downtown arena he sits at a table with a white classmate welcoming people to the rally "obama isnt just reaching out to the african american community " says eli noll the white classmate "hes so much for the youth of america " mr wright nods in approval "i just read about malcolm x in english class " he says "he had a lot of good things to say but nobody listened because of some of the other things he said obama he doesnt have to be like malcolm x "
