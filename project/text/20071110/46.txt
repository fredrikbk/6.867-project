the weekend interview with mitt romney consultant in chief i love data " mitt romney has been speaking for less than two minutes when he makes this profession the former massachusetts governor is meeting with the editorial board of the wall street journal to discuss his campaign for the presidency and he starts not with the economy "global jihad" or the country as a whole but with himself while some have questioned mr romneys authenticity the immediate impression he gives is that he speaks straight from the heart especially where data are concerned "i used to call it wallowing in the data " mr romney continues "let me see the data i want to see the clients data the competitors data i want to see all the data " this is not only a description of his approach to business it sums up his political outlook "you may ask me questions about topics that i havent studied in depth ill be happy to give you my assessment of what i think at this point but before i would actually make a decision on a very important topic i would really study it in depth " at one level this is a caveat so obvious that most politicians wouldnt bother offering it but mr romney gives the impression that this is a methodological first principle so important to how he does things that he wants everyone he meets to understand it about him having established his biography he turns without pause to the question which he asks himself "why am i running for president " the answer to this question is as abstract as his overture was personal the "i" in the question seems to disappear "i think what america faces now are extraordinary challenges which if we deal with appropriately will allow us to remain the worlds military and economic superpower for an indefinite period of time " mr romney does then introduce a personal element but its not his own person "if we instead take the course that hillary clinton would prescribe " he warns "it would lead to america becoming the france of this century having started as a superpower ending up as a second tier power " those challenges include "global jihad" and "the emergence of asia as an economic challenge " on the domestic front he lists "entitlement driven financial distress " "overuse of foreign oil" and "the inability of our school system to prepare our kids for the jobs of today let alone tomorrow " to that mr romney adds "the inability of the health care system to rein in the explosive growth in costs " needless to say he thinks "we have a good prospect of solving all of them and remaining the worlds power " those then are the problems that in his word "drive" him and its a pretty good list but rather than explain why he is the person to solve them mr romney shifts gears to talk about himself in another sense politicians dont like to describe themselves as ideological but most have a core of political precepts mr romney describes his thus "obviously i have just like in the consulting world i have concepts that i believe i believe the free market works and government doesnt that when government takes over a function which can be effectively managed in the free market we make a huge mistake i think government is almost by necessity inefficient inflexible duplicative wasteful expensive and burdensome " this is fairly traditional small government free market conservative talk or would be if it werent framed as a "concept " like those used in consulting which makes it seem at first a curious way to describe why one is running for president of the united states and leader of the free world but it turns out to be a perfect encapsulation of the romney campaign mr romney spent a decade as a consultant and later ran a private equity concern that grew out of that for most of his adult life then mr romney has been figuring out how to run businesses better it is not much of a stretch to say that he views the federal government as just one more candidate for a data driven makeover in fact it may not be a stretch at all when asked for details about how he would reduce the size of government if elected he mentions two things the organizational chart of the executive branch and consultants "theres no corporation in america that would have a ceo no coo just a ceo with direct reports " running a government organized like this is he explains impossible "so i would probably have super cabinet secretaries or at least some structure that mckinsey would guide me to put in place " he seems to catch a note of surprise in his audience but he presses on "im not kidding i probably would bring in mckinsey i would consult with the best and the brightest minds whether its mckinsey bain bcg or jack welch " this is not a new idea the new democrats too became enamored of the idea of "reinventing government " and al gore extolled the potential to making government work more like business as vice president except in that case the larger goal was to show that government need not be sclerotic bloated and inefficient mr romney seems to view it more as a turnaround project trim the fat reduce expenditure and shrink the organization mr romneys data driven world view however really stands out when he starts talking foreign policy in a debate last month he responded to a question about the presidents legal authority to attack iran by saying "you sit down with your attorneys" and figure out what authority you have but this was not merely a dodge if it had been it would have been a clumsy one at best it was a glimpse into the workings of mr romneys mind at his meeting in our offices this week he was asked how candidate romney would respond upon learning that president bush had launched an attack on irans nuclear facilities "i would hope that the president would have outlined a great deal of information " was mr romneys response "i have very little information for instance on how many nuclear facilities are there where are they can we take them out can we not what is the capacity of the iranian military to respond are our troops in iraq safe or are they going to get hit " coming from someone else it might sound like evasion but given mr romneys habits of mind it sounded instead perfectly natural he continued "its such a wide array of information id need to know whether something is a good idea or a bad idea so it depends " he then proceeded to outline examples of good and bad scenarios for attacking before coming around at last to what passes for a traditional political assessment of the situation to wit he thinks sanctions could still work if we can get other nations on board and if we can pressure iran diplomatically and economically "then i think we have a good shot of getting iran to behave more responsibly " the charge that mr romney lacks "authenticity" emerges from the fact that he has flip flopped over the years especially on social issues he famously tried to run to the left of ted kennedy on some of those issues in his unsuccessful senate race at that time he also expressly disavowed being a "reagan bush" republican these days of course mr romney is right with "the base" on abortion same sex marriage and the whole panoply of "social" issues which has led to suspicions that mr romney the businessman is simply tailoring the product himself to the customer then the massachusetts electorate and now the national republican party the impression he gives in person is not however that of a salesman tailoring his message to his audience it is instead precisely the person he described in the opening moments of our meeting a man who goes first to the data who refers to what some would call their "core beliefs" as "concepts " at any rate his response to a question about his former disdain for "reagan bush" is consistent with that version of the man "reagan gets a lot smarter the older i get " he allows he then explains what bothered him then "i was concerned about what seemed to be looming deficits and inability to rein in spending in those days and as time has gone on ive recognized that he was brilliant and did the right thing for our economy and so i may not have been entirely in sync with reagan bush back at the time but as time has gone on i think what they proposed was smarter and smarter " framed in that way what was a flip flop becomes an openness to reconsider former positions that may not do much to mollify those who worry about his ideological reliability hes changed his views before so whats to stop him from changing them again but it is a kind of romneyian consistency belief in what works belief in praxis over abstract theory or ideology this frame of mind seems to make politics both a befuddlement and a great challenge for the businessman in mr romney "my wife says " he explains "that watching washington is like watching two guys in a canoe on a fast moving river headed to a waterfall and theyre not paddling theyre just arguing as they get closer to the waterfall theyll finally start to paddle " thats characteristically optimistic but in business most of the time everyone agrees on the goal or which way the waterfall is the goal is profits at a minimum and ideally growth too in politics the two men in the canoe are probably arguing because they cant agree which way to paddle mr romney encountered this while governor of massachusetts as he acknowledges when describing how he vetoed certain elements of the states health care reform law only to have his vetoes overridden and then there is the fact that in his words "government is almost by necessity inefficient inflexible duplicative wasteful expensive and burdensome " and yet he speaks hopefully of whittling down the " economic development programs in this country " the teenage pregnancy prevention programs" and the like it probably takes a consultant to believe that we have economic development programs because no one ever hired a consultant to explain that maybe one or five or none would do and even mr romney is not that naive there is even something attractive about a politician who is driven by the facts of the case an excess of ideology is never appealing and in the worst cases leads to fanaticism of the ugliest sort the question for the electorate is whether mitt romney is the man of the hour but when asked whether his "nuts and bolts" approach can possibly succeed in an ideological divided age he returns to the nuts and bolts "i think im the only guy who can win the general election " he explains "that may seem strange but i think its going to take someone from outside washington to win i think its going to take someone whos not a lifelong politician to win " then he goes tactical "of course we have to win florida and i think almost all of the leading contenders could win florida with the right running mate and the right policies and the right effort "but we also have to win michigan or ohio winning both would be critical i dont see how you get there without winning michigan or ohio and i can win michigan and i may be able to win ohio too " at this point mr romney may have started to worry that it sounded like he was bragging because he abruptly shifted to a strange form of self deprecation "i can win those states and by the way not because of me but because of my dad " he says george romney was governor of michigan in the s "my dads reputation is better than mine will ever be in michigan his reputation for integrity and can do accomplishment is what i think helps me win michigan and thats what it takes to win the white house " mr carney is a member of the wall street journals editorial board
