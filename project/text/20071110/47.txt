thompson sets social security view washington although former sen fred thompson entered the presidential race late he ventured friday into an area few rivals have tread advocacy of a fundamental overhaul of social security the republican candidate laid out a detailed four page proposal calling for the creation of voluntary personal retirement accounts and a change in the formula for future retirees that would result in lower social security benefits it is a risky move for the former actor and lawmaker from tennessee he is the only presidential candidate so far to make social security an anchor of his campaign although all of the presidential candidates have spoken when asked about the need to fix the social security system none has offered such a detailed plan nor talked so eagerly and often about the issue they all recall president bushs failed effort in as a lesson in the political pitfalls and substantive complexities of trying to change the program he twice campaigned on letting workers carve private accounts from social security revenues but even fellow republicans wouldnt go along in large part because of the borrowing his plan would require for a nation already in deep debt by the governments calculations social security wont be collecting enough revenues to pay full benefits to recipients starting about "ive been concerned about this for some time " mr thompson told reporters friday "basically my plan will assist americans in saving more for themselves during their working years and not having to depend on the government for their entire retirement " the thompson campaign said its proposal wouldnt affect social security benefits received by current retirees or those nearing retirement to pay for his private account program the government which is likely to be running deficits for the foreseeable future would have to borrow more money mr thompson is proposing cutting future social security benefits for workers under age by calculating their initial monthly benefit using a formula that indexes to prices rather than wages currently retirees initial benefits are tied to wage inflation a structure that is designed to provide a monthly amount that allows retirees to maintain their standard of living mr thompsons proposal would effectively leave future retirees with a baseline amount that is lower relative to their standard of living than current and past retirees received initially to help make up for that gap mr thompson proposes creation of voluntary personal retirement accounts unlike president bushs failed proposal which would have let workers divert some social security payroll taxes into personal investment accounts mr thompsons accounts would be funded by a pretax contribution from workers wages the government would provide a matching contribution workers would automatically be enrolled in the program although they could choose to opt out those who opt into the program however would face delayed eligibility for full social security benefits they would face a one to two month delay from receiving full benefits for each year they invest in a private account or they could retire earlier and receive reduced benefits among the issues being debated in this campaign cycle few others offer such stark contrasts when it comes to differences between the two parties candidates than social security all of the leading republican candidates have suggested that private accounts should be part of fundamental social security changes and all have ruled out higher payroll taxes to pay for future benefits the leading democratic candidates in contrast have opposed private accounts and suggested raising payroll taxes on wealthier americans to help shore up the system neither new york sen hillary rodham clinton nor illinois sen barack obama has offered particularly detailed proposals for what they might to do to change the system but both have rejected the idea of private accounts they also have both floated the idea of raising payroll taxes on wealthier americans to avoid cutting benefits or increasing the retirement age they also have proposed incentives for americans to save more through existing k accounts or other such savings vehicles jackie calmes contributed to this article
