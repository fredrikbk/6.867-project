neither windmills nor garden gnomes grace this course european miniature golf is a game for perfectionists still fake volcanoes loom eskilstuna sweden carl johan ryner lined up a foot putt on the third hole he flexed his knees hands choked up on his club it was a hairy shot uphill with a hard bank to the right mr ryner held still for a count of five and swung the ball zipped up the incline passed neatly through a five inch wide wooden gate at the crest of the hill kissed the left hand wall and picked up spin caromed off the barrier at the back of the green and rolled confidently into the cup hole in one mr ryner pumped his fist at the top echelons of miniature golf and mr ryner is among the worlds very best sinking aces is par for the course over three days of play at the european cup held in a converted former tractor factory in this city west of stockholm mr ryner scored of them in holes he lasered shots through the saw tooth obstacles of the fishbone on plunked balls into the narrow channel of the orkelljunga on he led his team uppsala bgk to gold in europe competitors like mr ryner play a rigorously pure form of miniature golf course designs are more mies van der rohe than myrtle beach clean lines crisp angles geometric obstacles there are no garden gnomes astride the mini fairways no toy windmills no water hazards teeming with plywood crocodiles here minigolf is an athletic fugue of golf and billiards a challenge of precision and consistency "you get addicted to the game " says robbert van der laan years old of the dutch team mgc leeuwarden but traditional minigolf in europe is wrestling with change participation is waning in europe as the garish american game played with beat up range balls grows in popularity elite league bigwigs are mulling how much to relax traditional tenets to broaden the sports reach theres not much to bend european courses are carefully laid dimensions specified to the centimeter in a rule book players study spins and angles and train to develop a consistent stroke and then there are the balls "in the states you have adventure golf one ball " says boerje forss "no no " mr forss wagged his finger he is a minigolf ball salesman and had set up a table of his wares next to the th tee two hundred ninety four balls nestled like easter eggs in foam trays international rules prescribe some parameters for sanctioned balls they must measure between and millimeters or to inches across for instance but otherwise they vary balls are graded on "shore" a measure of hardness in polymers and "jump" how much a ball bounces when dropped from one meter minigolfers travel with arsenals during the days of practice before a big tournament theyll fine tune their selection picking just the right ball for each hole mr forss points out the "klicker " used by many eskilstuna competitors on which is played with two caroms like a pool ball the hard klicker reflects cleanly off the walls his best seller is the "nifo " which generally goes for about swedish kronor &# its gentle bounce gives a delicate rebound the environment must be conquered too heat affects bounciness humidity can cause skidding mr ryner had to recalibrate his play at eskilstuna because the arena was more crowded than it had been during practice sessions thanks to extra body heat "the temperature goes up " he said "every ball just pushed back " becoming more bouncy bgs hardenberg poetter a german team that has dominated the sport for more than a decade came with the oxygen activated mitten warmers employed by skiers hardenberg golfers use them to heat balls for finer temperature control team member walter erlbruch golfs with two athletic tube socks tucked into his waistband if a ball is too cold itll go into a sock then under his shorts minigolf requires stamina and precise control most of all it takes mental fortitude says hans bergstroem a computer specialist at volvo and president of the european minigolfsport federation "you have a very small muscle movement that makes the difference if you cannot control your nerves you will get it wrong " he says "the very best players in the world are ice cold men " on the course walter erlbruch is a snowman at the tee hell stand in silent concentration for half a minute or more in his putting stance the socks in his waistband hang motionless like plumb lines mr erlbruch a year old corporate trainer has been minigolfing since he was six by the late s he went pro and began assembling a team of all stars to gun for germanys then champions "we looked for guys who had the geist" spirit mr erlbruch said practice is paramount team hardenberg arrived in eskilstuna six days before the european cup late last month to master the courses idiosyncrasies pride is the only payoff save for the occasional bounty of a few hundred euros for winning a tournament theres no money in mini mr erlbruchs younger brother harald is by wide acclaim the worlds best minigolfer at the european cup in bergheim austria he shot a dazzling in nine rounds holes harald was off his game in eskilstuna he and his brother tied for fourth in the mens competition eskilstunas felt lanes tripped them up as in tennis international tournaments are held on any of three surfaces swedes dominate felt courses which are the norm in scandinavia but rare on the continent "we have no practice possibilities in germany " harald lamented germans favor the other two official surfaces concrete and eternit a fiber reinforced cement board used in construction the international minigolf scene is likely to get more complicated last year the world minigolf federation the sports governing body approved a new style of course called "minigolf open standard " or mos those courses approach an american design permitting such relaxations as moats moving parts are still verboten mos was pushed by the u s representative at the wmf robert detwiler mr detwiler is the proprietor of the hawaiian rumble and its sister course the hawaiian village both in north myrtle beach s c the hawaiian rumble takes its name from a fake volcano that erupts every minutes mr detwiler is no fan of minimalist minigolf the courses "are not attractive " he says "if you put one of the u s style adventure courses next to european courses nobody will go to the european courses " reinhard neitzke the sport director of the european minigolfsport federation is sanguine he is mindful of the need to lure new players "surely we need the fun attractive courses " he says standing near the results board at eskilstuna "as well we need the high level courses like this " he points to the lanes where the atmosphere is hushed like a chess tournament someone is almost always teeing off after all and punctuated with the occasional "ja " after a nice shot walter erlbruch bristles at the memory of a round of american style minigolf the passing blades of a windmill scooped up putted balls and flung them into a pool "luck " sniffs mr erlbruch "if you make a nonsense of my sport i dont like it " mr detwiler says europeans should recognize that the american courses still require skill they just also blend in a bit of showmanship "they would say it eez luck it eez luck " says mr detwiler goofing on some foreign accent nonsense he says "youve got to make the putt just like tiger woods " from the sidelines hans olofsson a former swedish champ says mr woods wouldnt stand a chance on the eskilstuna lanes "of course tiger is a better putter than me on a golf course but not by much " says mr olofsson
