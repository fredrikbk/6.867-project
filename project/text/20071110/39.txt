the buzz marketwatch weekend investor how a bear paws at mr coffee from the "tale of two titans" department jim chanos and martin franklin have never met but if they ever do and in the unlikely event i am invited this is one meeting i wouldnt want to miss mr chanos runs kynikos associates the countrys largest short selling hedge fund mr franklin is chief executive of jarden corp the umbrella for a smorgasbord of household brand names like sunbeam coleman and mr coffee mr chanoss firm has been shorting jarden betting that its stock will fall for several years among the reasons are mr chanoss belief that jarden is hooked on acquisitions to show growth and along those lines that it has been aggressive with the way it accounts for acquisitions that is noteworthy because jarden an outgrowth of the old ball canning jar company has been built on more than a dozen acquisitions since mr franklin a marathon runner is so enamored with deal making that in addition to running jarden he and jardens chief financial officer ian ashken last year helped launch freedom acquisition holdings the firms sole purpose is making acquisitions it has since merged with glg partners a european money management firm where messrs franklin and ashken are nonexecutive directors "theyve played a growth by acquisition game " mr chanos says "every time growth rolls off they make another acquisition " jardens takeover of k a sporting goods manufacturer he believes is a classic example of aggressive acquisition accounting the k deal was first announced in april during jardens second quarter a quarter in which sales growth from existing businesses went negative for the first time ever during that same quarter before it was formally acquired ks earnings "fell off a cliff " mr chanos says in the third quarter once it was part of jarden mr chanoss analysis shows that certain profit margins in the part of the company that includes k posted an unusually large increase he reckons that smacks of "spring loading " a legal tactic that calls for the acquired company to bulk up on charges and expenses before the deal closes to help the acquirer look better later on trying to get a handle on whether that has been the case mr chanos says he contacted richard heckmann the former chief executive of k and now a director of jarden who in the s was a stockbroker to mr chanoss firm according to mr chanos mr heckmann suggested that mr chanos meet with messrs franklin and ashken mr heckmann told me via email that he didnt recall suggesting that a meeting be set up "i forwarded jims obviously biased email to jarden believing that he did not understand ks business and left it up to jarden to communicate with him " mr heckmann says shortly thereafter mr chanos says he received an email from mr ashken saying that he and mr franklin would look forward to meeting with their longtime critic mr chanos says he wrote back to mr ashken saying he would be delighted to meet in kynikoss new york offices to discuss among other things how jarden accounts for acquisitions soon thereafter he says he heard from mr franklin who said he had no desire to discuss acquisition accounting and furthermore would only meet in jardens offices in new yorks westchester county jarden says mr chanos has a "standing invitation" that he has so far declined mr chanos says he hasnt any intention to take them up on their offer if mr franklin wont discuss acquisition accounting so what does jarden think of mr chanoss concerns speaking through an outside spokesman jarden believes there is a "major flaw" in mr chanoss argument regarding margins jarden also points out that september "is a significantly stronger month than july" for k mr chanos doesnt buy the explanation with jardens stock down since reporting earnings less than two weeks ago he figures his concerns about jarden are finally coming home to roost that is quite a different story from a little more than two years ago when i first wrote about similar concerns mr chanos had with jarden at the time its stock had been rising and mr ashken was quick to tell me that mr chanos had been "crucified" for shorting his stock he further said "i have no sympathy for him " my guess is that this time it is mr chanos who has no sympathy for jarden herb greenberg marketwatch senior columnist doesnt own stocks except his employers nor sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of wall street journal publisher dow jones email hgreenberg marketwatch com
