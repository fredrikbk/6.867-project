billiton bid spurs talk of buyouts offer for rio tinto lifts metal stocks field gets crowded bhp billitons rebuffed offer to buy rival rio tinto is boosting speculation that other big commodity companies will be swept up in a wave of consolidation fueled by strong demand and high metals prices that have raised cash reserves of potential buyers and increased the urgency to strike first shortly after bhp announced its &# billion offer for rio tinto on thursday the stocks of several commodity producers including alcoa inc anglo swiss miner xstrata plc and freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc rose as investors began trying to divine likely targets many industry observers and commodity companies expect demand for raw materials to remain strong for several years thanks to chinas rapid industrialization moreover the run up in prices over the past few years would allow companies to quickly pay down debt incurred in a buyout "i personally dont think we are anywhere near the top of the consolidation cycle " said jeremy gray a london based metals and mining analyst for credit suisse xstrata admits it is on the lookout for acquisitions but says the field is becoming more crowded with potential buyers the company which in was essentially a nickel company that sold to stainless steel makers has since bought its way into seven major commodity markets including precious and base metals along with coal "our strategy remains to grow by acquisition and expansion of existing operations and building new ones " said spokeswoman claire divver analysts say a midsize company like xstrata while an active buyer is also increasingly a target because many of the good smaller mining companies have already been cherry picked xstrata could expand the portfolio of even larger mining companies looking to increase their exposure to different commodities if bhp fails to get rio tinto it might consider going after xstrata according to research notes by metals and mining analysts at austock securities copper companies are also targets because of the continued high price of copper which while down in recent weeks is still about higher than a year ago some analysts say that even freeport mcmoran could be a target because of the strong copper prices freeport declined to comment last year freeport bought phelps dodge for &# billion high copper prices have helped freeport pay down much of the debt associated with the deal "freeport could be tempting " said leo larkin a metals and mining analyst with standard &amp poors equity research brazils companhia vale do rio doce has a strong iron position but relatively few copper assets and might be interested in freeport cvrd declined to comment about speculative purchases another question is what happens to alcoa if bhp and rio tinto link up and eclipse alcoa as the worlds largest aluminum maker alcoa tried to buy rival alcan last summer but rio came in with a higher bid since that time alcoa has been rumored as a takeover target because aluminum is strong and a buyer could sell off less profitable packaging operations alcoa might also be interested in any aluminum assets that a combined bhp rio might shed "we will watch it unfold with great interest " said alcoa spokesman jake siewert indeed a bhp rio tinto merger would boost merger activity in the mining sector just from deals that result from assets that would be sold off by the two companies to satisfy antitrust concerns said peter gray a managing director at kpmg corporate finance llc "theres tremendous confidence in the mining sector and sustainability " he said "its now becoming as exciting as the oil and gas sector " more consolidation is also expected in coal but in the u s the sector is less attractive to international miners because coal prices have retreated from highs in because of slower demand from domestic power plants uncertainty about carbon legislation and the prospects for future coal fired power plants have also damped u s interest in the sector coal companies in asia and australia which supply coal to china and have enjoyed skyrocketing prices could be more attractive targets say analysts yet analysts say more consolidation will eventually come even to the u s where the coal industry remains highly fragmented many analysts expect the handful of big public coal companies in the u s to acquire smaller private ones in the next year or two and further consolidate coal reserves
