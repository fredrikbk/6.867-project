weekend journal food &amp drink wine notes the cellars market we recently completed an addition on our house and we put in a bottle wine cellar ive always been an under &# a bottle drink it tonight kind of guy however with this new cellar i would like to lay some bottles and cases down for future enjoyment how can i tell what would be a good bottle to cellar and for how long todd wiebusch cornelius n c about two or three years ago when california cabernets were in full bloom in wine stores i bought a few cases of some "reliable value" california brands like rodney strong sebastiani and hahn and held onto a few bottles of each in my modest small cellar i was wondering if i may have held onto these a bit too long any general rule of thumb on whether value cabernets can or should be aged gunjeet singh new york we have received variations of these two questions hundreds of times over the years so many people have asked the same one mr wiebusch did that one of our colleagues did a story for weekend journal earlier this year about consultants who help people fill their wine cellars if you would like a copy drop us a note at wine wsj com our advice is simple relax take your time when you have a wine you like or perhaps a kind of wine you like buy a few more and lay them down we found that we liked bordeaux so we bought quite a few then it was california cabernet then and german rieslings and so on before we knew it our cellar was filled and the same thing will happen to you any consultant would be happy to fill your cellar with the usual suspects great bordeaux and burgundy fine port and so on but the most important feature of the wines in your cellar is that they should be wines that you like one of the very special delights of a cellar is the memory attached to every bottle or case where you bought it why you bought it and in many instances the great price you paid for it that brings us to mr singhs question while its a no brainer to collect and age fine expensive wines we did indeed enjoy our bordeaux over the years for instance to us its more fun to cellar wines that are less expensive even very much less expensive we have found that value priced wines from thoughtful wineries often age beautifully for years we bought the gutsy inexpensive reds from louis martini in california and kept them around years later they were even better and we loved the idea that they were so cheap when we bought them the rodney strong would be exactly the kind of wine wed probably cellar for a few years in when we sampled american cabernets under &# and the rodney strong was our best of tasting it cost &# sure it would be possible to buy wines like that in the future when theyve gained some age but theyll cost more and you can never be sure how they were stored if you drink a wine and really like it but find that it might be a little young perhaps it seems tight and not very giving or bites you at the end or makes your mouth pucker this would be a good candidate for aging one advantage of having a big cellar like mr wiebusch is that you could buy several bottles of the same wine or even a case of it that way you could open one every six months or every year and see how its coming along its a good idea to take some notes with a large cellar you have the room to take some chances because mr wiebusch is from north carolina for instance wed urge him to lay down some of the finer reds from the growing number of north carolina wineries how will these be in five years nobody knows and thats the fun of it we have so enjoyed drinking old bottles that weve cellared for years and when we hold one of those bottles its especially wonderful knowing that it is probably one of the few left on earth weve drunk many bottles from wineries that have gone out of business yes theres a risk of opening a bottle thats over the hill but the upside potential is greater especially with a value priced wine you can contact us at wine wsj com be sure to include your name city and state
