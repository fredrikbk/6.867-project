weekend journal gearing up the cost of taking half pints on the half pipe paying for skis for growing kids can be a slippery slope should you rent or buy when adults buy skis and boots they typically use them for eight or nine years which makes the average price of &# more palatable the real puzzle is whether to buy new skis for kids who change sizes at least every season the rental versus buying debate has even perplexed computer scientists who use an algorithm to come up with an answer to what they term "the ski rental problem " when kids are involved though other issues factor into the equation like how cooperative your year old will be about carrying equipment whether the ski school fee includes the price of equipment and the chances your child will want to try skiing backward ask any of the million americans who participated in the sports at least once last season skiing and snowboarding arent cheap though kids often get a break on lift tickets and their equipment runs about half what adults pay the average cost of junior skis boots and bindings sold in specialty stores was &# for the season according to snow sports industries america a trade organization in mclean va up from &# the previous season sue way who heads the ski school at snowmass in colorado says using the same equipment for the entire season is ideal switching skis or snowboards means the kids have to get used to the nuances of the new equipment every time they get out there taking time that could otherwise be spent learning says dan bergeron director of the learning center at okemo ski resort in ludlow vt thats a strike against daily rentals but it doesnt resolve the dilemma between buying and seasonal leases for families that dont have siblings for hand me downs or whose kids are more than a year apart leasing equipment for the season from a ski shop can be a less pricey option generally running &# to &# and kids can switch sizes for free if they grow halfway through whether to lease can often come down to the quality of equipment available nearby in some areas of the country there may just be one shop with old equipment that charges &# a season rei for example has stores in states but only rents ski and snowboard equipment in six colorado utah washington california idaho and massachusetts plus any kid who wants to do tricks will want twin tip skis those with tips on both ends and they can be hard though not impossible to rent joe jones sports offers twin tips and other new models at some of its shops throughout the northeast that have seasonal rentals and then theres the coolness factor most kids skis come with new graphics every year and it can be hard to resist drawings of raised fists black skis with pink stars and names like "bad seed" and "abracadabra " recently ski makers have started putting different graphics on girls twin tips which has some stores that rent playing catch up dan fox director of operations for christys sports which has shops in colorado and utah says he thinks the stores will have to get in some pink "pretty girl" models next season lauren corning a merchandising and finance manager who lives near boston says that so far she hasnt heard any complaints about brand names or aesthetics from her kids and who have leased for the past five years "they are usually so fired up about getting out to ski it never comes up " she says but she adds "as they get older and start skiing with friends rather than parents this could change " one reason to buy new the skis that most shops lease are models bought in bulk that are specifically made for renting they tend to be heavier and stress durability over the absolute performance offered by "in line" sales models says jeff mechura brand director for k skis and ski makers are coming out with new models with specialized advantages ks new "bad seed" is millimeters wider than its other junior skis allowing a more stable platform for powder snow roxys "abracadabra" comes as small as centimeters a twin tip for very small girls the small price difference cents in according to sia between buying skis via the internet and at specialty shops would argue for the shops since they can measure more accurately some shops offer a lease to buy program or hold annual sell back sales for new equipment buckmans ski shops which has five philadelphia area stores and leases about pairs of junior skis a year allows leasers to buy the skis at the end of the season minus some of the rental price the shop also has a tent sale every year where customers can sell the skis or snowboards purchased the previous season and get store credit ski swaps held by schools and other organizations sound like a good idea but they can be stressful with people lining up hours before the doors open to get the best equipment experts say swaps tend to benefit buyers more than sellers who rarely get more than half the price they paid for new skis since they typically have to pay a fee to the swap organizers for families that take one or two ski vacations a year and dont want to lug equipment on the plane renting is probably the best option but experts caution them to stay away from some resort owned shops at base lodges which can feature long lines banged up equipment and shortages of specific sizes this isnt always true upscale resorts tend to have upscale rental equipment there are usually shops in the resort town that have newer more performance oriented equipment the ultimate rental solution may be using companies that for a couple extra dollars a day deliver demo quality skis to a hotel room or the slope bringing along extras to make sure the fit is correct with names like ski butler black tie rentals and door to door they service resorts from aspen to lake tahoe to whistler the deals such as black ties free rentals to kids or younger with each paid five day adult rental could melt the ice from a parents face or follow the advice of the computer scientists the ski rental algorithm addresses the question of how to decide when to buy skis if you dont know how often youll be skiing the solution according to carnegie mellon computer science professor daniel
