weekend journal leisure &amp arts sightings the deaf audiophile whats so good about bad sound plenty of all the clever inventions of the past decade the most culturally consequential just might be the ipod in case youve been asleep since thats apples proprietary name for the mp player a hand held hard drive that stores and plays the audio files used to transmit recorded sound over the web its the postmodern equivalent of the walkman only better since an ipod can hold as many as songs in its digital memory yet these ingenious devices are driving producers and engineers nuts in september the journals lee gomes reported in his "portals" column that "those who work behind the mic in the music industry producers engineers mixers and the like say they increasingly assume their recordings will be heard as mps on an ipod music player " accordingly these audio professionals are now custom tailoring their product to sound best on ipods the same way that pop record producers of the early s are said to have tailored their product to sound best on car radios the trouble with this approach mr gomes explained is that mp files are highly compressed in order to make them easier to store and transmit thus a piece of recorded music that is loaded onto an ipod and listened to on inexpensive earbuds doesnt sound as good as the same music recorded on a cd and played back on a stereo system equipped with high quality speakers or headphones the result mr gomes was repeatedly told by industry professionals is "music that is loud but harsh and flat and thus not enjoyable for long periods of time " true incontestably as a trained musician with many years of performing experience under my belt im well aware that the mp is musically speaking something of a blunt instrument yet i find it hard to get bent out of shape over its burgeoning ubiquity indeed i spend a great deal of time listening to digital audio files on my ipod or through a pair of compact desktop speakers connected to my macbook why do i settle for inferior sound quality partly because of the near miraculous convenience of mps which not only can be stored and retrieved with the greatest of ease but are equally easy to purchase over the web via services like apples itunes but i have another reason one that i share with millions of other ipod users im middle aged like a third of my fellow baby boomers im experiencing one of the more predictable consequences of growing older which is that i now suffer from a mild but noticeable case of presbycusis the medical term for age related hearing loss not only are the sensory cell receptors in my inner ear gradually degenerating as a result of advancing age but when young i spent countless happy hours playing loud music which fried more than a few of those same receptors i can still enjoy music of all kinds but i dont hear it quite as well as i did years ago because i now find it harder to perceive the high frequency sounds that are such an important part of recorded music thats the bad news the good news is that i dont care much for one of the unintended consequences of presbycusis is that it liberates you from the snare and delusion of audiophilia when i was younger i longed for bigger better ever more expensive sound systems sure that they would enhance the pleasure i took in listening to recorded music and did they up to a point but somewhere along the way i forgot that every dollar i spent on speakers was a dollar i could no longer spend on records not to mention tickets to live performances like so many sound crazy audiophiles i had not only put the cart before the horse but id come close to cutting the reins now that my hearing isnt what it used to be i understand more clearly than ever before that recorded music can never hope to be more than a substitute for the real thing a priceless and irreplaceable substitute to be sure and one that has clearly changed the world of music for the better ive been listening to old records for most of a lifetime yet it never quite ceases to amaze me that simply by pushing a button i can hear igor stravinsky conducting "the rite of spring" or louis armstrong rapping out that golden introduction to "west end blues " yet the fact remains that sitting down in your living room and throwing on a cd is simply not the same thing as going to a concert much less playing for your own pleasure yes it can be intensely meaningful but it is still experience once removed no matter how fancy your speakers are conversely stravinsky is still stravinsky when you experience him through a &# pair of earbuds hes the point not the earbuds thats why im more than content to listen to "the rite of spring" on my trusty ipod would that my presbycusic ears were capable of distinguishing between great and good sound but at least they still know the infinitely more important difference between sound and silence mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and
