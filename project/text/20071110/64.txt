weekend journal leisure &amp arts declarations things are tough all over the story as i was told it is that in the early years of her prime ministership margaret thatcher held a meeting with her aides and staff all of whom were dominated by her even awed when it was over she invited her cabinet chiefs to join her at dinner in a nearby restaurant they went arrayed themselves around the table jockeyed for her attention a young waiter came and asked if theyd like to hear the specials mrs thatcher said "i will have beef " yes said the waiter "and the vegetables " "they will have beef too " too good to check as they say it is certainly apocryphal but i dont want it to be it captured her singular leadership style which might be characterized as "unafraid " she was a leader margaret thatcher would no more have identified herself as a woman or claimed special pleading that she was a mere frail girl or asked you to sympathize with her because of her sex than she would have called up the kremlin and asked how quickly she could surrender she represented a movement she was its head she was great figure a person in history and she was a woman she was in it for serious reasons not to advance the claims of a gender but to reclaim for england its economic freedom and return its political culture to common sense her rise wasnt symbolic but actual in fact she wasnt so much a woman as a lady i remember a gentleman who worked with her speaking of her allure how shed relax after a late night meeting and youd walk by and catch just the faintest whiff of perfume smoke and scotch she worked hard and was tough one always imagined her lightly smacking some incompetent on the head with her purse for she carried a purse as a lady would she is still tough a reagan aide told me that after she was incapacitated by a stroke she flew to reagans funeral in washington went through the ceremony flew with mrs reagan to california for the burial and never once on the plane removed her heels that is tough the point is the big ones the real ones the thatchers and indira gandhis and golda meirs and angela merkels never play the boo hoo game they are what they are but they dont use what they are they dont hold up their sex as a feint why hes not criticizing me hes criticizing all women let us rise and fight the sexist cur when hillary clinton suggested that debate criticism of her came under the heading of men bullying a defenseless lass an interesting thing happened first kate michelman the former head of naral and an edwards supporter hit her hard "when unchallenged in a comfortable controlled situation sen clinton embraces her elevation into the boys club " but when "legitimate questions" are asked "she is quick to raise the white flag and look for a change in the rules " then mrs clinton changed tack a little and told a group of women in west burlington iowa that they were going to clean up washington together "bring your vacuum cleaners bring your brushes bring your brooms bring your mops " it was all so incongruous can anyone imagine the th century new class professional hillary clinton picking up a vacuum cleaner isnt that what downtrodden pink collar workers abused by the patriarchy are for but even better and more startling people began to giggle at mrs clinton a woman who has never inspired much mirth suddenly they were remembering the different accents she has spoken with when in different parts of the country and the weird laugh she has used on talk shows a few days ago new poll numbers came out neck and neck with barack obama in iowa her lead slipping in new hampshire there is a sense that sen obama is rising a sense for the first time in this election cycle that mrs clinton just may be in a fight a real one one she could actually lose its all kind of wonderful isnt it someone indulged in special pleading and america didnt buy it its as if the country this week made it official we now formally declare that the woman who uses the fact of her sex to manipulate circumstances is a jerk this is a victory for true feminism in its old fashioned sense of a simple assertion of the equality of men and women we might not have so resoundingly reached this moment without mrs clintons actions and statements thank you mrs clinton a word on toughness mrs clinton is certainly tough to the point of hard but toughness should have a purpose in mrs thatchers case its purpose was to push through a program she thought would make life better in her country mrs clintons toughness seems to have no purpose beyond the personal accrual of power what will she do with the power still unclear it happens to be unclear in the case of several candidates but with mrs clinton there is a unique chasm between the ferocity and the purpose of the ferocity there is something deeply unattractive in this and it would be equally so if she were a man i wonder if sen obama as he makes his climb understands the kind of quiet cheering he is beginning to garner from some republicans and from those not affiliated with either party they see him as a democrat who could cure the bush clinton bush clinton sickness i call it that because it seems to me now less like a dynastic tug of war than a symptom of deterioration a lazy unserious and faintly corrupt turn to be taken by the oldest and greatest democracy in the history of man and i say sickness because on some level i think it is driven by a delusion "we will be safe with these ruling families whom we know so well " but we wont they have no special magic dynasticism brings with it a sense of deterioration it is dispiriting i am not sure of the salience of mr obamas new generational approach mrs clintons generation he suggests is caught in the s fighting old battles clinging to old divisions frozen in time and the way to get past it is to get past her maybe this will resonate but i dont think mrs clinton is the exemplar of a generation she is the exemplar of a quadrant within a generation and it is the quadrant the rest of us of that generation do not like they came from comfort and stability visited poverty as part of a college program fashionably disliked their country and cultivated a bitterness that was wholly unearned they went on to become investment bankers and politicians and enjoy wealth power or both mr obama should go after them not a generation but a type the smug and entitled no one really likes them they showed it this week see related letters "letters to the editor hillary clinton may have a problem with women" wsj nov
