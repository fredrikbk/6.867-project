weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece mantegnas singular jesus his dead christ is a brutal gripping anomaly milan italy here are three questions the first is how far should we go to call an anomaly a masterpiece the second when looking at a picture can we avoid being affected by what surrounds it by its neighbors on the wall and last if we dont know anything about the circumstances of a works composition how much do we really know about it andrea mantegna brother in law of giovanni and gentile bellini master colorist and illusionist anticipator of mannerism and the baroque made a picture that has attracted moved and confused its viewers since it first came to light after its makers death in we know little about it why it was done when or where it might have been placed but we have it it is "cristo morto " the "dead christ " an almost square by inch picture tempera on canvas belonging since to the pinacoteca di brera in milan it is brutal gripping and one of a kind both for its time and in its makers oeuvre "cristo morto" is currently displayed in a long hallway here on one side of it theres another mantegna a "madonna and child" with a chorus of brightly colored luminous cherubs on the other theres a giovanni bellini "madonna and child " it faces on the opposite wall three brilliant expansive canvases by vittore carpaccio famous like everyone else from the venetian school for his sumptuous colors along the same corridor the museum has hung other pictures by bellini and a large mantegna altarpiece with st luke writing his gospel and other saints below christ with the madonna and st john the evangelist sixteen works fill this narrow space a single one seems definitively not to belong it is the "dead christ " other paintings by its maker his relatives and his contemporaries are represented all around it but this picture is the odd man out indeed sui generis why and when mantegna painted it we can only guess his son mentions it to the painters patron the duke of mantua from the citys ruling gonzaga family in a letter right after the artists death mantegna had done his best work for more than two decades for the gonzagas his fame spread after a decade or so in rome he returned to mantua in and remained there this picture may have been lying around in the studio for as long as three decades intended for its makers funeral it appeared on his catafalque there and perhaps for a burial memorial instead cardinal sigismondo gonzaga acquired it it eventually made its way to milan mantegna painted both religious and secular subjects and no one who has been to mantuas ducal palace will forget his frescoes for the bridal chamber "camera degli sposi" there with trompe loeil illusionism peacocks prancing and cherubs leaning over and looking down from railings realistic lively and joyous the frescoes indicate why mantegna amazed and delighted his viewers as much five centuries ago as he does today "dead christ" bears no resemblance of course to this secular work but neither does it look like any "deposition from the cross" or "pieta" that you have seen before it shocks it distorts it terrifies here is human flesh laid out on a marble slab like dead meat on a butchers table here is christ at the morgue as dead as dead can be with the mourners the virgin mary flanked by two other barely visible figures on the upper left shedding tears most gripping here is a figure foreshortened and distorted by a perspective that squashes christs entire body rendering it grotesque and dwarf like if intended for an altar piece we still dont know how or from what angle mantegna might have wished his viewers to see the picture if from below or from the side we would see it differently from how we see it here at the brera straight on at eye level i thought of hans holbeins famous "the ambassadors" at londons national gallery with its internal joke the anamorphic skull signifying a memento mori which can be seen correctly only from the side obliquity is required take long views in other words and youll recognize the grim truth of death but even if you walk into an adjacent hallway at the brera and squint mantegnas christ still looks grotesque theres no way around it mantegna a master of anatomical correctness has performed a disorienting tour de force the painting maintains two mutually exclusive perspectives we take in the mourners from our point of view but not the object of their lamentation christ occupies space differently from the living or perhaps occupies a different space altogether that mantegna has succeeded there can be no doubt this is the picture from the brera that haunts everyone who sees it realistic instead of ideal hard instead of soft the picture conveys the cold permanence of death reproductions exaggerate the pictures colors whether they have faded with time or were deliberately muted is also debated the slab on which christ lies seems salmon colored even pink and mottled with the mourners tears mostly everything looks gray or dun the dead mans head lies against rather than on a pillow at the rear and his feet and hands are cleanly pierced through with the holes made by the nails of the crucifixion even the drapery over the lower half of his corpse seems rigid with death rather than loose most shocking and probably deliberate his genital area occupies the dead center of the picture plane this is by no means the ideal body much favored by other renaissance painters indeed by mantegna himself at other moments compared to the distant head the feet are gigantic unlike to take an obvious example michelangelos early "pieta " with delicate marble folds mantegnas two dimensional corpse looks bloated sodden heavy its rib cage raised up and parallel with the level of the virgins right hand christs hands seem to grip at the sheet beside him and his hair is splayed out in snakelike waves the picture is both small and claustrophobic it reaches out to the viewer as if to challenge and threaten mantegna has rendered the coldness of death with white hot intensity bringing deaths infinite distance into proximity with the viewer he has brought death to life the multiple indeed punning meanings implicit in the phrase "still life" in italian "natura morta" will occur to you when you try to take the measure of mantegnas achievement mr
