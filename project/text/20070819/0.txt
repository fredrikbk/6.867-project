answers on medicaid vary state by state our column last month about the aftermath of changes congress made in early in the rules for qualifying for medicaid assistance for long term care and ways to hold on to a home or other assets generated a stream of questions and comments an important aspect of the changes involves the "look back" period that the government uses to deter inappropriately giving away or sheltering money or other assets that could otherwise be used to pay nursing home costs previously if you gave money away during the past three years you would be ineligible for medicaid for a period of time based on how much money was transferred or given away that look back period has been extended to five years we also discussed ways that the law allows to protect money by putting investments in an annuity or a home in a trust many readers asked a basic question where can they go to get more information but as with just about everything associated with medicaid there is no simple answer as we noted in the previous column medicaid is a state managed program and rules can vary significantly from state to state still a good first stop is the federal governments web site cms hhs gov home medicaid asp a section on eligibility provides an overview of the issues anyone applying for medicaid needs to understand such as income guidelines and rules for transferring assets the next stop should be to locate the agency that oversees medicaid in your home state and either call or visit its web site in florida for example its the agency for health care administration but it can be a tough slog to relevant information on the florida web site it takes a few clicks to reach the "ssi related programs fact sheet " that fact sheet is a page outline of eligibility requirements and requires wading through more than a dozen variations of the states medicaid program to find the right one for you a close read of the florida materials however still will provide important information for example florida has yet to implement important parts of last years federal rule changes on gifts and medicaid eligibility that we wrote about last month one cautionary note when looking online for information about medicaid make sure youre visiting an official site internet searches for medicaid often direct inquiries to companies selling insurance or other services its also a good idea to seek out an expert in your states medicaid laws a good place to start is the national academy of elder law attorneys at naela org some state bar associations will also have referral services but before hiring anyone talk to a few candidates and take the time to check out their references some readers asked whether there is a threshold below which a gift wouldnt affect eligibility the answer says new york attorney philip bouklas is "it depends " in new york he says different counties can have different standards "the regulations do not specify an amount as to gifts " mr bouklas says "however when poring through three to five years worth of bank statements the state does not question every transaction some counties require the caseworker to question transactions over &# others question transactions over &# " in the past column we used the example of making a gift to help pay for college education and one reader wondered if other kinds of gifts counted as well they do "if you give money to a charity during the look back youre going to get penalized " mr bouklas says a number of readers also asked for additional information on annuities and medicaid under the new guidelines set by congress its still possible to put money in an annuity and have it not be counted as an asset when determining medicaid eligibility the idea is that if a couple has more than the allowable level of assets when one spouse needs to go into a nursing home rather than spend the money down to the maximum allowable assets about &# in many states the difference can be put into an immediate annuity from which the healthy spouse can draw income one reader asked what the best timing would be for taking that step its not something youll do ahead of time says attorney jeffrey marshall "you do it at the time when you need to apply for medicaid " he says that way you know the exact amounts you need to put away in the annuity the strategy of putting a home or other assets into a irrevocable income only trust also generated some questions about how they worked "how can the house be sold by the parent " one reader asks the basic concept is that whatever is transferred into the trust investments or a house counts as principal the parents can take income from investments in the trust or even rental income off the home if the house is sold they can take income off investments made with the proceeds of the house but they cant touch the principal "the house counts as principal " says chicago attorney janna dutton "as long as there is no access to the principal it would not be counted as an available asset " he says but a number of readers questioned the idea of estate planning around medicaid that involved sheltering assets from nursing homes "why is it that you would encourage people to turn to medicaid to pay for their nursing home costs so that they can leave their assets to their kids is that fair " one reader wrote "we all need to cover our own medical and nursing costs with our savings our home equity long term care insurance etc it is outrageous to take the position that our heirs inheritance be preserved for them at a huge cost to every taxpayer in the united states " it is true that this is a divisive issue but these practices exist and are legal meanwhile encore has written extensively about the ins and outs of long term care insurance in the past its a subject that the column will continue to cover closely as readers try to meet the rising costs of long term care email encore wsj com
