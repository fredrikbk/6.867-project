marketwatch how and when to bid low on a home with stagnant prices and elevated inventory in many markets home sellers are no longer automatically turning up their noses at offers that come in far below their asking price but buyers who do ask for deep discounts still risk offending sellers to the point where they quash any deal so before making an aggressive offer some homework is in order real estate professionals say and buyers will need to effectively explain why the price of a home should be lower pat oheron was able to negotiate a steep discount with a seller who relocated for a job in a neighborhood in ann arbor mich that had two years worth of inventory on the market mr oheron says before he even made an offer the asking price had already dropped by about &# he eventually bought the home for &# with about &# in other credits the price ended up being &# below the initial asking price mr oheron was able to take advantage of a market in which buyers decidedly hold the upper hand with its excessive for sale inventory due in large part to job losses in the area but even though housing is in a slump in many parts of the u s those tactics wont work in markets that remain healthy and theres always an inherent danger in going too low a low offer could insult the seller to the point that theyll refuse to counter realtors say and the seller could easily make the assumption that the buyer isnt committed to making a deal "when youre making the offer " says jon boyd mr oherons agent and president of the national association of exclusive buyer agents "if you justify that offer with outside data then its much less likely to be perceived as being an insult or the buyer not as serious " here are three guidelines on how and when to make an aggressive bid  learn how motivated the seller is to make a deal certain sellers are going to be more willing than others to negotiate a low offer and there are several giveaways that might indicate more leeway on price for instance if the sellers have already purchased another home and that sale has closed theyre likely to be more willing to make a deal says dick gaylord president elect of the national association of realtors and a broker with re max real estate specialists in long beach calif if the property has been on the market for a long time sellers will be interested in entertaining any offers he adds mr gaylord says he talks to the sellers agent to get as many details as possible about how motivated the seller is overall local market conditions also play a role the housing market in which mr oheron bought for example was sluggish the home he purchased had been on the market for about a year because of the job relocation the seller needed to move and wasnt in the position to take the home off the market until conditions were more favorable mr oheron says  make your case with hard facts when putting together an aggressive offer for a client mr boyd doesnt just hand the seller a purchase agreement with the price the buyer is willing to pay he creates a cover letter explaining exactly where that number came from in addition to citing comparable sales in making the offer it also could be important to include details regarding the amount of inventory in the immediate surrounding area he says "if we just looked at the relative values of the houses that sold we would end up paying too much for that house because we know that the values are going to fall " mr boyd says "if we see two years worth of inventory we should be buying potentially less than what houses have sold for in the past year in the neighborhood " buyers may even personally write a letter to the sellers to make their point as they did when the market was hot and they aimed to stand out from the crowd mr gaylord says that way they can detail what they like about the house but express their fear of future dropping values  prepare for the possibility of rejection or negotiation ultimately a real estate agent working on behalf of a buyer needs to honor and facilitate the offer that the buyer wishes to make even if it seems to be too low mr gaylord warns buyers making very low offers that the seller might refuse to negotiate on a "super aggressive offer " mr boyd says he might tell a client "theres a one in five chance there will be a positive response " still theres that potential for a seller to make a counteroffer especially if there havent been many other bids danielle kennedy a real estate sales coach and author based in pacific palisades calif advises sellers not to think of a low offer as an insult but as "a sign of interest " it "begins the dialogue regarding the purchase of your house " she says not all hope is lost even if a seller doesnt bite immediately sometimes after time elapses the seller comes around and decides to negotiate mr boyd says new information such as the sale of a comparable home at a lower price also can nudge a seller to give an aggressive offer a second look and open the negotiation process amy hoak writes for marketwatch www marketwatch com email forum sunday wsj com
