what you need to know about the market selloff the markets endured one of their most turbulent weeks in memory unsettling investors in the process one extreme example on thursday the dow jones industrial average tumbled more than points before staging a recovery that left it down just on the day then on friday a move by the federal reserve was met with enthusiasm sending the dow jones industrial average up for the week the dow tumbled points to close at but with fridays gains still up for the year to date the standard &amp poors fell only for the week to up on the year while the nasdaq composite index dropped for the week but has a gain of in the weeks zigzagging turmoil came after a month of losses that took some investors by surprise because they came after the dow jones industrial average hit a record high here are some questions and answers aimed at explaining how the market has turned from giddy to glum and where it might be going from here q whats at the heart of the markets problems a just as technology stocks soared to unrealistic levels in the late s and the subsequent bust caused deep enduring losses the debt market is experiencing the aftermath of its own unhealthy boom until recently investors paid too much for all kinds of debt investments and worried too little about the risks including mortgage loans from borrowers with poor credit histories and junk bonds sold by low rated companies now amid growing losses debt buyers and all kinds of lenders are pulling in their reins causing a credit crunch or a difficulty for some to obtain credit at reasonable prices q why are the problems of home owners who cant pay their mortgages affecting stocks a stocks are spooked because rising borrowing costs for companies and consumers could affect spending corporate profits and the overall economy stocks climbed between and july of this year due to strong profit growth much of it caused by strong consumer spending but now companies like wal mart and home depot are sending signals that more difficult times could be ahead q how does this panic affect the average investor an ira or k holder whos mainly concerned about his or her retirement funds or college savings a investors focused on the next six years and not the next six months should see the current swoon as a reason to look for bargains stocks may continue to weaken and the u s economy could slow down but investors shouldnt try to time the stock market stock prices are now more reasonable than a few weeks ago so investors should hunt for stable companies that are not reliant on borrowing money and are not in housing or consumer oriented businesses analysts say q interest rate cuts by the federal reserve bailed out markets in the past wont that happen this time a it could central banks have been adding cash to the system in the past week to instill confidence and keep things running smoothly on friday the fed lowered its discount rate or the rate it charges banks on loans citing rising economic risks the move is important and sent stocks climbing because it signals a potential willingness of the fed to cut its primary policy tool the federal funds rate which could lower borrowing rates across the economy q whats behind the sudden losses a large investors such as hedge funds are selling positions to raise cash and reduce the amount of money theyve borrowed from banks others are simply heading for the sidelines unwilling to buy shares and because many corporate buyouts rely on debt the problems in the debt markets have dried up the merger and acquisitions activity which also supported stock prices q so are we headed for a recession a its hard to tell most economists doubt a downturn is ahead but there are signs the economy is weakening and if lending conditions continue to deteriorate it could undermine other key sectors of the economy such as autos q why are hedge funds losing money arent hedge funds used by wealthy investors to "hedge" their losses elsewhere a the average hedge fund gained almost this year through the end of july but certain types of funds such as those that bet on debt products and so called quantitative funds or those that rely on computer models have lost a lot of money recently sometimes their hedges or investments that are supposed to protect them have not been working as expected other times theyve just made poor bets a stark example three big hedge funds run by goldman sachs lost as much as of their value just in the first part of august q everyone says the economy is doing great high profits high employment so why is the stock market going crazy a markets are driven by emotion and investors are worried about who might be the next to own up to problems will growing problems for housing weigh on consumer spending and whether a recession is around the bend so while economic growth is respectable and foreign growth is strong markets try to anticipate the future right now thats in doubt q why if as everyone says the fundamentals of so many companies are so good are the equity markets swooning a theres growing "risk aversion" in the market even bullish investors are unwilling to step up and buy in a significant way but there are bargains in the market for those who can handle the volatility and the possibility that stocks get even cheaper before the worst is over its also important to keep things in perspective stocks havent dropped significantly this year and are coming off a strong year least year q has credit truly become tight for everyone even highly qualified borrowers a borrowers with poor credit are finding it difficult to borrow at attractive rates but its also getting harder for borrowers with good credit those who want a so called jumbo mortgage or a loan larger than &# are now paying an interest rate of almost in many markets from less than in early july the reason investors who generally buy mortgage loans from lenders are much less willing to buy these loans worried that they might not pay off q what does this mean for the real estate market for buyers who wouldnt be considered subprime and for those who wish to sell property now a the real estate slump likely will last a while longer and could begin to affect even the most expensive sector of the market which has been relatively immune to the larger housing ills q how about other investments like junk bonds and investment grade rated bonds a those kinds of bonds were quite expensive a few weeks ago and arent yet especially attractive junk bonds pay an interest rate of about four percentage points above comparable super safe treasurys thats up from about percentage points a few weeks ago but still not enough compensation to take on the risks of these bonds most analysts argue in the past junk bonds have at times yielded percentage points more than treasurys check back a few weeks from now bonds might get more attractive q when do the volatility and the difficulties end a thats a tough one the housing market is facing a flood of adjustable home mortgage loans that will reset at higher rates in the months ahead the bond market will have to digest about &# billion of loans tied to leveraged buyouts and stock investors will need to see some evidence of the economys resilience but bulls note that there remains a lot of cash on the sidelines corporate balance sheets are strong retail sales have held up and global growth is robust providing reasons for optimism email forum sunday wsj com
