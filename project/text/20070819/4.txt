eyes on the road can they be classics will the cars of today catch on with collectors and auto buffs of the future online edition to everything there is a season and this is the season for automotive nostalgia this past weekend around a million people converged on the stretch of woodward avenue between pontiac mich and ferndale mich for the annual "woodward dream cruise " a celebration of the motor citys glory days made that much more emotional by the present day tribulations of detroits not so big three meanwhile in monterey calif a smaller and generally wealthier crowd of car aficionados assembled for the annual pebble beach automotive weekend a festival that celebrates the automobile as collectible fine art these events represent two distinct branches of american car culture separated at one level by the number of digits in the personal net worth of the average attendee among the dream cruises signature cars this year was the chevy bel air celebrating its th anniversary at pebble beach the featured makes were auburn cord duesenberg and aston martin among the cars expected to generate particular excitement at pebble according to autoweek magazines larry edsall was an unrestored ferrari mm touring barchetta found languishing under some rugs in the arizona desert the automotive equivalent of finding a picasso in grannys attic so years from now what will classic car fanatics be parading down woodward ave or bidding on at pebble beach what cars will emerge from beneath oily rags to delight some middle aged buff in will we celebrate the th anniversary of the chrysler lebaron its not an easy question there have been some fairly severe automotive design droughts during the past years or so will someone who discovers a chevrolet citation under a drop cloth in the old barn experience any form of excitement unless that person happens to need something to run in a demolition derby a visit to the auburn cord duesenberg museum in auburn ind can challenge your belief in industrial progress the distinctive artistry of the flamboyant duesenbergs the auburn boat tail speedster and the s cords with their art deco front ends puts most of what passes for premium cars today to shame still experts in the business of automotive culture design and collecting say there will be a vibrant classic car scene years from now particularly if car fans broaden their minds at the high end the key to collectibility will as always be rarity exotic cars such as the bugatti veyron as well as certain limited run ferraris and porsches will likely grace pebble beach auctions of the future says rob myers founder of rm auctions the big classic car restoration and auction company that runs a sports and classic car auction at pebble beach mr myers points to some more attainable cars that could find favor in the future including the datsun z and the dodge viper and plymouth prowler a few s and s detroit cars could have promise too he says such as the limited production buick gnx or special edition ford mustangs such as the bullitt model chrysler designer ralph gilles who led the styling team for the popular chrysler says in an email he expects cars such as the chevrolet corvette z the pontiac solstice convertible the original audi tt the new beetle and the mini cooper s will have a following in the future he also puts in a vote for several chrysler models including the viper prowler the convertible pt cruiser the forthcoming challenger and the c in "modified form " mr gilles gets a seconding vote for the c specifically the limited run srt model from automotive consultant jim hall of autopacific corp mr hall says cadillac cts v series models equipped with liter engines will be collectible as well because informed enthusiasts such as himself will know that these engines used certain exotic racing technology such as titanium rods to achieve extra power future woodward dream cruises could also feature more cars from the extreme edge of todays tuner culture "you will see crazy hot honda civics i mean crazy hot " says mr hall "three hundred to horsepower going through the front wheels its an internal combustion hand grenade " one challenge mr hall predicts will confront collectors who want to preserve todays cars as future classics maintaining and replacing the on board computers "there will be a business for someone who can build a generic computer plug and play" to allow a current car to keep rolling years from now he says as for cars of the late s and early s which technically are rolling into their first years as "classics" by some definitions christian overland vice president for museums and collections at the henry ford in dearborn mich makes an optimistic case "people are collecting their youth " mr overland says lots of people were young in the s and s even if detroit was in one of its dark periods popular culture in america has tended to cycle between periods when people looked to the past for fashion art and architecture and periods when the culture embraced dramatically new styles that broke with the past mr overland says "we are in a revival mode" now he says that accounts for such varied phenomena as the fad of pimping out mid s chevy impalas with massive wheels or the vh series that reverentially revisits the pop culture and music of the s in this context mr overland says even some dubious cars of the late s and s are enjoying a renaissance "people are starting to collect amc pacers " mr overland says gremlins and pintos are showing up at the henry fords annual motor muster classic car event last year he says someone from kentucky arrived in a fully restored sunburnt orange pinto with a beige leather interior "that thing had it all " he says hmm maybe i should have kept
