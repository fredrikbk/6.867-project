love &amp money no more soccer the readers weigh in no pain no gain or take your marbles and go home readers inundated my email box with comments after i wrote about a soccer injury several weeks ago that sidelined me from the game and finally pushed my wife amy to essentially insist that i hang up my goalies gloves for good her concern ill injure myself to such a degree that it will affect my ability to be a husband and a father as well as make it difficult to earn a living as a writer as i wrote in that column i think she is overreacting and exaggerating the risk i also think shes being unfair soccer is my one extracurricular passion i love the game and its the only activity i pursue that gets me out of our house where i spend almost all day every day because it also serves as my home office the question i asked in the column is whether a spouse can "veto your hobbies when those activities potentially affect your livelihood " im happy to say that the response i received most often from readers was get back in the goal but not everyone saw it that way one reader in particular said i need to "grow up and act like a man you sound like a whiny little boy complaining about not being able to do something he wants even though hes well aware that the choice could bring him harm "you took on the responsibility of being the provider and protector when you said i do its your job to see that your family has a safe comfortable environment without the daily fear of losing you to injury millions of men and women give up personal interests for the common good of the family all the time slowly many of them find a replacement for that loss that eventually becomes as valued as the interest given up "and so it goes until your kids have left the nest then it can be your turn to look to fulfill your interests and desires still only with the mental and heartfelt support of your mate " peg wolny in fort collins colo shared my column with a daughter in her late s who tore her achilles tendon playing soccer after reading my words "she laughed hysterically at your reluctance to give up the sport " ms wolny says "three years later she still cannot run more than once a week due to side effects from her injury even worse her kids saw her get injured while she was still on crutches her husband tore his hamstring playing jump rope with their kids neither could drive do lawn work clean house carry laundry up the stairs or grocery shop needless to say my husband and i were really busy "find a new passion " ms wolny concludes "stop being selfish " a number of readers suggested that maybe my injury was my bodys way of reminding me that im no longer a kid moreover they said that when i wise up and recognize this fact there are other ways to stay true to my passion for soccer ranging from coaching to playing soccer based videogames bob crafts a doctor in poway calif offers a different suggestion become a referee for youth leagues he played for years coached for one and refereed for "the referee is right in the middle of things and basically only has to show up for the games you wont injure your hands but youll still be running five to seven miles per game and you will be an integral part of the game we love "the kids need you give it a shot " a few readers weighed in with no opinion about whether i should stop playing but they said anyone who pursues potentially risky endeavors outside work should have disability insurance the polices one reader wrote "are not very expensive and if when you need it you really need it " she suggested having enough liquid savings to cover three months of living expenses and then have a disability policy in place that kicks in after days which "will help keep the premiums down " by and large readers like laura martinez and jo ann skalka echo the vast majority of voices who sounded off on this topic both share a passion for the activities they love both have been injured pursuing those passions and both say that while their spouses routinely raise a wary eyebrow only they can say when its time to leave the game ms skalka is a year old goalie in an indoor league in san diego her experience is similar to mine she says she has suffered a rash of small and not so small injuries including a broken tailbone ruptured quadriceps "and a mild concussion a couple months ago i get no sympathy from my husband when i come home hurting and we dont really have a debate going on as to when i should quit" though she says he circled my original column and left it at her chair in the kitchen "perhaps we are a little selfish when it comes to soccer and putting ourselves at risk but it picks me up after a great game " ms skalka says "i tell my husband happy wife happy life id rather be injured for a brief time than not have played at all " a skiing accident in left ms martinez a year old registered nurse in tacoma wash in need of knee surgery recovery took months before she was back to normal for six months she was unable to work her hour shifts but she hit the slopes again in and this past january damaged her other knee "im still not back to normal yet but had i never got back on that slope that i love i would have regretted it " ms martinez says more important she says "i probably would have resented my husband had he told me to stop doing what i loved " he never did say that ms martinez says though she knew he was concerned still "it was my decision even though he had to pick up the slack after my injuries " now she says shes stepping off the slopes for good but "it is now my decision to stop skiing " "just remember " she concludes "you can get injured doing nonrisky behavior like stepping off the curb the wrong way life is short so do what makes you happy because when you get old you might not have the option " jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney wsj com
