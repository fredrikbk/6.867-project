weekend journal tastings hidden in the aisle of whites a taste of savennieres a loire valley white with a sense of place when the weather turns hot sticky and uncomfortable the white wines of the loire valley of france take center stage sancerre muscadet vouvray these are the wines many of us turn to for easy drinkability kinship with summer foods and good value as youre shopping or dining over the next couple of months though wed urge you to remember that the loire also includes a whole bunch of less familiar names from menetou salon to quincy that are worth keeping in the back of your mind in case you see them on a shelf or a wine list they tend to be tasty wines that also hold interest because their fruit tastes are restrained enough to let a sense of place such as the minerals of the earth shine through one name wed especially urge you to remember savennieres we arent foolish enough to walk into any store or restaurant expecting to see a savennieres pronounced sah ven yare not very much is produced just cases in according to the loire valley wine bureau but a savennieres on the shelf or list is often a sign of a store or restaurant that really knows what its doing and it can often be a great deal because its not widely known consider this at the california grill at disney world there are two wine lists one handed to everyone includes dozens of wines available both by the bottle and the glass the second list which diners generally need to ask for is the reserve list and includes rare special and often very expensive wines when we looked at the reserve list on our most recent trip john glanced at the prices and immediately went into sticker shock and closed the book dottie however took a closer look and said "look at this " we have written before that at many restaurants one of the best buys is the least expensive bottle on the wine list the worst buy is often the second least expensive because restaurants know that many people dont want to appear cheap by choosing the lowest priced wine and therefore order the second lowest in this case the least expensive wine on the big list and one of the few wines under &# was a savennieres from baumard a well known producer it was &# a relative bargain and certainly the perfect wine to have while we watched a thunderstorm move in over the magic kingdom on a very hot day when the waiter brought the bottle he apologized that they no longer had the and asked if the was ok we receive letters all the time from readers who ask what to do when the vintage of the wine doesnt match the wine list it seems so obvious that the waiter should simply do what ours did point out the difference and ask if thats acceptable which it was on a similar note when we dined at the flying fish cafe in disney world as soon as the waiter handed us the wine list he explained that diners can take home unfinished bottles from restaurants in florida this is now the law in most states and it makes so much sense for everyone but this is the first time a waiter anywhere has mentioned it to us we hope that more waiters and sommeliers will do this dottie had indeed discovered a winner the savennieres was the single best wine we tasted during our entire vacation with focused tastes of apples and minerals and the kind of acidity that made every bite of food better as soon as we returned home we decided to see if there were enough savennieres out there for a tasting savennieres is made from the chenin blanc grape which has developed a disagreeable reputation over the years because of all the awful jug wines called chenin blanc in the u s in fact chenin blanc is a noble grape capable of making some great and long lived dry and sweet wines weve recommended some from the u s and france over the years and its a specialty of south africa where it was traditionally known as steen we found enough savennieres in missouri new york and washington d c for a small blind tasting because these can age beautifully we bought every vintage we saw and ultimately found them going back to while a few names appear to be most common including joly baumard and domaine du closel we found quite a few others we tasted them in blind flights over several nights we were charmed savennieres doesnt taste quite like anything else and if like most of us youve become accustomed to drinking chardonnay and sauvignon blanc your taste buds are in for a tasty surprise from the first sniff to the long finish the single most notable characteristic is minerals giving the wine complexity and a sense of place the wines offered all sorts of tastes nuts lemon lychee peach white pepper but the single fruit taste they pretty much all had in common was apple sometimes just off the tree juicy red delicious apples or tangy crisp granny smith apples sometimes spiced apples the yellow gold color became darker with age and the wines became richer and somewhat more challenging while savennieres is known to age well for decades weve always preferred it either at around five years old or quite old we had an outstanding still fresh at a restaurant recently and we found that again in this tasting but talking too much about fruit flavors obscures something that makes these wines different at a time when so many wines seem to be all fruit and forward tastes these are earthier bone dry wines where hints of slate from gravelly soil provide a weighty underpinning on which the restrained tastes of fruit rest our best of tasting turned out to be a wine that was by far the most expensive yes we hate it when that happens too a celebrated wine from nicolas joly from a special area of savennieres called coulee de serrant it was a wine of great stature and awesome complexity imagine a wine that seems both crisp and rich at the same time that became more and more interesting as the night wore on the importer vintus llc of pleasantville n y says the winery makes about to cases a year of which about cases are imported into the u s and distributed in about states as weve often written there are more good wine stores around these days than ever before sometime very soon drop into one of them and ask to be shown to the aisle of loire whites if the store offers only sancerre muscadet and vouvray get one anyway because you really cant miss but if they have any other loire whites ideally one youve never tried before pick it up if its savennieres great if not just remember that name sometime in the future you will see it and when you do grab it you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones savennieres index in a blind tasting of savennieres from the loire valley of france with vintages back to these were our favorites savennieres can be hard to find but we have focused on it as an example of the lesser known whites
