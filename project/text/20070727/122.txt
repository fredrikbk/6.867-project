wiretap debacle the u s homeland hasnt been struck by terrorists since september and one reason may be more aggressive intelligence policies so americans should be alarmed that one of the best intelligence tools warrantless wiretapping of al qaeda suspects has recently become far less effective and is in danger of being neutered by congressional democrats president bush approved this terrorist surveillance not long after allowing intelligence officials to track terrorist calls overseas as well as overseas communications with al qaeda sympathizers operating in the u s the new york times exposed the program in late and democrats and antiwar activists immediately denounced it as an "illegal" attempt to spy on americans a la j edgar hoover democratic leaders were briefed on the program from the first and never once tried to shut it down but once it was exposed these same democrats accused mr bush of breaking the law by not getting warrants from the special court created under the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa of mr bush has rightly defended the programs legality but as a gesture of compromise in january he agreed to seek warrants under the fisa process this has turned out to be an enormous mistake that has unilaterally disarmed one of our best intelligence weapons in the war on terror to understand why keep in mind that we live in a world of fiber optics and packet switching a wiretap today doesnt mean the fbi must install a bug on abdul terrorists phone in peshawar information now follows the path of least resistance wherever that may lead and because the u s has among the worlds most efficient networks hundreds of millions of foreign calls are routed through the u s thats right if an al qaeda operative in quetta calls a fellow jihadi in peshawar that call may well travel through a u s network this ought to be a big u s advantage in our "asymmetrical" conflict with terrorists but it also means that for the purposes of fisa a foreign call that is routed through u s networks becomes a domestic call so thanks to the obligation to abide by an outdated fisa statute u s intelligence is now struggling even to tap the communications of foreign based terrorists if this makes you furious it gets worse our understanding is that some fisa judges have been open to expediting warrants as well as granting retroactive approval but there are judges in the fisa rotation and some of them have been demanding that intelligence officials get permission in advance for wiretaps this means missed opportunities and less effective intelligence and it shows once again why the decisions of unaccountable judges shouldnt be allowed to supplant those of an elected commander in chief when the program began certain u s telecom companies also cooperated with the national security agency but they were sued once the program was exposed and so some have ceased cooperating for fear of damaging liability claims we found all of this hard to believe when we first heard it but weve since confirmed the details with other high level sources director of national intelligence michael mcconnell more or less admitted the problem last week albeit obliquely when he told the senate that "were actually missing a significant portion of what we should be getting " thats understating things our sources say the surveillance program is now at most one third as effective as it once was the bush administration bears much of the blame for this debacle white house officials hoped that by agreeing to put the wiretaps under fisa authority they could lower the political temperature and reach an accommodation with congress but no administration has ever conceded that fisa trumps a presidents constitutional power to place wiretaps in the name of national security the courts have also explicitly upheld this presidential power mr bush was making a needless concession that democrats have used against him as they refuse to compromise the administration wants congress to modernize fisa in two crucial ways first by allowing nsa to track on a real time basis these foreign calls that may be routed through the u s and in some cases allowing warrants to be sought after the fact our spooks would still be accountable but theyd also be able to act quickly to defend the country second the white house is requesting liability protection for telecom companies that cooperate with the wiretap program neither of these changes should be at all controversial and were confident theyd have overwhelming public support if the issues were understood yet for six months senate democrats have resisted these legal changes to make americans safer incredibly they are fronting for their trial lawyer campaign donors in blocking liability protection their counteroffer is to have the federal government supplant the companies as the defendants in any wiretapping lawsuits as if any such lawsuits were justified why are democrats letting trial lawyers interfere with a vital intelligence operation meanwhile senate judiciary chairman patrick leahy is holding any wiretap legislation hostage to his demand for administration documents related to the program this is part of the democrats political exercise to claim that mr bush has somehow broken the law by allowing the wiretaps backed by grandstanding republican arlen specter in short mr leahy is more interested in fighting over how the program began than in allowing it to continue today at least a few democrats realize they may be setting themselves up for trouble if theres another terrorist attack house intelligence chairman silvestre reyes wrote to mr bush last week saying he was "very concerned" about the program and urging the administration to "devote all the resources necessary to ensure that we are conducting maximum surveillance of the terrorist target abroad " mr reyes went on to note that "fisa does not require a warrant for communications between two individuals outside the united states if clarifications to the law are necessary we are prepared to deal with this " thatll serve mr reyes well as political cover if the next commission asks who ruined the terrorist surveillance program but if hes serious about national security he should send his next letter to senate democrats six months is too long for mr bush to cater to pat leahy while americans are put at risk the president should announce immediately that he is rescinding his concession to put these foreign wiretaps under the fisa court he should say he is doing so as an urgent matter of national security as commander in chief because congress has refused to respond in good faith by modernizing the law to let the u s eavesdrop on terrorists who wish us deadly harm then let democrats explain why theyre willing to put partisanship above the safety of america see related letter "letters to the editor calling out alarmists" wsj aug
