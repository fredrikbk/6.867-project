avid boarders bypass branded gear the &# blank decks work just fine a marketing challenge for industry sixteen year old matt hiemstra should be the &# billion a year skateboard industrys ideal customer during the summer he skateboards daily and between the end of one school year and the beginning of the next he breaks about eight boards doing jumps and other tricks he also knows all about skateboards including the names of the leading brands and the pros who endorse them but none of that knowledge really influences what he buys "when it comes down to it a skateboard is a skateboard " says mr hiemstra who placed second and third at local competitions last year at kuehn skate park in sioux falls s d "it doesnt matter that it has fancy stuff when you go through so many in a summer its too costly to buy expensive new ones " some million teenagers skateboard more than play baseball in the u s today estimates american sports data a research firm based in cortland manor n y but mr hiemstra and other skateboarders like him present an interesting marketing challenge they are the industrys prime customers both devoted to the sport and savvy and when they started out most of them invested in premium boards and other branded gear but as they got more serious about boarding many decided they just didnt care whether they used the industrys top products including the pro skateboard "decks" with graphics and branding that can cost between &# and &# without the wheels and the axles known as "trucks " in more mainstream sports like baseball basketball and soccer young athletes tend to respond to marketing by nike inc adidas ag and under armour inc paying top dollar for gloves balls shoes and other gear endorsed by their favorite stars but many boarders think its just fine to buy "blank decks " the plain seven ply wood boards that cost only &# to &# often come from overseas and are being sold by big discounters on ebay and at some skateboard specialty shops mike may a spokesman for the sporting goods manufacturers association in washington d c agrees that skateboarders can be a tough sell "i think skateboarding is sort of in a class by itself in that respect " he says "there are some free spirits and independent thinkers in the skateboarding industry " serious skateboarders also have big expenses on average those who execute tricky jumps spins and slides break their boards once a month "for a young kid every couple dollars count " says issa sawabini a partner in fuse a vermont based youth sports marketing company element zoo york santa cruz flip and other top skateboard brands have been hiring the best of the estimated professional and semiprofessional skateboarders to ride their boards and wear their brand named clothes in competition videos and ads many skateboard enthusiasts also admire top pros like ryan sheckler tony hawk and rob dyrdeck for their ability to invent new tricks and for their celebrity lifestyles and clothing and equipment sponsorships but mr hiemstra who pays for his gear by bagging groceries at a local grocery store for &# an hour isnt buying he wont settle for what he considers to be lesser quality boards sold at discounters like wal mart or at toy stores but he does sometimes bid for batches of closeout boards on ebay and he trolls the four skateboard shops around sioux falls for sales closeouts and other deals "word travels around the skate park about what various shops have in stock " he says noting that he recently picked up two half priced complete crown boards from scheels all sports in sioux falls for &# each instead of the usual &# apiece the international association of skateboard companies figures to of all the skateboard decks sold are blank rather than branded "the problem is the blank boards dont really contribute to the industry they dont buy advertisements in skateboard magazines they dont support professional riders " says john bernards executive director of the international association of skateboard companies based in santa margarita calif mr bernardss group recently published an advertising supplement in skateboarding magazines called "under fire " featuring interviews with pros brand owners and distributors to try to persuade young people to stop buying blank decks as a matter of principle one author called blank decks "bland unwarranted commodities that support faceless factories that do nothing to support professional skateboarding " but the effort backfired "we got hate mail saying that we are trying to commercialize skateboarding " says mr bernards whose group has now backed away from bad mouthing blank decks instead the large skateboard brands have begun adding new technology such as special footplates air pockets and layers of hemp fabric kevlar or fiberglass to absorb shock the habitat brand skateboard deck has bamboo on the top to strengthen it nhs inc a santa cruz calif company that owns several leading skateboard brands has doubled its research and development budget to &# using cameras to film skateboards mounted on special board breaking machines nhs discovered that the top rather than the bottom is what usually breaks prompting the company to add a special kevlar layer "sales are rising for that model " says nhss president bob denike he is also looking at boards made by mixing fiberglass materials with wood and wood laminates he argues that the industry is to blame for losing customers to cheap decks "we dont keep the product changing and moving forward " he says "when you have a year run of no innovation you leave the door wide open for an issue like this " the nations largest sporting goods store pittsburgh based dicks sporting goods inc sells skateboards at some of its stores and some of them are cheaper decks or blank decks "we sell them because thats what our customers want " says jeff hennion senior vice president and chief marketing officer "if we arent providing the assortment the customers are looking for they are going to go find it somewhere else " fortunately for the industry newer skateboarders whose approach to the sport is more recreational than competitive tend to appreciate branded gear more jack lecci has been skateboarding for nearly three years with his friends in pittsburgh with few skate parks nearby they ride their boards in parking garages near strip malls so far he has broken only one board a premium model by element coming off a set of stairs "i fell right in the middle and it just completely snapped " he says while the equipment failure was a mark of honor for jack it was also a breaking point for his mother mary ann who had bought the element board for him for christmas she made him buy his replacement board he chose a &# one from mystery skateboards on his own "i bought him one that was it i wont buy him another one " she says "if he wants to go get a job thats up to him " jack is thinking of working as a golf caddy so that hell be able to pay for gear he also says he plans to keep buying pro boards but he notes if he gets better at tricks and starts breaking a board a month he might change his mind and start buying blank decks
