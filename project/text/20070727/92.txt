youve been on the beat a while it feels as if youve heard at least one negative thing said about every coach in america and yet i have never heard a bad word uttered about skip prosser not one " espn coms andy katz had spoken with mr prosser the day before he died he tells of that conversation and how word of mr prossers death stunned his fellow college coaches alex rodriguezs next home run will

the top of the eighth with the yankees up the suspended game will be resumed tonight with a rod on deck if he hits a home run it will count as having been hit on june meaning it will become his rd dinger and home run no struck wednesday in kansas city will retroactively become no in the new york times alan schwarz has fun with "a scene more m c escher than norman rockwell " then finds a suspended game postscript involving none other than barry bonds bondss statistical first major league hit was his chronological st and is credited to a game at wrigley field that took place at least statistically on a day when bonds was a member of the triple a hawaii islanders a rod gives some of the credit for his monster season the man already has rbis to yankees hitting coach kevin long a former minor league outfielder for the royals in the kansas city star sam mellinger ponders that "isnt this weird a guy the royals drafted employed for years and passed over as big league hitting coach is now with the yankees credited for making rodriguez even better how did we get here " the philadelphia phillies suffered a blow to their playoff hopes yesterday when all star second baseman chase utley was hit by a fastball from a washington nationals pitcher making his big league debut the errant pitch fractured a bone in mr utleys ring finger hes expected to miss at least three weeks and might be gone for the season mr utleys sense of humor at least was intact asked about the worst case scenario for the injury he said "the hand will fall off " "whos john lannan " writes jim salisbury in the philadelphia inquirer "thats the question phillies fans were asking themselves when they arrived at the ballpark oh that john lannan thats what they were growling after hearing that chase utley had become the latest phillie to go down with a significant injury " the sports world is still stunned by the death of mike coolbaugh the tulsa drillers coach killed by a line drive on sunday in the chicago tribune rick morrissey looks at another worry the fans sitting near the dugout those fans he writes "are also in harms way and many of them are oblivious to it if you would like to witness something truly frightening i would suggest sitting behind a major league dugout and taking peeks between pitches to see how many people are paying absolutely no attention to the batter you would see parents tending to babies kids under the age of goofing around and vendors with their backs to the plate while they are selling beer insanity all of it larry pittmans story might knock some sense into people " mr pittmans story is indeed frightening so too is his final thought for mr morrissey "ill look over to where my seats used to be and either its young folks who are texting on their cell phones or its parents with young children and the kids are just running up the aisles something bad is going to happen something real bad is going to happen and i dont mean at springfield i just mean in general its just a matter of time " tim marchman the new york suns superb baseball writer considered cal ripken jr yesterday today he turns his attention to tony gwynn wholl enter the hall of fame alongside ripken this weekend mr marchman begins with the " " gwynn had embossed on his cleats a reference to the hole between shortstop and third base where so many of his hits went "this is charming and also perfectly reflects what kind of player gwynn was " he writes "if you think about his strategy it doesnt make all that much sense for a left handed hitter to consciously go to the plate trying to put the ball on the ground through the left side of the infield he has to be perfectly confident in his ability not only to go with the outside pitch but to place it exactly where he wants it the problem is that you cant wait for the outside pitch aside from its inherent difficulty gwynns approach presented other problems for instance when a defense knows that a player is going to try and hit the ball a certain way they can shade in that direction set into motion or even stack the infield that way with a straight shift gwynn always had to be alert to this possibility and so had to have total confidence in his ability to pull the ball from either side of the plate against certain defensive alignments theres also the fact that when your approach is so consistent that you emblazon it on your shoes pitchers are going to be aware of it and not give you the sort of pitch you like to hit " when gwynn and ripken are inducted bob feller will be there in usa today mel antonen catches up with the cleveland indians hall of famer at his ohio farm and finds the year old as strong and opinionated as ever and still with an eye for detail "feller also still attends games primarily at jacobs field " mr antonen writes "he gets there in time to eat in the media room and then sits in the top row of the press box reading newspapers as he watches the game sometimes he signs postcard size pictures of his statue outside jacobs field always in blue ink blue is the american league color black is the national league feller says feller says he appreciates the statue which shows him pitching although he did ask for a couple of refinements while it was being fashioned he wanted his grip on the ball changed from that for a two seam fastball to that for a four seamer i always threw a four seamer he says and he asked that the snuff can be removed from his pocket i never used that stuff he says " last weekend alan webb broke steve scotts year old american record for
