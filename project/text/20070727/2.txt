a moving story of honesty and courage thanks for the great article "the days and nights of elizabeth edwards" page one july what a great inspiration to read about a woman facing a terrible outcome and yet she continues to live her life to the fullest shes trying to balance supporting her husband raising her kids and at the same time preparing for the probable outcome in the best possible way im not even into politics but your story somehow touched me my problems pale by comparison don gibson woodland hills calif as a breast cancer survivor i read this article with interest however when i came to the following statement "behind the scenes campaign staffers were thrilled at the surge in interest and mrs edwardss high likeability but worried that too much exposure could cause a backlash " i thought "did i read this correctly " as i re read the paragraph i was appalled by this heartless comment i realize that campaign staffers motives embrace making their candidate stand out positively from the pack but this comment was extremely distasteful in an otherwise poignant article mary jane henderson irvington ky mrs edwards is a bright sensitive beautiful and dedicated woman i would think john edwards would want to spend with her and their children whatever time god allows them that he has chosen instead to continue his run for the presidency says to me that there is no way a normal man could give to the toughest job in the world when his wife and children need him desperately a need that will surely come charles r smith san jose calif thank you for this very moving story of honesty and courage that mrs edwards faces every day she is indeed a lady full of grace love and so much more i could never be that brave jackie rote ankeny iowa
