weekend journal taste houses of worship the mother of all churches last month pope benedict xvi addressed what he called "the delicate situation" in the middle east he told a vatican meeting of the aid agencies for the oriental churches that "peace much awaited and implored is unfortunately greatly offended " although the popes words were meant to refer to strife in iraq and israel they also may be taken to describe the delicate oft broken peace in christianitys own holiest site in the region ever since it was built by the byzantine emperor constantine in on the hill of golgotha where his mother helena claimed to have found the remains of the true cross the church of the holy sepulcher in jerusalems old city has enjoyed little peace the historian eusebius records that the original structure "an extraordinary work " was crowned by a roof "overlaid throughout with radiant gold " but constantines marvel was razed by the persians in reconstructed and then destroyed again by caliph hakim of egypt in rebuilt by crusaders in the th and th centuries the building evolved into the motley collection of shrines chapels and grottos that greet and sometimes disappoint the visitor today the critic edmund wilson said it "probably contains more bad taste certainly more kinds of bad taste than any other church in the world " the architectural mishmash reflects the overlapping theological resonances of the spots contained under one roof as amos elon notes in his book "jerusalem city of mirrors " the church marks the site of "christs alleged prison adams tomb the pillar of flagellation to which jesus was bound mount calvary the latin name for the hill where jesus was crucified the stone of unction where his body was washed in preparation for burial christs sepulcher and the center of the earth as well as the site of the resurrected christs meeting with mary magdalene " no wonder pope john paul ii called it "the mother of all churches " in a deeper sense however the stylistic dissonance embodies the rivalry that in jerusalem not only partitions one faith from another but also prevents a faith from mending its internal fissures in after greek orthodox clergy violently wrested majority control of the church from the roman catholics the ottoman rulers of jerusalem decreed a status quo for the citys holy sites for the church of the holy sepulcher this meant that control was split primarily among the three patriarchates of jerusalem the latin the greek and the armenian and secondarily among the churches of egypt coptic syria and ethiopia the arrangement formalized in has been enforced by the british jordanians and today israel but this has not created harmony back in mark twain visited and noticed the denominations chanting sometimes simultaneously in their own languages "it has been proven conclusively that they can not worship together around the grave of the saviour of the world in peace " and the cease fires fragility persists to this day five years ago ethiopians exiled since to quarters on the roof resented the placement of a coptic priests chair there and the ensuing brawl sent monks seven ethiopians and four copts to the hospital a couple of years later greek clerics tussled with franciscans the turf wars also paralyze maintenance a wooden ladder has rested on a ledge over the churchs entrance for at least years the edicule braced with scaffolding is falling apart the chapel of st nicodemus over which both the armenians and the syrians claim ownership has for that reason never been restored to prevent denominational disputes the very keys to the church have since the days of saladin been entrusted to muslims from the nuseibeh and joudeh families recently father athanasius macora negotiator on holy sepulcher issues for the franciscan custody of the holy land which represents roman catholics in israel showed me several large color coded maps signed and sealed by the heads of the three patriarchates which detailed even which sewage lines belong to which rite even the repair of a pipe requires ecumenical negotiation the drawings resembled nothing so much as the intricate jumble of lines that one sees on jerusalems political maps these days seeing them one is tempted to dismiss the church of the holy sepulcher as a stage for the absurd and the mundane and to scoff at the way like the city at whose heart it stands it suffers a discordance of religious impulses vying for supremacy but one also wants to yield to a fascination with a space that like jerusalem finally reveals itself as a sort of palimpsest a tangle of inscription upon erasure upon inscription mr balint is a writer based at the van leer institute in jerusalem
