the beltway credit market its been a bloody week so far for financial markets as a credit scare and rising oil prices have battered investor confidence would it be too much to ask washington to heed the warning and swear off its bearish policies stocks have been trading at their highs for the year so this weeks blowoff could be merely a pause or a harbinger credit spreads are widening as lenders grow more cautious but so far only to what can be called more normal levels of risk assessment the narrow spreads of earlier this year were unsustainable and in any case were pushing some deals far out on the risk curve a little more rational pricing is healthy with the dollar weak oil at &# a barrel and gold near &# an ounce the federal reserve hardly looks tight enough to ignite a credit crunch these columns have argued that the fed has been too easy for too long corporate profits also continue to come in strong another source of liquidity thats the pause story more worrisome is the beltway story which is all pointing in the direction of hostility to growth a bipartisan cast of senators wants to raise taxes on "carried interest " which means on hedge funds and private equity partnerships with this new element of political risk no one should be surprised to see buyout deals such as the cerberus purchase of chrysler harder to finance if congress wants to dry up capital for mergers keep it up meantime congressman lloyd doggett d texas has introduced a &# billion hike on foreign investment into the u s the proposal is aimed at u s subsidiaries of companies based abroad and amounts to a tax on capital invested to create jobs in america his proposal came out of the blue this week and as we write was scheduled for a vote as part of the house farm bill foreign investors would have another reason to put their capital somewhere else these tax hikes may be a prelude to the big tax increase democrats are promising if they win the white house in taxes on marginal income tax rates dividend and capital gains rates are all headed up this would reduce the after tax return on capital which in turn would hit stock prices meanwhile the free trade agenda is moribund trade promotion authority expired at the end of june and pacts already signed with peru colombia and south korea are in jeopardy anti china protectionism is building especially with housing values still declining the level of personal liquidity will be vital to sustaining growth congress and regulators havent helped housing values by imposing new much tougher lending restrictions as usual long after the worst mistakes were made that is helping to turn the subprime debacle into a larger credit anxiety pinch congress will only add to this worry if members keep pushing for tax increases at a time of market volatility and nervous investors it doesnt take much to trigger a larger financial panic we recall when a tax increase out of house ways and means and a u s germany currency scrap triggered black monday the global economy is now in its fifth year of a remarkable spurt of growth washington should help to keep it going not turn a case of credit jitters into a rout
