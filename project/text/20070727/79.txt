another permanent security council member appear increasingly leery of supporting sanctions that would strike at companies more central to irans economy or banking system chinas controversial shipments to iran which coincide with a furor over defective chinese exports to the u s also raise questions about beijings ability to control the transfer of potential weapons materials to countries under international scrutiny the u s has long accused china of supplying nuclear technology to countries such as north korea pakistan iran and libya in recent years though beijing has joined international nonproliferation agreements and imposed tougher rules on exports "this is no longer a government policy problem " said joseph cirincione an arms control expert at the liberal center for american progress "it is a matter of china actually implementing the export controls it now has in place it is a problem that many countries have " in a classified incident this year u s intelligence agencies tipped off authorities in singapore about a container that was transiting through its port from china en route to iran inside the container singaporean customs agents found large quantities

increasingly freewheeling chinese companies that trade in materials related to weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems " bush administration officials said the u s is also monitoring shipments to iran from companies in other countries including germany and italy they said washington could move to impose u s sanctions on some of the companies in coming months
