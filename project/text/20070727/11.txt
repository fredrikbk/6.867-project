bancroft cousins letter paying the price for our passivity online edition the debate within the bancroft family over whether to sell dow jones &amp co to rupert murdoch is entering its final stages thursday night one of the members of the bancroft family crawford hill wrote this nearly word letter to his fellow family members spelling out in candid detail why they should accept the offer he says the &# a share offer is "a tremendous business deal for dj shareholders" and also notes that the bancrofts have been uninvolved in the business for decades "we are actually now paying the price for our passivity over the past years " he says here is the full text of the letter dear family folks this is attached for your convenience as you may wish to print it out in an easier to read format i ask you to read this long note because i am coming at this family issue from an entirely different perspective and offer some background that should you indulge me i think will give you pause i am not going to throw numbers at you i just ask you to think like a biologist for a while huh read on please if nothing else there is some interesting family history herein oh yeah it is also the least you can do since i patiently listened to many of you for the entire six hours on my little spanish cell phone and as those closest to me know i am actually quite an emotional guy and let me say this you are all fine humans and we have nothing to be ashamed of about how we have looked in press or any of that nonsense we are an amazing group of people who have lives that extend way beyond our ownership of dow jones lets keep smiling through all of this we are all lucky folks but lets be as smart as is possible at this time with all due respect it is time for a reality check what is missing from this discussion about dow jones and the bancrofts is a sense of historical perspective and evolution there is a lot of family mythology and outright distortion going on that needs to be set straight particularly about our "legacy " i am an evolutionary biologist by training how does that apply it means that fundamentally i look at events from an evolutionary perspective which is to ask "how have things changed over time " in this case we are talking about family a business management a board and not insignificantly the business climate and how the interrelationships amongst these have evolved i loved and admired jessie b cox and possibly knew her better than anyone else in my generation and more so than many in previous generations for example when i was gramps was home sick and as jbc was always traveling to the olympics and precursor events she still wanted to go to the pan american games in winnipeg canada she asked me to go in his stead which of course i was thrilled to do and so spent a lot of time with her over the course of the two weeks of this mini olympics it was a sports lovers dream and many of the athletes that were to become world famous at the following years historic mexico city olympics in were there gay as we called her was so proud and delighted that i could identify lots of the athletes by name and could tell her something about many of them whether it was future celtics star jo jo white from kansas or up and coming swimmer mark spitz or track star tommy smith from san jose state he of the infamous "black power" salute during his meter dash gold medal ceremony national anthem in mexico city "uncle pit " she would say to whitney stone chair of the u s equestrian team and her dear friend "you simply must sit next to bumpy today so he can tell you all about the swimmers " we had a blast for days i spent a good amount of time at the oaks during college summers and thereafter and suzie and i spent lovely spring breaks with her down in sarasota before she passed away aunt jane graciously invited us down the following three spring breaks and we had wonderful times with gays sister then furthermore it was i who jumped into the back seat of the limo that we grabbed to rush gay to lenox hill hospital after her renowned collapse at the family dinner at "" manhattans club in april of in that back seat next to uncle bill i attempted cpr on her but sadly it was too late and she had taken her last breath so i knew gay well what most of you do not know however is that the very same jessie b cox that is mentioned at every turn as "family matriarch" and to whom many of us owe "the legacy" forced her incredibly talented husband william c cox top student at milton and harvard luminary to retire prematurely from dow jones at age so he could be full time in the social swirl of cohasset he was a star at the company my firstborn child hadley has that "c " in her name coburn to honor the talented and caring bill cox gramps to his grandchildren as to promoting legacy neither gay nor her daughter jane my mom ever spoke of the legacy of dow jones much less the possibility of actually working there or what it meant to be a steward of the business there was no effort at promoting legacy or educating the next generation whatsoever when i arrived at the oaks june of for a visit after having graduated from the university of pennsylvania and worked for a year on alzheimers research at the med school there gay asked me what i was up to and i replied that i had just accepted an offer to teach biology at the episcopal academy in philadelphia i was very excited at this prospect her response remarkably was "i am so disappointed that you are not going to work for dow jones " she had never ever uttered a word about dj to me in any way shape or form and in the context of a job had never discussed with me anything other than my love for biology which she shared we talked about everything under the sun but never dow jones again much less why one would want to work there or learn about business strategy or how to make sure the business flourished into the future we never had by the way conversations that sulzbergers grahams and yes murdochs had every day her response was astonishing to me and i felt for the first time a powerful disconnect between being an owner in name only and being an active engaged and questioning owner her response revealed so much that was completely taken for granted about our familys relationship with dj and what a responsible owner needs to attend to such things can never be taken for granted they must be actively nurtured cultivated questioned tested and honed that has not happened in our family in any meaningful way and while some of you may have had very different experiences although i am certainly not aware of those there has absolutely never existed any kind of family wide cross branch culture of teaching what it means to be an active engaged owner and more crucially a family director after all it is the family directors who can best pass on the familys concerns to the board and management first you have to have a culture in which one can dare to ask the right questions and then you have to have family directors who are attuned to these concerns and dare to present them to the board and then work as a team to make appropriate things happen those processes have never effectively materialized in our family ownership structure my personal anecdote is just symbolic of the fact that so much has been assumed and taken for granted about what it means to be a responsible owner and family director until very very recently that approach can be summarized as "do not question management" and "they have a good plan" and "these things take time " chris bancroft in a recent email said the following "we have been given a responsibility we never had before decide the fate of a business that has lasted over years and is considered the best in the world " actually chris we have had that responsibility all along there is nothing new about having to be responsible active and engaged owners we despite the attempts of a few have not until very very recently acted as successful owners do we are actually now paying the price for our passivity over the past years this is not something that happened overnight and in the context of history and circumstances it is very understandable if sad that the company that we own is now in the position that it is in we have as buffett himself pointed out not acted like we owned the company well we had no legacy as to what in fact that meant and in the absence of that legacy it certainly did not evolve independently by those in a position to make that happen this is what we are dealing with here our real legacy was an inherited lack of awareness as to what it takes to nurture and pass on an effective legacy about what is really required to be responsible engaged and active owners of a family business but we got away with this for a long time as it turns out the four crucial variables to be spelled out below were in congruence up until jbcs death and for a time thereafter when dow jones was routinely heralded as one of the five most admired businesses of any type in america consequently the family was not yet paying a price for not understanding what it means to be responsible engaged and active owners of a family business so the familys passive role in not questioning management did not matter since everything else was clicking together until the mid s then things changed what then are the four crucial variables i mentioned above  the performance of the business of dow jones as a function of management decisions and board leadership  the quality of the product notably the wall street journal up through mid s  the business climate  the role of the family as owners and as directors ideally these four variables are in synch but success does not always demand that all four are in harmony or congruent because the first three variables were so congruent and creating success for most of the century as the family became progressively removed from day to day management and senior leadership to the point where in recent years no one has worked at dj much less in senior management and family board members were passively buying into management it did not really matter that the family did not question anything things were working just stay out of the way was an approach we were able to get away with in those heady times unfortunately it became the real legacy we were burdened with as we approached the business climate turmoil which was yet to come and which we as family owners were singularly unprepared to handle the family ownership structure was not able to evolve to handle the changing demands soon to be placed on it as we move into the mid and late s and early s the business climate changes and then serious very serious missteps were being taken by dj management telerate missed opportunities to purchase comcast and many many others this has all been chronicled extensively talk to business people in the outside world for their take on the kann era in most of their words "a failure " when warren buffett proclaims as he did recently to charlie rose "they blew it " referring to the bancrofts lack of assertive questioning ownership over the past years you had best listen remember however that we had never had to be assertive active questioning owners because up until the mid s the other three variables had been working together so well that the owners passive role did not matter in fact it may have ironically been a great thing then however as we say in biology the environmental selection pressures changed who else to question weak management but the board and the owners the board certainly did not of course and there was no family legacy none whatsoever at least not during most of our lifetimes of challenging either the board or management much less getting together as a family and raising serious questions in fact as we moved into the s to attempt to raise serious questions about management strategy the families role as owners as anything other than strong supporters of management and to question the role of family directors was to be branded a dissident admittedly out of frustration that this was the case my friends billy and lizzie cousin william cox iii and second cousin elisabeth chelberg were not discreet in their handling of the situation publicly they were cast as traitors yet through the lens of history were the questions that they first attempted to raise within the family wrongheaded or inappropriate absolutely not it is a shame that we as an entire family could not have accepted at that time that we needed to start asking the board and management serious questions unfortunately the family directors had never done that and were when we needed it most when we needed to act as buffett might have or a graham or a sulzberger not about to start this is understandable given the lack of family legacy of asking the right questions at the right time there was no model for it and those in the positions that mattered did not figure this out that is understandable but nonetheless it set the stage for where the business is today and why we are in the current situation move in time back to when i had this idea that getting to know one another outside the context of the annual meeting weddings and funerals might actually help us as a family which in turn could only facilitate our ability to work and communicate with one another and ultimately perhaps lead to us becoming better owners of a family business suzie and i hosted this historic event at our home at the time on hilton head island many of you were there that year and then the next for two wonderful unprecedented bancroft family social gatherings thereafter billy cox iii and then buzzy and jeannie second cousin once removed jean stevenson daughter of jane bancroft cook and her husband bayne graciously picked up the ball and we also did a trip to mohonk mountain in new york these were strong efforts to promote family dialogue however this did not translate into a family wide acceptance of questioning debate tolerance of disagreement and strategic thinking in short the kinds of things that successful family owners have ultimately always had to figure out as we move into mid s well into the peter kann era i stood up at a pre "" family meeting in nyc and suggested that it was to use an analogy entirely appropriate as the owner of a football team to question the coachs strategy his success and his prospects in a changing competitive business it would be counterproductive to micromanage but it would be smart ownership and indeed the owners main function to when necessary find a new coach it was time i thought given the changing newspaper business and the emerging digital world to take a serious look at peter kanns now well documented weak performance unlike my friends billy and lizzie i did not do this publicly only in front of family nonetheless my remarks received a chilly reception from most but not all for raising this most fundamental question i thought i was acting like any responsible owner should really questioning what the coach was doing but this was deemed unacceptable by most in the family and was seen as heretical by more than a few by the way it is also so telling that now so many of you have revealed going back quite a long way that you had serious concerns about the business skills of peter kann but thought he was and still is a fine guy which he is peter once cooked me a dinner all by himself at his home in princeton while we watched karen on the mclaughlin group on tv and she arrived later after the taping to join us the reason these split feelings about peter are significant is they underscore how impotent or unwilling we were as a family do anything about peter despite the obvious problems the emotion involved prevented us from making the prudent business decision does that sound familiar despite the widespread perception in the family that here was a problem we had not evolved a process for handling this situation rationally i hope we can learn from that emotion can cloud good business judgment as we moved on i remember asking at various family fora if it was not possible for us to engage in some productive long term strategic conversations about the very entity that we owned i and the few others who raised this point were repeatedly told that everything was confidential we couldnt really have such conversations i pointed out that george strawbridge a family director of campbells soup had said when i asked him about this confidentiality issue "that is nonsense you need as a family to act as owners everyone who wants to participate is made an insider and signs an nda non disclosure agreement much as we did with the murdoch offer this spring and you can be involved in appropriate long term strategic conversations " this fell on deaf ears up until the past few months there has never existed a family culture of questioning management family directors have not gone out of their way to promote this basic concept in fact we were always told by them that we need to support management these things take time and we cant really talk about anything important i always wondered what the point of owning something was if you could not even seriously question those who had been hired in essence by you to run your business how screwy is that well that gets back to buffett who also said that had things been run differently we might own a &# billion business today not a &# billion or even &# billion business even the way the process has evolved since the deal arose has been revealing we had no teamwork amongst the family directors all were doing their own thing well there has never been any real teamwork there this ultimately led nowhere there was no strategy to her credit lisa elizabeth steele a board member and second cousin once removed daughter of jane bancroft cook began to look at the facts of the situation and after a difficult process she and her closest relatives recognized that neither the business of dj nor the family would prosper were things to revert to the status quo the murdoch deal actually began to look good for the company right after our annual family dinner in nyc this april sparsely attended i mentioned how underwhelming the talks by our guests ceo rich zannino and board chairman peter mcpherson had been a family director replied to me that i needed to give them time they had a good plan then this same director told me after the murdoch offer was announced that rich should be fired now this same director is quoting richs remarks about the company plan as a reason to spurn the murdoch offer of course i am talking of my sister leslie who has been working really hard to come up with alternatives unfortunately when you look at the facts as epitomized by managements position and the board itself there are no better alternatives despite herculean effort by les the fact is that there are no better alternatives out there now and murdoch like it or not has what it takes to help the business flourish he will not have naked bodies in the wsj he is not a moron i am not going to go into the various numbers all the experts have made the point this is a tremendous business deal for dj shareholders and will take the business into the next successful phase in a manner not possible if dj remains independent you cannot possibly have been paying attention to all the facts stated by merrill m&amp a legal counsel peter mcpherson lewis campbell pundits analysts near and far the h&amp b trustees members of the boston law firm hemenway &amp barnes for that matter virtually anyone outside the wsj newsroom if you really think that there is a better alternative than the murdoch offer yes it is sad that we have to sell to him but this has been a very long time coming evolution does not work overnight the fact that we still get a premium is a bonus and it is a helluva premium let us remember that this is america and capitalism is good and that hello we own a business i wanted to point out some of the key evolutionary reasons why it is that we came to this juncture in the road and lo and behold rupert was there we cant really feel bad about this history it is what it is it was frustrating for some of us to live through much of the past years as i know it is frustrating for many and some in extremis to realize that our only good option is to sell to rupert however the best thing we can do is look at the facts and put our emotions which have only gotten in our way in the past aside much as lisa and the cooks have done i put my emotions aside a long time ago for all the frustrating historical reasons mentioned above because i have been in that place for a while this is a no brainer so we never really figured out how to be owners when we needed to most when you look at the history it is understandable if frustrating as my brother tom has pointed out it was a special challenge to be owners of this company because of the added "disconnect" of the fact that the real "owners" were really the various trusts by extension that really meant that the professional trustees were in essence the owners and they were certainly never trained in that capacity in yet another irony those of us as beneficiaries of the large trusts that ultimately will pass along the principal to the next generation would become the true family "owners " yet should we act rationally that will not come to pass leslie has asked for a "leap of faith" at this time for all the reasons mentioned above we are way way past that as a rationalist and an empiricist i am not into leaps of faith especially when it comes to these kinds of decisions and i know she doesnt ask her passengers for that when she assumes the left hand seat in a jet with a precious human cargo on board leslie hill is a retired american airlines pilot she is actually flying based on data and a well trained brain that can process the relevant data at the right time i ask that we all take a look at the data it speaks loudly and clearly as to our flight course sell to murdoch that is the responsible rational data driven course it would be a big step in the evolution of this fascinating family if we could all converge on that approach and put the wrenching emotions aside that are in some cases obscuring reality as was the case with our handling of peter kann fine a guy as he is all best crawford dad gbp son brother cuz nephew "whos he " heretic to some born in boston but eagles fan all the way and now i am again proud to say fellow alum of st georges with my "born again" in law cousin buzzy p s life is too short not to keep on seeing the irony and humor in virtually everything
