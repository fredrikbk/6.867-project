weekend journal taste schmoozing without boozing i was carting out the garbage at a m on the last saturday in june when two middle age men within seconds of each other stopped at the driveway and asked if this was the correct address for a yard sale indeed it was i replied but reminded the early birds that the event wasnt scheduled to start until not entirely satisfied one of them boldly stated that perhaps he should receive a discount on the merchandise because of his enthusiasm although taken aback by the premature appearance of potential customers i mustered up a degree of conviviality and said that yes once my sons had hauled the boxes of books videos cds dvds handbags scarves toys and other items from the basement onto the front lawn special consideration would be given to both of them as it happened a score of bargain hunters dealers longtime friends and neighbors also arrived early and began pawing through the long forgotten treasures i was amazed that a dented power rangers lunchbox could fetch &# and a rather extraordinary day unfolded i knew that such events are a traditional form of recreation in the u s in some communities such as beverly hills a local permit is required but the friendly ferocity of our guests was something i hadnt reckoned on in fact it all began as an experiment remembering a similar sale one of my brothers and i organized nearly years ago i saw the project as an excuse to get my boys away from the television and internet and finally four years after wed moved to baltimore from manhattan restore a semblance of order to the basement my wife and i had limited expectations but we promised the kids that if they did the necessary work including organizing the junk carrying it outside putting up fliers and greeting customers the proceeds would be split between them i figured that if the weather was pleasant and it was wed attract maybe or so curiosity seekers and wind up with a modest &# windfall by p m that day however the total exceeded &# the real revelation to me was that its possible in to stage what amounted to a morning cocktail party without food or alcohol and emerge with blood pressure intact and no bruised feelings over heated differences in political or cultural views the schism began during bill clintons presidency of course but rapidly widened after the presidential election in and the terrorist attacks of sept im hardly alone among americans who follow current events closely in learning this lesson the hard way ive lost friends because of my conservative economic and foreign policy opinions and have reluctantly but wisely confined my conversation with say vehement pelosi democrats to sports kids and the weather the people who came to the yard sale were an eclectic bunch ranging in age from to one elderly man told me that walter cronkites aunt was his fifth grade teacher and appeared to be of mixed economic and social backgrounds the kind of collection of citizens that a focus group coordinator might set out to find i was sorry that there was no red white and blue bunting decorating the house a modern day norman rockwell if such a person exists could have produced a nifty portrait of this circus of humanity our year old son booker schmoozed and haggled over prices with customers he was the alpha sales guy while his brother nicky a year old fledgling filmmaker engaged music and movie buffs with conversation i was free to chat at will with our guests one woman was a teacher who asked me to find as many history documentaries as possible and as we foraged together through videos about u s presidents world war ii civil rights and the great depression we spoke without rancor about local and national politics she grew up in nebraska the daughter of staunch republicans and was now a committed democrat supporting john edwards in im no fan of the former senator but we laughed together about his now legendary &# haircut dismissed the prospects of mitt romney and agreed that the country would be better off without another clinton in the white house some buyers were in no mood to gab one bearded man wearing a grateful dead t shirt that suggested he was a participant in the "summer of love" years ago spent half an hour examining hundreds of cds and resisted my attempts to talk about the music from that era i lost track of the guy and found out soon after that hed taken advantage of booker who was juggling four deals at once offering the paltry sum of &# for a crate of cds at a dollar apiece lower than the asking price of &# each but there were some who came just for a chance to kibitz such as a guy who more than two decades ago was an employee of mine at baltimores weekly city paper he hung around for over an hour and wound up spending a token &# there were many moments of hilarity one couple who emerged from their car bickering combed through the boxes and were unable to agree on anything "beth should we get this copy of dirty harry " asked the husband only to be shot a withering glance and the admonition of "bert its &# so for heavens sake just buy it and leave me alone " just a minute later this seeming yard sale barracuda took me aside and affected the demeanor of a doting grandmother telling my wife and me that our sons were "adorable and perfect gentlemen " mary jo spiegel writing recently in the cincinnati enquirer described her own yard sale which was held on july "is there anything more american than the embarrassing spectacle of your worldly goods by which i mean absolute junk displayed on your front lawn " frankly the thought of embarrassment never even crossed my mind quite the contrary the boys are planning another sale at the end of august and our family has no fear of being ostracized over the "junk" laid out across the lawn besides booker and nicky are confident that a bolstered inventory including a used weber grill nearly books several dated video game systems and racks of their baby clothes once earmarked for posterity will keep them in economic clover well past the start of next year mr smith last wrote for the journal about the th anniversary of the beatles"sgt peppers lonely
