barrington stage company union st pittsfield mass &# &# closes aug garrison n y summer shakespeare festivals are thick on the ground in america these days and more than a few of them are a pleasure to behold if youre searching for the best of all possible times though youll have trouble topping the hudson valley shakespeare festival i see a lot of shakespeare but i cant think of another outdoor festival that has a higher overall batting average hudson valleys deliberately informal productions are a model of cultural populism at its most engaging and effective and kurt rhoadss uproariously loony staging of "as you like it " performed in the shoot em up style of a bottom of the bill b western is one of the cleverest updatings of the bard to have come my way at hudson valley the joy starts with the "theater " a spacious tent pitched on the green airy lawn of the boscobel restoration a th century mansion that is perched on the edge of a bluff located across the hudson river from west point the fact that the shows performed under hudson valleys big top are never upstaged by the scenery says a lot about the ingenuity of terrence obrien the festivals founder and artistic director mr rhoads who has been acting at hudson valley for the past years and has directed two earlier productions "the comedy of errors" and "the two gentlemen of verona " is very much in tune with mr obriens populist style his approach to "as you like it" is broad to the point of preposterousness but its also smart the parody is carefully worked out and flecked with touches of poetry indeed the shows most perfect moment is at once comic and achingly poignant nance williamson who plays jaques as a cross dressing ranch hand turns shakespeares seven ages of man monologue into a campfire tale told with a prairie twang at first you smile but as ms williamson takes her fellow cowpunchers down the path all men must travel from careless youth to the "mere oblivion" of second childhood they and we listen in a rapt silence broken only by the sounds of the hudson valley night the brightest star of the show though is joey parsons the fascinating ariel of mr obriens "tempest " who is no less striking this time around as mr rhoadss rosalind decked out in tight jeans and a red cowboy hat a la annie oakley she plays the ardent lover in disguise of "as you like it" with an eager sexy zest that put me in mind of the young annette bening paul bates the wonderful bottom of last years "midsummer nights dream " doubles as adam and audrey one of the productions most chokingly funny touches and the other clowns who are clearly intended to recall such scene stealing second bananas of hollywoods wild west as walter brennan andy devine and strother martin all get their laughs knowingly and infallibly "as you like it" alternates for the next six weeks with mr obriens production of "richard iii " had my schedule permitted i would gladly have seen both shows back to back ive never spent an evening at the hudson valley shakespeare festival from which i failed to go home happy pittsfield mass few theatrical experiences are as liberating as the anarchic laughter of pure farce in which the gravitational laws of everyday life are repealed and all hell breaks loose on stage no genre is harder to bring off in performance it requires exquisitely finicky timing but when all the comic cylinders are firing in sync theres nothing in the world funnier than a well made well played farce i saw one last week westport country playhouses revival of alan ayckbourns "relatively speaking " and i hit the jackpot again with barrington stages production of peter shaffers "black comedy " mr shaffer is better known for such bristlingly serious plays as "amadeus" and "equus " but with "black comedy " first seen on broadway in he proved himself to be no less adept at strewing the stage with banana peels its a standard issue british comedy about a poverty stricken ultramodern sculptor brian avers whos juggling two unsuspecting ladies ginifer king and nell mooney enhanced by one brilliant twist the action takes place during a power failure and the onstage lighting is reversed when the lights are on the stage is black when the lights are off we see the actors lurching around in the "dark " add a priceless porcelain sculpture of buddha and a strategically positioned trap door and the result is collective hysteria lou jacob the director was previously responsible for the off broadway production of sam shepards "the god of hell " i wont hold that debacle against him though since he keeps "black comedy" zooming along like a runaway train with a drunken engineer the performances are a bit obvious but so are mr shaffers characters and in any case i doubt that his apply pie a to face b effects would profit from being executed with greater subtlety mr jacob and his actors have wound up the comic mainspring of "black comedy" so tightly that i actually cried out "oh no " at one especially excruciating moment farce hurts i cant tell you what it was though because by then i was laughing too hard to take notes mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the
