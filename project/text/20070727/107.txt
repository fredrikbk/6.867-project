weekend journal review film simpsons edge and wit survive big screen leap busting the tv curse bland no reservations is all kitchen no heat hollywood could populate a nice sized suburb with the television stars who tried and tried and tried in vain to find success on the big screen a partial list includes shelley long and ted danson and the davids duchovny schwimmer and caruso but there is no such cathode curse on homer marge bart and lisa simpson after seasons and some episodes of their fox tv series the family created by matt groening the family that put the dys in dysfunctional makes a seamless transition from the shag carpet to the red carpet in the long awaited "simpsons movie " for reasons best known to himself homer voiced by dan castellaneta decides to acquire a pet pig and for reasons best known to himself he stores the creatures effluvium along with his own in a porous silo in the backyard nagged by his wife marge julie kavner to do something about the leaky receptacle at exactly the time hes heard about a limited time offer of free doughnuts homer makes a characteristically selfish decision his actions when brought to the attention of president arnold schwarzenegger all but destroy the town of springfield to say nothing of homers marriage and the budding romance of his do gooding daughter lisa yeardley smith who has just delivered a solemn address on the environment "an irritating truth " the movie pokes sly fun at the simpsons own fox network at television shows with the temerity to become feature length presentations and at the sturdy conventions of disaster films there are sharp references to such pop culture touchstones as spider man bono botox home depot and of course harry potter though a jab at the kennedy familys impressive choppers seems at this point pretty old hat "the simpsons movie" sputters just a bit toward the end when the paterfamilias is briefly out of the picture when he returns eager as he generally is at the very very last possible minute to do the right thing alls well with the world hurray for homer long may he rave no reservations its plain old lousy timing this chronicle of a dedicated exacting chef being released in the wake of the kitchen centered "ratatouille" and "waitress " alongside those two charmers which beautifully demonstrate the transformative powers of food and love "no reservations" is strictly cordon blah closely adapted from the appealing german movie "mostly martha " and proving yet again that possession of a winning recipe is no guarantee of success the comedy drama "no reservations" centers on kate catherine zeta jones the laser focused chef at a popular greenwich village restaurant in fact as played by ms zeta jones kate seems rather more cross than single minded shes up every day at a m to score the best catch at the fish market has little use for chitchat hasnt had a relationship in years and doesnt seem to feel the lack perhaps its sleep deprivation perhaps a failure to understand shes in a service business but kate gets downright testy on those very rare occasions that a restaurant patron questions her preparation of a dish its one of the movies missteps that the complaining customer is portrayed as so oafish that all sympathy goes to the chef in any case at the insistence of the restaurants owner the always wonderful patricia clarkson kate is seeing a therapist bob balaban to improve her people skills she spends many sessions reciting the ingredients of her signature dishes shes got heavy ego involvement in the quail with saffron sauce the good doctor meanwhile spends many sessions eating the lunch kate has prepared for him he may well think its defensive he also thinks its delicious but now kate has more to serve up to her therapist than the daily special shes unexpectedly become the clueless guardian of her year old niece zoe abigail breslin by gosh who knew kids didnt like foie gras at just about the same time an irrepressible opera loving sous chef aaron eckhart joined the restaurant staff could he be after kates job could he be after kate "no reservations" has all the shock value of tuna surprise the ravishing ms zeta jones looks as though she hasnt had a square meal in years but thats perfectly ok the cliche of the super sized chef should certainly be put to rest if it hasnt already been but this is a movie about a woman whose life is cooking not that the filmmakers trouble themselves much to explain her passion so shouldnt we see kate do more than decorate a dessert plate or garnish an entree "no reservations" brushes aside such matters as briskly as it introduces and resolves conflicts unfortunately there isnt much chemistry between the engaging mr eckhart and ms zeta jones all the more reason it would have been nice to have some heat in the kitchen arctic tale the term "global warming" remains unspoken until the closing credits of this documentary which limns the life and changing times of a polar bear cub and a walrus pup at the top of the earth still it reverberates through almost every splendidly shot frame and is implicit in the cloying narration co written by kristin gore daughter of al and voiced by queen latifah fifteen years in the making "arctic tale" charts the fortunes of the infant nanu the polar cub and seela the walrus pup as their respective mothers give them lessons for survival but the animals longstanding skills are challenged by circumstances they dont begin to understand a foreshortened winter thinning sheets of ice that will no longer support their weight the disappearance or shrinking of the ice floes that have in the past served as diving platforms and safe havens seela and her kin have to swim longer and longer distances to find a secure place to perch nanu has to swim longer and longer distances to find her dinner if she can find it at all awe is the only proper response to extreme close ups of a polar bear birth and to the shadow of an animal crossing the ice captured by an underwater camera a mother polar bear and daughter lying at the side of an ailing family member is an unforgettable and heart searing image but the impact of "arctic tale" is blunted by its length it feels long at minutes and by its script coming up with the right tone when youre aiming for a family audience is a tricky business too twee and you lose the adults too abstract and you lose the kids "the march of the penguins" nailed it "arctic tale " like "penguins" a production of national geographic films makes the mistake of anthropomorphizing its subjects and substitutes pallid whimsy for reportage "theres something fishy about those birds " notes queen latifah in describing thick billed murres which both swim and fly "seelas tusks are filling out nicely " she notes of the maturing walrus "and some of the boys are starting to take notice " joe morgenstern is on vacation
