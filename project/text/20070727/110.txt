weekend journal sports by the numbers the toll of the streak this weekend former baltimore orioles shortstop cal ripken jr will be inducted into the national baseball hall of fame after receiving of the vote in his first year of eligibility the third highest mark ever mr ripken deserves the honor having compiled an impressive resume as a hitter and helping to defy the stereotype of the shortstop as a position played by small good fielding no hit players that said its not only possible but probable that his pursuit of lou gehrigs consecutive games streak held him back from far greater accomplishments graph the hitting accomplishments of most position players in the majors and the results will resemble a bell curve the player tends to get better and better season after season players reach a peak usually around age or and then begin a decline the very best players continue to contribute even as they decline during their s while marginal players will find themselves out of baseball mr ripkens career is very different his chart looks like a ski slope with one single bump he starts off at a high level his sophomore season of is arguably the greatest ever for a shortstop but except for his most valuable player year of his performance at the plate gnerally declined year after year as his consecutive games streak grew longer and longer gehrig the yankee slugger who set the record under less demanding conditions than those faced by mr ripken followed a more typical career path reaching his peak in batting average at age and homers in his s mr ripken on the other hand seems to have reached his offensive peak at age in he posted a career high in hits doubles and runs scored as well as his second highest ops or on base percentage plus slugging average during his streak topped only by his in he won the mvp and the orioles won the world series during his streak their winning percentage was only and they made the playoffs only twice more overall mr ripken scored runs in a season three times by age but never did so again afterward he drove in runs twice by age but only twice thereafter he hit or more home runs in six consecutive seasons up to age but reached that modest mark only twice more in his remaining seasons he posted an ops mark thats at least better than the league mark five times by age he only did that once more during the remaining years of the streak compare this to former cincinnati reds shortstop barry larkin a likely future hall of famer in mr larkin set his career highs in homers runs scored rbis ops and slugging percentage at age did the wear and tear of playing every game with no breaks age mr ripken prematurely and stunt his statistical growth to get an estimate we identified some similar hitters dave winfield robin yount al kaline eddie murray carl yastrzemski george brett and tony perez hall of famers all we then took their early seasons between ages and and compared them to their "peak seasons" between ages of and how much did they improve a lot the comparable players improved substantially while mr ripken declined in virtually every major offensive category their batting average nudged up a bit an average of six points but their power and production numbers skyrocketed their average rbi totals increased by and their homers increased by a whopping their ops increased while the iron man declined by if we apply these kind of increases to mr ripkens "peak years " his statistical bottom line changes remarkably his career homers jump from to which puts him th on the all time list behind reggie jackson and just ahead of mike schmidt his rbis jump from to which puts him just behind willie mays for no still mr ripken is among the greatest hitting shortstops of all time well behind honus wagner but near the top of a group that consists of arky vaughan ernie banks robin yount and eventually derek jeter and alex rodriguez however if he had taken a few days off its possible that mr ripkens career trajectory would have been different and his numbers would have improved enough to make him the greatest player of his generation and among the very best of all time while his pursuit of the consecutive games streak brought him notoriety let it also be noted that mr ripken also made a huge sacrifice for what was essentially a perfect attendance mark
