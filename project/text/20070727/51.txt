immigration paralysis on a hot arizona day along interstate just north of the mexican border we see a sight all too familiar in these parts border patrol officers in an olive colored suv have detained a group of young mexicans who were motoring north the mexicans are squatting on the grassy highway embankment waiting for the officers to ascertain whether they have entered the u s legally or illegally a few days later when our journey has taken us to twin falls idaho we read in a local newspaper that potato farmers are being forced to obtain convict labor because theres a shortage of the migrants they have traditionally used to work their fields in fact the farm worker dearth is national particularly for growers of labor intensive fresh produce crops are rotting in the fields and prices going up observations recorded during a month long motoring sweep around the western u s by my wife jody and me reveal a disconnect between law and reality a legislative paralysis on immigration reform perhaps helps explain why a new ap ipsos opinion poll shows that the performance rating for congress has slumped percentage points since may with only of respondents voicing satisfaction with that bodys work after years of quarreling over reform of the dysfunctional simpson mazzoli act which made it a crime to knowingly hire illegal immigrants lawmakers are still batting a big fat zero hence willing workers are being turned back at the border at a time when growers are desperate for hired help the federally mandated severance of labor supply from demand is inopportune our western tour and an earlier swing through the south dramatized to us that over the last quarter century the u s has become an incredibly wealthy country millions of late model cars zoom the freeways lake and harbor marinas are choked with pleasure boats fitness centers and pet grooming parlors are now commonplace as an affluent middle class spends freely on non essential services in seattle which gets rain days a year people buy bottled water from france as a street entertainer puts it "evian spelled backwards is naive " a fascinating web site called "strange maps" compares the gross domestic product of each u s state with a foreign country texas produces more than canada california matches france illinois is on a par with mexico and little new jersey equals the output of huge russia economist john rutledge estimates the worth of all privately owned assets in the u s at &# trillion still the &# trillion american economy demands labor mexico has had a high birth rate although it is rapidly slowing and can supply the needed workers with benefits on both sides of the border but the u s political class can only talk of new barriers why is this such a hard equation for politicians the longer this problem festers the more likely it will push the mexican polity to turn away from being an uneasy friend of the u s to becoming a troublesome enemy the fundamental mistake one that american politicians have made over and over again is the belief that the governments police powers can overwhelm powerful market forces richard nixon and the congress attempted this feat in with wage and price controls stalling american growth for a decade simpson mazzoli was a similar effort to strong arm a key market for labor by threatening something that proved to be unenforceable jail sentences for employers of illegal aliens luckily that didnt shut off the labor supply from mexico it just drove it underground estimates are that there at least million illegals in the u s and that may be far lower than the actual number hotels and restaurants in places like chicago miami and just about every other city would have to shut down without waiters maids and others with dubious credentials the well manicured lawns in my home town would soon become weed gardens in the absence of the mexicans who man landscape services americans genuinely worry about maintaining the rule of law but the biggest threat to that is the disrespect for law created when legislative grandstanders pass draconian measures that the authorities are incapable of enforcing arizonas legislature which apparently has learned nothing from the federal laws failure has just compounded the crime by passing a measure that is even more draconian than simpson mazzoli it has caused an uprising among arizona businessmen and farmers who shout that a law making them felons for trying to keep their enterprises afloat is just bonkers washington efforts to reform simpson mazzoli are plagued by the death struggle the two parties are conducting over control of the government republicans who perhaps have noticed that they are losing that struggle are frozen in the headlights of the anti immigrant campaigns being conducted by nativists and vigilantes in their home states hate and emotion do not produce good laws my friend robert halbrook a retired lawyer living in tucson ariz is aware that politics are not always logical or even rational but offers a logical solution nonetheless legislators must do away with all the threats and penalties that drive labor and its employers underground it must be made possible for illegal workers to achieve legal status without fear that way mexicans can come to the u s to fill jobs and go home safe in the knowledge that when their work is demanded they will be able to come back again many will go back with skills learned in the u s enabling them to earn a living at home most he believes do not crave u s citizenship why should they want to cope with a new language and culture if they can return home without penalty they just want to feed their families and try to move up the economic ladder is it too much to ask of congress that it employ some of this clear logic apparently so judging from the paralysis in washington mr melloan is a former deputy editor of the journals editorial page see related letter "letters to the editor were pro immigration but enforce the laws" wsj august
