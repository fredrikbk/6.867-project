the uaws health care dreams it is not within the power of united auto workers president ron gettelfinger to save gm ford and chrysler but it is certainly within his power to kill them whether he chooses to do so will soon become clear what are arguably the most critical contract negotiations in the history of motowns auto industry began this week americas former big three auto makers are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy fords second quarter profit notwithstanding and one big reason for their dire state apart from collective amnesia over how to make hit cars is their ever escalating health care expenses every car they produce they plaintively assert contains &# in health costs that their japanese competitors dont face but mr gettelfinger has already declared that he is not in a "concessionary mood " uaw workers at ford and gm agreed to a health care cost sharing deal during an unusual round of mid contract negotiations in closing the competition gap with japanese auto makers now mr gettelfinger insists requires not more concessions by auto workers but a japanese style government health care system for all workers "we pay more but get less " he thundered to roaring applause at a recent naacp luncheon doubtless some of mr gettelfingers tough talk is posturing calculated to extract the best possible deal from auto companies yet his perennial calls for a national health care system echoed by leading democratic presidential candidates affect the dynamics at the bargaining table by feeding the notion that japanese workers are getting a better health care deal than uaw workers they make it harder for mr gettelfinger to make reasonable compromises and sell them to his rank and file but do japanese workers really live in some single payer health care heaven where all their medical needs are covered by general taxpayers with no cost to them hardly the japanese system comprises three basic insurance plans one for the self employed and the unemployed including retirees under one for the elderly over and one for all private and public sector employees the employee plan is not just completely self financed with no taxpayer support it actually subsidizes the other two an arrangement that is becoming increasingly unsustainable as japans population ages both toyota and honda declined to give an estimate of their current or future health care premium burden the employee plan requires a premium equal to of a workers annual income employees themselves pay about of the premiums from their paychecks their employers the rest this works out to &# for an employee with an annual income of &# average wages for a blue collar japanese auto worker according to figures provided by the japanese ministry of health and labor welfare but thats not all japanese workers are on the hook for working families also face a co pay capped at &# per month for a mid income family for medical expenses such as in patient and out patient hospital charges drugs doctors visits and diagnostic tests because these services are exceedingly cheap thanks to massive price controls in practice the average japanese family pays only about &# a year in co pays this adds up to total out of pocket annual expenses of about &# for every japanese household which is comparable to what active uaw workers pay after the deal in absolute dollars but relative to their income japanese workers bear a far bigger burden than uaw workers even that isnt the full story in the event of a catastrophic or chronic illness requiring prolonged hospitalization a uaw worker faces no further expenses a japanese worker who hits his co pay cap each month would be out of pocket up to &# a year about of his annual pay check and five times more than a uaw worker under similar circumstances this puts a huge strain on some japanese families forcing them to default on their hospital bills asahi shimbun japans respected national daily reported that japanese hospitals lost &# million in unpaid patient bills in uaw workers get a better deal not only than japanese workers but other american workers as well before the "givebacks " the detroit three companies picked up the entire health care tab for all their hourly workers active retired dependents and incredibly even laid off workers till they found other jobs workers were not required to pay any premiums deductibles or co pays except for routine physical exams and prescription drugs the deal left these benefits virtually untouched for retirees with pension incomes below &# but for the first time ever it began requiring more well off retirees to cough up &# in annual premiums for family coverage and another &# in total annual deductibles in short for a grand total of &# in out of pocket annual costs uaw retirees and their spouses get full medical coverage for life given the huge retiree population that the big three support gm has three times more retirees than active workers this has saddled them with a combined unfunded health care liability exceeding &# billion by contrast of retirees in other american companies dont get any employer provided coverage after when they become medicare eligible such couples according to an analysis by fidelity investments last year are typically on the hook for &# in out of pocket annual costs for medicare co pays and other expenses not covered by the program or times more than uaw couples meanwhile the only concession that active uaw workers made in was to defer &# an hour of their pay raise toward a uaw controlled voluntary employees beneficiary association veba fund on average this translates into roughly &# in veba contributions per uaw worker per year some of the returns from the funds investments subsidize the coverage of current retirees but the rest are tucked away for the workers own retirement coverage in other words by setting aside about of their current wages annually uaw workers secure not just all their medical needs now but for life in comparison salaried workers with families contribute more than twice as much as uaw workers &# in premiums and another &# in deductibles and co pays for just their current health care needs according to two separate surveys conducted by kaiser foundation and hewitt associates last year what all of this shows is that the so called competition gap that motown auto makers and the uaw complain about is created by the lavish health care and pension deals they wrote themselves not by japans nationalized health care system indeed it is often overlooked that japanese auto makers import less than of the cars they sell in the u s and the percentage will likely drop further as toyota plans to expand its share of u s made cars to two thirds of all vehicles sold in america in the next three years active hourly workers at japanese "transplants" face out of pocket costs not much higher than their uaw counterparts the big difference however is that upon retirement they dont get limitless medical coverage instead they get a fixed amount of money to buy supplemental medicare coverage american auto makers too are hoping to cap their health care liability to retirees by convincing mr gettelfinger to accept a deal under which they would put a lump sum of money into a fund that the uaw would use to buy coverage for its members mr gettelfinger signed off on a similar arrangement with dana a large auto supplier when it went into bankruptcy last year but is reportedly not convinced that this would be advantageous for big three retirees uaw workers still enjoy a health care deal that no one else in america or japan or quite possibly the planet does yet mr gettelfinger said last week that the health care givebacks were the toughest decision he ever made in his entire career this is a startling admission that reflects the depth of the uaws entitlement mentality and its detachment from the world that its fellow americans inhabit but such lavish expectations are unsustainable under any system american or japanese this is a reality that mr gettelfinger must accept otherwise he may well push u s auto makers over the cliff and his comrades with them ms
