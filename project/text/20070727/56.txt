insurance folly the state childrens health insurance program schip was originally a republican program to provide health insurance to children in near poor families who did not qualify for medicaid democrats now want to expand schip to children of the middle class their efforts to do so are rightly being resisted by the white house but senate finance committee republicans have already caved on an unwise compromise to make more people eligible for schip on the surface congressional democrats appear to be rescuing children from the scourge of uninsurance the reality is quite different if they get their way millions of children will have less access to health care than they do today and the same will surprisingly be true for many low income seniors studies by mit economist jonathan gruber show that public insurance substitutes for private insurance and the crowd out rate is high in general for every extra dollar spent on medicaid private insurance contracts by cents to cents for schip depending on how it is implemented private insurance could contract by about cents these findings make sense why pay for something if the government offers it for free under congressional proposals to expand schip the crowd out would likely be much worse the reason almost all the newly eligible beneficiaries already have insurance the senate bill would expand the eligibility for coverage under schip to families with incomes above the federal poverty level &# from its present ceiling above the poverty level house democrats want to push coverage to &# annual income yet almost eight of every children whose parents earn from more than the poverty level already have private health care coverage according to the congressional budget office cbo at incomes between and more than poverty nine of every children are already insured what about the eight to nine million children currently uninsured nearly of them are already eligible for medicaid or schip according to the cbo so the main result of the democrats proposal to expand schip will be to shift middle class children from private to public plans why is that bad one reason is that most schip programs pay doctors at medicaid rates rates so low that medicaid patients are having increasing difficulty getting access to health care anecdotal evidence suggests that u s medicaid patients already must wait as long for specialist care and hospital surgery as in canada many doctors wont see medicaid patients among those that do many will not accept new patients as a result children who lose private coverage and enroll in schip are likely to get less care not more there is also the issue of who exactly will be covered republicans want to restrict schip to children the democrats want adults covered as well even under the current system childrens health insurance is increasingly a ruse to cover adults minnesota spends of schip funds on adults wisconsin spends seniors will suffer from schip expansion too when millions shift from private to public coverage not much happens to the overall rate of uninsurance but the governments cost soars wheres the money to come from one idea popular with some house democrats is to reduce federal payments to medicare advantage plans these plans provide comprehensive coverage to low income seniors who cant afford supplemental insurance to fill all the gaps in medicare one in five seniors has enrolled in these plans and one in four of those is a minority in the house of representatives health care for this group is a great risk the proposal to expand schip comes at a time when health care spending already poses a serious threat to the federal budget the medicare trustees tell us that the programs unfunded liability is six times that of social security the cbo predicts that on the current course income tax rates paid by the middle class will reach by midcentury and the top marginal rate will reach so what do congressional democrats plan to do about this problem ignore it a key provision of the medicare modernization act says that when medicares finances deteriorate to a certain level that level is already reached the president must propose an appropriate reform and congress must fast track the proposal yet one senior democratic legislator as yet unidentified wants the schip bill to repeal that provision in a way repeal makes a certain sense if the ship is going down anyway why spoil the fun mr goodman is president of the national center for policy analysis see related letter "letters to the editor data show schip to be about as good as it gets" wsj aug
