the domino effect as lbos lose luster a stock price prop falls for the past few years private equity firms have helped to lead the stock market higher by offering rich premiums for the shares of companies they were seeking to take private this important underpinning to the market might now be losing its power thats because debt market turmoil shows signs of changing the economics of the deal business inexpensive loans with flexible terms have allowed private equity firms to bid aggressively for the shares of takeover targets like slm corp known as sallie mae freescale semiconductor or txu corp but interest rates on the junk bonds and junk rated loans behind this boom have been rising as investors become more leery of owning them the interest rate on a junk rated b junk bond has risen to percentage points above treasury yields from percentage points a month ago as the debt becomes more expensive and the terms less flexible deal making becomes less attractive "for the last couple of months the market was being driven by mergers and acquisitions activity " says steve bleiberg who runs the &# billion legg mason global asset allocation group "the underlying economic fundamentals were mixed but there was a premium being built into the markets on the view that any company could be in play because it was so easy to obtain the financing to do a deal "but with the buyers strike thats going on in the debt markets where its clear that its not going to be so easy to get that financing the stock market is sitting up and saying maybe these takeover premiums arent warranted any more " mr bleiberg says bankers are now delivering to private equity clients the news that debt is going to be far more expensive and that investors wont back deals that entail too much borrowing or easy terms some bankers say that financing deals might cost a full four percentage points more than just a few weeks ago for some companies on a billion dollar loan that amounts to &# million this spring some private equity firms boasted that &# billion deals were in their sights including some in cyclical industries that had previously been too volatile to consider wall street analysts distributed lists of dozens of such potential targets to their clients but the markets indigestion with borrowing now makes that unlikely one important contributor to the turmoil is a corner of the debt market known as collateralized loan obligations these complicated securities hold hundreds of corporate loans that are packaged together and sold to investors around the world in pieces with different levels of risk some bankers say as much as of the loans that have ended up in clos in the past few months were loans to either finance private equity firms purchases of target companies or to finance dividend payments to the private equity firms after their takeovers were completed the investments have been sterling performers largely because corporate default rates hover near record lows but cracks are showing up amid fears that defaults could rise issuance of clos soared to a record &# billion in the first half of that has since slowed to a trickle so far this month just &# billion of clos have been sold according to standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data "leveraged finances cash engine the clo market has ground to a halt " s&amp p noted in a written commentary on july now investors are demanding better returns some riskier slices of clos which will take early losses if loans go bad are now selling at more than percentage points above benchmark interest rates more than triple the level at which they were sold two months ago this comes at a critical time because banks are in the process of selling more than &# billion of loans to investors clos have been big buyers of those loans and now many of them arent getting sold most notably on thursday chryslers bankers said they would have to hold roughly &# billion of loans they couldnt sell in a financing deal tied to the auto makers takeover by cerberus capital management the hedge funds and other money managers issuing clos have traditionally asked investment banks to accumulate the loans in virtual warehouses as these instruments were being put together now some banks are taking these loans out of the warehouses and selling them because the banks dont want to hold too many corporate loans when market conditions are shaky bankers are telling clo managers they can no longer persuade investors to buy loans with unusually easy terms such as "covenant lite loans" that dont place strict performance requirements on borrowers that is helping to drive down the value of such loans and spook the debt market tom lauricella and serena ng contributed to this article
