weekend journal from japan with mixed results ballplayers find small changes go a long way in the majors mr iguchis new leg kick they come to america with gaudy resumes and big paychecks flanked by paparazzi editors herald them with headlines like "godzilla takes the bronx" and "matsuzaka mania " but for all the hype japanese baseball players remain something of a mystery with few exceptions theyve performed at the extremes in major league baseball some surprise excel and even dominate while others fail spectacularly or barely make a mark the wild variation has stumped baseball statisticians and become a growing source of anxiety for team owners who have committed &# million in the past year to acquire japanese talent unlike american players who are mostly selected through the amateur draft or prospects from latin america who often sign contracts with ball clubs as teenagers most japanese players are brought over as seasoned stars with long track records of success in the japanese leagues which are just below the major leagues in quality the japanese imports on big league rosters this year were years old on average when they made their debuts according to coaches team executives scouts and japanese players the key to success in north america isnt just how well a player performed in japan or whether he can conquer homesickness its the ability to recognize subtle differences in the way baseball is played here and the willingness to make small adjustments to account for them even if it means breaking some deeply ingrained habits those who do like ichiro suzuki of the seattle mariners who has led the american league in hits three times can become larger than life stars those who dont can end up as brief footnotes once considered the best third baseman in japan norihiro nakamura went cold at the plate for the los angeles dodgers in and lasted all of games "its a leap of faith " says andrew friedman the general manager of the tampa bay devil rays who recently acquired japanese third baseman akinori iwamura while team officials always try to evaluate the risks before signing a japanese player he says they are well aware of the uneven track record "every player is a little different " the latest surprise is kyoto native hideki okajima a year old lefthanded relief pitcher who signed with the boston red sox this season for &# million over two years his arrival barely made a ripple in boston where fans were more focused on another more famous japanese import starting pitcher daisuke matsuzaka or "dice k" whom the red sox signed for &# million over six years while the cameras followed his countryman mr okajima spent the winter working on a special surprise for america a vastly improved off speed pitch or change up on april after mr okajimas dubious start to the regular season he gave up a home run on his first pitch boston pitching coach john farrell suggested he alter the wrist motion on the change up to turn the ball over more as he released it those small adjustments have produced a pitch that boston fans call the "oka doke" and that has baffled nearly everyone who has seen it including barry bonds mr okajima has used the pitch to register nearly of his strikeouts this year and to record of his outs overall according to baseball info solutions he has given up only five runs in nearly innings and was selected to the american league all star team the years biggest flop has been starting pitcher kei igawa of the new york yankees after the year old led japans central league in strikeouts three times the yankees signed him for &# million over five years but through wednesday he had surrendered home runs in games one of the worst ratios in the majors on may after his earned run average had ballooned to the yankees sent mr igawa to the minor leagues for six weeks yankee pitching instructor gil patterson says the problem was mr igawas delivery which tends to produce pitches that come across the plate high these pitches were potent in japan where the strike zone is taller and the depth of talent shallower but major league hitters had little trouble pounding them to teach mr igawa to keep his pitches down the yankees tried to change his mechanics in one drill they had him stand on his left leg in front of a mirror and step with his right leg onto a piece of tape affixed to the floor while trying to hold his head still while mr igawa returned to the yankees last month he has lapsed back to his old motion at times and could soon lose his spot in the starting rotation "its pretty tough to change your delivery in the big leagues " mr patterson says for years most mlb scouts and executives believed japanese players were not skilled enough to succeed in north america that changed in when dodgers pitcher hideo nomo defied expectations by leading the national league in strikeouts and winning rookie of the year honors since then there have been numerous success stories including outfielder hideki matsui of the yankees former seattle closer kaz sasaki and role players like akinori otsuka saves for the texas rangers last year and second baseman tadahito iguchi who helped the chicago white sox win the world series at the head of the class is mr suzuki who was recently named most valuable player of the all star game after collecting three hits including an inside the park home run japans victory in last years world baseball classic only raised the level of interest this season a record japanese players began the season on major league rosters up from nine in still the list of disappointments is long enough to induce fear in front offices theres mr nakamura the japanese slugger who washed out with the dodgers satoru komiyama a veteran starting pitcher who made just appearances for the new york mets in and infielder kazuo matsui who made errors in just months for the mets perhaps the worst example was hideki irabu who came to the yankees billed as the "nolan ryan of japan" but was traded after giving up home runs in games as a yankee to acquire a player still under contract in japan mlb teams have to bid against one another to pay a "posting fee" to the players japanese club while also reaching a separate salary agreement with the player last winter the red sox paid a &# million posting fee for mr matsuzaka while the yankees paid &# million to the hanshin tigers for mr igawa in by contrast the mariners paid &# million for the rights to mr suzuki for some japanese imports the first challenge is adjusting to the different physical properties of the north american game los angeles relief pitcher takashi saito who has converted of save opportunities this year while holding hitters to a batting average credits his success to the baseballs which he says are bigger and slicker than in japan the right hander who will earn &# million this year says he learned to use these properties to improve the speed and movement of his fastball as his confidence in the pitch grew he started relying less on the slider hed developed in japan this year while continuing to throw more than fastballs mr saito has reduced the number of sliders he throws to from the season before in the case of infielder kazuo matsui who debuted with the mets in the trick was adapting to the natural grass surfaces prevalent in mlb ballparks in japan where most fields have artificial turf ground balls tend to reach infielders more quickly giving them extra time to set their feet before throwing out base runners but to throw out runners on natural grass says his former coach sandy alomar mr matsui had to drop his aversion to backhanding ground balls a play his coaches in japan considered sloppy his inability to make the change was painfully apparent he committed errors in second worst among national league shortstops in only games the more aggressive base running in north america is often a factor too kenji johjima of the mariners the first japanese catcher in the big leagues struggled at first to handle the larger number of steal attempts in his first season he threw out just of all base runners a mediocre number but after changing his throwing motion to improve his accuracy he has raised his average to which ranks third in the majors the more bruising physical style of play can take a toll as infielders both mr matsui of the mets and mr iguchi of the white sox had to cope with something foreign to them trying to turn double plays while a base runner barrels at them trying to knock them over "in the states there are more players who dont care if they injure a guy " says former mets manager bobby valentine now in his second stint leading a japanese club the chiba lotte marines mr valentine says infielders in japan step directly toward first base while turning a double play at second while infielders in the majors make a variety of evasive maneuvers to protect themselves while both players struggled to adjust mr iguchi was called for failing to touch second base during a double play attempt in a playoff game mr matsui paid the higher price he injured his leg in his debut season after being taken out four times in one game by the atlanta braves in he bruised his left knee after being upended on another double play attempt that same season he converted just of all double play opportunities well below the league norm the challenge for mr nakamura the dodgers third baseman was to alter his batting style to compensate for faster pitching as a slugger in japan mr nakamura used a pronounced leg kick to generate power but the move also prolonged his swing by a few milliseconds "he had trouble catching up with fastballs from good hard throwers " says his former manager jim tracy while mr nakamura was unable to change his mechanics and hit only for the dodgers mr iguchi another japanese power hitter with a leg kick was though he still strikes out more often than he did in japan mr iguchi hit last year and led al second basemen with home runs japanese players often say that baseball is still baseball but that the differences both on and off the field can be unsettling "its not easy " says mr saito "its not a matter of talent it has more to do with mind set and being able to adapt to the environment " mr iguchi says it took him about a year to learn the nuances of mlb pitchers while mr suzuki says the most "stressful" thing was the relative lack of direction from his coaches "my way of thinking about the game was not adjusted at all " he says to be sure every player who comes to the major leagues has to make a few tactical improvements to survive japanese players also arent the only ones who come to the majors as seasoned pros cuban stars like orlando hernandez have arrived in america late in their careers and thrived as well off the field japanese players have to deal with everything from a language barrier to reporters in the locker room in japan the media are barred from most clubhouses in some cases success is only a matter of time kazuo matsui has improved since the mets traded him to colorado in making only two errors so far this season although mr matsuzaka has had some poor outings this year he has won games and is tied for fourth in the majors in strikeouts one area hes still working on is time management pitchers in japan pitch every six days rather than every five which has forced dice k to search for a new training regimen as more japanese players arrive statisticians are getting better at making predictions clay davenport of baseballprospectus com says his research confirms that japanese power hitters tend to have a dramatic drop off while pitchers allow more walks and home runs and see their strikeout totals decrease by about as for seattles ichiro suzuki its hard to pinpoint any one adjustment although he did employ a few tactics according to kevin towers the general manager of the san diego padres who watched him during his first spring training mr suzuki looked especially hapless on inside pitches but once the season started it was a different story "he baited us pretty good " mr towers says
