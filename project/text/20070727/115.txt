weekend journal the drivers seat land rover lr a land rover for the rest of us amid all the speculation surrounding ford motor co s likely sale of land rover one thing is certain whoever takes control of the venerable luxury brand will do so at its pinnacle land rover has never had as attractive a lineup as it does today and despite some serious questions about the quality of its sport utility vehicles sales are as robust as the british marques off road reputation globally land rover had its best year ever in then again in and is on pace to sell even more vehicles this year the catalyst has been an overhaul of the entire model range a process that now concludes with the lr the fourth land rover debut in the past five years the first was a redesign of the flagship the range rover the second came two years later when the three row discovery was re engineered and rechristened lr and the third was a brand new model the range rover sport the lr land rovers second try at building a compact suv hit our shores in april the strictly for north america name is meant to put some distance between the lr and the freelander it replaced the freelander land rovers initial foray into the small suv market fizzled in the u s and it disappeared after the model simply strayed too far from home seeming much more like a small inexpensive japanese suv than its upscale brethren thus the lr smartly apes the more expensive and established nameplates in todays land rover lineup its stepped roof resembles the lr the side vents echo the range rover sport and its overall stance is like that of a runt range rover from its clamshell hood to the door pulls to the steering wheel the lrs pastiche of roverisms successfully convince you of its legitimate place in the pantheon of british off roaders looking under the surface however reveals some surprises in the lineage the lrs liter horsepower inline six cylinder engine is shared with the volvo s sedan while its all wheel drive system is based on the one in the swedish brands xc suv volvo is another ford unit we can only hope that these communal components help the lr surpass its own brands dismal quality reputation but in any case the powertrain seems nicely designed it gives the lr sufficient performance and off road capability while its bias toward powering the front wheels helps return what these days passes for reasonable fuel economy though the lrs epa rating is a combined miles per gallon i managed to beat that averaging mpg over plus miles even in your wildest dreams thats a good mpg better than youd see in any other land rover sold on this side of the pond perhaps a new owner might see fit to import some of the diesel models sold overseas but until then the lr is the only land rover without shameful fuel economy its also the only one that seems entirely right sized for the job these suvs regularly do in the u s which is to sashay about suburbia while making an occasional trundle over a gravel road to the summer home the lr serves well for the task offering a comfortable ride with solid on road handling thats aided by a weighty steering feel the interior however is not up to the plush standards of the range rover or even the lr the overall design of the instrument panel and console is attractively simple but theres too much dull hard plastic in the lr even worse is a pathetic piece of fake wood trim bisecting the dashboard that looks like it came straight from a "forest" at ford headquarters in michigan if what you desire is a smaller land rover with the same soft leather and nicely finished lumber of the upscale models youll be left wanting but on the upside youll be able to adjust the temperature and radio without poking at a dozen different buttons or delving into the owners manual as the lr has simple discrete audio and climate controls that are in no way integrated into its optional navigation system bravo you dont have to be a luddite to appreciate the wisdom of this configuration especially if youve driven the overly computerized acura rdx the lr is the most accessible land rover to date and not just because its &# base price makes it both inexpensive for the brand and competitively priced with the competition factor in the improved fuel economy smaller size and functional design and the lr may appeal to people who might never have considered a land rover if that makes this new model the big upside to a potential suitor for land rover im afraid the downside is that theres not much more that can be done with the brand as traditional suvs continue their inevitable slide from the mainstream the marque faces a struggle regardless of who owns it theres only so far that the go anywhere ethos can be extended and the lr is just about the end of the road paved or not contact me at jeff sabatini wsj com
