weekend journal taste de gustibus listen and learn a brief history of oral history youve never heard of him but robert rush may be a modern day herodotus mr rush who jokes that "he got his b a from the back of a humvee " is an oral historian with the u s army a retired command sergeant major who spent years on active duty before getting his doctorate in history mr rush believes that recorded testimonies "can flesh out details that arent present in the paper histories " in he was stationed in iraq where he spent seven months interviewing everyone from "engineers to bricklayers to military officers " all with his handheld olympus a century ago historians might have laughed at mr rushs desire to spend time talking to construction workers today the populist impulse is everywhere in the study of history for that some credit is due to joe gould a west village bum with a harvard degree mr gould told the new yorkers joseph mitchell in that he would "put down the informal history of the shirt sleeved multitude what they had to say about their jobs love affairs vittles sprees scrapes and sorrows or perish in the attempt " he announced that he would do so in a work he humbly called "oral history of our time " he claimed that the tome covering the first half of the th century included nine million words of everyday new yorkers it was revealed upon mr goulds death that he had made the whole thing up besides remaining a part of new york city lore a portrait of the small bearded man still hangs in minetta tavern on macdougal street mr gould left another legacy the term "oral history" was thrust into the public lexicon the roots of oral history of course are much older than mr gould they "go back to the beginning of human beings " alphine jefferson the president of the oral history association tells me but ronald j grele the author of "envelopes of sound the art of oral history " says it all started a little more recently the fifth century b c perhaps with greek storytellers "people have told their history since time immemorial but herodotus left a written record so we know that he was going out and doing this " still there is a distinction between thucydides recounting oral testimony culled from interviews with athenians and what we now consider oral history what distinguishes modern oral history is the recording of the voices of its witnesses "up until the th century or so sound disappeared " says mr grele it wasnt until thomas edison developed the cylinder and the phonograph in the late s that it was possible to capture sound and replay it some of the earliest recordings on wax cylinders that could hold only a couple of minutes of sound were those of american indians taken by ethnographers funded by the federal government these early oral historians "felt compelled to try to record native traditions of what they thought was a dying culture " says the senates associate historian donald ritchie in the s as cylinders gave way to lacquer discs the government expanded its oral history horizons such writers as ralph ellison and zora neale hurston were hired by the works progress administration to interview immigrants the appalachian poor and ex slaves the stories of such groups were largely excluded from formal histories of the time but modern scholars have made great use of their testimonies now preserved in the library of congresss american folklife center as the government funded interviews of those on the fringes of american society it also sought to record the most dramatic events as they unfolded mr rush traces the armys current initiative in iraq back to when george marshall suggested recording the institutions history and so according to mr rush military detachments were sent into the war most of the time with nothing but a "stubby pencil " it was only when they arrived in germany that they realized how rudimentary their recording methods were the germans had by then developed the magnetic tape which allowed for longer recordings and splicing three years after the war ended the first scholarly oral history program was established at columbia university initially such programs like all formal historical study at the time focused on the elites but in the s a new movement of social historians began to challenge this way of understanding the past arguing that history be told from the bottom up for a while the populist streak was so dominant that mr ritchie jokes "you were much more likely to be interviewed if you were a fisherman than a member of parliament " today digital technology has allowed for every fisherman and every member of parliament to immortalize their stories with folks from all walks of life now making autobiographical podcasts historians in the future will be presented with the issue of how to separate the wheat from the chaff storycorps an ambitious national oral history project whose results can occasionally be heard on npr does some of this sorting providing a more structured opportunity for such recordings than youtube in soundbooths across the country americans can come in and record their stories for minutes which then get archived in the library of congress david isay the founder of storycorps describes the act of listening to the voice as "an adrenaline shot to the heart " the physical experience of hearing anothers words can bring an understanding that reading those words on a page simply cannot if you go to the library of congress web site you can listen to lloyd brown the last u s navy veteran of world war i who died earlier this year on the minute recording which he made at age mr brown offers a confession for posterity "i lied about my age i told them i was " he recalls in a southern drawl at he couldnt wait two years to join the navy "it was a matter of patriotism " so says the voice from history ms weiss is a robert l bartley fellow at the journal this summer
