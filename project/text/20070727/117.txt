recommend and sell their own pillow protectors as well whichever one you choose it should have the same mite stopping qualities as the pillows themselves in terms of fabric weave and stitching we ordered five standard size synthetic pillows choosing firm "side sleeper" models when we could easily find them and slept on each of them not always so well for a week we also inspected the seams on each pillow to see if they were double stitched as the aafa recommends making a small cut and examining the inside of a cover when only a single row of stitching was visible from the outside all of
