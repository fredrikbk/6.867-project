affected by wider than normal differences between the "bid" and "ask" prices traders said there was no shortage of activity in stocks in contrast trading volume of new york stock exchange listed shares set another record at an astounding billion shares the previous record was billion earlier in the week the dows drop of put the blue chip index at just days after setting a record in crossing for the first time at its nadir the dow was off nearly points yesterday the dow remains up for the year the standard &amp poors stock index matched the dows percentage drop falling to and the nasdaq composite index dropped to treasury bonds rallied as the risky corporate bonds declined the markets problems are a sign that the angst about risky subprime home loans which has shaken wall street
