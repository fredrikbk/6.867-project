the numbers guy its tough using data to blow the whistle on fixing games can numbers prove a referee is fixing games the fbi is investigating whether former national basketball association official tim donaghy bet on games or provided inside information to gamblers during the past two seasons since this news broke last week the media are using numbers to seek evidence of game fixing one focus is on so called over under bets in which the bettor gambles on whether the two teams combined points will be over or under a number set by the sports book among the reported findings mr donaghy worked in games last season for which bookmakers set the over under line at points or fewer in of those games the total was higher according to the sports gambling information site covers com such high scores could be the result of the fact that mr donaghys crews ranked near the top of the league in calling technical and personal fouls which give players the chance to shoot free throws while the clock is stopped the results in these over under bets are proof of abnormal referee calls according to one widely repeated claim but gathering suspicious numbers ex post facto is a questionable statistical technique referee performance can be quantified in dozens of ways over several time periods that makes it anomalous in itself not to find a single anomaly in any one refs performance which complicates the nbas goal of detecting compromised referees several statisticians have ideas for how to construct an early warning system but its not clear whether any formula would have fingered any suspicious referee "this opens up a potential pandoras box of false positives " says hal stern chairman of the department of statistics at the university of california irvine that reality hasnt slowed the search for suspect stats r j bell president of the sports gambling information site pregame com received wide coverage for news releases analyzing data on mr donaghy that focus on over under bets one pointed out that the over bet won in of or of donaghy games over the past two seasons mr bell told reporters that because the over bet won just of the time in mr donaghys prior two seasons such a transformation was a one in shot these claims rest on an assumption not yet proved a ref favorable to an over bet in one season will remain so the following season barring abnormal influences such as gambling certainly refs like any group of people have natural tendencies and the betting market cant adjust for those because the nba doesnt announce officiating assignments in advance but not all behavior is predictive a clutch hitter in baseball one season is no more likely than his teammates to hit well in tight spots the next season the same may well be true about refs who officiate over unexpectedly high scoring games in one season just look at the top officials who were found most likely to referee games in the season in which scoring exceeded the predicted total and who then returned the next season four of the were no longer in even the top half of all refs for the over bet mr donaghy himself wasnt consistent even before the period of suspicion the over bettors won just of his games in the two season period ended in but in the three years before that these bets won in of his games mr bell acknowledges that his choice of only the prior two seasons makes him subject to criticism that he is cherry picking figures but he adds "it feels kind of symmetrical" to establish mr donaghys tendencies with two prior seasons to evaluate the most recent two another failing of the numerical evidence against mr donaghy afflicts all team sports stats its tough to isolate his performance from the other two officials in each game in the past two seasons mr donaghys games had more technical fouls than any others but nba commissioner david stern said at a news conference this week that mr donaghy wasnt among the most likely refs to call technicals the league has access to internal data showing who blew the whistle on each call as part of its monitoring of officials that database hasnt incorporated gambling data yet when asked if the league would try to determine if a ref is fixing games mr stern told the media "its very hard but were going to give it our best shot " statisticians contacted for this column suggested creating a database incorporating both in game action and vegas gambling hunting for unexpected changes in ref behavior "at best though this system would simply indicate a refs games should be reviewed " says benjamin alamar editor of the journal of quantitative analysis in sports an nba spokesman and mr donaghys attorney declined to comment for this column brigham young university statistician shane reese demonstrated how such a system might work by examining all referees last season to see whether any of their results on over under bets were outside normal variation no refs would have tripped the switch on this warning system not even mr donaghy "theres nothing suggesting he was an outlier " says prof reese email me at numbersguy wsj com read daily commentary about numbers and join a discussion with readers at my free blog wsj com
