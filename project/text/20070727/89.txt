stocks tumble as wary investors reassess risks by bidding up stock prices all year investors were effectively betting the housing slowdown wouldnt engulf the broader economy yesterday that confidence appeared to be shaken stocks and corporate bond markets tumbled amid selling that was more widespread than during the three previous days of triple digit declines this month along with risky bonds and anything connected to the housing market investors sold off stocks emerging markets bonds and even high quality corporate debt the record trading volume in stocks reflected rising anxiety meanwhile roughly or nearly of the around stocks that trade on u s exchanges hit their lowest price of the past months to many investors that made yesterdays selloff more ominous than other big declines this year sid bakst a senior portfolio manager at investment firm robeco weiss peck &amp greer said the steady drip of bad news on subprime mortgage loans and the failure of some leveraged buyouts to get long term financing has made investors increasingly nervous "as each day has gone by things have been leaking a bit more " mr bakst said "but today there was full blown carnage " the dow jones industrial average sank points or to finish at after being down as much as points at midafternoon at the new york stock exchange trading curbs designed as safeguards against a crash remained in effect for nearly all of yesterdays trading session the selloff marked the biggest three day point drop for the dow industrials in five years and wiped &# billion off the averages market value the dow is clinging to an gain on the year but has already fallen this week including two daily drops of more than points the broader standard &amp poors stock index slid points or to leaving it up on the year the technology focused nasdaq composite index shed points or to and was up on the year and in a sign that investors are increasingly worried that small companies may be least able to weather the weaker economy that may lie ahead the russell index of small stocks fell points or to near its break even point for the year the decline of small capitalization stocks which had led the market for the past several years is also a signal that investors believe the pace of leveraged buyouts will slow in the coming months typically buyout firms snap up shares of small and midsize companies and many of these stocks were trading at prices that suggested they would be taken over yesterdays volume on the nations three major stock exchanges totaled billion shares up from the previous record which was set earlier this year the exchanges handled the heavy load with few hitches when volume is high investors take big market moves more seriously as investors sold stocks and corporate bonds they bought u s treasurys sending yields lower the yield on the year treasury note fell to its yield has declined a half percentage point in the past several weeks one of the markets biggest moves in recent years one bright spot in yesterdays markets was that lower treasury yields translate into lower mortgage rates which could put a cushion under the housing market but investors dont see lower mortgage rates as a panacea for the economy the moves in the stock and bond markets and discouraging news about home sales and orders for capital equipment led the federal funds futures markets where traders can bet on the federal reserves next move to conclude that the central bank is now much more likely to cut interest rates sometime this year the futures market is putting the odds of a rate cut as soon as september at it sees a quarter percentage point rate cut to as a near certainty by mid december of course the markets earlier this year anticipated the fed would cut rates only to be dissuaded by the vitality of the economy and fed chairman ben bernankes warnings about inflation pressures yesterday investors sold off stocks whose performance is tied to the ups and downs of the economy like energy companies industrials and basic materials companies a sign investors now think the economy will slow down those sectors were among the markets leaders this year sectors such as health care and small ticket consumer goods which hold up during times of economic weakness fell but fared better than the overall market energy stocks which were up on the year before yesterday led the way down after exxonmobil corp reported weaker than expected earnings the energy sector had accounted for roughly a third of the stock markets earnings growth over the past two years meaning high oil prices actually had a positive impact on stocks but now energy prices which have flirted with new highs recently are clearly a drag on the market the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market was clearly the factor that set off the cascade of declines investors fears have been heightened by the sheer complexity of collateralized debt obligations and other structured finance vehicles which makes it difficult for investors to judge just how bad conditions are in the subprime sector said arthur tetyevsky chief u s credit strategist at hsbc "now its a much broader much more nebulous much more intimidating issue for the market and thats adding to the duress that weve seen in the market " mr tetyevsky said cdos are investment vehicles that pool together mortgages and other assets and then spin off bonds that carry varying levels of risk by spreading to other markets the subprime mess is driving up interest rates for borrowers of all sorts which can lead to a credit crunch many bearish observers thought the housing slump might cause an economic slowdown by cutting into consumer spending which accounts for about two thirds of the u s economy consumer spending has held up reasonably well however and now worries about the economy are focused on whether tighter credit will undermine companies ability to borrow money so they can expand and keep boosting their stock values the impact of tighter credit is already apparent in the market for high grade debt yesterday for example tyco electronics ltd pulled a &# billion bond deal "due to unfavorable conditions in the debt markets " the company said selling bonds for a company like tyco which has put its past scandals behind it is normally a routine affair as another example mr tetyevsky pointed to the price action on a &# billion bundle of year bonds issued two weeks ago by lehman brothers holdings inc by yesterday the quoted yield on those bonds was roughly points above the yield on year treasurys widening from a spread of roughly points on wednesday and points back on july thats a big increase for the investment grade bond market and a sign that investors are nervous and want to get paid more for risking their money even on bonds that are considered to have a very low chance of default some analysts said the credit market which had rallied strongly for several years was due for a downturn rbc capital markets fixed income strategist t j marta said the high grade bond markets move may simply be a symptom of the air being let out of a credit bubble that had gotten too big "but the concern is that this is a fairly disorderly and hysterical move and that always carries the risk that you hit a tipping point where things get out of control " mr marta said juggling his phone on the floor of the new york stock exchange broker steven grasso weighed in on a stock market where investors fear has replaced greed as the most prominent emotion the bond market "is a huge concern " said mr grasso "its been overhanging the market new companies keep getting lumped into whats happening to subprime people thought it would be a handful of companies but were seeing a marketwide impact " mr grasso said many companies borrowing costs will go higher lowering their earnings rising borrowing costs also make leveraged buyouts which have helped fuel the run up in stocks more expensive that could remove another factor that has been propping up stock prices in recent months "the lbo chatter will come down to a low whisper " he predicted until recently emerging market bonds had largely weathered the turmoil in the u s and european credit markets thats a testament to the strong economic fundamentals and financial stability of many emerging economies but in another sign of the disquiet in the markets russian energy giant oao gazprom abruptly postponed a bond offering planned for yesterday "its kind of like catching a falling knife right now " said edwin gutierrez an emerging market portfolio manager at aberdeen asset managers in london of yesterdays trading "i wouldnt be in a hurry to add risk " u s investors awoke to overnight selling in key asian and european markets in addition the australian asset management firm absolute capital announced that it was halting withdrawals from two funds with about &# million in assets invested in credit instruments including cdos as the morning progressed the commerce department released data showing that new home sales in the u s fell in june more than quadruple the decline expected by economists in a survey by dow jones newswires the government also announced a smaller than expected rise of in june orders for big ticket items known as durable goods some investors appeared undeterred by the selloff larry reno a retired civil servant in fayetteville ga was tinkering on his recreational vehicle yesterday morning when he heard about the markets rout on the radio "today is like the day after christmas sale this is a buying opportunity " said mr reno who estimates his stock portfolio to be worth about &# mr reno who owns about stocks said he isnt concerned about the subprime mortgage market or the prospect for a weakening credit cycle "this is a flash in the pan its a great day to be in the market to increase positions " he said but mutual fund investors have picked up their selling as volatility has increased recently according to
