private equity firms was streamlining work forces " anxiety she says began rising in the blog mr clarke noted to employees that travelport intended to re engineer operations to reduce overlap and to eliminate "activities that are not contributing to our success " the company decided to overhaul the telecommunications center housed in centennial "we are automating work that was done manually " explains mr clarke within weeks of the buyout at a meeting with employees in centennial some managers warned that more cuts were coming ms covyeau says she began packing her boxes and told a manager "please just give me a severance package and let me out of here " one morning in october managers in centennial sent emails instructing employees to report to various conference rooms and cafeterias

tray of bagels and coffee and chortled "looks like this is our last supper " a manager told them their jobs were being cut for economic reasons according to several people who were there some employees burst into tears others stared stoically "i was devastated " recalls ms fugazzi who says she had planned to retire in four years "i had the mentality that if you worked hard you could keep your job forever " when they got back to their desks their email had been disabled guards lingered while employees filled boxes with belongings the company declined to provide written references in

about &# million in cost savings through the consolidation of sales staffs data centers and other operations mr clarke says in this years first quarter travelports profits were up over the year earlier period to &# million half of the profit improvement was because of revenue growth the company says was because of vendor related cost reductions and was from productivity improvements including reductions in the work force mr wilson says travelports debt load has made it more urgent to generate cash "if we can accelerate the reduction of our debt and therefore lessen our interest payments " he says "no one would expect management to do otherwise " with the worldspan merger looming employees at both companies say they are worried about their jobs "we are all on pins and needles
