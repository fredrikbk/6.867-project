weekend journal the weekend adviser not light in august august is vacation time and the book industry known for its "summer friday" short work days used to join in but increasingly publishers are shunning the beach and turning the month into a surprisingly busy time to release new titles next month publishers will put out works by prominent novelists such as medical thriller writer robin cook sci fi master william gibson and others its part of a move by several publishers and imprints that is making this once sleepy month a home for an increasing number of high profile fiction and serious nonfiction books scribner for one is increasing its august releases to books from seven last year doubleday which published only one book last august has eight going on sale next month one factor behind the move is the desire by some retailers in particular borders group to have more titles to sell in august these stores say they need new products in a month that has risen in the last years to become one of the two or three top months for bookstore sales jockeying with december and january according to commerce department data "i think publishers in their sluggish way heard all that and responded " says susan moldow scribners publisher publishers also say august books stand a better chance of getting reviewed by newspapers magazines and other outlets because there arent as many competing culture and arts stories then during august "you can sort of captivate the media " says doubledays publisher steve rubin the trend got a further boost with the success last summer of nora ephrons "i feel bad about my neck " which came out in august and remains on best seller lists with copies in print according to knopf and the terrorism history book "the looming tower" by lawrence wright which went on to win a pulitzer prize among major titles coming out next month ballantine will launch "loving frank" by nancy horan a novel about a married womans affair with frank lloyd wright putnam which had a february hit with mr gibsons "pattern recognition " has chosen to publish his latest "spook country " in august algonquin which began releasing books in august last summer after doing so only very rarely before is releasing three books including the novel "an arsonists guide to writers homes in new england" by brock clark yet the august shift works against another industry trend releasing more titles in the fall to generate holiday sales doubleday for instance moved three titles originally slated for fall including kate christensens new novel "the great man" to august to get a jump on sales in the less competitive period before labor day but that period may not be less competitive for long says jonathan burnham harpercollinss publisher "the big fall release date has been inching forward " he says "but now the problem is that everybody is starting to grab that slot " quick hits music ugly duckling opera a snaggle toothed welsh cellphone salesman is poised to make a splash at some u s record retailers next week even though his cd of opera solos isnt officially supposed to come out until september in june paul potts became the ugly duckling winner of the british tv competition "britains got talent" with his rendition of the puccini aria "nessun dorma " the victory made the year old an instant celebrity in the u k where his cd "one chance " made its debut last week at the top of the british album chart but footage of his performance has also ricocheted around the internet one clip has been viewed more than eight million times on youtube exceeding any other youtube video uploaded in the last month the result some u s fans appear willing to shell out about &# for an imported version of mr pottss cd that will be available next week even though the tv show he appeared on has not aired in the u s and his delivery has won him scorn among some opera buffs "one chance" has climbed into the top cds on both amazon and barnes &amp nobles u s web sites based on presales higher on amazon a spokesman says than musicians such as amy winehouse and lily allen achieved when their albums were available only as imports those rankings wont translate directly into major sales because cd sales through internet retailers represent only a sliver of total album sales and mr potts wont be hitting the billboard charts at least not until september
