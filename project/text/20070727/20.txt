chinese government is corrupt not the people i agree with emily parker that the results of the "anything for a profit" culture in china is dangerous and abhorrent but i must challenge her conclusion that the underlying reason for this is that the chinese as a people are somehow ethically and morally devoid as a result of communism "made in china editorial page july as she points out the chinese themselve suffer more than others and self preservation is not a government produced trait the communist government is at fault not because it is an atheist government but because it is a centralized totalitarian government that completely controls all information and over which the citizens have no power im sure most workers do not even know what chemicals go into the products they make and certainly the media there will not report on it im quite certain that if the people were informed and had a means to vote on issues that concerned them they would demonstrate their outrage and the situation would change as it did here in the u s in the early s since this is not an option then the solution is for the u s and other countries to vote with their pocketbooks to boycott chinese products until it can be assured that the products are not harmful however americas own "anything for a profit" culture will make this difficult as the cost of toothpaste will go up lisa walker thornwood n y
