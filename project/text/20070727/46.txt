high rise relics ghost structures haunt bangkok abandoned in bust rusting projects loom the sv garden tower mess bangkok one recent steamy afternoon a shirtless man named nop tossed out chunks of putrid meat for the dozen stray dogs that share his home an open air encampment inside the unfinished story sathorn unique tower ten years ago sathorn unique was destined to be one of the citys glitziest addresses today its corinthian columns and four story arches are nearly lost amid a tangle of trees and vines although workers completed the buildings basic structure all the way to the top its concrete shell starts to peter out about stories up leaving exposed metal and a half finished dome on the roof steel bars jut out in all directions and mounds of refuse litter the grounds inside two out of service escalators climb to nowhere and the smell of urine is overpowering but at least nop says "the building wont collapse " the building is one of a dozen or more major "ghost" structures that haunt bangkoks skyline many of them were started in the mid s when thailands economy was booming developers envisioned a city of gleaming office and residential skyscrapers symbolic of the nations rapid development not that long before the tallest buildings in the city were buddhist temples then thailand sank into a swamp of reckless investments and unpaid debts that became known as the asian financial crisis the countrys economy contracted in and many of the building projects came to a crashing halt in the decade since thailand has more or less recovered the economy is growing again traffic gridlock has returned to the streets of the capital and shiny new malls are sprouting up everywhere but many of those who failed in the crisis either cant be bothered or cant afford to restart their building projects leaving bangkok with more modern ruins than probably any other big city in the world according to architectural experts they include four steel skeletons of stories or more rotting along a busy roadway by bangkoks chao phraya river another story high rise in the middle of the central business district is covered in graffiti of octopuses and space aliens an ugly pile of rust covered steel beams and concrete pillars sits next to one of bangkoks most fashionable hotels then theres the unfinished elevated commuter train whose hundreds of abandoned rail supports march through the city like giant dominoes the so called "hopewell" rail project died in too courts and government officials havent been eager to force bankrupt owners to unload their properties or resolve ongoing legal disputes which could have paved the way for faster redevelopment many influential families were able to hang onto their dud assets after the crash even after it became clear they would never restart them in thailands labyrinthine bureaucracy it can be hard to trace the last owners of the projects and government officials routinely refuse to disclose information about them bangkok also has plenty of land so it is easier for developers to sidestep the ruins of yesteryear instead of tearing them down thailands mellow brand of buddhism may even play a role some say because it leaves people somewhat complacent about the unfinished buildings despite the occasional chunks of metal and steel that rain down during storms "maybe for us theyre great eyesores because americans cant deal with things that are unresolved " says paul katz a principal at kohn pedersen fox architects in new york who has spent time in bangkok "but asian cultures understand the world isnt perfect everything isnt always finished " mr katz describes the buildings as "poetic " adding theyre "not completely boring to look at especially when things start growing out of them " most of the or more high rises left unfinished when the crisis struck have been completed among them the story neoclassical state tower which sat empty and forlorn for years but now sports one of asias swankiest open air restaurants on top but as many as one fifth of the projects that were interrupted in central bangkok are still not completed and many may never be some dont really count as full fledged urban ruins since they were in the very early stages of development when work ceased for the big ones its becoming increasingly difficult to restart work engineers say many incomplete towers cant survive much longer than years in bangkoks blistering tropical heat and rain before suffering significant structural damage the buildings wont necessarily fall down but the cost of repairing or reinforcing their rusted out beams becomes prohibitively high for many people here the buildings have become just another part of the urban landscape thai students study them for school projects artists incorporate them into their work in one gallery show called "ghosttransmissions " a group of local and foreign artists including a thai who calls himself "duck unit" featured video and sound recordings from the vacant buildings architecture fans track the buildings progress or lack of it on a number of web sites some people are living in the buildings or in their shadows damri tungsirimitra a year old contract laborer lives in a house about feet from the perimeter of the sathorn unique tower on a recent day mr damri was drying fish stomach in a basket while his family hung laundry on the chain link fence around the building mr damri pointed to a jagged piece of wood with rusted nails hanging from the tower overhead sooner or later a wind storm will set that relic free he says a piece of metal from the building already crashed through the roof of a nearby parking lot and smashed into a car below at sv garden a city within a city along bangkoks chao phraya river sasamon julasophonsri a year old food vendor lives just under the hulking ruins behind a white picket fence on the ground floor of the vast unfinished development flakes of rusted steel break off from support beams impenetrable messes of green weeds encroach from all sides stray dogs wander around at night thieves steal up by boat and carve out chunks of the exposed metal that protrude from concrete walls "i fear if they cut any more it will collapse and fall on my house " ms sasamon says launched by a thai conglomerate called sv group and a hong kong architect named eric lai sv garden was supposed to help transform the area into bangkoks new financial center the developers were so confident that they decided to build multiple towers some more than stories high all at the same time they blanketed the city in advertising and pre sold a large percentage of the condominium units but in early one of the projects lenders failed triggering a freeze on funding mr lai recalls in an interview the developers eventually stopped construction leaving the shells of four major towers partly clad in concrete condo buyers were furious mr lai and others had to scramble to sort out the mess eventually the case moved into the hands of a thai bankruptcy court which appointed an independent administrator to manage a reorganization at about the same time new investors considered redeveloping the project people familiar with the matter say but some of the creditors held out for a better deal and now some condominium owners refuse to consider anything less than a full return on their investment no serious new investor has emerged sv group which is linked to a powerful thai family continues to run a large steel company it didnt respond to requests for comment as he picked at a tuna sandwich in a bangkok hotel cafe mr lai said he lost "a lot" of money in the project but declined to be specific he says hes no longer involved in sv garden but still hopes it will flourish someday "over time it gets more difficult " he admits "but i hope it happens " in the meantime he is developing projects in malaysia and pattaya a busy beach resort southeast of bangkok wilawan watcharasakwet contributed to this
