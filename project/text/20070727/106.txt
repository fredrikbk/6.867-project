weekend journal review books hail to the veep cheney by stephen f hayes harpercollins pages &# few people confuse the washington establishment more than dick cheney before becoming vice president he had always been the kind of low key pragmatic republican that democrats and the press liked when he served in congress he had been a protege of moderate republican leader bob michel and a member of a group of centrist republicans known as "the wednesday group " he was tight with james baker and brent scowcroft pillars of the realist school of republican foreign policy heck he had been gerald fords chief of staff how did this sane sober voice on foreign policy turn into the darth vader of the bush white house today mr cheney has become the personification of virtually everything people dont like about the bush administration he is a war monger puppet master advocate of torture manipulator of intelligence and the center of an endless supply of conspiracy theories as gen scowcroft his old friend lamented "ive known dick cheney for thirty years but i dont know dick cheney anymore " not long ago a prominent foreign policy expert in washington who has also known dick cheney for years told me seriously that he thought the change could be chemical that somehow when mr cheney had his pacemaker installed in june it triggered a reaction that affected his brain and drained him of his common sense stephen hayes doesnt explore the pacemaker theory but "cheney the untold story of americas most powerful and controversial vice president" is the most serious effort yet to understand the cheney enigma mr hayes has an advantage over others who have struggled with this subject mr cheney actually talked to him and so did many of his usually tight lipped advisers the result is a detailed and sympathetic portrait but one that will leave mr cheneys erstwhile friends still confused mr hayes finds more consistency than change in mr cheneys positions and style over the years for one thing mr cheneys temperament was moderate but his politics never were "i had a very conservative voting record more conservative than most people realized " mr cheney says "the press never looked at my voting record they thought i was all warm and fuzzy and they never looked to see " there is one important theme on which mr cheney has been especially consistent a matter that has animated much of his work as vice president preserving if not expanding the power of the presidency this has been something of an obsession for mr cheney going back to his early days in the ford administration he urged president ford to fight proposed reforms to the cia coming out of the church committee because they amounted to "legislative encroachment on executive power " it was an argument he would make over and over again during the course of his career in the early s when he was defense secretary during the first gulf war he argued unsuccessfully that the president should not seek congressional authorization to use force the president he said is the commander in chief and congress "a great debating society " and he has never been shy about threatening military force in while he was just a freshman member of the house mr cheney criticized president carters handling of the iranian hostage crisis with words that seem to perfectly reflect his approach to the current stand off over irans nuclear program "my major criticism is president carters repeated public statements that he will not use force to resolve the situation " mr cheney told a local paper in wyoming "although he might decide not to use force he should not make his decision known once you remove the threat of force you remove any incentive for the iranians to free the hostages " still mr cheneys old friends cant understand how the longtime realist could become a central player in a foreign policy dedicated to the idea of promoting democracy in the past mr cheney took a realpolitik approach to dealing with tyrants in the middle east emphasizing stability and access to oil not human rights and democracy he opposed overthrowing saddam hussein in for example saying "the question in my mind is how many additional american casualties is saddam worth and the answer is not very damned many " mr cheney tells mr hayes why his views on saddam in particular and the middle east in general have shifted so dramatically "americans werent going to die based on who was governing in iraq or most other places over there " he says "that changed on " but mr hayes also suggests that mr cheneys support for the "reform process" in the middle east falls short of president bushs notion that the u s can or should spread democracy around the world "cheney is a cautionary voice on the prospects for democratic reforms " he writes mr hayes put the question directly to president bush is mr cheney as "passionate" about democratic reform as you are "theres no question that he brings a kind of a caution about of being unrealistic about how fast democracy can take hold in certain societies " mr bush replied he stammered on for a bit more and then gave up telling mr hayes "im not sure how to answer the question of how he stands relative to me " donald rumsfeld looms large in the books early chapters without him it seems there would be no dick cheney after a rocky first encounter on capitol hill when mr cheney was little more than a congressional intern "i thought he was an arrogant abrasive young congressman " mr cheney remembers mr rumsfeld becomes directly responsible for all mr cheneys big breaks he hires him for two different jobs in the nixon administration when mr rumsfeld becomes president fords chief of staff he makes mr cheney his deputy later when mr rumsfeld is named defense secretary he persuades president ford to name the year old cheney as his replacement in years mr cheney goes from being a yale dropout who is twice arrested for drunk driving to the youngest white house chief of staff in history its during these years as mr rumsfelds protege that mr cheneys political ideology takes form he becomes like mr rumsfeld minus the arrogance and abrasiveness but mr rumsfeld nearly vanishes from mr hayess narrative during the iraq war as the insurgency gained strength in and mr hayes suggests mr cheney became frustrated with a pentagon war strategy that he believed was too timid at the time mr rumsfeld was arguing against sending more troops saying that we should "take the hand off the bicycle seat" and force the iraqis to take more responsibility in the white house though mr cheney was pushing for an early "surge " as president bush tells mr hayes "cheney was a more troops man " but did mr cheney ever talk about more troops with mr rumsfeld unfortunately mr hayes doesnt ask him mr rumsfeld doesnt reappear in his narrative until mr bush decides to fire him in november its one of the few bush decisions that mr cheney is prepared to admit publicly he strongly disagreed with if mr cheney had any disagreements with mr rumsfeld they were apparently trumped by personal loyalty mr cheney calls his long time mentor "the greatest defense secretary in history " the one area where mr cheney has indisputably changed is in his relations with the press mr hayes tells some comic stories about the practical jokes that mr cheney used to play on the white house press corps during the ford years the reporters liked him he seemed to get along with them and he received good press as chief of staff congressman and defense secretary now mr cheney has cut himself off almost completely from the washington press corps during the campaign for example he refused to give the new york times a seat on his plane reporters from major news organizations routinely travel with the president and vice president the banishment of the times was not an isolated incident mr hayes reveals that mr cheney had also ordered his staff to kick ap reporter laura meckler off his plane in the middle of a trip ms mecklers transgression was writing a single story that mr cheney felt had twisted his words the staff gently suggested that it would be a bad idea to leave an associated press reporter stranded at a campaign stop mr cheney agreed to allow her to stay on the plane until he returned to washington but added "i dont have time for this s t i dont want her on the plane again " mr hayess biography is not entirely uncritical he portrays mr cheney as "a fanatic for secrecy" and writes that in the wake of the valerie plame case the vice presidents office became "a seedbed of paranoia " mr cheney has never been more isolated mr hayes quotes former democratic rep lee hamilton a longtime cheney admirer lamenting that mr cheney who was once widely respected by both parties rarely talks to democrats anymore some people dislike mr cheney because he has been effective in pushing policies they disagree with but even mr hayess positive portrayal makes it clear that mr cheneys image problem is about more than politics secrecy and isolation have come with a price conspiracy theorists have filled the void and that goes a long way toward explaining how a soft spoken pragmatist a man once so well liked has come to be seen as the darth vader of the white house mr karl is senior national security correspondent for abc news
