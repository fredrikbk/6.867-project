david von drehle while there are reasons to be concerned about boys achievement boys by many measures are actually faring as well or better than their fathers or even their older cousins says mr drehle academics and cultural critics started declaring a boy crisis in the late s as boys began to trail girls in a host of academic measures bad behavior among boys increased including drug use violence and sexual promiscuity the debate over boys performance has turned up culprits ranging from school reforms to coddling parents to a videogame soaked culture meanwhile experts continue to disagree about the extent of the problem in the view of one education policy analyst a good news story about the achievements of girls and young women has been turned into a bad news story about laggard boys and young men mr von drehle says a recently released federal report shows there were good reasons for worrying about boys bad behavior in the s at the same time he finds in the report

d studies only of ph d students complete their degrees years after their enrollment some observers say this represents a waste of resources but other education experts believe that students who take more than a decade to complete their ph d shouldnt be written off as failures john gravois writes in the chronicle of higher education that a new study by the council of graduate schools suggests that graduate students who spend years in school arent necessarily a lost cause in the social sciences and humanities where students tend to take more time to complete their degrees than in the sciences the percentage of students who have completed their degrees "slowly but doggedly continues to rise" even into the eighth ninth and th years of study some students in the social sciences and humanities complete their work after even or years those results says mr gravois call into question whether universities should set time limits on doctoral study as some currently do essentially writing off other ph d candidates as "noncompleters " the study also might prompt schools to focus more on why some students take so long to finish their degrees the study disputed several other long held beliefs about graduate study including the idea that ph d students are more likely to complete their degrees in smaller doctoral programs than in larger ones program size has little impact overall the study found the same is true about completion rates in private versus public universities while researchers had thought that private schools ph d programs had higher completion rates presumably because of ampler financial resources the study found little difference between the two types of institutions the chronicle of higher education july israel religious rules on marriage keep immigrants from altar
