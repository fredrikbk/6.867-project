gap picks canadian retailing veteran as ceo gap inc has turned to another industry outsider as it struggles to regain the magic that made khakis cool and brought casual friday to the workplace in the s after a lengthy search the apparel retailer named glenn murphy a canadian retailing veteran as its new chief executive officer mr murphy years old has a background in many types of retailing from pharmacy to food to books yet he lacks experience in designing and marketing apparel raising questions about whether he will be able to turn around gap and old navy two enormous chains that despite languishing in recent years still dominate their industry with huge sales volumes in some ways the choice of mr murphy echoes the decision to hire former chief executive paul pressler who was similarly skilled at improving operations but also had limited apparel experience however mr murphy does have a much broader retail background running larger and more complex chains than mr pressler had before he joined gap most recently mr murphy spent six years as chairman and chief executive of shoppers drug mart the largest drugstore chain in canada with more than stores and sales of &# billion last year that business is considerably smaller than gap which has more than locations and posted sales of nearly &# billion for its fiscal year ended feb before joining shoppers drug mart mr murphy held several executive positions at loblaw cos the leading retail and wholesale food company in canada he also served as president and chief executive of chapters a large canadian book retailer his challenges at gap will be formidable sales and net income have declined two years in a row some analysts believe the retailer which besides gap and old navy operates the banana republic chain needs to close hundreds of stores to regain its cachet with shoppers gap has struggled to recapture the popularity it attained in the late s when customers snapped up khakis during the widespread shift to casual business attire old navy meanwhile has been plagued by competition from discounters such as target corp which have improved their fashions and offer lower prices mr murphy succeeds robert j fisher who had been interim chief executive since january when mr pressler resigned though mr pressler had run the disney stores chain when he was an executive at walt disney co he lacked a strong apparel background mr pressler cut expenses and restored gaps balance sheet but during his tenure the company was unable to consistently design appealing merchandise although mr fisher was a longtime gap executive and is the son of gap founder donald fisher he said from the beginning that he was not interested in taking the ceo role permanently robert fisher has said that gap needs to make faster decisions cut through its bureaucracy and hire and retain creative talent to turn around the company in recent months gap has cut jobs in an attempt to streamline its management structure it also closed its forth &amp towne chain aimed at baby boomer women gaps board search committee had indicated a preference for an apparel executive in january the committee said in a statement that it was looking for someone with "deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel who understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline " gaps choice of mr murphy as ceo is perhaps not as surprising as it first seems "because we have an acute dearth of talent to take that job " said hal reiter chairman and ceo of herbert mines associates inc a new york search firm that specializes in the retail industry "there are very few senior level executives who have the competency to run the gap " mr reiter said of those who have the talent many are hindered by noncompete provisions in their contracts he said further complicating his task mr murphy is taking the helm of a business "different in size scope and scale" from shoppers drug mr reiter continued "he has many more and much smaller stores he also has three distinct brands where design and sourcing determine profitability " other retail industry recruiters were dubious about gaps choice because mr murphy lacks apparel experience "the gap does need somebody with a sense of the product who understands fashion " but no one knows if its new leader "has an affection for clothing " said elaine hughes owner of e a hughes &amp co a retail search boutique in new york at shoppers drug mr murphy earned high marks for turning around the business by cutting costs and improving margins during his tenure the companys earnings per share doubled he also improved the canadian retailer by using cheaper offshore sources introducing in store clinics near pharmacies and adding more fashionable cosmetics brands such as chanel and shiseido according to an acquaintance mr murphys experience upgrading stores could prove useful at gap which has acknowledged that it let its gap and old navy stores become tired cluttered and confusing to shoppers industry experts have said though that customers wont return until gap improves its fashions the fact that mr murphy has been successful at a wide range of retailers "shows he has a creative mind " said mark montagna a retail analyst with cl king &amp associates however he characterized his impression of the decision as "neutral" and said he expected investor reaction to be minimal adding "its not like theyre grabbing a marquee guy out of the apparel world " in a filing with the securities and exchange commission gap said mr murphy will receive an annual salary of &# million a signing bonus of &# million a pro rated target bonus for the companys current fiscal year and annual performance bonuses targeted at of his salary in addition he will receive four million stock options half those options will be priced at of the fair market value of the stock on his start date with gap so that they will have no value to mr murphy if the stock price does not rise after he joins gap he also is slated for a target award of one million "performance" shares that will depend on gap improving its earnings over time the retailer said a "significant" portion of his compensation "will require sustained improvements in the companys performance " mr murphy expresses optimism "i believe in these brands and i think its important to lead by example and make a personal investment in the company " he said he plans to purchase gap shares in the next few weeks
