put on review for possible downgrade by moodys investors service according to regulatory filings the complex securities known as "structured investment vehicles" or sivs have been at the heart of turmoil in the markets due to a difficulty in selling some of them the recent batch of regulatory filings show just how widely these sivs have filtered into money market funds which are considered among the safest investments around sivs typically raise money by selling short term debt and using it to buy higher yielding long term securities funds recently holding some of the sivs include some from barclays plcs barclays global investors ubs ag charles schwab corp deutsche bank ag bny hamilton funds and morgan stanley the funds range in asset size from &# billion to &# billion and hold about to of their investments in some of the sivs while these are very small percentages they can theoretically still pose a risk thats because if even a relatively small sliver of a money market funds assets were to lose all of its value a fund could technically be termed to have "broken the buck " or violated the requirement to maintain a &# a share value to be sure no money market fund has broken the buck in the recent market turmoil in addition nobody is expecting sivs to lose all their value and they have underlying collateral that will pay investors nevertheless analysts are paying attention "no matter what the exposure if its a penny or millions dollars were keeping our eye on it " says peter rizzo an analyst at standard &amp poors whose team reviews money funds rated by them

masons money funds exposure to sivs continues to come down as paper matures and pays " on friday moodys placed sivs on review for a possible downgrade a downgrade could require the managers to take remedial measures to prevent the funds from losing value the funds managers should ideally already be evaluating the securities "to ensure that they still represent minimal credit risk to the portfolio " said henry shilling an analyst of money funds at moodys if the funds managers and board are confident that the security in fact will pay up the fund can continue to hold the securities fund companies holding the sivs that are on review say they are confident that these securities will pay up on maturity besides these are only a small percentage of the funds and many funds have now stopped buying securities issued by sivs in a report issued last month standard &amp poors ratings services estimated that among the plus u s money funds it tracks siv exposure had come down in two
