agreement limiting how she spoke about her departure her attorney said the otherwise effective technique could have been hassle free broadcasting bad news about your job is a bad idea "i am a prolific networker " the dismissed executive said in an interview but in hindsight she concedes the emotionally charged email "wasnt the most professional or politic way to do it " everyone knows you must network to find work following a job loss too often however unemployed people make networking missteps prolonging a job hunt a common flub involves name dropping without knowing how a contact feels
