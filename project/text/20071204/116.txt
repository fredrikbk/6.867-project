the game debt reckoning is also looming for lbo shops overpaying for deals aided by loose credit puts borrowers at risk wall street has been roiled by the declining value of exotic securities that were tied to the housing boom it might also want to explore the valuation of paper tied to another boom leveraged buyouts private equity firms the envy of securities firms a few months ago have plowed billions of dollars investing in companies that they believed they could turn around and flip for a fat profit but figuring out the value of that equity isnt easy understood only by a caste of spreadsheet priests "i am not going to answer your question directly " is how blackstone group president tony james put it on the firms latest conference call soon investors in private equity funds and the employees who work in their portfolio companies will be making some very fundamental queries how much did private equity firms aided by the wall street debt machine overpay for the deals done in and what would the likes of a univision freescale semiconductor or canadian phone company bce fetch if they were auctioned today as opposed to the debt debauched days of yore they would be "hard pressed to achieve those valuations again " says jake newman a media analyst at research firm creditsights ltd or as one banker succinctly put it yesterday "no way " that matters immensely if a recession is around the corner because companies may not be able to meet their basic financial requirements such as servicing debt or funding new investment and in deals that depend on rolling asset sales to reduce leverage such as univisions struggling auction of its music group declining valuations make life all the more difficult of course private equity firms have the luxury of waiting out bad markets and the terms of their debt packages were excessively forgiving its a long stretch to say that overpaying for a company leads to bankruptcy but it can destroy the lifeblood of the private equity industry returns "their returns are less likely to be double digit " mr newman says "they wont be able to get out of investments as soon as they want and there will be some that fail " consider how pricing has changed over the past few years during the first half of leveraged buyout targets went on average for a price times their cash flows according to a j p morgan analysis in the figure was times and only times in fueling this surge of course was wall street which in the form of guaranteed financing was essentially subsidizing ever higher prices on that same conference call last month blackstones mr james explained the effect this can have its a helpful summary of the interplay between leverage price and return "when leverage ratios go up all that benefit is instantly reflected in a higher price and it instantly goes to the seller of the asset not to the buyer of the asset the buyer of the asset takes more risk arguably because there is more leverage for a comparable return " mr james is acutely sensitive to this dynamic as blackstone went public in the middle of this lbo binge blackstone shares are off since the ipo and the company needs to convince investors that asset prices will recover in the years ahead the best test could come soon as last night blackstone filed to list portfolio company travelport on the london stock exchange it bought travelport just months ago meantime many lbo linked senior loans are trading for as low as cents on the dollar a level that historically indicates "stress " according to reuters loan pricing corp univisions first lien paper is trading at cents of par while freescale semiconductors term loan is changing hands at cents reuters says that is a big discount for the most secure piece of the capital structure and a sign that equity positions may already be under pressure consider the case of radio and billboard company clear channel communications inc which agreed to a &# billion buyout from bain capital thomas h lee partners and the companys management earlier this year the deal became a symbol of shareholder discontent as investors could barely stomach a price equivalent to about times its cash flow according to data from capitaliq how different that price looks today as the waves of debt have long since receded from the market and the outlook for radio stocks hasnt improved by much one of the best comparables to clear channel cbs corp is today trading at about times cash flow while outdoor advertising companies such as jc decaux sa are trading at times cash flow blend all those valuations together and today clear channel might fetch around times on the market some people close to the deal say does this spell disaster for clear channel a person close to the buyers said they were confident with the investment and some in the clear channel camp say the valuation could be higher noting that some outdoor advertising firms are fetching times sales and the best radio firms a multiple of about whats more its impossible to predict how the investment might evolve say three years from now so far however that deal and plenty of others are starting out with a kind of yard penalty for overpayment its now time to see if these new private owners can grind out first downs email dennis berman wsj com get a complete daily view of the world of deals and deal making at wsj com
