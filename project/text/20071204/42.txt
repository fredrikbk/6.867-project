financing entrepreneur curt schillings unfair advantage online edition from marketwatch two sharply dressed something entrepreneurs mark rukavina and curt schilling came to a conference last week in the heart of silicon valley to talk about why a venture capitalist should take a chance with the fledgling start up companies they each created at the sofitel hotel tucked between the massive oracle corp campus and highway rukavina and schilling were among dozens of entrepreneurs that got their turn in the spotlight in front of an audience of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs one of them though had an "unfair advantage " schilling is a baseball player perhaps bound for the hall of fame fresh from earning his third world series championship and the biggest celebrity to ever roll into a venturewire sponsored conference the buzz his presence created doesnt compare to opening day at fenway park but it did turn normally mild mannered venture capitalists into giddy schoolboys hoping to shake the hand that catapults a baseball miles per hour even rukavina sitting anonymously yesterday at a round table in the main ballroom hours before presenting the business plan of scottsdale ariz based imemories inc said he was "kicking himself" for scheduling a meeting during schillings on stage interview "im so upset im going to miss it " he said "he helped us in arizona to win a world championship so im very appreciative of what hes been able to do " by comparison rukavina is a virtual unknown in public though he has worked the silicon valley circuit before and made a small fortune with two other start ups mastering computers inc which went public and then sold to platinum technology inc in and knowledgenet inc which sold to thomson corp in now hes put &# million into his latest venture a promising company that converts vhs home movies into dvds the only executive listed among the companys employees rukavina came to the consumer technology innovations conference alone no entourage or even a handler just a slick multimedia show rukavina would use during two minute presentations he and several other start up chiefs were assigned in breakout sessions schilling the founder of maynard mass based online gaming start up studios inc flew in the night before with chief executive brett close chief operating officer bill thomas and art director todd mcfarlane the famed comic book artist and writer the night before that he must have felt like a rock star on the red carpet in boston with other red sox teammates at the premiere of the world series video produced by major league baseball wednesday morning he stood next to the breakfast buffet in the conference networking area of the sofitel hotel awaiting his one on one interview on the big stage a rare opportunity for an executive of a start up that has yet to develop a product there he was a man idolized by millions of baseball fans huddled with his other co workers at a geeky tech conference on this day clad in a sharp suit and with neatly combed hair he looked like the other attendees except perhaps for his athletic " frame it was about minutes before go time and schilling heartily shook hands with all those that came up to him graciously chatting with them about the sox and his start up and patiently signing autographs one fellow entrepreneur told schilling that while he was a big yankee fan for which schilling joked "we all have our own crosses to bear" his wife was an even bigger red sox fan and he couldnt pass up the opportunity to get her an autograph a day earlier in roughly the same spot where schilling was standing rukavina was eyeing the snacks on the afternoon buffet table and pouring some coffee he had just emerged from his company presentation and now he stood alone energizing himself before he would do it all over again an hour later at that earlier presentation rukavina in a polished manner meticulously illustrated how imemories uses state of the art technology in an square foot studio to convert old home movie films photographs and slides into nearly organized digital archives since being founded last year imemories has gained plus customers in arizona and will generate nearly &# million in sales this year now he needs to find a lead investor for a &# million round to help take the company national he said his customers mostly in the to year old range are eager to digitize their old videotapes before they degrade with six other start ups presenting in other rooms at the same time the crowd was spread thin about people sat in during rukavinas first presentation and no one asked questions at the end save for one by a journalist in the back rukavina said he is confident hell find a lead investor though there wasnt any buzz surrounding his start up on this day in tuesdays last panel discussion in which four venture capitalists buzzed about the best of the start ups they saw in the breakout sessions no one mentioned imemories schilling however had no problems drawing attention walking onto the stage of the grand ballroom amid enthusiastic applause schilling answered questions for minutes in front of a packed house of more than venture capitalists and entrepreneurs there were no flashy multimedia productions just candid curt and his star power to the disappointment of some in the room schilling offered very little about the massively multiplayer online game or various tie in products that will come out of a square foot studio because "a couple of guys would jump out of their seats and stop me if i went in depth " instead he mostly talked about how he got in the business how he assembled an executive roster that he believes is "the equivalent of the yankees " and the "unfair advantage" that gets him meetings with investors or onstage at a big tech conference "when i first talked about my plans for studios we had vcs lining up from boston to maynard " schilling said "yeah star power will get me the meeting but five minutes in that goes away and they want to hear all about the business plan and you better be able to talk in depth " but schilling isnt george foreman a famous athlete looking to slap his name on something and sell a product he knows little about schillings a self professed hardcore massively multiplayer online gamer who "hangs out" with his three sons while on the road during the baseball season by playing an mmo game with them online for years hes had a grand dream to create his own gaming studio and now after earning millions of dollars and one more year in baseball he hopes to create "world domination through gaming " as his business card states and to his credit he understands that while hes the leader of the company hell leave it to the hired guns to run the day to day operations "the company runs better when im not meddling put me on the mound feet away from a hitter and im going to beat him but im out of my element here and ill be the first one to admit it " and he admits hes got a lot to learn about business "i thought burn rate was something regarding a fastballs velocity but i learned it was heinous number that ill hate the rest of my life " after his on stage interview schilling signed a couple more autographs shook a few more hands and then headed off to meetings with various companies like apple inc lucas arts and electronic arts inc before a flight back to boston rukavina meanwhile hoped to court vcs during his stay in silicon valley like most other entrepreneurs here hell likely have to line up to talk to them yes schilling may hold an "unfair advantage" over rukavina but as schilling knows from his playing days in the end its the best team not the person that wins scott austin is assistant managing editor of
