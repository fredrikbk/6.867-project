some cry foul over relief plan for borrowers homeowners say rate freeze would penalize the prudent perpetuate property bubble the bush administrations plan to give subprime borrowers a break on their mortgages is already catching flak from an unexpected source other homeowners treasury secretary henry paulson at a housing conference yesterday said he is "aggressively pursuing" an agreement with lenders and investor groups to freeze rates on subprime adjustable rate mortgages at their original levels the proposal aimed at helping homeowners who would fall behind in their payments at higher rates is designed to prevent a surge in foreclosures next year about million subprime adjustable rate mortgages are scheduled to reset to higher rates in but as outlines of the plan become known some homeowners are complaining that the effort isnt fair to borrowers who didnt overextend themselves others argue that the government shouldnt be involved in perpetuating a housing bubble that needs to deflate a key question how far should you go to help borrowers who cant pay their bills "people have to be responsible for their own actions " says harry lancz a small business owner in traverse city mich he holds a pair of fixed rate mortgages one for his primary residence which has been for sale for six months and one for a second home in louisiana "what are you going to do when their credit cards get due and they cant pay are you going to bail them out on that too " like many homeowners mr lancz is skeptical that the plan will actually lessen the impact of the housing crisis "unless you give them the money this is just postponing the inevitable " he says "the more the government steps in the more things get into a deeper quagmire " even some subprime borrowers object to the plan justin miller a year old mortgage broker in coral springs fla says he made a bad investment decision when he bought a &# oceanfront home last december with two subprime loans but hes committed to making the &# in monthly payments and the higher payments once the rates go up "a lot of people are trying to point fingers and get themselves out of something they put themselves into " he says "i put myself in this position i need to find a way to make it work " mr miller says that the rate freeze proposal reminds him of a television commercial the announcer asks "do you owe back taxes " a client responds "i settled for half of what i owe " says mr miller "hows that fair everything seems to be backward " the paulson plan wouldnt help subprime mortgage holders who can afford the higher payments in addition it wont help those who cant manage to make their payments even at current rates because of that some consumer advocates say the plan doesnt go far enough in helping troubled borrowers "this only deals with one of the easiest of the categories" of borrowers says mike shea executive director of acorn housing corp a national housing counseling organization "it will do nothing to help those people who are currently delinquent and facing foreclosure " mr shea praises mr paulson for trying but points out for example that some mortgage loan servicers already are freezing rates for five to seven years so a grace period shorter than that in the governments proposal could be a step backward proponents of the plan say it would prevent the housing sector from derailing the rest of the u s economy in addition they say that "predatory" lenders not just careless borrowers are responsible for the mess and that homeowners shouldnt necessarily lose their homes as a result but some would be homeowners who have been waiting for house prices to fall say the government proposal would prop up prices and thus keep them out of the market "ive been trying to do what i would consider the right thing " says daniel theda a product manager for a manufacturer in vancouver wash who has been saving for two years to buy a home "its kind of frustrating when all of a sudden these guys come and say were going to bail out people " he says he lost several hundred thousand dollars from bad investments during the technology industry bust but nobody came to his rescue "its just upsetting " he says "it seems unfair that the government and paulson would get involved with the free market " patrick barron a business consultant in west chester pa blames the government for keeping interest rates low for years and creating todays conditions "people were encouraged to borrow money they cant pay back " he says "its the government thats at the heart of this problem " mr barron says a government led solution wont solve the problem "the whole idea that everybody can win and nobody loses is on the face of it ridiculous " he says steve bailey a year old retired homeowner in fairway kan says he hopes the governments involvement will be limited "i dont see how people can be so naive as to fall into these traps " he says "but they do i dont think its the governments job to straighten them out " for many people the crucial question is whether taxpayers will pick up the tab mr paulson said they wont melissa huelsman a seattle lawyer who represents homeowners facing foreclosure says she is in favor of a relief plan as long as it doesnt entail public funds "i would support it if the lenders and wall street take the hit " she says ms huelsman says there is a misconception that many "teaser rates " which would be frozen temporarily are themselves affordable "i have very few clients who actually started out with low rates or if they did they adjusted after one or a few months " she said "the loans my clients got had initial teaser rates of or more so while perhaps preventing them from adjusting to would be helpful its not like they are at a good rate to begin with " with details about the plan unclear some consumer advocates are unsure how much it would help "i think that it might be a temporary fix but it would really depend on what type of restrictions there were " says joann hauger executive director of community housing resources of arizona a nonprofit that helps low to moderate income families buy their first home "personally i dont know that its going to solve the housing crisis " rescue plan or bailout the government has proposed the following moves to help some subprime borrowers keep their homes freezing interest rates on certain subprime loans encouraging states and cities to issue tax exempt bonds and use proceeds to help homeowners funding mortgage counseling services
