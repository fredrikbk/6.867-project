accelerating growth in china chery automobile drives an industry shift low costs high output attract global partners chryslers leap of faith wuhu china in this city on the yangtze river more than blue uniformed workers are busy churning out cars for chery automobile co as they motor through double shifts using the latest imported technology theyre also helping to change the dynamics of the global auto industry barely a decade after it was founded state owned chery has emerged as chinas largest independent vehicle maker and one that is determined to compete against the worlds automobile giants "in the beginning no one had confidence in us " says yin tongyao cherys chairman and general manager in a rare interview now he says "we are looking globally for markets " the tale of cherys improbable rise is in large part the story of chinas ballooning domestic car market which has roughly doubled in size since its products mostly inexpensive cars and suvs are also gaining a following in developing countries hungry for low cost vehicles but rapid growth is already taking its toll as executives strain to manage the companys expansion amid a shortage of experienced workers "we are still fighting for our survival " says mr yin "we didnt get to learn from books we have to learn everything by doing it " in july the company signed a landmark deal with chrysler llc to sell a series of small cars made by chery under the american auto makers dodge brand chrysler has said it plans to start selling the cars in latin america and other developing markets next year and aims to have them on the market in the u s and western europe by the pact marks the first time that one of detroits big three has outsourced the production of entire vehicles to a chinese company the deal also sends a warning to high cost workers in the u s and europe that even more of their jobs could be at risk cherys arrangement with chrysler follows years of breakneck expansion sales of chery cars have increased more than tenfold since this year chery expects to sell more than compacts sedans and sport utility vehicles by the company says it will be turning out a million vehicles annually for markets both at home and abroad holding the reins of this galloping enterprise are mr yin and a handful of other men whove been with the company since it started as the brainchild of local communist party officials in the poor eastern province of anhui the founding group is known in china as the "eight guardians" a reference to eight defenders of the faith in buddhist legend the corporate culture they spawned is an odd hybrid of communist state enterprise and entrepreneurial start up party propaganda posters hang on factory walls "know plain living and hard struggle " one poster exhorts workers "do not wallow in luxuries and pleasures " in another part of the plant bulletin boards display quality survey data from j d power &amp associates comparing cherys cars with those of its rivals inside the gates of cherys sprawling production complex where few foreign reporters have been allowed before assembly lines run hours a day much of the equipment is state of the art imported from europe the engine plant has german precision milling machines and italian robots the paint shop is from germany chery this year expects to export more than cars up from about in mainly to emerging markets such as russia the middle east and latin america where its low prices are helping to win it business the company is building a car shipping port on the yangtze near its plant to send vehicles to chinas coast and overseas still chery remains far smaller than the worlds big auto makers volkswagen ag general motors corp toyota motor corp and honda motor co have each outsold chery in the china market so far this year world wide gm and toyota both sell nearly nine million vehicles a year at cherys research and development center engineers say they are now at work developing to new car models at least of which could be ready for production as soon as next year the company is building new assembly lines that next year will boost its capacity to about mr yin sets an urgent tone both inside and outside the company parts suppliers say they are frequently called to meetings at chery headquarters late in the evenings and on weekends as chery engineers and executives try to push projects forward in a hurry chery says it expects to benefit from chryslers technical expertise and established sales and service networks even though their cars will be sold under the dodge brand they expect consumers will know they are made in china by chery "people look down on our products there are many doubts about our safety and quality " says mr yin selling under the dodge name initially will boost buyers confidence he says "if we work together with chrysler we can go global faster " chery has combined low wages with massive capital investment and other government backing this recipe is powering the latest phase of chinas industrial revolution helping firms in industries from cars to consumer electronics become significant global players junior engineers at chery earn about &# a year and many sleep in bunk beds four to a room in company dormitories some dont have drivers licenses and like most chinese people didnt grow up riding around in a family car few workers can afford to buy the automobiles they make assembly line workers earn an average of slightly more than &# an hour far less than their counterparts in europe or north america but in anhui a sought after wage chery can "offer low cost platforms with speed " says tom lasorda president and vice chairman of chrysler which has said it will eliminate jobs in north america visiting cherys plants in he says he found that "everything was very familiar " with production processes and equipment very similar to those in top western factories cherys conception dates to the mid s when a handful of officials in anhui decided to place a bet on cars developing a local auto industry they figured would boost incomes and growth in a province where the average annual income of people in rural areas is less than &# the companys first chairman zhan xialai at the time an assistant to the mayor of wuhu recruited zhou biren then a manager at a city owned building supply company the two men faced significant opposition from bureaucrats who doubted local families would ever earn enough to buy a car "people thought we were crazy " says mr zhou now a chery vice president and one of the eight guardians "in those days people werent rich yet " says mr zhou they "thought it would be a waste of state funds " but messrs zhan and zhou persevered they cobbled together a team with connections to anhui including mr yin an anhui native who was lured away from a volkswagen joint venture mr zhan later became the communist partys top official in wuhu and stepped down from his post at chery for the first two years mr yin mr zhou and the other members of the eight guardians worked from a crumbling building in an empty field there was no heating or air conditioning it took a computer crash during a heat wave to prompt the purchase of one cooling unit initially the founders sought to lure a foreign auto maker into a joint venture mr zhou and his colleagues talked to several multinational companies he says but none were willing to take a chance on such an inexperienced partner flying solo the first order of business was finding an engine to use in the companys still theoretical first car in mr zhou flew to england to buy engine assembly equipment that had been discarded by ford motor co s plant there in march chery started building its first factories it hired a taiwanese company to help it design its first model a sedan known as the fengyun or wind cloud which was cobbled together mostly using parts from components makers that supplied the china operations of vw and gm the first cars rolled off the line in december but chery wasnt allowed to sell them since it didnt have a government license to be in the auto business the red tape was eventually untangled when chery briefly became part of the much larger shanghai automotive industry corp a large state owned company that has partnerships with gm and volkswagen the fengyun hit the market in and were sold chery also began work on a four door hatchback minicar which would lead to accusations that the young company was knocking off the designs of its competitors the car which went on sale in and is known as the qq is similar to a gm model known as the chevrolet spark gm sued chery in chinese court in alleging that the company had illegally copied its design for the spark the companies settled the lawsuit in without disclosing the terms of their agreement chery spokesman jin yibo says the deal with gm was "very friendly " and chery has publicly denied that it did anything wrong manufactured with local partners at a plant in southwestern china the qq remains the companys no model and far outsells the more expensive chevy spark in china "we honor the intellectual property rights of others " says mr zhou amid the controversy over the qq a fundamental shift was happening in executives and government planners decided that chery should go beyond recycling outdated technologies for the local market they envisioned the company as an international player encouraged by sales in cherys first two years and by signs that chinas auto market was revving up the company and its state owners decided to embark on a massive new investment program chery also stepped up its efforts to recruit chinese nationals working for auto companies abroad as well as to bring foreign expertise to wuhu "theres no way you can move slowly and catch up " says xu min a former chery engineer who is now dean of shanghai jiao tong universitys institute of automotive engineering "it took the japanese two or three decades we didnt have that kind of time " the central goal to acquire and develop technology that would belong to chery and help it compete even in the u s and europe with their daunting regulatory hurdles and high customer expectations in chery recruited mr xu the engineer who is now an academic at the time a specialist on combustion and fuel injection at delphi corp in the u s mr xu says he got the hard sell from executives seeking to bring him back to anhui where he was born mr xu says that a lot of his friends questioned his decision to abandon a secure job in detroit for a post at a then unknown chinese company but he says he felt like he was hitting a wall in the u s "in detroit you could spend years on something and never see it commercialized " he says "the pace was so slow " chery on the other hand wanted mr xu to oversee a project that would develop three new families of engines within just a few years in mr xu and chery turned to avl list gmbh an austrian engineering consulting firm that specializes in internal combustion engines for help avl promised to train chery engineers to design and build the sophisticated engines teams from the two companies worked side by side in austria and in china "they knew they had to exchange knowledge for money that really speeds up your capacity building " says mr xu the engines are good enough that italian car maker fiat spa plans to use them in some of its cars as well buying them directly from chery fiat is to buy at least liter and liter engines a year for use overseas starting next year according to chery in august the two companies also signed a memorandum of understanding to form a joint venture that would produce alfa romeos and other cars earlier this year chrysler executives visited chery and could see the rapid progress that occurred over months "i would say the aha moment for us would be when we subsequently visited chery " in june says richard chow wah a chrysler senior vice president the "ability to make decisions quickly without a lot of bureaucracy was what was most impressive " ellen zhu contributed to this article
