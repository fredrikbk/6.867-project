decking the halls and walls how small firm transforms stores malls for holidays several weeks ago after closing time at tiffany &amp co s flagship store on new yorks fifth avenue a team of workers descended on the stately retailer to dress it for the holidays from just past dusk until dawn they worked for two nights stringing white lights along archways and burying hundreds of blinking strobes in custom injection molded pine garland all told it took pairs of hands ladders and one crane to complete the job across the city and country similar scenes unfolded a few blocks south of tiffany on fifth avenue rival jeweler cartier is now wrapped in linear feet of garland and proclaims "happy holidays" in languages across its facade at the time warner center overlooking manhattans columbus circle pound led lit stars hang from the entranceway elsewhere in the city macys inc s flagship store on herald square sports enough red ribbon to stretch the length of football fields and a foot martha stewart tree with glass ornaments packed tight as barbed wire unbeknownst to most consumers is the year round planning it takes to execute this explosion of retail cheer that lasts a few weeks before disappearing as suddenly as it arrived in manhattan some of the highest profile work is performed by a small long island city n y firm called holiday image inc with &# million in projected sales this year the company handles decor installation from start to finish for new york city stores including both tiffany and cartier a unit of switzerlands cie financiere richemont sa barneys macys and fortunoff as well as office buildings and hotels such as the essex house it also works with large retail chains like gap inc and lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton sas sephora to create designs that can be replicated nationally "the way i see our business is not just as a christmas decorating business " says matthew schwam chief executive officer of holiday image "we are a global sourcing business " this "sourcing" for the christmas holidays actually begins in october the year before when mr schwam and other company executives travel abroad to research the latest trends in holiday displays holiday image taps more than factories in nearly two dozen countries including china and india some venues desire only a simple tree and a few wreaths in their lobby that might run around &# including installation maintenance and storage from year to year but other stores have more grandiose visions that can run hundreds of thousands of dollars for instance to get the happy holidays message onto cartier meant building a shed of clear plexiglass filling it with lighting equipment and projectors and using a crane to lift the operation onto the roof of a nearby building outfitting tiffany required figuring out how to attach garlands so they wouldnt harm the stores stone exterior the solution building a substructure out of tension brackets and wood xs that grabbed hold of the stone moldings without drilling holiday image also decorates tiffanys interior this year with frosted pine cones red berries and feathers among other things "its like a fashion show " says robert rufino tiffanys vice president of creative services "you watch a model walk down the runway in the most simple elegant dress and you wonder why it takes so long to achieve that but its a huge huge job " while many customers reuse the same decorations from year to year and hire holiday image to install them some national chains want displays tailored to that years marketing campaign gap this year sought garlands made of striped scarves and ornaments fashioned of yarn to adorn all of its stores nationwide it was holiday images job to tap its textile connections abroad create the designs and pack striped scarf garlands and yarn ornaments into boxes along with simple assembly directions gap employees then installed the designs in stores "we must build it in an out of box way so that almost anyone can take it out of the box and build it and it looks great " mr schwam says similarly when sephoras design team described the "enchanted" theme they wanted back in april mr schwams crew was charged with finding and shipping nearly feet of custom white branches and more than feet of crystal to adorn the stores along with the proper brackets to make them fit "their job was to capture aesthetically what we were after and they were able to do it " says jennifer bartlett director of visual operations for sephora planning for a stores concept begins seriously in the spring with most visions being nailed down by june thats when mr schwam triples his year round staff of to begin building the decorations in his square foot warehouse in queens he hires a cadre of artists actors and freelancers paying them an average &# an hour which includes overtime to work through the holidays assembling and disassembling the displays nearly of installations happen at night when shoppers arent afoot "if someones hanging a wreath overhead i dont want people walking under that " mr schwam says a lot of work is trial and error for instance at macys holiday images crew had to figure out how to plug in a lighted wreath without a messy cord showing the trick opening up the face of the clock where the electrical outlet is hidden says mr schwam "you could stare for hours and hours and not know it was there " the supervisors of mr schwams installation crews all carry blackberrys to email him pictures and notes of installations back at headquarters administrative staffers record each days findings into a computer to make next years job easier each of holiday images trucks are fitted with a substantial tool kit but inevitably a necessary work item say gaffers tape is missing to prevent a work slowdown in the middle of the night mr schwam has constructed his own makeshift square foot hardware store at company headquarters complete with nuts and bolts electrical wire male and female plugs "there is an absolute sense of urgency while decorating " mr schwam says "from the customers standpoint they are back in business the next day whether we are done or not and if its halfway its not going to look right " if certain jobs are too large to complete overnight holiday image crews take pains to hide their tracks the installation of the led stars at the time warner center required five nights so mr schwams team put up three stars symmetrically one night and the rest later as soon as the holidays are over holiday images team must swoop in to remove the work as fast as they installed it in cases where retailers will use the same designs the next year items are packed into heavy rodent proof cardboard boxes labeled with customers names addresses and items boxes are then stored on foot racks at holiday images air conditioned and heated headquarters a computerized floor plan of the room details every boxs location but the decorations dont stay dormant long beginning jan boxes are pulled back out and the contents refurbished burned out bulbs get replaced crushed ornaments and faded greenery tossed out or donated to charity to ensure a companys display doesnt start looking skimpy mr schwam typically buys to extra of everything come march the cycle begins again with another trip abroad to recap the previous season and preparation for a trade show called globalshop where the firm presents its newest concepts and designs to retailers as for right now while the rest of the worlds holiday bustling peaks the company has a rare moment of down time "well have parties and celebrate " mr schwam says "because pretty soon weve got to start planning for take down "
