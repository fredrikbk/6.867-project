parents fret over magnets in toys new guidelines prompted by recalls wont take effect until after shopping season last summers recall of million magnetic toys made by mattel inc highlighted a risk that is high on many parents minds this holiday season buying toys that may still have hazardous high power magnets hidden in them larger companies like mattel have redesigned their toys to prevent the small magnets from falling out and the industry drafted a new set of design and labeling standards in may intended to make magnetic toys safer and warn parents of which toys have magnets in them the hitch the new rules wont take effect until january after the holidays that leaves parents like janice sirovita a year old mother from san jose calif whose infant daughter turns on thursday wondering what to do this december "you cant tell which magnets are which " she says the death of a toddler in from pieces of a construction toy called magnetix resulted in the first magnet related recall in covering millions of the toy sets marketed by montreal based mega brands inc it also brought national attention to a new hazard in the toy business magnetix contained high energy neodymium iron boron magnets that when swallowed can stick to each other in a childs intestinal track causing potentially dangerous tissue damage near the time of the recall mega brands redesigned the toy by partially embedding the magnets in plastic and sealing dangerous pieces with a cap that prevents the parts from escaping mattel which recalled million toys in several popular lines including polly pockets and batman has taken similar measures as well injecting the magnets into plastic and employing a locking mechanism earlier versions of some toys had employed a chemical adhesive that failed in a number of cases to keep magnets from coming loose in may the toy industry association made its first attempt to address the issue drafting a set of voluntary standards to curb the dangers of magnets according to the new rules which were written in association with astm international a nonprofit testing standards organization magnets must either be "reliably contained" within a product or the toys must carry a warning label explaining the dangers of ingestion even though consumers may be left wondering about potential hazards this holiday season the toy industry maintains it moved quickly to make the changes joan lawrence a safety specialist with the toy industry association said that new standards generally take to months to institute across the industry "we expedited the compliance process " she says but the new regulations couldnt go into place before the new year given that many of this holidays toys were manufactured during the summer "its a step in the right direction but the timing is somewhat late " says ed mierzwinski of the nonprofit u s public interest research group in washington d c he adds that the industry might have penned new standards more swiftly after the magnetix recall in early mr mierzwinski also questions whether labeling will be enough to solve the problem "if you can convince parents to keep toys from small children it will help " he says but preventing older children from sharing toys with younger friends or siblings may prove a stumbling block alan oestreich a pediatric radiologist at cincinnati childrens hospital medical center has seen this happen firsthand just this past summer a toddler arrived at his office after having swallowed five small magnetic parts on a toy that was given by a sibling an accident that required emergency surgery to remove the metals it was the eighth case his hospital had seen since realizing that a problem has occurred can be difficult for parents since children who have swallowed high powered magnets generally feel little more than a mild stomachache "its hard to distinguish this problem from a dozen other common illnesses " says dr oestreich and with toddlers who are most at risk for swallowing small toys many victims are too young to describe the symptoms or to recall what they swallowed some potentially dangerous toys have continued to circulate this fall in late october about backpacks sold at target with game pieces based on the disney movie "cars" were recalled voluntarily when reports arrived that magnets in the sets were coming loose the distributor global design concepts inc in new york says the toys had passed safety tests and it is still investigating how the parts came out of the toy more recently a report published last month by u s pirg cites five toy lines believed to pose an ingestion hazard that were being sold in a number of discount stores nationwide "in some cases we found loose magnets falling right out of the packaging " says mr mierzwinski of u s pirg the report cites two lines of magnetic jewelry as hazardous what mr mierzwinski calls a potential loophole to the new rules since jewelry isnt technically considered a "toy" by the industry safari ltd the u s distributor of magnetic marbles another one of the toys on the u s pirg list says it hasnt received any ingestion complaints about the toy which it says was designed by an outside manufacturer but a company spokesman says the line has been discontinued and initially passed safety tests
