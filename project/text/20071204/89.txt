prescription abuse seen in u s nursing homes powerful antipsychotics used to subdue elderly huge medicaid expense in recent years medicaid has spent more money on antipsychotic drugs for americans than on any other class of pharmaceuticals including antibiotics aids drugs or medicine to treat high blood pressure one reason nursing homes across the u s are giving these drugs to elderly patients to quiet symptoms of alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia nearly of the total nursing home population is receiving antipsychotic drugs according to the centers for medicare &amp medicaid services known as cms in a practice known as "off label" use of prescription drugs patients can get these powerful medicines whether they are psychotic or not cms says nearly of nursing home patients who dont have a psychosis diagnosis are on antipsychotic drugs that is what happened to a woman listed in new york state health department inspection records as resident # the year old alzheimers patient who lives at the orchard manor nursing home in medina n y likes to wander and roll her wheelchair around her unit according to a report filed earlier this year and sometimes she nervously taps her foot to address her behavior which was considered disruptive resident # was given a powerful antipsychotic drug called seroquel a drug approved for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder resident # is not psychotic and seroquel like other atypical antipsychotics carries a "black box" warning that elderly dementia patients using it face a higher risk of death "she is a handful " says thomas morien administrator of orchard manor "other residents complain about her because often at night she will get up and go to their rooms " the patient has since been taken off the drugs the growing off label use of antipsychotic medicines in the elderly is coming under fire from regulators academics patient advocates and even some in the nursing home industry "you walk into facilities where you see residents slumped over in their wheelchairs their heads are hanging and theyre out of it and that is unacceptable " says christie teigland director of informatics research for the new york association of homes and services for the aging a not for profit industry group her research which she believes reflects national trends shows that about one third of dementia patients in new yorks nursing homes are on antipsychotics some facilities have rates as high as to "these drugs are being given way too much to this frail elderly population " dr teigland says federal and some state regulators are pushing back questioning the use of antipsychotic drugs and citing nursing homes for using them in ways that violate federal rules new york has increased its focus on antipsychotics in nursing homes training inspectors to spot signs of medication abuse last month the arkansas attorney general filed suit against johnson &amp johnson and two of its units claiming among other things that they "engaged in a false and misleading campaign" to promote its antipsychotic drug risperdal to geriatric patients a spokesman for janssen lp one of the johnson &amp johnson units that manufactures risperdal says "we are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims " the &# billion a year nursing home industrys use of drugs raises complex issues in an aging society revulsion against practices such as tying down and sedating disruptive elderly patients led in to a landmark federal law signed by president reagan that set limits on how and when nursing homes can physically or chemically restrain a patient since then a rising population of elderly people suffering dementia has entered nursing facilities many of which have overburdened staff the vast majority of antipsychotic medicines paid for by medicaid are atypical antipsychotic drugs thought to have fewer of the side effects typical of older drugs many were introduced in the s to treat schizophrenia and have become huge sellers for pharmaceutical companies nursing homes turned to the drugs to try to calm dementia patients and to maintain safety and order in their facilities the newer antipsychotics are more expensive than older ones a dose of seroquel for instance can cost more than &# at retail while risperdal can cost more than &# a pill retail older antipsychotics can cost less than a dollar per dose in all atypical antipsychotics rang up u s sales of &# billion last year up from &# billion in according to ims health a health care information company doctors last year filled million prescriptions for atypical antipsychotics compared with million five years ago ims health says schizophrenic patients for whom the drugs were originally intended make up of the u s population or million people over according to the national institute for mental health it says of americans suffer from bipolar disorder for which the drugs were later also approved marketing atypical antipsychotic drugs for use in treating dementia is banned since the drugs arent approved for such use still drug companies have reached out to those who take care of incapacitated patients for instance the march issue of annals of long term care a publication of the american geriatrics society that caters to doctors and long term care specialists carries a multipage ad for seroquel the ad says in large type that the drug has been approved for treatment of bipolar depression a spokesman for astrazeneca pharmaceuticals the maker of seroquel says "bipolar depression afflicts adults of all ages including seniors " he noted that the warning of dangers to elderly patients was prominently featured in the ad seroquel had global sales of &# billion last year making it one of the industrys blockbusters u s sales were &# billion for the past two years seroquel has been the no drug purchased by medicaid astrazeneca says it "does not recommend seroquel for uses other than its approved indications in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder " the company noted the warning on the labels "of all drugs of this class" regarding use in dementia patients "decisions about medical treatment are made by physicians " the company says nursing homes often find it difficult to balance the demands of caring for certain patients against the pressure to keep staff costs down the economics of elderly care can work in favor of drugs because federal insurance programs reimburse more readily for pills than people the use of antipsychotic drugs comes amid a wider debate about how to care for the rising numbers of seniors many of whom have behavior problems stemming from dementia they can be difficult to manage at home or in an institution they can cry lash out wander or even be violent to themselves or others there arent many effective methods to calm them doctors say a big question is whether to use a medical model administering antipsychotics as the way to alleviate distressing symptoms of dementia or trying to find other ways to help these patients the centers for medicare &amp medicaid the federal agency that oversees the two huge tax funded insurance programs that cover the elderly and the poor has "initiated a more rigorous process to oversee appropriate use of medicine " says chief medical officer barry straube he says the number of nursing home inspections that result in citations for violating drug misuse rules has jumped by nearly between and this year action is being taken and the increased vigilance is working cms says dr straube says cms which both funds and oversees nursing homes "is very concerned about the quality of care in nursing homes and has taken steps within its authority to discourage inappropriate use of all drugs including psychotropic medications " in the most recent year for which total expenditure figures are available medicaid spent &# billion on atypical antipsychotic drugs it spent less on aids drugs &# billion and medications to lower cholesterol &# billion these figures dont include rebates the government receives high use of antipsychotics in a nursing home can be an indicator of inadequate staffing says bruce pollock president elect of the american association of geriatric psychiatry "we know the more staffing there is and the higher quality of care the less the antipsychotic usage " he says psychosis is a severe psychiatric illness which frequently includes delusions or hallucinations alzheimers is a neurological disease that can be accompanied by either psychosis or severe behavioral symptoms such as aggression or agitation dr pollock a professor of neuropsychiatry at the university of toronto says one problem is that the psychosis in alzheimers disease is not the same as psychosis in younger patients with schizophrenia america is facing a public health crisis over the care of those with dementia dr pollock says "we are left with the atypicals because we have nothing else " he says these drugs have a role to play he says but "nonpharmacologic treatments" should be tried first in new york the state health department is stepping up its focus on antipsychotic use in nursing homes two years ago it issued citations involving medication misuse this fiscal year there were records of a state inspectors visit to the orchard manor nursing home earlier this year offer a glimpse of the problem the report profiles an year old woman identified to protect her privacy only as "resident # " she was confined to a wheelchair with a "lap buddy" a restraining device that prevents her from getting up her "primary" behavior issues are that she "self propels in wheelchair and enters other rooms " the report said resident gbp "is usually understood and usually understands " the report said she suffers from alzheimers disease but isnt psychotic still she was placed on the antipsychotic drug seroquel along with haldol an older less expensive antipsychotic new york regulators found in that case orchard manor violated the federal requirement to refrain from giving patients "unnecessary drugs " the facility was ordered to submit a new plan for treatment there was no fine mr morien orchard manors administrator says the facility submitted a plan within days he says the small rural home provides excellent care the facility may not have adequately explained to state officials its reasons for putting resident # on antipsychotics he says he says she is off the drugs now it comes down to staffing he says taking care of patients such as resident # requires many more people able to watch them yet under the current reimbursement system where the government spends billions on these drugs he says it is hard for a facility such as his to make ends meet "we are a nonprofit we have not made a penny in years " he says mr morien says there are certain patients with behavioral issues and "no matter what you do you cant control them and physicians will try different medications for them " but he says his facility tries to use drugs only as a "last approach to a behavioral problem " most dementia patients who become agitated are trying to communicate a deep felt need or want says jeffrey nichols vice president for medical services at new yorks cabrini eldercare consortium a nonprofit group when they cry out are they simply being combative or are they delusional and in need of a tranquilizer maybe neither says dr nichols "they may be in pain " dr nichols who oversees a bed nursing home says that for dementia patients antipsychotic drugs "dont work very well and they are significantly overused " the use of such drugs to care for agitated dementia patients is "like hitting a tv on the side " he says in a statement the american health care association which represents for profit investor owned and nonprofit nursing homes says facilities "work closely with doctors to ensure that medications prescribed are meeting the individual needs of each patient " nursing homes are "treating an older more frail population of seniors with increasingly complex care needs " the group says the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes continues despite scientific papers that question the benefits of using them on dementia sufferers in light of the risks earlier this year the federal agency for health care research and quality reviewed existing research and noted the drugs can trigger strokes induce body tremors fuel weight gain and affect an elderly persons gait increasing their chances of falling the food and drug administration issued a "black box" warning on using the drugs for dementia patients in but the fda stopped short of banning such use officials say they give physicians the leeway to prescribe the drugs if they think it will help this difficult to treat population some doctors are now switching back to older cheaper antipsychotics such as haldol the fda says the older drugs had fallen into disuse but dont have a black box warning now the fda says its weighing putting a black box warning on those drugs too in massapequa n y a nursing home was recently fined by the state for injecting doses of haldol into a year old alzheimers patient the woman identified only as resident # enjoyed listening to music and getting her nails polished according to a state report but when agitated she banged her hand on the table and sometimes yelled one aide found it was possible to calm her by offering ice cream and chatting with her the report said but other staff gave her the drug haldol between august to february of this year she received doses of injectable haldol the report said the facility parkview care and rehabilitation center paid a &# fine for medication misuse "it is a unique situation " says steve seltzer parkviews administrator "i know that this is not the nature of this facility " he described resident # as an especially difficult case who reverted to her native european language making it hard to communicate as a result of the states action "staffing changes were made " he says the woman was later given a teddy bear as both a way to calm her down and to provide a cushion so she wouldnt hurt herself she passed away last friday
