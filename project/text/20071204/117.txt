the middle seat why every day isnt a holiday for air travel its the evening before thanksgiving a day stuffed with travelers but continental airlines flight taxies past other airplanes in newark n j and makes the three hour trip to orlando in just two hours and minutes the reason flight was one of continental flights to use two air corridors that were opened in military airspace just for the holiday rush the military has virtually all the airspace just off the east coast locked up for training but when president bush opened some to commercial flights to ease holiday travel airlines jumped at the chance southwest airlines had a dozen flights a day over the ocean jets flying from airports in new york and new england to fort lauderdale west palm beach and orlando in florida the federal aviation administration says use of the new routes built over the long holiday weekend increasing to to flights an hour on the sunday after thanksgiving the busiest travel day of the year "this is a good news story " says mike sammartino the faas director of system operations who hasnt had a lot of good news stories in year packed with air travel delays "the overall initiative was very successful " to be sure thanksgiving air travel went relatively smoothly this year in large part because most of the country enjoyed good flying weather but airlines and the faa say the two extra lanes also made a difference case in point on the monday after thanksgiving when foul weather moved into the east coast and the military took back its airspace air travel degenerated into a morass at new yorks la guardia airport one of the most delay prone airports in the country on time arrivals fell to of scheduled flights according to flightstats com a flight tracking service the day before of la guardia flights arrived on time the pentagon agrees that the two routes open to planes at feet and above made a difference "it added more capacity and airlines could plan on it " says gerald pease jr executive director of the defense departments policy board on federal aviation so airline officials wonder why cant every week be like thanksgiving week having proved that a couple of extra lanes for airplanes off the congested east coast can make a big dent in delays pressure is likely to mount on the pentagon to give up more airspace more frequently either by scheduling training to avoid airline rush hours or by moving training farther offshore to make room for a couple of eight mile wide lanes for jetliners "we have long been saying there have to be ways to free up that airspace more often " says david castelveter spokesman for the air transport association the airlines trade group "we need access to that space when we run into unusual weather and heavy traffic we all know its doable we all know it helps " the faa says it is involved in talks with the pentagon "i want more use of it " says mr sammartino continental airlines chief executive larry kellner says the success of the thanksgiving experiment shows that the benefit can be considerable for travelers "we hope the transportation and defense departments will continue to consider opening military airspace during other critical travel times throughout the year as well as during periods of severe weather " he says the pentagon says it needs the airspace military officials were able to relinquish use of the airspace over the holiday because there were few training missions scheduled but most days flight training is under way offshore ships may be test firing missiles or other activities essential for military readiness are taking place the military trains from the water up to altitudes as high as feet "that offshore airspace is heavily used on a daily basis " says the pentagons mr pease pushing military flights farther offshore adds time and fuel expense to training he says it also can raise safety issues for example when rescuing crews that eject from airplanes and it can add complexity to training missions such as for in air refueling of fighter jets some officials believe it will take an order from president bush for the pentagon to give up its airspace commercial flights generally follow specific airways most of the north south traffic on the east coast bunches into just a handful of these highways in the sky laid out decades ago even east west traffic mixes in for example when planes bound for new york from the west mesh with traffic south of washington d c before flying north the big bottleneck is over washington the faa says if theres not a spot in the stream of airplanes planes wait to take off or can end up in holding patterns near washington if storms close an airway or two delays can run to hours the pentagon coordinates with the faa to open up airspace on stormy days but not always in time for airlines to plan and no defined routes are drawn the faa says it is in daily contact with military airspace officials but airlines say permission from the pentagon is sporadic over the thanksgiving holiday even when just airplanes an hour used the offshore routes onshore flights benefited from less congestion the faa says "thats airplanes that i dont have to funnel overhead washington " mr sammartino says "it reduces delays everywhere theres a domino effect " email middleseat wsj com
