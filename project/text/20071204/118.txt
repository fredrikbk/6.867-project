services to banks fund managers and others world wide but the impact of the credit crisis in europe and the u s could hurt reuterss results last month reuters chief executive tom glocer warned that sales in the next two years could be hit by market turbulence reuters is approaching "with caution " mr glocer said at a morgan stanley conference in spain "if we see continuing turmoil and hung bridge loans there will be a general need to restrict spending" on news and financial information some analysts in may thought thomson a canadian company with headquarters in stamford conn was paying too much and do even more so now the cash and stock offer of gbp a share was more than reuterss then share price and valued it at a price to trailing earnings ratio of "its terrific for reuters shareholders but whats the benefit for thomson " says felix nahi an analyst at vancouver broker odlum brown ltd if the reuters business goes into a downturn thomsons share price would likely suffer it also would be seen as a rare misstep for the thomson family which over years has transformed the company from a chain of regional newspapers into one of the worlds largest providers of business scientific and legal information reuterss main clients are investment banks hedge funds and other finance related employers if layoffs hit that sector in the next year as many expect demand could

exposure to financial markets with about of revenue of the combined company coming from the sale of financial information up from of thomsons revenue now reuters relies on the stock foreign exchange and credit markets and the funds management industry for most of its revenue credit concerns are hurting the entire media sector and thomson shares which have fallen to &# from &# in about the past month on the new york stock exchange that has driven down the value of the cash and stock offer for reuters to about gbp a share without a bid reuters shares probably would be around gbp analysts say yesterday reuters shares were at gbp in london on nov thomson said it started buying back its own shares after suspending purchases when the reuters deal was announced "i think if thomson was to launch the offer today the price would be lower " says laura wallace a portfolio manager at coleford investment management ltd in toronto which owns about &# million of thomson shares the deal is expected to close in the first quarter mr glocer will succeed thomson chief executive richard harrington as ceo of the combined company which will be called thomson reuters corp thomson owned by its founding family through an investment trust says it remains happy with the deal which took months to negotiate thomson deputy chairman geoffrey beattie said more investment bank jobs cuts wont have a big impact "we may see an impact on revenue from a recession but i feel very confident there are enough growth opportunities and new market potential to make up for that " mr beattie said thomson and reuters estimate the deal will generate &# million a year in synergies in addition to lower property and head office costs and reducing the number of products sold they say they will sell more services to existing clients for example thomson sells a service to help track the development of drugs including information on scientific news and patents that could be paired with a reuters service

sophisticated products such as algorithmic trading which banks are less likely to cut mr montanari says he has been buying thomson shares as the price has fallen some shareholders are pleased thomson will get its ceo from reuters because the new company will be dominated by the financial information division "i think mr glocer has done a fantastic deal but i am not sure its because he forecast what was going to happen in the credit markets " says nick train investment manager at london investment firm lindsell train ltd which owns about gbp million of reuters shares "i think combining reuters with thomson makes a whole lot of sense " jessica hodgson contributed to this article
