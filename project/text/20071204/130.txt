will defeat alter chavezs path venezuela leaders failure to cement power expected to embolden opposition caracas venezuela venezuelan president hugo chavezs defeat in a referendum on changing the countrys constitution will energize the nations opposition but the leader is likely to continue his quest to remain in power and turn the country into a bastion of what he calls st century socialism mr chavezs defeat in sundays vote shows a growing impatience among venezuelans including surprising numbers of mr chavezs supporters about his inability to substantially improve their lives despite near record high oil prices and the fact that he has governed the country for nearly a decade mr chavez sought to amend the constitution of the worlds ninth largest oil producer to allow him to concentrate nearly all power including scrapping limits on re election mr chavezs defeat will ripple across latin america hurting allies in countries like bolivia and ecuador and boosting moderates in brazil and chile for the u s and europe a weaker mr chavez is welcome news the former military officer has been increasingly hostile to western interests in the past few years nationalizing key areas of the economy like the oil industry telecommunications and utilities despite the result mr chavez will remain a major force he still enjoys a deep reservoir of support among the countrys majority poor and working class he controls the countrys courts most of its media the congress and almost all local and state governments he is also a recognized comeback king in he was knocked out of power for two days but came back and in only four years after being released from prison for his unsuccessful coup attempt mr chavez was elected president of venezuela for the first time "he is wounded but hes still very dangerous " says fernando ochoa a former defense minister now that the constitutional referendum has failed mr ochoa warns that mr chavez may try to keep pushing his agenda perhaps by calling for a constitutional convention the main lesson for mr chavez from the vote could be that he needs to focus on issues of popular concern such as the economy and crime his ideas about so called st century socialism and performances on the international stage including his gibes at president bush didnt help him much with voters "people are tired of his bombast after nine years of nearly constant mobilization " says peter hakim president of the inter american dialogue a washington think tank "his magic and charm are wearing thin next to the still poor quality of government services " mr chavez has used oil money to direct billions of dollars in health and food subsidies the spending has created make work jobs and put money in peoples pockets but other economic policies like price controls have backfired basics like rice sugar milk and chicken are sometimes hard to find in a country where the economy is booming from oil wealth crime is another problem area while mr chavez gives venezuelas oil money to allies around latin america violent crime is rising in venezuelas cities the poor mr chavezs base suffer the most because the rich insulate themselves behind bodyguards and high walls the outcome of the vote shows that mr chavez is more out of touch with his supporter base than his man of the people image would suggest mr chavez had predicted a percentage point victory in the referendum and was seemingly unaware that many of his supporters could defect one explanation is a heavy travel schedule that leaves him less time for domestic affairs another is the isolation that comes with power "strongmen often surround themselves with sycophants who tell them what they want to hear " said riordan roett director of western hemisphere studies at johns hopkins university in baltimore "they get carried away by the soothing tones of their advisers " it remains to be seen whether mr chavez whose political style has been one of confrontation rather than conciliation will heed the wake up call he has received if he doesnt venezuela could face unrest as mr chavezs emboldened opposition presses for more space jerrold post the head of george washington universitys political psychology program recently completed a psychological study of mr chavez for the u s air force mr chavez says dr post is "immensely narcissistic" and "enormously self absorbed " mr chavezs defeat should give succor to his opponents one of the biggest challenges for the middle and upper class leaders of the opposition parties will be figuring out how to cross class lines and compete for the votes of disillusioned chavez supporters in working class neighborhoods while many of these voters opposed the referendum they also have a deep mistrust of venezuelan elites who governed the country for generations
