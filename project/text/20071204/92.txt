service in cleveland she already had years of experience managing nonclinical operations at a hospital in st louis "im not a nurse and i dont profess to be " she says but her experience plus a masters degree in health care management made her better equipped to deal with seniors issues than someone unfamiliar with the industry "it was an easier transition for me " she says mature business owners tend to walk into a venture with a full rolodex and or years of experience working in various capacities says deborah russell director of work force issues at aarp the washington advocacy group for adults and older additionally she says "they may have a larger pool of finances to invest in a new business than younger entrepreneurs " but also says marc freedman founder of civic ventures a san francisco think tank for retirement and workplace issues "they are finally in a good position financially the kids are grown up or just finished school and the mortgages are on the downward slope "

that they are entering " says mark hogan president of small business banking at bank of america in charlotte n c he adds that the business itself may be more fruitful since older entrepreneurs tend to bring with them a network of contacts customers and clients plus says raymond joabar senior vice president of product management for open at american express in new york older entrepreneurs "are a little bit smarter about things " theyve made mistakes in the past and can attack new problems with those in mind but even as mature entrepreneurs tend to have more savings than their younger

new " says freedman of civic ventures but they may not know the first thing about running a business in an entirely foreign industry for these people its a good idea to acquire relevant work experience or "test drive" a new industry before starting up any kind of business "it is important to find a place where you not only subscribe to the mission but also you can handle the day to day
