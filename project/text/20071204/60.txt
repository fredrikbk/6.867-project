insurance companies in an imperfect world i thought some of merrill matthewss arguments "hillarys false claims " op ed dec were making some sense until i found his pitch for health savings accounts the idea that "patients" are going to be better at monitoring our "own health care dollars" than insurance companies monitoring claims is a bit too much at least the companies have leverage i recently saw a hospital bill for which the insurance company paid only about essentially telling the hospital that that was all it was going to pay is the author trying to tell us that individuals with hsas would somehow have these options most bills of course are not for elective services but for ones done by or ordered by a doctor for someone who has an immediate problem with his health george fulmore concord calif i agree with merrill matthews concerning the need for patients to do most of the claims monitoring themselves after my surgery that was insured i received a full bill from the hospital for many thousands of dollars and was advised that my insurance company declined "in network" payment the hospital expressly told me it was "in network" before the procedure but then i found that the hospital had changed its irs registration number the insurance company had not updated its records even though the hospital had notified the insurance company of the change and use of the new irs number made the hospital "out of network " the revised bill was for a few hundred dollars chet martine orinda calif i found mr matthews to be remarkably uninformed about the issues of health insurance and payments for care to state that "the health insurance industry pays the vast majority of claims without hesitation" suggests mr matthews is out of contact with the daily reality of one of the biggest curses of practicing medicine in the u s the insurance industry has a well established history of denying claims reducing payments delaying payments and restricting payments all while forcing doctors to see more and more patients and work longer hours for whatever diminished insurance reimbursement may be finally produced it would be educational for mr matthews to step away from his council for affordable health insurance and have a meaningful dialogue with his own personal physician roger c dunham m d santa barbara calif i am a retiree medicare eligible with a company sponsored supplemental insurance plan administered by one of the larger medical insurance companies while most of our claims are handled correctly there are a significant number that are not getting them processed correctly is a nightmare it takes several months and much persistence one recent case took months to correct two others are still pending after six months these cases routinely require sending the claims through several times and untold hours on the telephone i have been laughed at by the representatives and been told by the benefits administrator there is no one in my company i can talk to i have been dunned by medical service providers for delinquent bills and received a letter from a doctor asking me to please pay the full bill because insurance companies are slow to pay all of this for at most a few hundred dollars that is due me in contrast medicare works fine there is no other institution i deal with that comes close to having such an unwieldy unworkable conflict resolution process linn gault center mo while hillary clintons numbers may or may not be accurate i know from personal experience in medical practice that she is correct about insurance companies avoiding payment to doctors contrary to mr matthewss assertions insurance companies conveniently "lose" claims change diagnoses to reduce payments and use other devious excuses to delay or avoid reimbursement to doctors and patients in order to maximize their profits and pay lavish salaries to executives fredric reichel m d santa monica calif
