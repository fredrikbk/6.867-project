chicago of business leaders say they believe that it is critical to their companies strategic success the study finds that few businesses have yet positioned it in a way that allows it to achieve this

property casualty co a division of hartford financial services group inc has seen some of those drawbacks up close for years the insurance unit didnt include its chief of technology in its strategy meetings as a result the it department treated each new insurance product as a one time event as opposed to a process that the company repeated over and over again and didnt install technology to automate or streamline the product development process that led the hartford conn insurance company to take three years to five years to introduce an insurance product then in hartford property casualty recruited john chu to become senior vice president of e business and technology at first mr chu says he nearly didnt take the job because "the role of it was an order taker " but he says he received an assurance that the company wanted to make it more strategic and that he would be expected to attend senior management meetings since then mr chu says he has developed a close relationship with executives from other parts of the company that has helped him focus on tech projects that have reduced the time it takes to launch a new product to nine months he says at walgreen co the deerfield ill pharmacy chain has included its cio on its management team since the late s that has helped walgreen connect all its pharmacies via a single software system which the it department updates several times a year the it department depends on feedback and suggestions from pharmacists and other store employees in order to make changes jeffrey rein walgreens ceo says having the cio on his leadership team sends a message to employees that they need to make providing this feedback a priority "if you dont involve the cio in strategy meetings you end up with systems that dont serve the needs of your employees or customers " says mr rein one reason many companies havent worked closely with their it departments is because it professionals often struggle to explain what their departments do in language that business leaders understand says jerry luftman a professor at the stevens institute of technology in hoboken n j that has made it hard for nontechies to see the value that an it department contributes to a company and creates the impression that it leaders are too focused on bits and bytes steve bozzo the cio at online florist flowers com inc of carle place n y says he learned that lesson the hard way early in his year it career he would brag to his bosses that the systems he was responsible for were up of the time "theyd say but steve they were down when we needed them most " he says that taught mr bozzo that he needed to focus on the business impact of technology and not the technology itself for example he didnt describe to his companys executives a recent regionwide telephone outage that caused customer calls to get dropped as a one minute disruption which was the amount of time that the systems were down he called it a minute outage which is how long it took for the customer service representatives to log back into their systems and reconnect with customers for those companies that work closely with it one result can be more revenue at
