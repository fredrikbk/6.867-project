finding the true power of a pungent bulb garlic has been used in medicine since ancient times today companies that sell garlic pills liquids and topical ointments say garlic can prevent or treat a number of maladies from the common cold to even cancer scientists say garlic has powerful antimicrobial effects in the laboratory but so far there isnt adequate proof of any benefit in humans when garlic is cut allicin a sulfur based compound is released giving garlic its distinctive smell and believed to be garlics defense against microbes fungii and other natural enemies scientists have found garlic and allicin extracts kill bacteria in the lab it may also kill viruses but evidence is less compelling says larry lawson an orem utah chemist who studies garlic and garlic supplements garlic has been tested to prevent or treat a variety of maladies including high cholesterol cancer the common cold coronary artery disease infection by antibiotic resistant bacteria and even toenail fungus "the problem is most of the trials come from companies that make the garlic supplements and they are small and not very compelling " says christopher gardner an associate professor of medicine at stanford universitys stanford prevention research center a number of studies had shown that garlic supplements appeared to lower cholesterol but a study published earlier this year by dr gardner and colleagues found no effect the study tested raw garlic eaten in sandwiches one clove a day six days a week plus two different supplements and a placebo in patients for six months while garlic is used to ward off colds and flus evidence for its efficacy is limited a patient study published in in advances in natural therapy found those taking a garlic pill daily had fewer colds than those taking a placebo and recovered more quickly if they did catch a cold the author was peter josling a scientist at allicin international ltd a british concern that sells an allicin supplement called allimax the study has yet to be replicated by independent researchers one of the most promising areas is cancer so far much of the research is in the lab or in animals but some studies particularly on rectal and colon cancers have been done in human populations last month an expert panel of the nonprofit american institute for cancer research concluded that garlic "probably" protects against colorectal cancer but noted more evidence is needed a catch is that garlic and some supplements can cause bad breath getting allicin into your bloodstream also is tricky most pills involve a powder that is supposed to make allicin when it dissolves but stomach acid harms the enzyme that makes allicin many pills are coated to keep them from dissolving until they pass the stomach but often the coating works too well and the pills are never digested scientists say scientists say it is most plausible that garlic will be effective when used topically like in creams to treat toenail fungus the best way to eat garlic for health is raw says dr lawson you can stir fry it or roast it but youll likely get less allicin since the enzyme used to make it is harmed by heat a study by pennsylvania state university researchers found letting cut garlic sit for minutes at room temperature before heating helped retain its anticancer properties email aches wsj com
