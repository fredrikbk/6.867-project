when a boss is unreceptive to new views q my boss is an authoritative manager who seems disturbed by any differing opinion how can i break down the walls so i can feel safe saying what i mean i am and six months into this job a confident executives dont take criticism badly since you have been there just six months its possible your boss believes youre still learning and isnt ready to hear your views but its more likely that hes a tyrant and you would be better off working elsewhere says steven berglas a clinical psychologist in los angeles career success comes from understanding what your boss wants and meeting his needs quickly so you can accomplish other goals such as finding a new job if the organization is large enough lobby to move to a new department if its small and you arent financially able to change jobs yet its worth trying to improve the situation says barry zweibel an executive coach in northbrook ill when your manager is in a receptive mood ask if he will meet with you use communication channels he prefers and explain why you want to talk such as "i want us to discuss how i can work more effectively with you and tell you where im coming from " try to keep the conversation on the issue which is how the two of you interrelate explain that you want to exceed your bosss expectations and provide what he needs in a timely manner dont back your boss into a corner about his management style because he may come out swinging afterward thank him regardless of how things went so that the lines of communication will remain open if your relationship doesnt improve accelerate your plans to find a new position elsewhere suffering under a tyrannical manager in exchange for a paycheck will erode your self esteem and emotional well being "why risk burning out when you can exit gracefully " asks dr berglas
