the allure of tyranny it is ultimately a cruel misunderstanding of youth to believe it will find its hearts desire in freedom " says leo naphta the great character of thomas manns "the magic mountain " "its deepest desire is to obey " on sunday voters as far apart as caracas and vladivostok took to the polls and put naphtas theory to a practical test in russia the result of parliamentary elections was a triumph for president vladimir putin his party united russia won of the vote add that to the votes taken by the kremlins allies and the putin tally reaches with the principal "democratic" opposition represented at by the communists the vote sets up mr putin an exceptionally fit to rule russia for another four year term and perhaps several terms beyond that by happy contrast hugo chavezs effort to establish himself as venezuelas president for life via a constitutional referendum seems to have failed by a narrow margin even so an astonishing of voters were prepared according to the official count to permanently forgo the opportunity to choose a president other than mr chavez the phenomenon in which masses of people enthusiastically sign away their democratic rights is not new it happened in germany and austria in the s but its one that americans especially have a hard time coming to grips with the freedom agenda may no longer be in vogue but most americans implicitly endorse george bushs view that "eventually the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul " when it doesnt when in fact it is consciously and deliberately spurned we rationalize it in ways that go only so far in offering a persuasive account of the dark allure of tyranny culture is one rationalization the word is invoked by everyone from self described burkean conservatives to left wing cultural relativists to explain the supposed failure of some benighted corners of the world to adopt and sustain democratic norms in this view africa and the arab world are too tribal the muslim world makes no distinction between the divine and the mundane latin america cannot find a stable middle ground between populism and paternalism the chinese are too used to emperors and mandarins the russians too used to czars and bureaucrats and so on but cultural determinism often runs afoul of reality the example of china is counterexampled by taiwan zimbabwe by botswana jeddah by dubai president chavez by president alvaro uribe in neighboring colombia like baseball statistics culture has a way of explaining a lot until it suddenly explains nothing a second line has it that the putins and chavezes of the world owe their popularity to bread and circuses tactics the canny manipulation of the media their appeal to nationalism and xenophobia bureaucratic patronage and above all the benefit of having petrodollars to shower on favored constituencies here the argument is that the two men rule by what amounts to an elaborate hoax yet that only begs the question of why the hoax is so widely believed venezuelans and russians can travel abroad and still have considerable albeit diminishing access to foreign sources of news and opinion they can read the anxious op eds warning of creeping dictatorship in venezuela that might have even tipped the scales in sundays vote yet in russia "outside meddling" has had no measurable effect on mr putins overwhelming and genuine popularity which seems only to have been enhanced by the perception that the west increasingly fears and mistrusts him perhaps the most conventional theory is that messrs putin and chavez like most autocrats ultimately rule through a combination of intimidation and dirty tricks thus in a saturday op ed in this newspaper russian opposition leader garry kasparov asks why mr putin feels compelled to engage in "heavy handed campaigning if he knows he and united russia are going to win " mr kasparovs answer is that the president "is very aware of how brittle his power structure has become " plainly the fear factor is central to the politics of both countries but neither is it the whole story russians and venezuelans alike elected their current leaders with bitter memories of democracy economic collapse and social chaos under boris yeltsin the incompetent revolving door governments of rafael caldera and carlos andres perez messrs putin and chavez both came to office promising to reverse the disintegrating trend with what the british prime minister anthony eden once called "the smack" he meant the word in its physical sense "of firm government " their track records over the past eight years represent if nothing else the fulfillment of that promise and the widespread gratitude that promise keeping engendered that is the crucial context in which chavismo and putinism need to be understood "the totalitarian phenomenon " observed the late french political philosopher jean francois revel "is not to be understood without making allowance for the thesis that some important part of every society consists of people who actively want tyranny either to exercise it themselves or much more mysteriously to submit to it democracy will therefore always remain at risk " there is a lesson here for president bush who in headier moments seems to forget that freedoms goodness must first be demonstrated instrumentally that is in terms of what it tangibly delivers before it can be demonstrated morally or spiritually there is a broader lesson here too that while tyranny may ripen in certain political climates it springs from sources deep within ourselves the yearning for a politics without contradictions the terror inscribed in the act of choice thank goodness there is usually more to human nature than that as courageous venezuelans proved sunday other times thats all there is welcome to mr putins democracy
