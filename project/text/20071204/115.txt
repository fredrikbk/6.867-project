move to prohibit residents from washing their cars on the street over concerns that the runoff is sloshing into puget sound in fairfax calif fearing similar runoff pollution officials have proposed a ban on washing cars in front of ones home with citations and possible imprisonment for violators in santa monica calif city officials drafted a plan in october to rein in car washing by groups such as the boy scouts or soccer clubs the city deems such car wash fund raisers "one of the biggest water wasters and pollution generating events of this type " according to its proposal so it wants to set up a pilot program in which at least some fund raisers will be asked to volunteer to use a new "waterless" cleaning product across the country environmental worries are fueling a crackdown on the automotive bucket brigades that have been a staple of american culture many towns particularly those on the eco friendly west coast cite reports showing that soap and grime from home car washes can run into the nearest stream or creek poisoning the fish and other wildlife in santa monica bay for example million to million gallons of urban runoff from sources such as car washing flows into the bay every day when it doesnt rain according to heal the bay an environmental group the environmental groups dont take much issue with commercial car washes because most of those funnel runoff into

find that not all of their residents are so eco conscience at least when it comes to the dirt on their cars many locals complain that the pollution caused by washing a car is miniscule compared to how much oil grease and other waste gets swept off roadways during a storm after fairfax proposed its car wash ban two months ago about residents crowded the town council chambers to protest the idea "we have homeless people washing in the creek " fumed one of the protesters year old anne moos "why dont we stop that first " residents in the northern california town miles north of san francisco grouse that the car washing ban was coming on top of some already strict water rules businesses in fairfax are already restricted in how they can hose down their sidewalks for instance "its ridiculous because we cant hose it off even if the dog does whatever " says rose taber owner of a local fabric shop in october fairfax officials began considering a less onerous version of the ordinance to merely "encourage" people to change their practices such as washing the car on the grass instead of the street to limit the runoff "people dont want their dwindling zone of privacy interfered with " acknowledges fairfax mayor larry bragman who helped propose the compromise measure in some communities officials are looking to emulate a program launched in by the puget sound car wash association the association an industry group sells discounted tickets for commercial car washes to fund raising groups a participating boy scout group for example would resell the tickets to auto owners to have their cars washed commercially instead of washing the cars themselves "the upside of this is you can sell these tickets year round including in winter when its too cold to do a car wash " says kathy ohalloran a year old mom who helped organize a drive to sell the tickets for her sons th grade class last year at sacred heart school in bellevue wash still the program has drawn some ire when fremont calif city staffer michelle pelayo asked lance winslow a retired owner of a mobile car washing business whether her city should adopt the puget sound coupon program he called it a ploy by commercial car washes to get more business "coupon car wash fund raisers dont make much money and they certainly dont teach kids teamwork earning their own money hard work ethic customer service and goal setting " he wrote to her in an email christina broadwin co president of the parent teacher association at the gomes elementary school in fremont says her nonprofit parents group is prohibited from endorsing specific businesses like a car wash and so would have trouble using the coupons industry officials say they dont make money from the program and that their work is otherwise widely supported in santa

funding to test it for one year by using it on the citys fleet of cars and trucks in a car dealership a rental car agency and in six fund raisers waterless car washing isnt without its issues since car dealership lexus santa monica purchased the green earth product a few weeks ago general sales manager alan macloughlin says his workers have had to spend an average minutes longer cleaning the
