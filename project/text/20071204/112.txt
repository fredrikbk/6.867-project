day sign up for the e mail here the latest national intelligence estimate on iran casts doubt on the hawkish warnings about tehrans nuclear ambitions but paints such a rorschach like picture of the situation that its unlikely to quiet debate the nie process it must first be noted is now more prone to ambiguity thanks to the legislative and political overhauls of american spy work in the wake of and the bush administrations use of wmd estimates to take the country into iraq changes in the past months mean nies come with definitions and notes on the scope of such phrases as "we judge we assess and we estimate and probabilistic terms such as probably and likely " as well as a breakdown of the differences among high confidence moderate confidence and low confidence what this nie aimed to do was reexamine a nie that accused iran of working toward creation of a nuclear armament and assessing the iranian governments relatively current intentions and capabilities starting without an assumption of guilt it insists "we judge with high confidence that in fall tehran halted its nuclear weapons program we also assess with moderate to high confidence that tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons " the u s intelligence community or ic concludes "we judge with high confidence that the halt and tehrans announcement of its decision to suspend its declared uranium enrichment program and sign an additional protocol to its nuclear non proliferation treaty safeguards agreement was directed primarily in response to increasing international scrutiny and pressure resulting from exposure of irans previously undeclared nuclear work " the ic has "high confidence" the halt in the iranian militarys nuclear weapons work lasted several years but because of intelligence gaps there is only moderate confidence this halt represents a halt to irans entire nuclear weapons program "we assess with moderate confidence tehran had not restarted its nuclear weapons program as of mid but we do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons " the nie says still the halt suggests iran is less determined to get one "than we have been judging since " what the u s doesnt have enough intelligence to judge confidently is "whether tehran is willing to maintain the halt of its nuclear weapons program indefinitely while it weighs its options or whether it will or already has set specific deadlines or criteria that will prompt it to restart the program " and it judges that the halt came primarily in response to international pressure led by the u s that was a time when after the initially successful reshaping of afghanistan and before the iraq conflict worsened the u s carried much greater geopolitical weight and it was before russia irans supporter in these matters grew increasingly emboldened on the world stage thanks in part to the wealth bred by high petroleum prices the nies biggest blow to the bush administrations case against iran seems to be what it says and doesnt say about "a secret slide show drawn from thousands of pages that officials said were downloaded from a stolen iranian laptop computer " as the new york times describes it that laptop containing what seemed to be "detailed efforts to build what looked like a compact warhead for an iranian missile" was the principal piece of evidence used by the administration in making the case to u s allies that iran was lying the nie assertion that nuclear weapons efforts stopped two years earlier throws into doubt an argument that at the time was drawing skepticism from some european and united nations officials the slideshow may have been outdated the times suggests and the nie doesnt explain in its unclassified summary why the judgments were so off the nie also raises questions about why president bush this fall was warning a nuclear armed iran could start world war iii at a time when he had already been informed about the new doubts the washington post notes perhaps the only hard conclusions to be drawn from the nie are that intelligence the kind that can start wars move oil markets when leaked swing political fortunes remains a murky business to be treated with care and that the u s lacks the kind of trusted sources in iran that could really tell washington whats going on like their late enemy the dictator saddam hussein the theocratic leaders of iran have long blocked or filibustered international attempts to determine what their nuclear ambitions are and the associated belligerence toward the u s on the matter has only bolstered irans credibility in the middle east as the wall street journal notes the bush administration and especially the more hawkish faction led by vice president dick cheney has treated doubts about iranian intentions as dangerous naivety iran today welcomed what it called the u s decision to "correct" its claims the associated press reports but the matter hasnt been decided the how and who of helping homeowners the decline in home values rising gasoline prices and worries about health insurance are helping to make the economy the no issue for many voters as the presidential primary season approaches the wall street journal says and that helps explain why the burgeoning mortgage mess is an increasingly hot political potato in making the bush administrations most prominent statement to date on possible solutions and a plan it is negotiating with the biggest u s banks treasury secretary henry paulson suggested the administration was already doing what it could and he "urged the democratic controlled congress to pass stalled housing legislation and support a new white house proposal to use tax exempt bonds to refinance troubled subprime mortgages " as the journal reports that in effect puts "the burden on congress to fend off an approaching wave of home foreclosures " the paper says mr paulson did say he wants to "develop a set of standards" for changing the conditions of subprime loans that the industry could use to accelerate decisions for the hundreds of thousands of borrowers who are now at risk of losing their homes the new york times adds "but industry analysts and executives were skeptical about the governments ability to produce a high speed approach to handling thousands of cases with a few simple principles " the times says at the washington conference where mr paulson spoke some housing industry leaders including countrywide chairman and chief executive angelo mozilo added their voices to calls for federally chartered mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac to play a bigger role but as the washington post points out that runs against other interests not least of which is fannie and freddies "obligation to deliver profits to shareholders " separately on a european financial regulatory front european union diplomats and government officials tell the financial times that the u k today is expected "to reject an italian proposal to introduce common european union standards for supervising financial institutions " china looks at making its own rio tinto bid china and its steelmakers hoping to block

kevin martin "having recently angered almost everybody" through an aborted attempt to overhaul cable television regulation and media ownership rules is now being targeted by congressional

affairs in an appropriate manner " democratic rep john dingell head of the house commerce committee wrote in a letter to mr martin "while this is certainly not true for every commission proceeding a
