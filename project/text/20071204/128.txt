why independents hold the key presidential campaigns like sports events play out amid a blizzard of statistics but if you have to keep in mind just one number make it this one almost of new hampshires voters are officially registered as "undeclared" that is they are independent voters these independents able under new hampshire rules to vote for either party in the nations first primary on jan may represent the most important group of voters in the land they are likely to determine among other things whether john mccains candidacy can be revived whether barack obama can sustain whatever momentum he gets out of iowas caucuses whether mitt romney actually is best positioned to win the republican nomination and whether mike huckabees rise in iowa will turn out to be just a flash in the pan more than that new hampshire independents are a reflection of the growing number of independent voters nationwide who have been trending toward democrats in the past couple of years their behavior in new hampshire will be a good clue about how independents will behave in the general election in "theyre the ones who hold the wild cards " says tom rath a longtime republican activist in new hampshire now working for mr romney "they tell you a lot about the general election electability of a candidate " important as these new hampshire independents are though their behavior is nearly impossible to predict right now it is likely to be heavily influenced by the outcome of the iowa caucuses just five days earlier their unpredictability in fact makes the campaign a game resembling d chess heres why under new hampshires rules undeclared voters can show up on primary day and choose a party in which to vote in essence they can simply move to whichever primary looks more interesting or important on paper at least they are the single biggest force in the state as of the end of october just under of new hampshires voters were registered as republicans about were registered as democrats and just below were undeclared according to the new hampshire secretary of states office some of these undeclared voters of course are really democrats or republicans at heart and will vote accordingly mr rath estimates that the share of new hampshire voters who are truly independent is more like than still they will determine the shape of the game and the trick isnt to own them but to rent enough of them for the day on jan so far tracking done by the campaigns suggest these independent voters leaning the same way as independents nationally may be twice as likely to vote democratic as republican yet thats subject to rapid change as history has shown in the campaign it appeared that many new hampshire independents were poised to vote in the democratic primary to back former new jersey sen bill bradley who had tailored an antiestablishment campaign to appeal to them but when then vice president al gore thumped mr bradley in the iowa caucuses many of these independents decided mr bradley was a lost cause so they readily crossed over and voted in the republican primary for sen john mccain the other candidate who had cultivated a maverick persona and targeted his message directly at independents that propelled sen mccain to a dramatic victory ending mr bradleys hopes and nearly derailing the republican candidacy of then texas gov george w bush now sen mccain his national campaign struggling is trying to use new hampshires independents to catch lightning in a bottle again hes running ads aimed straight at them stressing among other things his crusades against pork barrel spending but the mccain appeal has two problems the first is that his stance in support of the war in iraq doesnt go down well with many independents the second is that the democratic campaign is starting to look exciting enough to lure away many of these independents if sen hillary clinton were to win in iowa she might well appear to be on her way to winning almost everywhere else considering the lead she enjoys in other states independents may decide the more meaningful vote would be in the republican primary which appears far more fluid but right now sen clinton actually is running just behind sen obama in iowa which means the democratic race in new hampshire may be a hot ticket that draws in undeclared voters some of whom are intrigued by sen obama anyway that would leave mostly core republicans to vote in that partys primary bad news for sen mccain and good news for mr romney who leads in new hampshire polls so sen mccains hope has to be for sen clinton to pull ahead in iowa making the democratic race less competitive and liberating new hampshire mavericks to step into the republican primary and vote for him that may explain why he often has nice things to say about sen clinton oh and a footnote one other person watching the behavior of the new hampshire undeclareds closely will be new york mayor michael bloomberg the one person who could yet launch a truly independent presidential campaign that would go after such voters head on next year
