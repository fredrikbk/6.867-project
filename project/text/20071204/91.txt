report may reset debate on iran case for military strikes blunted by view that work on atomic weapons ended washington a new report from u s intelligence agencies concludes that iran halted its development of atomic weapons in a surprising finding likely to shift the debate over irans nuclear ambitions both at home and abroad the national intelligence estimate demanded by congress in could undercut calls from hawks inside the bush administration as well as those on the presidential campaign trail who have urged military strikes to combat irans program u s diplomats say it also could undermine washingtons ability to use financial sanctions to pressure tehran into giving up its long term pursuit of nuclear technologies especially if it emboldens irans allies such as china and russia at the same time the report could pose a challenge to the iranian regime which has expanded its strategic influence across the middle east partly on the back of its nuclear ambitions much like saddam husseins iraq tehran has employed belligerence over the nuclear issue to bolster its regional credentials by standing up to the u s the nie the consensus view of u s intelligence agencies says tehran appeared committed to developing a nuclear weapon until it froze its activities following a mixture of diplomatic pressure and the prospect of u s military force and financial sanctions the report says the report also says tehrans decision was driven in part by the exposure in of some of its covert programs "international isolation and international pressure " said one senior intelligence official "created an atmosphere that clearly led to this decision " the official said it wasnt clear whether the invasion of iraq or other events including libyas decision to end its nuclear program and the dissolution of pakistani scientist a q khans nuclear weapons network influenced irans decision regardless of the freeze the nie warns that iran continues to enrich uranium at a rate that could allow it to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb sometime between and iran continued through this year to install new centrifuge equipment but faced significant technical problems operating it the report says irans decision to freeze its nuclear weapons program took place two years before the election of mahmoud ahmadinejad as president while he has become the face of the countrys nuclear ambitions his ultimate influence over these matters is uncertain since much power in iran is held by a council of senior clerics the white house sought to play down the significance of the estimate arguing that its most significant finding was that iran continues to press ahead with its uranium enrichment work national security adviser stephen hadley told reporters the estimate suggests president bush "has the right strategy" in confronting iran the bush administration and its western partners particularly france and the united kingdom have been working in recent months to pass a united nations resolution penalizing tehran for its uranium enrichment work now a number of u s officials believe china and russia and potentially other countries will balk at coercive actions citing the diminished threat last week talks between irans senior nuclear negotiator and the european union collapsed in acrimony with the iranian saeed jalili bragging about his countrys recent advances congress mandated the report in a defense bill last year and intelligence officials said yesterday it was also a part of their continuing review of their information on iran such a report had already been requested by senate democrats earlier that year and in a may letter to president bush democratic senators including harry reid now senate majority leader and carl m levin of michigan now senate armed services chairman said the report was needed to "avoid repeating mistakes made in the run up to the conflict in iraq " u s intelligence officials said the report was delayed because of the need to gather additional information this was deemed crucial these officials said to avoid a repeat of the national intelligence estimate on iraq which is widely seen today as having overstated saddam husseins weapons capabilities ahead of the u s invasion the reports findings diverge from statements made by administration officials as recently as this year and also from the most recent nie on iran issued in in february director of national intelligence mike mcconnell told congress that "we assess that tehran seeks to develop nuclear weapons " president bush in october said that denying tehran a nuclear capability was central to any international effort to avoid "world war iii " officials at u s spy agencies came to believe after their report was issued that iran had suspended its weapons program the differences between this assessment and the administrations public comments prompted them to make the report public officials say republican and democratic presidential front runners rudy giuliani and hillary rodham clinton have cited the iranian nuclear threat as perhaps americas no security issue both candidates endorsed the administrations coercive actions against iran
