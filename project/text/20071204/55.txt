how florida might unfreeze a fund adviser poses asset split and a redemption fee but some parties balk officials in florida are scrambling to reopen a state run fund that has been crippled by withdrawals from local governments and school districts amid worries about its exposure to subprime mortgage loans the funds investment managers have hired blackrock financial management which yesterday outlined a plan to revive the states local government investment pool the pool was recently valued at &# billion and is now valued at &# billion this fund manages cash accounts for state school districts and local governments which had been pulling their money out en masse until withdrawals were frozen solutions wont come easily blackrock officials said the fund could have trouble selling even its best quality assets given recent turmoil in bond markets they proposed splitting the funds &# billion in assets into a "high quality" fund and a "distressed" fund the latter would include about of the funds total assets blackrock also recommended the state pool charge a redemption fee against certain withdrawals from the fund an idea that was roundly criticized in a call yesterday with state and local officials meantime some school districts with money in the fund say they are running short of cash and are growing impatient for solutions "im hoping that the electric company wont cut off the lights to our school " says hal wilson chief financial officer for the jefferson county school district which had money in the fund "wed really be in a bind " floridas state board of administration which oversees the fund will meet today to consider blackrocks proposal and potentially others for months big wall street banks and hedge funds as far away as sydney australia looked like the main losers from investments in complex securities backed by subprime mortgages but problems are also showing up in the portfolios of state run cash management funds that are supposed to be highly liquid and safe the florida investment pool holds about &# billion in short term investments called structured investment vehicles or sivs which use subprime mortgages and other troubled asset backed securities among their collateral other states have recently found themselves stuck with illiquid mortgage backed securities montanas short term investment pool has suffered recent withdrawals from at least one county official spooked by the funds investments maines short term fund meanwhile is coming under increased scrutiny for mortgage investments it made in august as the credit market crisis was heating up in maine questions are being asked about a &# million investment by a state run portfolio in a siv the issue is whether the states &# million short term cash pool received bad advice from a merrill lynch &amp co broker in early august the broker recommended the purchase of commercial paper issued by mainsail ii llc just before it failed capital adequacy tests and was forced into a restructuring maine has stopped doing business with merrill for the time being a merrill lynch spokesman said "the investments were in line with the investment policies that maine developed for itself when we executed these sales for maine we provided maine with the relevant information " "were starting to realize how pervasive these assets were " says david watts an analyst for creditsights an independent research firm "when you package these securities they end up in all sorts of places you wouldnt have expected " mr wilson from floridas jefferson county schools says that he had to overdraw the schools bank account by &# to pay his staff friday the school district has &# million in the state run fund and hasnt been able to get access to the cash because the state cut off withdrawals mr wilson also had to stop payment on checks to the local electric company so that teachers could be paid the florida investment pool has been around for more than two decades and had always served as a reliable place to park cash offering better yields and lowers fees than the typical bank account according to some of the funds investors "we relied on the continued assurances from state officials that the fund was safe " mr wilson says "were a small county we cant call on outside money managers to assess the situation " many others say they would like to see a government guarantee for the investment pools assets and rejected the idea of accepting anything less than full value for the investments randy beach chief financial officer for the wakulla county school district which has &# million in the frozen fund says that "even less wouldnt be acceptable " something similar has been happening in montana yellowstone county has withdrawn &# million from montanas &# billion short term investment pool recently "we withdrew all our money because we have a lack of confidence in some of the investments that are currently in their portfolio " says john ostlund a county commissioner yellowstone county has an annual budget of roughly &# million it needs the &# million to pay the salaries of employees and meet other crucial obligations "were not willing to risk taxpayers money so it needs to be in very stable investments with as good a guarantee of return of principal as possible " mr ostlund adds "were certainly focused in interest but retention of the principal is always our first mission " in florida one option under consideration would be to split up the funds assets to isolate the risky mortgage backed securities that led panicky investors to withdraw billions of dollars in recent days at this point however it isnt clear if even the safer investments can be easily sold blackrock officials cautioned that selling the highest quality holdings could result in additional losses during november the pool was forced to sell off securities at less than face value to meet redemptions before withdrawals were halted these officials also said they were looking for a creditor that might offer loans to government and school officials and use the funds high quality holdings as collateral some investors urged them to turn to the states &# billion pension fund to be that lender but blackrock officials suggested the pension fund wasnt an appropriate vehicle for that role
