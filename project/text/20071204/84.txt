politics &amp economics how paul could change race republican candidate is poised to win role as spoiler manchester n h after shocking the republican party establishment with a surge in online support rep ron paul is trying to translate his internet revolution into real votes particularly in new hampshire the texans latest campaign swing through the early primary state shows it is going to be a tough climb though he could have an impact on the race for the republican presidential nomination "as a realist and as an experienced political person i know that its extremely unlikely he is going to get the nomination " says keith murphy who runs an unofficial paul campaign headquarters at his elm street bar "having said that if he can win in any state in the nation its new hampshire " new hampshire seems a natural fit for mr paul whose libertarian strain of republicanism fiscal conservatism opposition to the war and pro gun record play best here he also boasts spirited grass roots activism and a healthy campaign bank account that spent wisely could potentially shake up the jan primary this past saturday evening as mr paul arrived at murphys tap room the supporters erupted in a chant "what do we want liberty " murphys provides free wireless internet access an indispensable tool for a campaign largely organized on the web the year old lawmaker and obstetrician has been able to raise large amounts of money using the internet his poll numbers have climbed passing fred thompson whose loss to mr paul would be a humiliating setback still mr paul has yet to break through the single digits with an average in recent polling his official new hampshire headquarters miles away in concord has only paid staffers trying to coordinate operations many supporters here in manchester and in salem where mr paul appeared at a town hall meeting insist their candidate can win but the strategy is foggy even mr paul cant explain it and hes uncertain of the outcome "i have no idea " he said in an interview when asked to gauge his chances for the nomination many of his supporters while vocal and enthusiastic are from other states and cant vote in the jan primary staten island new yorks lou barrett years old and dressed as santa claus said he came to new hampshire to get other people here to vote for mr paul mr barrett isnt a registered republican in new york either and thus cant vote for mr paul in his home states feb closed primary still he says "were winning the hearts and minds " mr barrett said he hopes the &# santa costume will leave voters with a positive feeling about mr paul others have taken equally unorthodox approaches to promoting their candidate tom moor of massachusetts and his band have written a song "the ron paul anthem " with lyrics such as "is there a doctor in the house a man who will not sell his country out " another supporter promotes "ron paul chocolate liberty dollars " such goofiness borne of reliance on political neophytes and mr pauls own appeal to more fringe elements like conspiracy theorists point to the probability he wont win or place in the contest but he could be a spoiler embarrassing other candidates who place behind him in the first in the nation primary mr paul brushed off such suggestions "i dont know if i can accept that term if im a candidate running i either win or i do well or i lose but who am i spoiling if someone beats me do they spoil me " he asked jeff nelson president of thomas more college in merrimack n h said mr pauls strength is likely to come from first time voters making it more difficult to gauge his effect on the primary "i think hes attracting voters that otherwise wouldnt participate " he said "ive been around the mitt romney campaign the rudy giuliani and the sen john mccain people and theres no one there thats attracted to ron paul " mr paul is also raising the kind of money that will allow him to stay in the race if only as a republican gadfly until the republican nominating convention in september "thats the goal as long as the campaign goes well that would be the goal " he says his independently run online fund raising operation fueled by individual small donors has put nearly &# million in his coffers since sept trevor lyman a miami area music promoter helped organize a nov online fund raiser that collected nearly &# million in a single day mr lyman years old says he has never voted before but moved to new hampshire in november to work full time as a volunteer he is helping coordinate a second fund raiser on dec the anniversary of the boston tea party which he predicted will "meet or beat" the first event if successful the campaign will easily exceed the &# million target for the fourth quarter mr paul said the campaign is raising money faster than it knows how to spend it while other campaigns are rolling out television and radio ads sending mailers and hiring pollsters mr lyman is now trying to coordinate an outside effort to rent a ron paul blimp to fly around the country for a month
