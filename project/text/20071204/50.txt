home &amp family eyes on the road heres looking at you kid ever wanted to know what your teenage driver is doing with the car right now technology that gives parents the answer is poised to make the jump into the mainstream if some big car insurers can resolve worries about privacy a few insurance companies are offering systems that can monitor how a car is being driven and they are promoting these systems as a way to keep tabs on newly licensed drivers some systems use global positioning system devices to gather and transmit information about a vehicles location and speed others offer speed location braking and other data plus video of the driver and passengers all of them speak to parents fears about kids shaky judgment behind the wheel these fears are well founded based on the statistics about teen drivers and accidents "the highest crash risk is when they first begin to drive without the parent in the vehicle " says anne mccartt senior vice president for research at the insurance institute for highway safety "we do believe these devices have potential in helping teens to learn safe driving behaviors and correct unsafe driving behavior faster " in vehicle monitoring systems have been used among truck fleets and company car fleets the emergence of these virtual back seat drivers to watch over teens is relatively recent but there are signs the concept is gaining momentum in march american family insurance of madison wis launched a three state test of what it calls the teen safe driver program in partnership with drivecam inc a san diego supplier of in vehicle video technology american family offered consumers a system that records video of a drivers behavior and captured other data such as swerving or hard braking in the case of say a sudden sharp braking maneuver the system stores video from seconds surrounding the event the video is sent to an analysis center not operated by american family where analysts comment on the event and rate the incident by level of risk parents and teens can log on to a web site www teensafedriver com to review the video the test has been expanded to all of the mostly midwestern and western states in which american family operates one factor in that decision was research from the university of iowa that indicated the monitors and the "coaching" significantly reduced incidents by confronting parents and teens with video evidence of driving goofs one fascinating finding of the iowa study only seven of the teens monitored were responsible for the bulk of potentially dangerous mistakes in the test of the teens from a rural iowa high school had a rate of "safety relevant events" every miles the other seven recorded events per miles almost times the rate of the safer kids according to the study the drivers including the worst seven then spent nine weeks living with the video cameras in their cars getting feedback about mistakes from a blinking light the teens and parents also got a weekly disc with video clips the bad drivers recorded a reduction in "safety relevant events" after the nine weeks this suggests an " " rule for teen drivers and that changing the behavior of just a few could save a lot of expense and more importantly pain and heartache the iowa researchers are conducting a larger test in minneapolis american family isnt yet offering discounts to customers who put cameras in their cars according to steve witmer a spokesman the company is gathering data to determine if claims experience justifies a price break an equally important issue is privacy state farm insurance cos the leading auto insurer is testing onboard monitors but it isnt offering such a product and privacy concerns are a big reason why a company spokesman says at rival allstate corp roger parker assistant vice president of consumer driven innovation says the company is taking onboard monitoring seriously but hasnt worked out a roll out of a product that overcomes privacy concerns "consumers are very worried about privacy issues and big brother issues " mr parker says parents may want to know what their teens are up to in the car he says but they probably dont want the insurance company to know or to have the power to use information to penalize them by for instance denying a claim based on video recorded stupidity moreover annoying a teen with intrusive technology today could mean losing an adult paying customer tomorrow "if we avoid the temptation for the insurance company to know more about you but use technology to empower people we can accomplish a lot " mr parker says for example allstate employees have tested a system that buzzes a cellphone when the car exceeds a speed limit mr parker says a timely prod on a recent drive probably saved him a ticket allstate which insures about million cars in states plans to offer several different products for consumers as well as commercial accounts within a year mr parker says as insurers develop solutions for the privacy issue and the cost of the hardware goes down mr parker expects on board vehicle monitoring will get big fast "we think it could be huge " he says
