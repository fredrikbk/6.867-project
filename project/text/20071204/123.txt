venezuelans rain on hugo the stunning defeat sunday of president hugo chavezs constitutional reform agenda is more than a setback for venezuelas messianic strongman it is a victory for the ideal of liberty across latin america what an affirmation of that ideal it would be if the u s congress now did its part to keep it alive by voting to liberalize trade with venezuelas neighbors more on that in a moment the kudos for now go to the people of venezuela mr chavez had at his disposal an almost limitless supply of petro dollars to support and to impose what amounted to a personal coup against that nations democracy he tried to bully venezuelans into voting for one man rule and a hard model of socialism they said no algimiro polanco a year old bus driver told the miami herald "i have always voted for chavez but he wants a dictatorship like cuba i dont want the government to take my small house its mine " there were reports from caracas as early as p m sunday night that the "no" vote against the chavez proposals was victorious intriguingly it took the chavez controlled national electoral council until a m to announce the results apparently mr chavez was reluctant to accept the final count but the military knew that the opposition students held the tally sheets from all the polling stations when it became clear that there was no way to fudge the results mr chavez conceded defeat though the margin of his loss is still being debated the chavez opposition was celebrating its first electoral triumph in nine years yesterday and it must have tasted good venezuelas student opposition deserves special mention for the outcome the fact that the chavez program went down in flames is due in no small part to the courage of the countrys university students who persisted with few resources against the chavez machine for months they have braved tear gas and riot police in cities across the country and responded only with cries for liberty and the open palms that became the symbol of their movement the package of reforms that mr chavez wanted the electorate to approve on sunday would have eviscerated venezuelas civil liberties the reforms were yet another assault on economic rights in a country with few left mr chavez wanted to officially strip the central bank of its autonomy and to end guarantees of private property these amendments seem to have most frightened people living at the far end of the spectrum from the countrys elite with inflation on food and non alcoholic beverages clocking in at for november alone few venezuelans were ready to hand over to mr chavez the powers he sought over money creation so yes the joy this defeat has produced is warranted but all democrats in the region should be forewarned that mr chavez isnt likely to stop his efforts at revolution inside or outside the country the president still has control of all the countrys political institutions indeed in the early hours monday morning he warned the nation that his defeat is only "for now " he pledged that he will get his reforms accomplished without changing a single word of what he put before them on sunday mr chavez remains a threat to region he is in a race against time to impose his will before his star fades as it already has in peru brazil and mexico his expansionist agenda has the potential to undermine colombias democracy and has already destabilized bolivia and ecuador this brings us to the u s role the chavezes of the world rise below our border when people there see little hope the u s senate today is scheduled to vote to ratify a free trade agreement with peru a similar pact to open the economy of colombia however is bogged down in the pettiest politics of democratic presidential campaigning and in the house such a crabbed view of the americas has bad consequences there is nothing better the u s could do to reward venezuelans for their bravery than to kick start that regions economy by enacting these agreements after sundays performance venezuelans have rightly earned the u s s attention and its support see related letters "letters to the editor cold rain on chavezs bolivarian revolution" wsj december
