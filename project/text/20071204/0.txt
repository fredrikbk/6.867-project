a cultural conversation with vinzenz brinkman setting the record straight about classical statues hues cambridge mass the venus de milo white the apollo belvedere white the barberini faun white the passing centuries may have cast their pall of grime yet ever since the renaissance rediscovered antiquity our platonic ideal of classical statuary has been bare marble bleached bone white the greeks and romans did not see it that way the current show "gods in color painted sculpture of classical antiquity" through jan at the arthur m sackler museum on harvard universitys campus makes a bold attempt to set the record straight on view are replicas painted in the same mineral and organic pigments used by the ancients pulverized malachite green azurite blue arsenic compounds yellow orange cinnabar or "dragons blood" red as well as charred bone and vine black at first glance and quite a while after the unaccustomed palette strikes most viewers as way over the top but few would deny that these novelties archers goddesses mythic beasts look you straight in the eye the prime mover behind the show is vinzenz brinkmann a german archaeologist who has spent the past two decades investigating polychromy literally the use of many colors in greek and roman sculpture the longtime director of the glyptothek in munich one of the foremost collections of ancient sculpture outside greece or italy he has recently moved on to the liebighaus a museum in frankfurt dedicated to sculpture through the ages as director of the antiquities collection "without color " mr brinkmann said on a recent visit to harvard "you cant understand ancient figures at all " on dec he will be back to deliver the keynote address opening a two day symposium "superficial approaches to painted sculpture " which is free and open to the public he will also participate in the concluding panel discussion the following afternoon for details contact janet sartor at or janet sartor harvard edu for centuries the world has been living partly in ignorance partly in denial when lord duveen put up the money for a new wing of the british museum in the s he forced the restorers to clean the surfaces of the elgin marbles with copper chisels abrasives and iron brushes they knew perfectly well that this was wrong but as the ostentatious patron of the arts he was duveen insisted that his showcase look "classically" pristine the fashion for white antiquities dates back to the early th century when the renaissance began excavating works that had lain buried in the earth for centuries color traces still visible to the naked eye deep in the folds of draped clothing for instance went unnoticed following what they believed to be the greek and roman example italian sculptors notably michelangelo conceived their creations as uncolored by the th century practitioners of the then new science of archaeology were aware that the ancients had used color but johann joachim winckelmann the german prefect of antiquities at the vatican preferred white his personal taste was enshrined by fiat as the "classical" standard and so it remained unchallenged except by the occasional eccentric until the late th century has it been a case simply of cultural inertia mr brinkmann thinks not "i cant prove this " he says "but you cant help noticing the way the postwar generation in europe rejected color the th century was the cruelest in modern european history it traumatized the middle class in ways we are still only beginning to understand for decades the mainstream didnt want color they wanted things to be white it was part of the modernist aesthetic color and ornament box you in a white cube leaves space open undefined its irrational throughout history the world fought against the irrational but now people like it its an escape from history in a way so its a kind of comfort " the ancients valued marble mr brinkmann says but not as we do "in modern times " he explains "marble has been prized for its surface effect sculptors in antiquity knew it as the material that would allow them to do exactly what they wanted they thought about it as filmmakers today think about their cameras you got what you paid for you ordered a block of parian marble the best there is and you paid a fortune but once it was delivered you could relax because in those cubic meters there would never be a fault or a flaw if the sculptor wanted to make a fold a meter long he could do it in limestone hed run into a shell or a bump or a hole the crystal structure of marble is absolutely pure and even its the most homogeneous natural material in the world its a gift from god its perfection " once the sculptor had finished however it was the painters turn nor was that the end of the story "we think of white marble figures as aesthetic monuments " mr brinkmann says "we think of them as static frozen in a museum installation but weve learned by our studies of polychromy that the interplay with architecture and the large ornaments on the pediment of large structures in fact turned them into actors on a kind of stage and the more color they had the more lifelike they looked " much in the manner of the builders of medieval cathedrals the greeks told their great legends in pictures not all the sculpture in question is in the round friezes showing figures in low or high relief were treated in the same manner one example mr brinkmann has studied with particular attention is the frieze of the siphnian treasury in the sanctuary of apollo at delphi one section shows the gods of olympus assembled to determine the outcome of the combat between achilles and memnon rather than debate the warriors merits the divine herald hermes places their souls in the scales of fate memnon whose soul proves the heavier must die typically a modern viewer sees such material up close in museums and galleries the greeks saw them at a distance so we may wonder how much of the abundant detail actually registered "perceptual physiology hasnt changed in the last years " mr brinkmann says "color enhances legibility tremendously the greeks painted the names of the figures on the friezes you can read the names from meters away the eye has amazing powers of resolution you must also remember that the ancient world unlike ours was a world with few images the images people saw were built up from a repertoire of elements that never changed what we call seeing is really only actual vision the other is memory and so the details that seem to vanish in the distance mysteriously read all the same " the research behind mr brinkmanns replicas has been going on since the early s but the building of replicas in plaster or synthetic marble "color reconstructions " he calls them is of more recent date early on a principal tool for investigating the surfaces of ancient statues was a hand held lamp positioned at an angle to create conditions of extreme raking light which can reveal crucial surface details another was ultraviolet which reveals "color shadows" of pigments no longer visible to the naked eye since then other far more advanced technology has come into play and the wealth of knowledge is expanding exponentially mr brinkmann and his associates have long known that archaic statues were painted in flat even colors to enhance the effect of roundness or volume artists might use elaborately calibrated patterns a zigzag design for instance swelling and tapering with the shape of an arm or leg but mostly they depended on natural light and shadow to his astonishment mr brinkmann recently discovered that the polychromy of later sculpture used shading hatching and highlighting to convey plasticity darkened colors in the fold of a garment a pinprick of light in the black pupil of an eye bright glints in a head of curly hair details like these create their own chiaroscuro the so called alexander sarcophagus in istanbul which depicts alexander the great in action is mr brinkmanns piece de resistance in this regard while occasionally the color reconstructions rely on guesswork was a given piece of body armor ochre or actually golden the speculative margin in mr brinkmanns creations is narrow since when the first of his color reconstructions went on display in munich the slowly growing collection some two dozen pieces now has traveled widely not only to such postclassical northern cities as copenhagen basel and amsterdam but also to the ancient capitals rome athens and byzantium istanbul to you "harvard is our th venue " mr brinkmann says "the emotional response of viewers here is as intense as it has been everywhere else the new view of antiquity upsets some people unconsciously they register the message that images lie artists through the ages have been working hard to achieve just that the aesthetic ideal of the greeks was mimesis the imitation of life and it was color that brought their statues to life " mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on culture and creative personalities
