a sound portrait a history of american classical music by barrymore laurence scherer sourcebooks pages &# most american concert goers are likely to know a long list of european symphonists and opera composers but only a few american ones and they are likely to feel unembarrassed by such tepid chauvinism after all isnt the european tradition the "great" one barrymore laurence scherer a frequent contributor to the journals leisure &amp arts pages sets out to correct this imbalance in "a history of american classical music " profiling americas own long list of composers and highlighting the major works of each or at least the works that have made a claim on our attention john cages " for instance made history without making music mr scherer is not a champion of any particular school or a polemicist he is a genial tutor giving the best possible account of every figure he discusses even philip glasss mind numbing arpeggios are treated with respect and leaving to others the grim task of deciding what is truly worth listening to and what is to be avoided for sanitys sake aaron copland and leonard bernstein can be found in "a history of american classical music " of course and george gershwin charles ives and lest we forget louis moreau gottschalk and stephen foster other names half muffled now are made to resonate more fully by mr scherers survey of the music that brought them a certain measure of fame and that found its way for a time into the repertory virgil thomsons "symphony on a hymn tune" william schumans "new england triptych" and third symphony howard hansons second symphony "the romantic" walter pistons own second symphony edward macdowells "indian suite" and second piano concerto morton goulds "american symphonettes " from the late th century are john knowles paine and horatio parker both of whose orchestral works may be confused for brahms on an uninspired day closer to our own time are atonalists like elliott carter and milton babbitt experimentalists like harry partch and edgard varese and tonally inclined composers like john adams and john corigliano who mix all sorts of textures pitch arrangements and forms dozens of other composers from the modern part of mr scherers busy chronicle e g henry cowell paul creston do not fit easily into any category no composer really does although the category "avoid for sanitys sake" may be apt in the case of morton feldman whose string quartet ii lasts five hours as the new yorker critic alex ross has gently put it "certain later feldman works unfold over extraordinarily lengthy spans of time straining the capabilities of performers to play them and audiences to hear them" they also "abandon the syntax of western music " a few of the compositions that mr scherer mentions sadly not feldmans quartet can be sampled aurally on a cd that accompanies the book among the most poignant figures in "a history of american classical music " and among the most emblematic is samuel barber we are reminded that his "school for scandal" overture and symphony no both composed when he was in his s entered the repertoire almost immediately in the mid s arturo toscanini conducted his music for an nbc symphony broadcast mr scherer tells us "and by the time his violin concerto appeared in barber was taking his place among those american composers to be most often programmed over the next four decades " barber composed among much else the "essay for orchestra " a song cycle called "knoxville summer of " from james agees words and a piano concerto and today well the new york city opera this season is reviving barbers opera "vanessa" and the violin concerto can often be heard but somehow barbers vogue like that of schuman hanson piston david diamond roy harris and other mid century american composers never found a way of transmuting itself into a broad beloved and steady concert hall presence the kind that might last all the way down to our own day only copland has managed to do so and possibly schuman if we take into account a vast subculture of wind ensemble performance but barber wins the laurel wreath anyway his "adagio for strings" first written for string quartet and then scored for orchestral strings is probably the last great american work to have found a hallowed place in the repertory and if the phrase is allowable in the hearts of the composers countrymen it is an achingly expressive piece of music inflected by the astringent harmonic newnesses of the th century but impossible to imagine without western art musics long incrementally varied tonal tradition yes hollywood studios have borrowed the "adagio for strings" more than once threatening to turn it into kitsch but it has so far managed to keep its dignity and its intimations of something profound it may well command the attention of listeners in concert halls or if need be movie theaters for a long time to come most of the works in "a history of american classical music" will not they will survive if at all in the playlists of dinosaur radio stations the programs of earnest music festivals the textbooks of music history courses and the dustier precincts of audiophile cd collections not that there is anything disgraceful about that or unusual the fate of most art is cruel mr eichman is the journals books editor
