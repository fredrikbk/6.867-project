guilds blue collar guy gets a starring role for the past month striking screenwriters have placed their faith in veteran union organizer david young who cut his teeth rallying garment workers carpenters and other blue collar trades but as the strike enters a crucial phase mr young faces a test of his core strategy applying traditional labor tactics to a hollywood creative guild whose members range from millionaires to part time waiters thus far mr young has taken a hard line against the studios in his role as lead negotiator for striking members of the writers guild of america and he has surprised the entertainment industry by organizing a unified highly visible and noisy strike by the writers a group that has in the past often behaved like a dispassionate collection of white collar professionals not a cohesive militant union mr young has relied on a playbook that draws heavily from his past mixing street theater and sloganeering with calls for the writers to expand their power base by annexing nonunionized writers of reality tv animation and original internet content the writers have added their own flair to the mix peppering the internet with clever youtube videos that pillory the studios and have helped the guild gain a big advantage in the public spin game as he goes forward though mr young faces other challenges his background is in union organizing not contract negotiations and the studio executives sitting across the table are quietly sowing the notion that he is not up to the task mr young himself plays down the difficulties "this kind of renegotiation is not that complicated in traditional negotiating terms " he says the studios have also dug in against mr youngs efforts to expand the guilds reach a push he tried before and failed to pull off and the big media conglomerates that own the studios and tv networks are not yet under pressure from wall street or advertisers to cave in as the strike drags on mr young faces the difficult task of maintaining unity in a guild in which some members struggle to find work while others make millions of dollars a year and stand to lose big sums in a long work stoppage in response mr young has departed somewhat from most labor unions focus on rank and file workers paying special attention to the guilds top earners to ensure their participation comparing the guild to other unions he has organized mr young says "all the fundamentals are the same the most specific difference is that this is a group of creative intellectuals that have a tremendous capacity to participate at a really high level " the writers and the studios appear to be at a crucial juncture after the guild spent the weekend reviewing the latest proposal put forth by the alliance of motion picture and television producers which negotiates on behalf of the studios the two sides will meet again today in los angeles should talks collapse the strike could last well into next year reflecting mr youngs confrontational style the guild last thursday quickly condemned the studios latest offer as "a massive rollback" just hours after it was proposed but in an interview friday mr young softened that stance saying that because the writers are asking for &# million in pay increases over the next three years and the studios latest offer totaled &# million "were not that far apart " he added "we are prepared to stay at the table and get a deal done as soon as possible " the amptp declined a request for comment but in an open letter slated to appear in the trade press today the producers organization said "ours is not a "take it or leave it" offer it is designed to allow both sides to engage in the kind of substantive give and take negotiation that can lead to common ground " mr young worked for a time as a plumber after he graduated from college in san diego as a union organizer one of his highest profile jobs came in the mid s when he worked for unite the garment workers union mr young helped lead an organizing drive against los angeles based clothing manufacturer guess inc trying to unionize thousands of low wage workers many of them illegal immigrants mr young led an effort targeting guess and its local suppliers that continued for several years but the move backfired the organizing effort failed and guess moved most of its california manufacturing jobs to mexico costing thousands of jobs "its a story of american manufacturing over the last years if workers try to organize their jobs are taken away theyre fired by globalization " mr young said last week reflecting on that effort mr young was hired by the writers guild in after he left a southern california construction union the next year then secretary treasurer patric verrone and his allies were overwhelmingly voted into the top roles at the guild on the heels of what the membership viewed as the latest in a series of bad deals with the studios mr verrone campaigned on a platform of change vowing to unionize the swelling ranks of reality television writers and he quickly installed mr young as executive director almost immediately mr young began employing tactics rarely seen at the guild as he launched the battle to organize the reality writers in november guild members disrupted a panel of network executives being moderated by cnns anderson cooper and he staged other "spontaneous" protests in los angeles and new york but the wgas effort to organize reality writers never gained traction and the union largely abandoned the cause discussing the effort mr young says he is "very happy with what weve tried to do" but concedes that "the results arent always there " compensation for writers is generally more complicated than that for hourly workers so the current talks arent simple hollywood writers typically receive a fee for writing a script followed by later payments called residuals when the work is shown again on television or sold on dvd in its open letter the amptp said that under its latest proposal a feature film writer will receive a minimum of &# by the third year of the contract a nearly &# increase over the current contract tv writers meanwhile will get upward of &# as a minimum for a one hour network pilot a core issue in the current strike is residuals for writers when their work is used in digital forms like online streaming or downloads a business thats still in its early days and has an uncertain future mr youngs other big challenge is keeping together a guild whose individual members have a wildly divergent range of economic interests the studios and the guild offer differing accounts of what a typical member earns in a letter distributed to the news media friday the amptp painted guild writers as "among the highest paid employees in america " saying the "average" writer pulls in more than &# a year the guild counters that the "typical" writer earns a mere &# a year each figure is accurate in its own context because some writers rake in millions the average income among the approximately west coast writers who worked in was indeed around &# according to data in the annual report of the wga west the guilds west coast branch but because writers frequently dont work every year charles b slocum an assistant executive director of the wga west who does financial analysis says it makes sense to look over a longer period the &# figure is the median of working wga west writers five year average incomes mr slocum says the median for working wga west writers in alone was about &# mari kornhauser an independent filmmaker and guild member whose past projects have included the movie "housebound " says many guild members are like her "middle class poor" for whom residuals are "extremely important " apart from a select few who may earn as much as &# million for their projects she says "most writers are not contract employees they may do a job one year and then have nothing for three years " unless he is able to hold together the successful and struggling mr young acknowledges his fight will be hard to sustain "really the whole model i base my approach on is that all of our power really comes from the membership and whether or not they participate " mr young says "the only real power i have comes from the memberships willingness to participate and be strong if necessary "
