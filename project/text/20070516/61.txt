it spendings mixed messages investors in the technology sector have seemingly been getting mixed messages on the strength of u s based information technology spending lately depending on which technology company is reporting their earnings spending on technology gear is on the rise or on its way down that say investors and analysts is because some markets of technology such as networking equipment and personal computers are seeing good demand while areas such as storage hardware arent so hot it also means investors cant make broad bets when choosing technology companies in which to invest "you cant play the aggregate technology sector very well " said mark mowrey an analyst at al frank asset management which owns shares of technology stocks "in general anytime you talk about it spending its in such broad brush strokes i dont think parts move in tandem as everyone assumes " this past quarter companies such as cisco systems inc international business machines corp emc corp and sun microsystems inc have talked about lackluster u s corporate information technology or it spending during the first quarter while others like hewlett packard co and cdw corp appear to be seeing robust spending "i suspect what we are seeing is a slowdown in spending by big companies " said jeff matthews general partner at hedge fund ram partners "auto companies are in rough shape and some financial companies might be pulling back " roger kay founder of endpoint technologies associates a market research firm agreed adding that corporations are under pressure from investors to keep costs down so companies may be taking a more cautious stance when it comes to where they will spend their it dollars after all a corporation could justify spending on networking equipment if it sped up productivity but the firm may be hard pressed to get support for another server or storage system despite the mixed messages market research firm idc is still predicting it spending growth of this year which has been the firms figure since the start of stephen minton an analyst at idc said the health of technology spending really depends on what market a particular company addresses for example cisco is doing well mr minton said because companies and the telecommunications industry are continuing to spend on networking equipment to support new services like internet protocol tv or iptv pcs mr minton said are also seeing good demand in part because of microsoft corp s new vista operating system meanwhile storage hardware may not be seeing as much growth as storage software he said "pretty much the main theme running through all the results is that the mood and tone of the vendor reflects heavily which technology and geographies are the strongest " mr minton said despite the bearish comments from some companies tech stocks as a group continue to climb the morgan stanley technology index which tracks a cross section of large cap technology stocks is hovering near six year highs and has risen since hitting its year low at the end of july that outpaces the gain over the same period by the s&amp p stock index "tech stocks are moving higher on macroeconomic reasons so they are up there for reasons other than themselves " said sushil wagle a senior vice president for j &amp w seligman for tech stock prices "to go beyond here investors have to feel comfortable that corporate spending in america will be fine " he said
