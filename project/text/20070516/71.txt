me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q at the mile service for our honda odyssey minivan we were told one of four front engine mounts the only one "liquid filled " was leaking we had it replaced for &# can you explain this and will we face another failure in the future attila matray carlsbad calif a it is true there are four mounts that support the engine and transmission in your odyssey van and yes the front mount is filled with liquid that helps it absorb vibration when the engine is idling the other three mounts are conventional while i understand they dont typically fail after four years or miles such a failure isnt especially rare i wouldnt grouse about the failure but i would save the receipt from the recent service if the replacement mount fails within the same range send honda a letter q i am considering buying a maserati quattroporte or gransport but i cant afford a new model and am looking into used options i found three year old models without a lot of mileage at half the price of new is it at all recommended to buy a used maserati kambiz aghili san diego a many will disagree but i think if you find a used maserati you like that doesnt have any known mechanical maladies you should buy it expensive sports cars present some of the best cases for buying used as high rates of depreciation often make them affordable however the maserati is an exotic machine and even basic services such as oil changes and tune ups can result in sticker shock still i fondly recall test driving a maserati a few years ago and thinking if i were in the market for such a car i would be willing to put up with its fussiness within reason in exchange for the pleasure of sitting in its beautifully tailored cockpit and listening to its screaming engine q i drive a lexus lx which i love except for poor gas mileage is there an suv with four wheel or all wheel drive that gets good gas mileage are there any hybrids you would recommend david h anderson portland ore a two hybrid suvs that come to mind are the lexus rx h and toyota highlander while critics point out their fuel economy especially the lexuss is far from stellar they generally perform better than other suvs nonhybrid models worth a test drive are the acura mdx bmw x and gmc acadia questions can be e mailed to mecar wsj com
