boat maker charts new course the u s pleasure boat market is tanking on high gasoline prices and other consumer worries at brunswick corp the worlds biggest recreational boat maker chief executive dustan mccoy says he cant say when industry sales which sprang a leak last year will hit bottom but once the u s market stabilizes brunswick with leading brands like hatteras and mercury could be a seaworthy stock pick the year old lake forest ill company is in better shape to weather a downturn than in the past and is in a good position for long term growth mr mccoy said in an interview brunswick has doubled its international business in the past five years and increased its marine parts sales to support older boats costs are coming down and brunswick has a good grip on inventory levels mr mccoy isnt alone in his faith in the company shares rallied nearly on april when brunswick reported a drop in first quarter earnings but reaffirmed its earnings outlook of &# a share in down

compared with other stocks in the recreational products industry is mixed during the past two years shares of brunswick have fallen compared with a decline for the industry during the past five years though brunswick shares have gained compared with a gain for the industry a g edwards analyst timothy conder has a "hold" rating on the shares he thinks the stock will trade in a narrow range until the industry hits bottom likely sometime this year given that brunswick has refitted its business to navigate up and down sales cycles "some long term investors are already looking at the stock " he said for the long haul mr conder likes brunswicks dominant position in the market with a share in outboard engine boats and in inboard models in the mid to high end of the market brunswicks chief competitor is privately held genmar holdings inc the average pleasure boat owner is years old with an annual income of &# compared with the average u s consumer who is years old and earns &# a year

&# on gas " brunswick is focused not just on consumers but also on its dealers historically a weak spot in boat sales said james hardiman at ftn midwest securities corp in markets such as michigan and illinois the two biggest boating states behind florida and california dealers have trouble keeping good workers in a summer only business plus most dealers carry many brands making it tough to provide top notch customer service "brunswick is doing everything it can to work better with dealers " including weeding out weak ones mr hardiman said "when the boat market improves theyll be in great shape to add more market share to their no position " potentially game changing technology could jump start brunswicks u s sales industry watchers say along with partners such as engine maker cummins inc brunswick has worked for more than a decade to develop a navigation system called zeus combining a new engine design with global positioning system and other navigation tools it allows boats to maintain a stationary position on the water and makes docking easier and safer it can also save as much as on fuel and cut exhaust emission zeus can add as much as &# to a boats price tag but on a vessel costing &# or more it is worth it said mr conder of a g edwards zeus will be available this summer on smaller brunswick boats and next year on other models it is also being sold to other manufacturers mr mccoy said meanwhile brunswick is offsetting dismal u s sales with growth in foreign markets such as europe asia and the middle east in the first quarter non u s boat business accounted for of sales and is expected to reach in a few years marine parts sales are also rising aimed at boat owners who are keeping older boats rather than replacing them brunswick was founded as a billiards maker and it still generates of sales outside of the marine industry in addition to billiards it is in the bowling and commercial fitness equipment markets brunswicks leading life fitness brand is gaining strength with world wide sales to hotels and fitness clubs rising in the first quarter "fitness equipment is recession proof " mr mccoy said "people seem to go to the gym even more when times are tough " mr mccoy said brunswick isnt looking to add other lines of recreation business "over the years weve tried a lot of things some have worked and some havent " he said
