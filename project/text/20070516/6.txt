benn and wolfowitz imagine that a high level western official in charge of fighting poverty is accused of a personal conflict of interest that undermines his integrity one can only wonder what paul wolfowitz thinks of the hilary benn dust up mr benn britains minister for international development has been among those fighting mr wolfowitzs anticorruption drive at the world bank he was also one of the first european officials to criticize mr wolfowitz for awarding a promotion and salary increase to his girlfriend over the weekend however it was mr benns turn to squirm the sunday telegraph reported that mr benn holds some gbp or about &# of stock in a company that has a gbp a year contract with his department and that he has been inconsistent in declaring this business interest on standard forms for mps mr benn received the shares in united business media which runs services including pr newswire from family members his spokesman says he has been blocked from making decisions involving the company and that he has made senior civil servants aware of his shareholdings if only the world banks ethics committee had granted mr wolfowitzs request when he joined the bank in to be similarly recused from matters involving his girlfriend shaha riza or perhaps his disclosure of their relationship and the transparent way in which he sought and received the committees approval for compensating ms riza for the disruption to her career should have sufficed to ease mr benns concerns about mr wolfowitzs integrity and intentions the facts uncovered so far dont appear to reveal grave wrongdoing on the part of mr benn a candidate for the labour partys deputy leadership and possibly the next foreign minister under gordon brown but hes also fortunate he doesnt have the world bank staff and his fellow europeans trying to drive him out of a job
