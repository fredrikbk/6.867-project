the afternoon report changing tune online edition the much criticized copyright protections that nervous music companies insist upon for legally purchased digital music files took another hit as amazon com said it intends to sell music without the embedded features the online retail giant which already sells loads of compact discs said that its long expected music store will offer "millions of songs" in the mp file format without digital rights management or drm technology the copyright protections have been a touchy subject in the world of digital music record companies say that they need the software to protect their products from rampant copying and piracy that slice into their sales but critics charge that the software hamstrings consumers by making it impossible to transfer songs between devices sentiment has lately been turning against the piracy curbs raising some eyebrows among those who think that his company has profited more than anyone else from the record industrys piracy paranoia apple ceo steve jobs penned a jeremiad against drm earlier this year then british music giant emi group said last month with mr jobs sitting alongside that they plan to offer a significant portion of their catalog without anticopying software the stakes for the music industry are considerable for as much as companies might fear that dropping the drm safeguards would allow throngs of pirates to ransack their intellectual property the industry runs the risk of falling further behind a shift in the way that consumers purchase and listen to music digital downloads still account for less than a fifth of all recorded music that is purchased in the u s but many of those who are still buying cds no doubt take them home and promptly load them on their computers and many analysts think that digital music sales would be even higher if the drm safeguards didnt make it so difficult to listen to music on various devices mr jobs and others argue that by closely guarding copyrights music companies might be stifling innovation that could help turn the business around "if such requirements were removed the music industry might experience an influx of new companies willing to invest in innovative new stores and players this can only be seen as a positive by the music companies " he wrote in his essay apple given its current dominance of the market would be well positioned to benefit from any further flowering of digital music but amazons move into the business clearly turns up the competitive pressure right now details about amazons shop are still fuzzy the company didnt disclose how much it would charge for songs or when the store would be opening its virtual doors but the development was received as a significant milestone by analysts david card of jupiter research wrote that though amazon might have a difficult time at first making money on the business the company is a "master of upselling" and has "zero customer acquisition costs " mr card wrote that amazons store should do "just as well as any other store and likely better " investors seemed to be waiting for more details however and amazon shares were treading water stocks hug the
