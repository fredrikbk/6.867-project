deal or no deal whenever democrats and republicans both cheer a "compromise " it pays to ask what theyre hiding but the trade deal announced late last week between the bush administration and house democrats looks like a genuine bipartisan breakthrough albeit with some major risks worth watching in simplest terms democrats have agreed to help republicans pass bilateral trade pacts with peru and panama in return for gop concessions on labor and environmental standards in a better world congress would realize that freer trade in goods and services is in everyones interest and wouldnt demand new legal obstacles but democrats are under pressure from unions which see their ranks shrinking and from the green lobbies that want u s standards imposed on the rest of the world the question was how destructive any new trade rules would be and in the event it looks as if the worst damage was avoided protectionists wanted the u s to abide by the "core principles" of the international labor organization ilo even though the u s has signed only two of its eight conventions they also wanted third parties such as the afl cio to be able to file trade complaints they lost on both counts only countries party to the trade pacts will be able to file complaints with a special arbitration tribunal as important the bush administration has agreed to abide only by the ilos "declarations" on worker rights which the u s has already endorsed and which are general aspirations about curtailing forced labor and the like rather than specific legal obligations this means the afl cio will not be able to rewrite u s labor law by the back door and it should entail no new obligations for u s business wed have preferred an overall "safe harbor" provision that protected the u s from any legal action instead the deal amounts to a framework to minimize complaints even if peru say did complain that some u s labor practice violated the pact it would have to prove that the practice actually affected trade and even then the trade tribunal would have no power to alter u s law congress would still have to act the deal also only applies to federal law so "right to work" states cannot be challenged the larger danger is that some future administration prodded by unions or the sierra club will use the new language to beat up our trading partners greens in particular will try to use these trade pacts to reduce logging and energy use in poor countries that may not be able to afford rich country regulatory costs history shows that as national incomes rise poorer countries have their own incentives to clean the air or preserve forests forcing them to do so before they begin to prosper may result in less green progress the white house also bowed to democrats by weakening drug company intellectual property rights under the new terms u s bilateral trading partners will have the right to produce and sell any generic drug already available in the u s so the same democrats who gripe when china doesnt punish the theft of american software or movies are only too happy to strip u s drug makers of their global patent rights the national association of manufacturers rightly worries that this precedent will spread to other industries having made all of those concessions the white house should be embarrassed that it won support for only two relatively minor trade deals the exclusion of the trade pact with colombia which is already signed is especially disgraceful democrats are demanding new "human rights" guarantees from bogota on grounds that labor leaders have been killed in colombia but president alvaro uribe has done more to protect human life and establish a rule of law in colombia than any president in recent memory hes americas best ally in a region that is increasingly hostile toward american values union activists have been killed in the war torn country but so have journalists judges police peasants and ranchers humiliating mr uribe and colombia by rejecting this trade pact will only please the terrorists and drug lords who will have a poorer population to terrorize and recruit from the white house says negotiations with democrats are continuing on the colombia deal as well as on the pending pact with south korea ditto for the presidents trade promotion authority which expires next month and limits congresss ability to amend free trade pacts without agreement on those issues the peru and panama deal will be a hollow victory if nothing else however this trade progress should put to rest the caricature that the bush administration is politically inflexible credit also belongs to new york democrat charlie rangel the ways and means chairman who worked to overcome his own partys protectionists lets hope they can build on that cooperation to maintain a free trade majority in congress
