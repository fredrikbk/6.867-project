the morning brief bernankes regulatory preference for a light touch on derivatives online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here regulators it seems will always struggle to keep up with the ever quickening pace of innovation in financial markets ben bernankes on one hand and on the other discourse yesterday about how to police derivatives markets lacked a clear prescription but it did serve as a reminder that even the biggest macro policy making has something in common with individual investment decisions a balancing of risks and benefits addressing the atlanta federal reserves annual financial markets conference the fed chairman noted that the increasing prominence of hedge funds a subject he tackled last year and credit derivatives are part of the "remarkable wave of financial innovation that we have seen in recent years " and one that has prompted boisterous debates about the need for more regulation but central banks and other regulators "should resist the temptation to devise ad hoc rules for each new type of financial instrument or institution " he argued "rather we should strive to develop common principles based policy responses that can be applied consistently across the financial sector to meet clearly defined objectives " a big reason why the sophistication and depth of financial markets promote economic growth by moving capital to where it can earn the best returns while dispersing risk more broadly among a wider field of investors increasing "the resilience of the system and the economy to shocks " he said any tampering with the likes of single name credit default swaps credit default swap indexes and derivatives based on exotic interest rates and foreign exchange options in short all the kinds of complex instruments created to transform risk into profit must also preserve the benefits of financial innovation he said what public policy makers must do he noted is assure financial stability in the marketplace protect investors and safeguard the integrity of the markets to do these things correctly regulators need to know how to measure risk in the infamously opaque derivatives and hedge fund fields at the same time mr bernanke suggests it isnt fair to scrutinize only one particular class or category of investing field "if transparency about risk bearing is important then consistency seems to imply that full transparency should be required of credit markets broadly not just of credit derivatives " he says "and why stop with credit markets do we know exactly who is bearing the risk in equity markets or foreign exchange markets for example " mr bernanke thus voices support for the british leaning toward a "principles based and risk focused approach that takes account of the benefits as well as the risks that accompany financial innovation " the idea as he describes it is to use a "light touch" in regulation but one that isnt "inconsistent with the use of rules which can provide needed clarity or a safe haven from legal and regulatory risks " in other words set principles and then create rules to follow them rather than create rules for each issue that pops up such an approach he said "could provide substantial economic and social benefits " white house all options open for wolfowitz the white house is backing away from its previously staunch support of paul wolfowitz at the world bank until yesterday that support for a former administration official close to vice president dick cheney hadnt wavered as the wall street journal notes senior administration officials stressed to the washington post that the white house hasnt abandoned mr wolfowitz and doesnt think he should be fired but spokesman tony snow said outright that "all options are on the table " and that "members of the world bank board mr wolfowitz need to sit down and figure out what is in fact going to be best for this bank " on another personnel front new details emerging about a tense intra administration fight over the nsa domestic eavesdropping program "could spell further trouble for attorney general alberto gonzales " as the journal says mr gonzaless former deputy james comey testified before congress that the president had to intervene in march to avert a crisis over the program after then attorney general john ashcroft fbi director robert mueller and other senior justice department aides threatened to resign as the new york times reports "mr bush quelled the revolt over the programs legality by allowing it to continue without justice department approval also directing department officials to take the necessary steps to bring it into compliance with the law " as the times sums up mr comeys account mr comey described his race to a hospital sirens blaring to prevent mr gonzales then white house counsel from pushing an ailing mr ashcroft to sign a document he had already rejected the new details underscore what the journal notes is "a divide between administration lawyers who argue that the law places limits on presidential powers and those such as mr gonzales who prefer to push the limits of executive authority " new management for the war president bush yesterday tapped a three star army general to serve as white house "war czar " managing the washington side of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan in ways that will avoid what the president apparently considered problems encountered by the traditional u s national security apparatus in the past five years lt gen douglas e lute currently serves as operations chief for the joint chiefs of staff and "in effect will jump over many superiors as he moves to the west wing and assumes authority to deal directly with cabinet secretaries and top commanders " the washington post notes lt gen lute had been a voice of dissent during the administration review that led to the current "surge" policy in iraq the post adds "lute believed the situation in iraq reflected the same mistakes as the ineffective and disorganized response to hurricane katrina according to a source familiar with the debate " the paper says "like others at the pentagon he was also irked because civilian agencies in his view had not done nearly enough to help stabilize iraq and he was outspoken about the increasing strains on the u s military officials said " his selection caps what the wall street journal notes was "a long and embarrassing administration effort to find a senior official willing to take the job " the administration "approached at least three retired four star generals about the position but was rebuffed with one of the generals publicly criticizing the administration for lacking a clear strategy for iraq " the journal adds the appointment which will have to be confirmed by congress comes at a time when "newly declassified data show that as additional american troops began streaming into iraq in march and april the number of attacks on civilians and security forces there stayed relatively steady or at most declined slightly in the clearest indication yet that the troop increase could take months to have a widespread impact on security " the new york times reports separately usa today reports that the shiite dominated iraqi government is trying to set up an intelligence agency "that would rival the u s backed organization created shortly after the fall of saddam hussein " and the journal of the american medical association citing a report from the world health organization reports that the iraqi populations health is increasingly threatened by a shortage of health care workers and troubled infrastructure "in addition to pressures on the health system due to violence related injuries a shortage of basic services is taking its toll " jama says "according to the agency of people lack effective sanitation lack access to clean water and only have access to the public food distribution system " hamas fatah fighting escalates the virtually uninterrupted skirmishing between hamas forces and those loyal to fatah seemed once again to break into open warfare this week in gaza and took an escalating turn this morning gunmen from hamas which leads the palestinians current coalition government shot dead six bodyguards from the rival fatah movement of president mahmoud abbas hamas forces fired rockets into israel in the latest attempt to draw israel into the fray and fighting spread near the gaza compound of mr abbas though he was in the west bank hamas fired mortars and pipe bombs at the home of the fatah security chief in the territory before storming the building and killing the bodyguards there the associated press reports fatah officials also said hamas fighters killed five of their own number by ambushing a fatah vehicle carrying hamas detainees the continuing clashes suggest the unity government formed with the help of saudi mediation in march "is something of a fiction " the new york times notes especially in light of remarks made by the independent interior minister hani al qawasmeh when he quit yesterday declaring that neither side was ready to respect authority the intra palestinian violence coupled with political uncertainty in israel also makes it very unlikely any work will take place soon on the peacemaking front also of note new york times russia agreed to tone down the harsh language its senior officials have used against the u s in recent months but the two countries remained at an impasse on several issues that have strained relations following a kremlin meeting between president vladimir putin and secretary of state condoleezza rice washington post the department of homeland security is breaking privacy laws by failing to tell the public all
