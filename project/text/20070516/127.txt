unfriendly skies as pay falls airlines struggle to fill jobs tighter staffing makes morale severely tested why your flight is late wrestling suitcases on and off planes got so grueling late last year for southwest airlines co s ramp workers in chicago that by christmas season one fourth of them were reporting on the job injuries starting pay for the position &# an hour airlines used to offer prestigious jobs with good wages and coveted flight benefits now in the aftermath of aggressive cutbacks a growing number of airline jobs are more akin to those at a fast food restaurant the pay is low the work is tough and in a new twist airlines are having trouble hanging onto workers and finding new ones "what once was a glamorous job doesnt look so good any more " says andy roberts executive vice president of operations for northwest airlines corp mr roberts says northwest and its peers used to have a list of applicants "as long as your arm " now "we have to go seek them out even pilots " thats not good news for passengers as the combination of fewer and less experienced workers is causing more service problems planes sit on tarmacs because airlines are short on gate workers service on planes is slower because many airlines are flying with fewer flight attendants when bad weather hits tight staffing may mean more delays or canceled flights the situation isnt likely to improve anytime soon although airlines were able to raise fares the last two years as travel surged customers have begun to resist fare increases domestic demand is softening and jet fuel prices have started rising again these are the same pressures that contributed to more than &# billion in net losses from through the u s airline industry is profitable today in part because big network carriers shed more than workers or of the total between august and october according to the air transport association that happened even as the number of passengers flying has returned to pre levels pay has fallen sometimes substantially capt gene malone a year old pilot for amr corp s american airlines says his annual pay dropped to &# from &# after the airline won concessions to stay out of bankruptcy hes flying more overnight "red eye" flights from his base in los angeles he plans to retire early in about months "an airline career is not worth it anymore " says capt malone "its a very different profession than it was years ago when i started " when ual corp s united airlines decided recently to bring back pilots who were furloughed during the downturn most didnt want to come back says capt steve derebey a spokesman for the pilots union "it takes letters to get one back " he says ual disputes this saying a majority have returned it acknowledges having a hard time recruiting new workers in some locations where unemployment is low and the cost of living is high american airlines now staffs full md s with three flight attendants the minimum under federal regulations down from four the plane carries around passengers though airlines say they can get by with the minimum because meals have largely disappeared from planes one fewer worker increases the likelihood of a flight being canceled if a crew member calls in sick pamela lopez lewis a northwest flight attendant for years says she started working a second job as a bartender months ago to make up for what she estimates is a &# drop in pay imposed by the airline in bankruptcy "everybody is reaching their breaking point " she says of her colleagues "morale is so low youve been insulted by the pay youre getting youre not feeling happy i absolutely think it affects service apathy prevails " mr roberts the northwest executive vice president says "morale is certainly severely tested its hard to keep people enthused " american airlines passenger leana hill had her holidays upended by short staffing last christmas day when she and her family had two of their flights canceled due to lack of crews the hills missed spending christmas in st louis with her in laws eventually arriving around midnight american called her experience "unfortunate" and said staffing is difficult for all industries during the holidays advances in technology account for some of the declining need for workers many passengers book their tickets on the internet and check in via self service kiosks also airlines need fewer gate agents because passengers are now generally required to check in at the main terminal before undergoing security screening nonetheless by many measures service is growing worse last year of flights were late the highest percentage since according to the u s department of transportation that isnt all the fault of airlines the outdated u s air traffic control system also plays a role in march of this year passenger complaints about u s airlines nearly doubled from the same month a year earlier with big increases in gripes about cancellations delays and missed connections that same month the rate of mishandled baggage rose nearly from a year earlier at the largest carriers says the department us airways group inc recently acknowledged the cuts have gone too far after slashing its work force and keeping its ranks lean during two trips through chapter and a merger with america west airlines the carrier is now profitable but in march the airline ranked last among its peers in punctuality at just us airways also admits its baggage handling has suffered particularly at its hub in philadelphia with long waits and too few "runners" to transfer bags of passengers making flight connections the airline last month said it will hire more than airport workers to help it manage the busy summer travel season us airways has already hired more runners in philadelphia and started deploying "virtual agents" with cellphones to airports to assist passengers waiting on long lines united is also adding back some staff the airline says it hired flight attendants last year and plans to add this year sara nelson a spokeswoman for the association of flight attendants branch at united says one reason for the extensive outside hiring is that the airline had trouble calling back its own attendants united says a majority of those recalled came back and it was overwhelmed by applications for the new jobs it created despite the additions us airways chief executive doug parker says the market leaves airlines with little choice but to operate lean staffs "you cant get the passengers to pay more so the airlines can staff another flight attendant its the reality of the business and what the consumer has told us they want " he said in an interview for decades airline jobs were coveted and many of the largest carriers attracted multiple generations of the same families drawn to the glamour of aviation the pay was better than comparable jobs in other fields the benefits were generous and travel passes allowed workers to fly for little or no money now snarling passengers and trimmed pay have taken away much of the industrys allure and airline workers have a harder time taking an inexpensive vacation with planes full of paying passengers theyre often unable to grab a free seat for themselves even the more financially successful budget airlines are doing more with fewer people "were trying to grow the company without adding head count " says greg wells senior vice president of operations for southwest airlines when southwest was faced with the ramp worker injuries at chicagos midway airport over christmas the airline muddled through by asking for or imposing overtime and using fewer gates so there would be enough manpower to cover each one it is studying why there were so many injuries jetblue airways corp got a huge black eye when it mishandled a valentines day ice storm in new york stranding customers in airports and on planes for hours at a time david neeleman the founder and chief executive officer days later admitted there "are some areas of the company that needed to be beefed up and didnt keep pace with the growth" of the discount airline last week mr neeleman stepped down as ceo while unions criticize what they call excessive staffing cuts theyre not happy about one response to the problem outsourcing work a few years ago northwest hired lower wage "skycaps" to help check in passengers inside the terminal but it had to halt the practice after the union argued successfully that the skycaps violated contract terms governing customer service agents last month the union representing uniteds mechanics filed a grievance saying the airline is outsourcing a higher percentage of maintenance spending than the unions contract allows united says it is within the contractual limit carefully negotiated union pay scales also can make it difficult to raise wages for hard to fill jobs stephen gordon president of the international association of machinists district that represents northwest ground workers says northwest was having trouble recruiting ramp workers and wanted to raise starting pay to &# an hour from &# the unions reply if you do that you need to give everyone a &# an hour raise the wages stayed the same when outsourcing does happen the process isnt always smooth in alaska air group inc s alaska airlines outsourced ramp jobs in seattle to an outside firm the transition was marked by misplaced luggage late flights and an incident in which a damaged aircraft had to make an emergency landing the airline and the outside firm john menzies plc say the problems have been fixed overall airline and government officials say tighter staffing doesnt represent a threat to passenger safety a spokeswoman for the federal aviation administration says air travel "has never been safer " ground operations are among the most acutely affected by the airlines cutbacks troy bacon a ramp agent in atlanta for delta air lines inc says he has seen a shortage of drivers to transport luggage at the international terminal during weekends which contributes to baggage delays "sometimes they may be ten minutes late because theyre so undermanned " though the company has been hiring he said delta says it recently reorganized staffing to address problems like the one mr bacon describes mr bacon says his pay fell nearly as delta reorganized in bankruptcy court to &# an hour from &# although he has gained some of that back recently mr gordon of the machinists union said northwest is having difficulty hiring and retaining qualified employees in expensive cities such as boston and new york in minneapolis where the airline has a hub "you can hire on the ramp for &# an hour" and work bad shifts out in the cold weather or "you can work inside a target for &# " he said northwest confirms that it is having hiring difficulties in some places in dallas southwest airlines had customer service agents before compared with about now says debbie aven an official with a part of mr gordons union representing these workers southwest says the pre figure was closer to the company now sometimes assigns one or two agents to handle multiple gates which can cause problems when a flight is late or oversold says ms aven southwest says it doesnt think the new staffing arrangement has worsened service for passengers although it wont roll it out fully until it introduces technology that will help rebook passengers automatically when there are storms or other disruptions yesterday the university of michigan released its american customer satisfaction index u s airlines scored out of a possible their lowest score in seven years and two points lower than last year airlines fared worse by nine points than the federal government and even lagged by two points the internal revenue service americans vice president of customer services planning marilyn devoe says the airlines overall staffing is adequate "would we like to have more manpower " she asks "i would but it just isnt prudent as a business "
