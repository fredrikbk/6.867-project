kurdish ministers talked up investors on the attractions of working in kurdistan as locals call it foreign investors can benefit from a year tax holiday for businesses land ownership and international arbitration for settling contract disputes much of the construction in the region is being undertaken by companies from neighboring turkey and middle eastern countries the aim of the kurdish government is to lure foreign money with incentives to encourage outsiders with job skills and know how to take up residence much the way dubai has done for more than a decade officials say dubai a flashy and pricey real estate and trading hub is one of the seven united arab emirates "that is the model we are looking for dubai has been the best experiment in the middle east " says kurdish planning minister othman shwani adding that new schools and hospitals are part of the governments growth plan the areas relative security in a country with widespread violence has helped the kurdish governments ambitious growth plans but this is still iraq a truck bomb explosion at the kurdish interior ministry last week killed more than people the first such attack in nearly two years in the kurdish region kurdish military security blankets the regions main cities and even empty rural roads most foreign business officials who visit hire private security as a precaution these security measures have been key to delivering more paved roads and improved choices at stores even annoying traffic jams are indicative of the areas growth car manufacturers including japans toyota motor corp have dealerships here and more cars are filling the roads "theres a bit of a parallel in the kurdish region with dubai costs are rising for everything infrastructure projects are being built every day " says warwick knowles middle east economist at dun &amp bradstreet corp in the united kingdom the parallels extend to eye popping property prices upscale developments along with demand from thousands of people arriving in the area have pushed up home rental and home sale prices to the past few years according to the kurdish housing ministry even though a typical house in the region sells for a fraction of the price at a new development such as dream city the sharp rise has put housing out of reach for most average residents who make about &# a year according to government officials hassan ameen a mechanic has paid regular visits to real estate agents in erbil over the past seven months seeking to rent a bigger house for his wife and nine children he is convinced he will remain in his cramped two bedroom house for now prices have risen since his search started he says mr ameen years old moved his family to erbil several months ago to escape the violence in mosul about miles west "we are very happy we have security but &# a month is too much " he says the kurdish government says it is concerned about the jump in housing prices but it pins much of the blame on runaway demand from new residents "we have a housing problem kurds arabs turkmen christians have moved here in the thousands because its secure " says kurdish housing minister emad sayfoor the influx has overwhelmed housing says the government which estimates that more than new housing units are needed across the region there are no plans to cap what developers or housing owners can charge for selling and renting property says mr sayfoor but the government says it is attempting to mitigate rising housing costs a &# million program launched more than a year ago in suleimania another kurdish province offered families &# loans to help buy property and build a house a similar program will be launched shortly in erbil and to offset rising costs the government expects to double the amount of money handed out kurdish geography also pushes up housing prices the landlocked region has few natural resources outside hydrocarbons and the industrial base is being built so nearly all basic inputs are imported wood from as far away as finland steel from germany and that means added transportation costs mr adib the lebanese construction company manager says cement prices in erbil are &# a ton double the price his company pays in dubai he pays dozens of engineers more here than those doing similar jobs in dubai despite the rising prices though mr ameen the mechanic is happy to be in erbil "i saw many people die in mosul " he says "here my family is safe i will find a bigger house but it will take time "
