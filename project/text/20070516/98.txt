politics &amp economics old episode could haunt gonzales testimony recalls clash over wiretaps at ashcroft sickbed washington the justice departments former no lawyer told senators of a power struggle over domestic spying that resembled a hollywood thriller a tale that could spell further trouble for attorney general alberto gonzales testimony yesterday by former deputy attorney general james comey detailed a night in when white house and justice department officials clashed at the bedside of mr gonzaless hospitalized predecessor over the legality of wiretapping americans phone calls without warrants mr comey recounted how then attorney general john ashcroft weakened by illness roused himself long enough to sternly repeat his refusal to sign off on the plan the incident itself previously has been reported but mr comey fleshed out the role of mr gonzales then the white house counsel in overruling the justice department mr gonzales had gone to the hospital with then white house chief of staff andrew card the new details underscore a divide between administration lawyers who argue that the law places limits on presidential powers and those such as mr gonzales who prefer to push the limits of executive authority the debate has been a source of tension within the administration on matters ranging from treatment of enemy prisoners to the recent u s attorney firings that have clouded mr gonzaless tenure at justice critics seized on the episode to bolster claims that mr gonzales puts loyalty to president bush ahead of fealty to the law "what happened in that hospital room crystallized mr gonzaless view about the rule of law that he holds it in minimum low regard " said sen charles schumer who presided over yesterdays session "its hard to understand after hearing this story how attorney general gonzales could remain as attorney general how any president democrat republican liberal conservative could allow him to continue " several justice department officials departed after the incident in part apparently because of disagreement over the reach of executive power mr comey said he drafted a resignation letter but held off submitting it because the following day brought the madrid train bombings creating a law enforcement emergency that kept him at his post white house press secretary tony snow yesterday declined to comment on mr comeys remarks but reiterated the presidents support both for the "terrorist surveillance program" and mr gonzales "the fact is youve got somebody who has splashy testimony on capitol hill " mr snow said "good for him were not talking about internal deliberations " the hearing before the senate judiciary committee ostensibly was called to investigate alleged political motives behind the dismissals of federal prosecutors last year as he did at an earlier house hearing mr comey a career prosecutor before serving as justices second highest official from to said most of those fired were among the best of the presidentially appointed u s attorneys but mr schumer a new york democrat opted to use the forum to explore the wiretapping row long the subject of speculation in washington the administration has said it seeks information about possible terrorism by eavesdropping on phone calls between the u s and foreign countries the program disclosed in by the new york times later was ruled illegal by a federal judge in january the administration said it had obtained approval for a modified version of the program from a judge of the special court that oversees foreign intelligence warrants but has disclosed few details citing the sensitivity of the subject mr comey declined to identify which national security effort was at issue but the context leaves no doubt it was the wiretap program which required recertification from the attorney general every days the revelations were set in motion last week when sen schumers staff told mr comey the senator was interested in exploring the hospital incident according to people familiar with the matter mr comey who hadnt spoken publicly about these events said he couldnt discuss classified material but could provide additional information for mr schumer the revelations offered another chance to embarrass mr gonzales after leading the charge on the u s attorneys issue and while mr comey declined invitations to pass judgment on mr gonzales mr schumer has named mr comey as someone he could support as a gonzales replacement at the outset of the hearing his enthusiasm was evident "now id like to administer the oath of office " mr schumer said "oath of office " mr comey asked "sorry i wish we were administering the oath of office " mr schumer said to laughter mr comey recounted events of as the reauthorization deadline approached mr comey who had recently assumed his post reassessed its legality with assistant attorney general jack goldsmith mr comey said he and mr goldsmith decided the program didnt comply with the law and he met with mr ashcroft on the matter and "he and i agreed on a course of action " when mr ashcroft fell ill with a pancreatic condition mr comey became acting attorney general and told the white house he wouldnt recertify the wiretap program heading home from work march mr comey said he received a phone call from mr ashcrofts chief of staff alerting him that even though the attorney general was too sick to receive visitors messrs card and gonzales were going to see him mr comey said he called some justice officials including federal bureau of investigation director robert mueller and told them to meet him at mr ashcrofts room arriving at the hospital he said he ran up the stairs to reach the attorney general before white house officials could get to him "i was concerned that given how ill i knew the attorney general was that there might be an effort to ask him to overrule me when he was in no condition to do that " mr comey said joined by mr ashcrofts wife mr goldsmith and another aide mr comey waited alongside the bedridden attorney general "it was only a matter of minutes that the door opened " and in walked messrs card and gonzales carrying an envelope mr gonzales asked mr ashcroft to approve the program mr comey said "and attorney general ashcroft then stunned me he lifted his head off the pillow and in very strong terms expressed his view of the matter rich in both substance and fact which stunned me drawn from the hourlong meeting wed had a week earlier and in very strong terms expressed himself and then laid his head back down on the pillow " unable to obtain approval the white house continued the program without mr ashcrofts signature mr comey said he said the program later was modified in a way that he and mr ashcroft determined was lawful later yesterday the justice department issued a statement saying "we cannot comment on internal discussions that may or may have not taken place concerning classified intelligence activities the terrorist surveillance program was always subject to rigorous oversight and review "
