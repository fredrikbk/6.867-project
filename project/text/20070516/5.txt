audi rivals vie for china crown volkswagen ags audi brand leads the premium car segment in china but german rival bmw ag is pressing hard and toyota motor corp s lexus brand also is building momentum in the u s the worlds biggest auto market audi lags behind rivals such as bmw lexus and daimlerchrysler ags mercedes benz but thanks to an early push into china by volkswagen audi has taken a lead in one of the worlds fastest growing markets it is now the car of choice for politicians and top business people "the premium segment in china has enormous growth potential " said senior auto analyst roman mathyssek from global insight in london "the number of people in china who can afford a premium car is growing " audi executive board member ralph weyler said he expects the chinese auto market to expand further but he said the growth rate might be damped by regulatory measures the chinese government may introduce to avoid economic overheating in contrast to the relatively small but high margin premium segment overcapacity in the mass market sector and rising competition from chinese manufacturers already have led to price pressure for volkswagen general motors corp and other western auto makers china overtook japan in to become the worlds second largest market after the u s with million vehicles sold up from the previous year according to the china association of automobile manufacturers bmw of germany expects the premium segment to outstrip the mass market segment in years to come bmw the worlds biggest premium car manufacturer by sales hopes to take the chinese crown from audi in bmw sold cars in mainland china a rise from the year before that lagged behind the cars audi sold in in hong kong and mainland china a rise from the year ago "in the long term we want to be no in china " bmw chief executive norbert reithofer said recently adding that bmw expects the chinese car market to become the worlds biggest by the contribution from china to the balance sheets of foreign premium auto makers remains relatively small compared with more developed markets partly because non chinese auto makers are obliged to take local joint venture partners and because imported cars are heavily taxed but as more customers move upmarket prices for premium cars remain stable and earnings per car in china are often more attractive than in the u s where in addition to the weak u s dollar that squeezes margins on cars imported from the euro zone some areas of the u s premium car segment are affected by price pressures from incentives and rebates sharing returns with joint venture partners is "less than optimal but probably has financial upside compared to an imports only strategy " said sanford c bernstein senior research analyst stephen cheetham "it makes the vehicles more affordable locally by avoiding at least some of the import duty and also enables a measure of customization to local tastes "we would expect bmw to reach parity with audi at some point since the latters advantage is due to the historically strong position of the vw group in china rather than any structural superiority " said mr cheetham one way bmw hopes to catch up is to become the car of choice for chinese politicians audi and mercedes already are in the fleet business of selling cars to high ranking chinese government officials however "were in no rush here as our growth rates in china are quite strong anyway " bmws mr reithofer said mercedes plans to broaden its product lineup in china where the worlds second best selling premium brand is now focused on sales of its flagship s class model in the first quarter mercedes sold about s class sedans or almost half of the mercedes vehicles sold in china mercedes just presented its high performance amg lineup in china and is ramping up production of the new e class at the beijingbenz daimlerchrysler joint venture but audi isnt going to let its crown slip easily "china is set to become audis second home market im sure that we will continue our strong growth in the future " audi chief executive rupert stadler said ahead of the shanghai auto show last month germanys volkswagen was the first foreign manufacturer to start chinese operations in in light of strong demand bmw plans to increase output capacity in china beyond the level of about vehicles annually and aims to make a final decision by the end of the year bmw operates a joint venture with brilliance china automotive holdings ltd in the northeastern city of shenyang bmw executive board member klaus draeger said brilliance is the priority partner for any expansion plans mr draeger said bmw is thinking about launching its compact series in china in an effort to boost sales but audi and bmw face competition from japanese manufacturers in particular toyotas lexus brand lexus has mainly been successful in the u s but sales in markets outside north america have risen in past months in lexus sold about cars in china and aims to reach this year toyota which became the worlds biggest car seller in the first quarter plans to double the number of lexus showrooms in china from about by march while honda motor co plans to expand the outlets for its premium acura brand to from three this year nissan motor co meanwhile will introduce its infiniti premium brand in china in july global insights mr mathyssek said he also expects competition from gms cadillac brand with customers appetite for spacious cars mirroring tastes in the u s cadillac sells the cts srx xlr and the escalade models in china and began local production of the sls sedan in the first quarter designed specifically for the chinese market mr mathyssek doesnt expect chinese auto makers to gain a foothold in the premium segment in the foreseeable future which gives foreign brands free rein for now "im sure some will try it but premium is not just about the technology and quality of the car its also about the right brand image and this is much more difficult to achieve " he said the emergence of chinese manufacturers in the mass market segment has increased competition and pressured prices with the president of volkswagens chinese division winfried vahland projecting a further decline in prices by however due to lack of local competing brands and generally less price sensitive customers in the luxury and premium segments prices for those cars havent suffered "it doesnt affect luxury and premium cars but for sure the competition will become tougher over the next years as more auto makers are pushing into these segments " bentley motors executive board member stuart mccullough said bentley based in the united kingdom is volkswagens luxury brand
