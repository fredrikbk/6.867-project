mideast sugar refining surges dubai the middle east best known for vast petroleum holdings is in the throes of a rush to build refineries sugar refineries that is major refining projects are taking place in the mideast and north africa in a bid to fill a six million ton gap left in the white sugar market after the world trade organization capped exports from the european union formerly the largest producer of white sugar the middle east which used to consume around half of all eu exports is taking matters into its own hands to eliminate the shortage the region is attracting foreign investors along with local entrepreneurs trying to capture the largest share of the local market the massive dome of al khaleej sugar co s storage facility dominates the horizon when driving north on sheikh zayed road leaving glossy seven star hotels behind for undeveloped parts of the desert the largest single refinery in the region al khaleej turns raw sugar into white sugar hours a day churning out as many as metric tons a day and a million tons a year the family owned refinery was in the right place at the right time the wto cap in july turned the eu from the worlds largest exporter of white sugar into a net importer moreover demand for sugar in the mideast is expected to rise annually during the next few years said al khaleej managing director jamal al ghurair refiners such as al khaleej are adding capacity to try to cope even as big companies including the cargill international unit of minnesotas cargill inc the ed&amp f man sugar ltd unit of ed&amp f man holdings ltd and tate &amp lyle plc both based in the united kingdom rush into the mideast and africa one person familiar with the industry said as much as half a billion dollars is being invested in sugar output "less white is coming out of the eu so there is a definite urge to build " said ian mote a director at standard chartered in dubai "ive heard of two to three new projects in the last six months " cargill is building a refinery in syria with local and brazilian investors tate &amp lyle is building a plant in egypt working with local industries and ed&amp f man is planning one in israel major local producers al khaleej cevital spa of algeria and saudi arabia food products company savola group are expanding the international sugar organization estimates the middle east and north africa consumed million tons of sugar in and al khaleej says the region produces six million tons the gold rush mentality has raised fears of a sugar mountain that could slash prices most of the new planned refining capacity is to hit the market by early one recent morning al khaleejs general manager nabil tabchouri was clearly unhappy as a computer screen showed his strong work force had managed to produce only tons of white sugar over the past hours far less than the tons the day before mr ghurair watching from home had seen it too and put in a call to find out the problem on this day a machinery malfunction forced a brief shutdown in the processing chain mr ghurair is undeterred by year end he plans to spend &# million to increase output and raise the refinerys storage capacity to million tons he expects the middle easts capacity to process white sugar to increase within a year to eight million metric tons al khaleej currently the only net exporter in the region expects stiff competition by cevital run by businessman issad rebrab produces sugar for the algerian market but is building a plant alongside its existing one in bejaia port that should be finished by early the existing facility has an annual refining capacity of tons and after the second plant is constructed the facility will be able to produce million tons algeria consumes almost a million tons a year so the country "will be obliged to export at least tons and maybe more depending on the rest of algerias expansion " said robin shaw a consultant to cevital based in the u k cevitals potential customers will include countries in the mediterranean and the balkans in syria cargill is teaming with local investor najib assaf crystalsev of brazil and wellington group inc of kansas to build the countrys first refinery which should come online around the same time as cevitals expanded plant the refinery would produce a million tons of white sugar annually allowing syria to become a net exporter the country consumes tons annually but produces only tons from local sugar beet mills the primary destination for the refinerys output will be the domestic market with the remainder to be exported to lebanon jordan and iraq according to cargill projects manager daudi lelijveld tate &amp lyle once the worlds largest refiner has closed plants in the eu and is moving some production outside the bloc it costs &# million to &# million to build a refinery but companies are seeing the benefit of importing cane from brazil and refining on site rather than bringing in refined sugar from destinations farther away yousef a meshiea a trader who imports sugar into jordan said the region has an advantage because of the large number of transport vessels available which brings costs down al khaleej started refining sugar in with a daily capacity half of what it has now it was the first sugar refinery in the gulf region and has remained the largest single operation responsible for of global output visitors to the refinery see workers in blue hard hats and coveralls dusted in white powder moving mounds of sugar onto conveyor belts while other workers in green breathing masks fill kilogram pound bags the bags are manually sewn up before being shipped in a few months al khaleej will have a new bagging system and will be able to bag and ship cargo within a single day mr tabchouri said al khaleej has put a stamp on trade by delivering its product against londons euronext liffe contract for white sugar futures to prepare for the future new delivery ports will apply to londons euronext liffe in october
