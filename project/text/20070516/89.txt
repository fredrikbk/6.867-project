plugging in to calpine pared debt environmental advantages juice interest in power generator power generator calpine which is operating under bankruptcy court protection is getting a favorable new look from investors who are betting that there will be significant value left for stockholders after creditor claims are paid calpine recently told the u s bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york that it is considering raising money possibly from private equity firms or others as part of its strategy to emerge from bankruptcy court this year some investors believe that existing shareholders will be given warrants that can be used to purchase stock there even is speculation of buyout interest in the company the nations largest owner of natural gas fired power plants in terms of megawatts of capacity and that could make its shares even more attractive calpines stock which traded at about cents a share a year ago has rallied since late last year yesterday the shares closed at &# down cents or in over the counter trading giving the company a market value of about &# billion the companys price earnings ratio is far below that of the independent power sector as a whole with calpine trading at times its estimated per share earnings for compared with times for the sector part of the reason for the stock price climb since filing for chapter in december calpine chief executive robert p may has been selling assets and patching up the balance sheet the company has sold eight power plants using the proceeds to cut debt by &# billion and it has renegotiated seven power sales agreements to improve its position by &# billion it has eliminated about one third of its creditor claims so far and has cut staff by a third mr may declined to comment on the companys plans saying he will weigh in after calpine files a reorganization plan expected by june but peter cartwright founder former chief executive and shareholder said he has heard rumors that "a lot of companies may be interested in buying calpine " though he has no specific information about a possible buyout and peter hastings a portfolio manager at mtb investment advisors inc in buffalo n y said his firm doesnt invest in companies operating in chapter but "a lot of people are looking at this name " it is a twist for a company that was once a favorite of short sellers investors who bet against a stock and make money if its price declines back then hedge funds and other short sellers were convinced that calpine couldnt support its enormous debt due to lackluster sales of electricity and a glut of generating capacity calpines prospects have rebounded in part because of dimming prospects for the construction of coal fired power plants by others due to fears of global warming and stepped up regulation future carbon limiting rules would be fine with calpine because it doesnt own coal fired generating plants on which restrictions would be toughest it operates clean burning gas fired power plants which emit only as much carbon dioxide as coal fired plants and geothermal plants that tap the earths heat to make electricity of the top power generators in the u s calpine emits the least carbon dioxide that means it could benefit from new regulations because the rules would likely force other generators to charge more for electricity to cover greenhouse gas compliance costs making calpines power more competitive by comparison calpines stock started climbing in november when congressional elections delivered the democrats a big victory suddenly legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions looked far more likely and the coal plants on the drawing boards looked problematic california gov arnold schwarzenegger signed a bill into law last autumn that requires the nations most populous state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to their level by ten eastern states will begin pushing down emissions levels after and federal action could soon sweep in the other states calpine is aided by the fact that about half its generating capacity is in california and texas two states with declining electricity reserves that are less willing to lean on coal than in the past it also has plants in the northeast big utility txu which is facing a &# billion buyout by private equity interests recently halted plans to build eight of its proposed coal fired plants in texas california prohibits utilities from building coal fired plants or signing contracts to purchase power from coal plants owned by others that throws more business to natural gas generators like calpine last week for example it announced a contract to sell the full output of a new plant in california to san diego gas &amp electric it also is planning to add two generating units to a plant near houston with coal plants looking iffy and new nuclear plants perhaps a decade away "you have a situation where plants like calpines look like the only alternative for at least the next five years " said daniele m seitz analyst for dahlman rose the investment bank and research firm in new york initiated coverage of calpine last month with a "speculative buy" recommendation the value of calpines portfolio is rising generating capacity that was valued at about &# a kilowatt two years ago now fetches about &# a kilowatt of capacity another plus for calpine is the example set by other generators that have emerged from bankruptcy protection nrg energys stock price has soared to about &# four times as much as it fetched in december when the new jersey company emerged from chapter stock in mirant has doubled in price since it reorganized in the atlanta company recently said it is seeking a buyer the origin of calpines distress lies in the billions of dollars it spent during a building boom conceived when deregulation of retail electricity markets was sweeping the u s in the mid s rather than issue a lot of new stock it took on more debt a calculated gamble that executives later regretted independent "merchant" generators like calpine built plants to take the place of utilities vacating the power making business but the merchant generators lacked guarantees that they would be able to recover their investments from consumers enrons tumble into bankruptcy in late convulsed the industry and tightened credit most big generators pulled back canceled projects and sold assets to lighten their debt loads calpine stuck by its expansion plans despite rising interest costs and fuel costs hoping to finish plants fast enough to boost revenue sufficient to finesse debt repayment it didnt work
