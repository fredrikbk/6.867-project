hopes dim for kids on college wait lists many schools take fewer backup applicants because of higher than expected first round yields for a while it looked like this might be a good year for wait listed college applicants but that is turning out to be wrong instead many colleges are taking few students off the wait list and sometimes none at all elite schools such as stanford university the university of chicago and dartmouth college arent admitting any students from their wait lists this year the university of pennsylvania expects to admit about students down from last year state schools such as the university of north carolina at chapel hill and the university of delaware too are taking fewer students than last year the reason many colleges say is that they underestimated their yields the percentage of students accepted who decide to attend with unexpectedly high numbers of acceptances these schools are filling their slots quickly the yields surprised many schools which had been preparing for more wait list activity after a couple of years of tight admissions though it has always been a long shot to get in off the wait list at many schools the odds have become worse in the past few years this year with applications pouring in and students applying to multiple schools admissions officers had anticipated more overlap so they were especially conservative in their yield forecasts many increased the number of slots offered on wait lists expecting to then fill out their enrollment from the bench but at many selective schools that scenario hasnt played out the university of pennsylvania had expected that of the admitted would accept slightly lower than last year because it was the first year the university switched to the common application which makes it easier for students to apply online to multiple schools but the yield came in at "conventional wisdom is that students are less serious with the common application but that has not proven to be true for us " says lee stetson dean of admissions at the university of pennsylvania yields are highly important to schools and are closely watched by competing colleges potential donors and status conscious applicants as indicators of a schools appeal but they have become harder to predict in recent years for one the number of seniors graduating from high school has been rising for more than a decade according to the national association for college admission counseling admissions deans and high school counselors also say students are applying to more schools because they are uncertain of where they will get in some counselors also point to the growing popularity of the common application which makes it possible for students to fill out one application and submit it to many schools but overall the number of applications per student has remained relatively stable at compared with five years ago according to common application inc the nonprofit that administers the process for about colleges even a few percentage points in yield can make "a big difference" in policy especially at small elite schools that dont admit many wait listed students says christopher avery a professor of public policy at the john f kennedy school of government at harvard university and co author of a book on college admissions amherst college which had expected a yield had anticipated more wait list admissions this year but the amherst mass college which saw a yield of is taking no one yields will become even more volatile in the future the education department predicts that the rise in the number of high school seniors will continue until at least and next year more schools harvard university princeton university and the university of virginia will drop so called early admissions the system that asks students to promise to attend if they are accepted early that will add a fresh crop of students to their regular decision pools the university of delaware which eliminated early decision applications last fall has already found it harder to manage yield without the security of early admissions delaware admitted more students initially this year compared with last so now it is taking a mere students off the wait list down from last year next year says louis hirsh director of admissions the university will accept fewer students initially so that it can take more students off the wait list colleges generally want to be able to use the wait list to adjust the freshman class for characteristics they are lacking such as certain majors "we didnt quite know what to expect " says mr hirsh "you have to assume that the kids who would have applied early decision are still going to apply the problem is you dont know exactly which ones they are " to be sure the unpredictability of yields can have the opposite effect and result in more wait listed students getting a shot princeton which took zero wait listed students last year says it expects to take this year a result of a slight drop in yield to from last year princeton is expecting to enroll a slightly larger class in as part of a long term plan to expand the size of the undergraduate student body for students who were wait listed the uncertainty can be hellish "i like to call it purgatory " says katie french a senior at stamford high school in stamford conn who applied to five schools she was wait listed at boston university her top choice she was admitted to emmanuel college in boston and rejected from the other three two weeks ago she found out she got into boston university but because she didnt receive financial aid she says she had to settle on emmanuel "i was an absolute wreck " says ms french who later missed an advanced placement english exam because she was so upset this year ohio state university is trying to make the process less painful the university decided not to have a wait list this year after two years of admitting no one since the university has rolling admissions it is easier to forecast in the spring whether it will reach its targets says mabel freeman assistant vice president of undergraduate admissions if need be it can take people who applied late "there are a number of ways you can try to deal if you suddenly find that you are short " says ms freeman at this point in the admissions cycle students who remain on college wait lists can do little to sway their school of choice the process will be largely over by the end of the month though some schools admit students into june if you havent sent in a letter expressing your interest already you should do so says jon reider director of college counseling at san francisco university high school but he says to avoid contacting the college repeatedly "you dont want to seem too pushy " waiting game plans for wait listed students at selected schools admitting no students from their wait lists stanford university university of chicago amherst college accepting fewer wait listed students than last year university of delaware university of pennsylvania accepting more than last year princeton university
