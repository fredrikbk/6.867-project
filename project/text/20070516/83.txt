online buying gains stature at upfront bigger planned effort by havass mpg firm follows whim in this week madison avenue is bustling with swanky parties and star studded tv network presentations for the all important "upfront" market during which advertisers will fork over roughly &# billion to purchase ad time in the new fall tv season but with the web stealing ad dollars and network ratings on the decline it will be no picnic for television executives trying to reverse the two year long downtrend in total upfront dollars bill mcowen executive vice president and director of media investments for mpg a media buying firm owned by havas talks about challenges facing the networks during the current upfront market wsj last year the networks began selling online ad packages during the upfront is the tv upfront the right place to buy online ads mr mcowen absolutely wsj do your clients intend to buy online ad packages from the networks during this upfront mr mcowen yes i would say we will do at least more digital purchasing than we did last year last year we did it on a whim this year we have a thought out plan and we know what we want to achieve with it the net is not a branding tool or a quick reach vehicle but when used in conjunction with other media it helps to seal the deal with the consumer wsj which network is in the best position heading into the upfront mr mcowen conventional wisdom says abc and fox because of their rating performance and profile but what needs to be looked at further is whether they are offering the right genres with dvr and time shifting sitcoms seem to have a better viewer retention rate than do dramas or reality shows no one would say nbc is strong they had a decent year but havent rebounded to where they were but i have to give them credit for not pandering or following the formula they are sticking to what they once were a provider of content that reaches the light television viewer the hard to reach consumer that tends to be urban upper income households look at thursday night yes they used to own it and now they dont but they now win a bit on getting the hard to reach viewer with my name is earl the office and rock nbc has been able to build a successful sci fi show with heroes the types of people who watch heroes are hard to find in prime time wsj which networks have work to do mr mcowen one who has to think twice is cbs they have had a very successful year they are the populist choice they always win in household ratings and in most situations but it might be time for them to reinvent themselves and take some chances what they have created for themselves is an audience profile that is a little older that is great but what i worry about is they have to make sure their programming reaches the youth wsj last year johnson &amp johnson and coca cola sat out of the upfront j&amp j says it will do the same this year do you think other marketers will join them on the bench this year and if so what effect will that have on the marketplace mr mcowen well i would question if those two clients actually did get a good deal later in the scatter market when ad time is sold closer to the air date the upfront proved to be a much more affordable place than the scatter market i am telling my clients to look at the upfront a little closer than they once have i think the scatter market has an opportunity to be much higher this year because you have the olympics and political spending that will be involved wsj dvrs are wreaking havoc with live ratings which has tv networks eager to make sure that marketers pay for viewers who time shift and watch the shows days after the shows originally aired last year marketers would only do deals based on live ratings will marketers compromise this upfront and pay for delayed ratings mr mcowen i dont think the networks can stay in business if they adhere once again to the current currency of using only live ratings at the same time i dont think marketers can afford to only use live ratings either if networks cant monetize their audience the cost per thousand will escalate through the roof what has to be done is both sides have to address commercial ratings and find what works for them there has to be compromise
