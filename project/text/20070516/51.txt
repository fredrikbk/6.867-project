hollywood showdown it is that time again like boxers getting ready for the title match theyre circling each other trading taunts and promising to deliver a knockout blow here in hollywood its the triennial main event the guilds against the studios in one corner is the association of motion picture and television producers an alliance of media titans determined to hold back the rising tide of expensive movies and tv programs across the ring are three guilds of the creative class the screen actors guild the writers guild of america and the directors guild of america everyone you talk to is certain trouble lies ahead the guilds they say have been taken over by a radical fringe showbiz sandinistas determined to make up for concessions to the studios in earlier days and ensure that artists get paid fairly in the digital age there hasnt been a movie tv strike since the disastrous stoppage in and the guilds which have refused to submit to early negotiations are acting like they want to rumble again the bean counters at the studios these days mostly component parts of media conglomerates are preparing to take them down a year ago nicholas counter president of amptp was quoted in variety stating "that the situation has gotten worse " nothing has occurred since then to change his mind its like the end of a quentin tarantino movie all the guys have guns and theyre all pointed at the head of someone else but they are missing something a strike would put over actors writers and directors out of work right at the dawn of global distribution for filmed entertainment over the internet and mobile devices in case youve been under a rock the long awaited convergence of technology and content is here video streaming works advertising on the internet is thriving and the "old" media companies are nervous take googles purchase of youtube and double click add to it viacoms &# billion lawsuit against google and you have all you need to know given this backdrop the guilds and the studios should consider the possibility that unemployed artists might find something to do when they are put on strike and in so doing they may just start creating original content for the new media because it is easy and well theyre not allowed to go to the set or the lot and once they do so they may enjoy the lack of interference from "suits" and become smitten with the ability to put their work out immediately and world wide right now few big name actors writers and directors have gotten into the game but they might strike out in new directions if theyre put out of work even if the guilds frown on it simply put if you kick artists off a playground dont be surprised if they make sand castles at a new sandbox the distribution plays are already there today sites like joost and itunes are putting quality content out either with pay per download or advertising support ad supported sites will typically pay of revenues to the content provider venture capitalists and tech entrepreneurs are ready to supply capital and geeks to make it all happen perhaps more importantly advertisers are spending and ready to spend more google has become google by selling the internet equivalent of classified ads who knows what will happen when it starts selling expensive ads an ad executive told me recently that every company he works with has doubled or tripled its internet advertising budget for studios would do well to remember that it is not the threat from digital distribution is massive just ask any unemployed music executive the market caps of google and the other barbarians at the gate are much larger numbers than hollywood has faced before one has to wonder if the studio chiefs are being arrogant by not defusing these labor issues more aggressively worse yet is the creeping feeling that uber executives at the parent companies are not committed to these assets at all do ge guys in connecticut who recently hired citigroup for advice on spinning off universal really care about the future of the movies of course most of hollywood is held hostage by the possibility of a strike the list of people stuck in the middle includes agents lawyers managers publicists editors electricians grips gaffes gofers interns assistants accountants receptionists hair and make up artists you name it everything from cash flows to production schedules to vacation planning for next spring break is affected every industry faces labor problems but it is hard to look at this industry and conclude that a strike is in anyones interest the big winner in all of this will be silicon valley a crippling strike and even the stockpiling of movies and programming in anticipation of a strike followed by a slowdown will greatly benefit both established and start up net ventures offering content the labor unrest could result in not only less product strike but poorer quality product stockpiling whenever there is serious strike talk in the air we get a batch of creative lemons at the box office and on tv thats certainly not what old media needs in many ways in fact this fight is just what new media needs these boxers may well be racing headlong and heedlessly into a sucker punch mr morris is the founding and managing partner of the los angeles entertainment law firm of barnes morris klein mark yorn barnes &amp levine
