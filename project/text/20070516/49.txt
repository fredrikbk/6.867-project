greenspan joins fellow legend pimcos gross the maestro advises first client since fed world rates point up two of the worlds best known interest rate experts the "maestro" and "the bond king " are now playing for the same team alan greenspan returning to his roots as an economic consultant has signed up allianz ags pacific investment management co as his first client since leaving as chairman of the u s federal reserve pimcos chief investment officer is the widely followed bond king bill gross among the predictions mr greenspan has made for his new client world interest rates are headed higher in the next few years under the arrangement signed this week mr greenspan will participate once each quarter in a strategy session with executives of pimco based in newport beach calif including mr gross he will also speak with them as often as twice a week via conference call and email dropping a self imposed prohibition he has observed since leaving the fed in january he will also discuss fed interest rate policy with the firm provided those conversations are private with about &# billion under management of it in fixed income pimco and mr gross regularly move the bond market but their influence pales in comparison with that once wielded by mr greenspan nicknamed the "maestro " after the biography of the same name by bob woodward since his retirement the year old mr greenspan has roiled markets several times with comments to paying often private audiences a week after he left office his comments to a private lehman brothers event were interpreted as meaning interest rates were headed higher in february his suggestion that the u s could slip into recession this year was blamed by some for helping trigger a global stock selloff some outsiders have criticized these comments as making life difficult for his successor ben bernanke mr greenspan said in an interview that he didnt comment on fed policy for a year because of his knowledge of confidential fed deliberations in his last days there and to avoid comparisons with mr bernanke "now that more than a year has elapsed private conversations about monetary policy are appropriate " he said "i will continue to refrain from public comments on monetary policy " mr gross said mr greenspans words as fed chairman were constrained by his position "now that hes on the team we would expect for him to be open and expressive in terms of his views " for example he said pimcos fed watchers paul mcculley and richard clarida will run their fed analysis by mr greenspan mr gross has long had a reputation as one of the savviest bond fund managers around his main charge pimcos &# billion total return fund has beaten of the competition in the past ten years with a average annual return according to morningstar inc lately however mr grosss fund has been struggling in the past year the fund has trailed roughly three quarters of similar funds and so far this year it is in the bottom of its peer group mr greenspan ran an economics consulting firm townsend greenspan &amp co but dissolved the firm when he joined the fed upon retiring he formed greenspan associates in washington but devoted himself to speeches and writing a book that is due out in september pimco first approached mr greenspan about a consulting arrangement more than a year ago mr greenspan said he wouldnt consider it until his book was published "we didnt wait " said pimcos chief executive bill thompson his agreement with pimco was finalized this week in a meeting with pimco last week mr greenspan predicted the recent period of low global inflation could end in the next few years as the downward pressure on prices and wages from china and indias assimilation into the world economy lessens "i asked him specifically three years from now where would he see g interest rates and he said higher " mr gross said mr gross said that is largely in line with his own views though he expects interest rates to first head lower in the next months because of u s economic weakness mr gross has hardly been a greenspan cheerleader in october he told businessweek "i like bernanke better greenspans approach in terms of throwing money at the problem lowering rates whenever there was a crisis it appears to have worked at the same time it has led to a substantially leveraged u s economy thats the legacy he leaves mr bernanke " "obviously i have to be more greenspan friendly " mr gross said more recently he has sought common ground with mr greenspan telling how he once did his high school homework in the bath just as mr greenspan sometimes writes speeches in the bath because of his bad back according to mr gross mr greenspan replied "all that means is were both concerned about liquidity " neither mr greenspan nor pimco disclosed either the duration or financial terms of the contract mr greenspan will not take on any pimco competitor as a consulting client but remains free to give speeches to whomever he wishes he said he plans to have no more than a dozen clients and will pick those that will enable him to do the sort of research he likes tom lauricella contributed to
