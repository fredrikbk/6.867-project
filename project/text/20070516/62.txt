its possible safe attractive cars with improved fuel economy i disagree with the way holman jenkins jr "cafe break " business world may dismisses the corporate average fuel economy cafe standards as a failure in light of the growing instability in oil markets and the constraints our oil dependence places on foreign policy the current unnecessary stagnation in fuel economy has become unacceptable cafe standards enacted in the aftermath of the arab oil embargo were instrumental in helping americans dramatically raise fuel economy during the decade or so that followed between and however fuel economy for americas light duty vehicles has remained essentially unchanged this stagnation in fuel economy has persisted even as technological advances have made improvements increasingly possible in a study the national academy of sciences argued that the fuel economy of certain u s passenger cars could be cost effectively raised by as much as within a decade for the largest light trucks the potential improvement was the implied potential fuel economy for the entire fleet given the existing mix of vehicles was mpg well above todays actual mpg significantly these improvements were premised on the use of existing and emerging technologies without altering the average weight size mix or performance of the fleet america requires a new legislative approach to vehicle fuel economy reforming cafe thoughtfully and comprehensively can give automakers the flexibility they need to produce safe attractive cars while continually upgrading fuel economy and reducing american oil dependence in december the energy security leadership council a group of prominent business leaders and senior military officials released "recommendations to the nation on reducing u s oil dependence " among other things the report proposes annual improvements of in the fuel economy of all on road vehicles while also establishing "off ramps" to relax the standard in a given year if it is proved to be technically infeasible unsafe or not cost effective this legislative approach can establish a responsible middle ground between inflexible government prescriptions and policy abdication gen p x kelley ret washington gen kelley was the th commandant of the marine corps and co chairman of the energy security leadership council mr jenkins warns that we are likely to get some "abysmally bad public policy on fuel economy in the coming weeks " but help may soon be at hand for auto companies and for the public in the form of a new metal technology now going through final crash worthiness tests at mits department of mechanical engineering and the department of mechanics at frances ecole polytechnique this cellular "sandwich" metal is lighter than the traditional sheet metal used in auto bodies and times stiffer its use by the auto industry would mean buyers could continue driving large comfortable safe cars and suvs that are significantly lighter than todays vehicles providing up to at least more miles per gallon while improving overall body strength and safety honda engineers have indicated they hope to be the first to develop a prototype vehicle using the new metal perhaps as early as next year joey straza celltech metals san diego i agree with mr jenkinss take on cafe standards and i especially agree with his proposition that washington makes it difficult to function in detroit however dont think "miraculous technology" is required for u s automakers to be competitive my ford thunderbird had a liter v engine and got mpg city and mpg on highway it was fast powerful and even had a catalytic converter on it more recent comparable cars cant seem to break mpg on the highway it seems the technology exists why do automakers world wide continue to build cars with such poor fuel efficiency ben waide madisonville ky
