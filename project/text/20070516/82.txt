nymex may rue a bet on optionable some of the hottest traders in the world work on the floor of nymex holdings inc but the exchange operator recently made one bet it would like to forget the new york mercantile exchanges owner which went public last year and was one of the years top performing public offerings is facing a roughly &# million loss in an investment it made earlier this year in optionable inc a tiny energy brokerage that sends trades to the nymex optionables stock was crushed earlier this month after its biggest customer canadas bank of montreal disclosed it had a trading loss that could exceed &# million while analysts say the loss wont hurt nymex which has a stock market capitalization of &# billion it is a black eye for one of the worlds largest energy exchanges the securities and exchange commission prohibits stock exchanges from owning stakes in brokerages they regulate in part to stop exchanges from playing favorites among the brokers that do business with them but futures exchanges like nymex are governed by different rules that dont expressly prohibit such relationships and while there was no suggestion that nymex was playing favorites with optionable questions are being raised about the wisdom of nymexs decision to buy a stake in the valhalla n y firm because it exposed nymex to market risks that exchanges dont usually face adding to nymexs woes kevin cassidy optionables chief executive resigned over the weekend following a discovery by the nymex that he had spent time in prison in the s on a federal tax evasion charge nymex didnt know of mr cassidys criminal history at the time of its investment according to a nymex spokeswoman "its a mess " says richard repetto an analyst with brokerage firm sandler oneill "they should have done better due diligence on this acquisition " in an interview may before mr cassidys criminal record became public an optionable official contended nymex had done extensive due diligence on the brokerage firm before investing "this was a laborious process this wasnt something that was handshaked on monday and papered on tuesday " said albert helmig an optionable board member who became chairman when the company announced the former chairmans resignation may nymex also was telling others it was comfortable with its due diligence yesterday mr helmig declined to comment further lawrence r gelber a lawyer for mr cassidy said his client resigned "because he believed it would help the company move forward " he added that bmos trading losses happened because "of decisions made by bmo not because of optionable not because of mr cassidy and not because of anything in mr cassidys distant past " the episode shows that exchanges are still getting used to handling their investments like public companies instead of the not for profit clubs they used to be says craig pirrong a finance professor at the university of houston optionable provides trading and brokerage services to natural gas and other energy traders in addition to handling trades via individual brokers it has an automated derivatives trading platform that matches buyers and sellers optionable is a midsize customer to the nymex providing an estimated &# million a year in revenue to the exchange "we believe that a reduction in clearing volume brokered by optionable would be offset by clearing volume from other brokers " said the nymex spokeswoman adding that "volumes in options remain strong " the investment was made by the exchanges parent company not the exchange itself which means it may not have automatically triggered a review by the commodity futures trading commission according to people familiar with the matter industry experts say the spotlight now on the nymex may trigger more scrutiny on what futures exchanges can buy nymex monday resigned its board seat from optionable "we are concerned about the recently announced developments" and "are actively reviewing the situation " the exchange company said in a statement the nymex board member left optionable "to avoid potential conflicts of interest during our review " nymex stock has fallen about since optionables involvement in bank of montreals losses became public exchange stocks more generally are flat since may when the bank of montreal suspended all business relationships with optionable because of the banks trading losses optionables stock has declined optionable has said about one quarter of its revenue came from bank of montreal which has put two energy trading executives on leave in connection with the losses meanwhile cftc officials are now looking into the natural gas trading losses at bank of montreal and optionables role in them according to people familiar with the situation a big issue surrounding the bank of montreal trading blowup is whether optionable provided accurate "marks" to the bank that set a value for the options positions held by the bank because options are complex instruments and arent as widely traded as the standard energy benchmark traded publicly on nymex estimates as to how much they are worth can vary
