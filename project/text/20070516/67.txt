lemon sale early in the explorations by daimler ag about detaching its chrysler tar baby it discussed the possibility of a deal with general motors gm apparently expressed a willingness to consider this but only if daimler would pay it for taking over chrysler rather than vice versa with due respect to the sagacity of stephan feinberg and his colleagues at cerberus capital management gm may have done its sums better than they paying &# billion for approximately of chrysler plus assuming &# billion in employee benefit liabilities reflects not merely turnaround optimism it may cross the frontier into foolhardiness from the standpoint of financial outcomes there are two kinds of auto makers momentum companies and hit driven companies a momentum auto maker enjoys strong consumer confidence produces sound but usually unflashy vehicles and is very good at the blocking and tackling aspects of the business both technical and managerial toyota and honda are momentum auto makers so are bmw and psa volvo and subaru too on a smaller scale gm used to be one and so was nissan but both committed a cascade of managerial and product gaffes that erased their momentum and dropped them into auto maker purgatory hit driven auto makers are like toymakers whose backlog of older product is too weak to smooth their road from year to year if a toymaker has lots of perennial strong sellers like a barbie or a monopoly it can weather a year without a new tickle me elmo if it doesnt though every season must include at least one home run or financial performance will be a roller coaster chrysler has been the epitome of a hit driven company for more than years at its ultimate perigee in the late s buffeted by an extensive new product losing streak and the unusual expenses of meeting new fuel economy and safety standards it was headed for bankruptcy a modest federal loan guarantee and some artificial respiration from the uaw gave newly arrived ceo lee iacocca time for some inspired improvisational first aid and ultimately the introduction of a real home run product the first front wheel drive garageable car based minivan then the new product pipeline dried up the numbers headed south and chrysler seemed perigee bound again somehow mr iacoccas team not only managed a reprise of its earlier rabbit from the hat trick but did it with a trifecta of hit products the muscular ram pick up the civilized jeep grand cherokee suv and the so called "cab forward" sleek dodge intrepid midsize sedan chrysler became suddenly the most profitable auto maker on the planet unfortunately the gush of profits began to flow only after the chrysler board mistakenly convinced that mr iacocca had lost his fastball handed him the proverbial gold watch and replaced him with robert eaton freshly imported from general motors mr eaton encountered a paradox buyers were flooding the dealerships for the spiffy new vehicles developed under mr iacoccas leadership yet by any objective evaluation fit and finish product durability and reliability or plant productivity chrysler was a basket case he assumed that fixing these problems was of higher priority than new hits this was a big mistake but mr eaton turned out to be the luckiest man in motown at the detroit motor show daimler benz chairman jurgen schrempp button holed him apparently out of the blue to propose the great transnational auto maker that would be created by exchanging daimler shares for chrysler shares herr schrempps penance for undertaking the least diligent due diligence in recent corporate history was spending &# billion on an acquisition which almost instantly plummeted deeply into the red it was making better quality vehicles more efficiently thanks to bob eatons efforts but hardly anyone wanted them the magic had vanished and despite heroic efforts by dieter zetsche parachuted in from stuttgart in to turn things around it has not returned even mini hits like the chrysler the big gangsta car with the narrow windows and powerful hemi engine is proving to have no legs in the market worst of all chryslers most recent new offerings have been panned by consumer reports the great auto market influencer as both mechanically and cosmetically deficient mr zetsche rewarded in january with the top job at then daimlerchrysler had already cleaned things up at chrysler the way a financially oriented new owner like cerberus might do it perhaps mr feinberg and his colleagues can push even further persuading the union to accept give ups but it will have to overcome a natural suspicion at solidarity house uaw headquarters of financial hotshots with a park avenue business address to the uaw cerberus has deep pockets a situation much different from when chrysler was a stand alone entity and could not survive without union help cerberus may find some imaginative way of slashing chryslers inflated dealer body along with the market ineffectiveness and internal cost burden it imposes on the company but this is likely to be both expensive and time consuming gm says it paid out &# billion to close down its oldsmobile network that may have been its out of pocket cost but if staff time for negotiating dealer payoffs were factored in the real cost was undoubtedly much higher and chrysler dealers are legitimately wary no matter who owns the company late last year they had considerable numbers of unordered and unwanted vehicles thrust down their throats to get them off chryslers own books yet cutting costs doesnt make an auto maker successful or profitable chrysler demonstrated in its two recoveries under mr iacocca that costs can be high and quality modest but attractive products can make these into virtual non issues theres the rub what even dieter zetsche could not accomplish was the mysterious feat of generating hit products and hitmakers are hard to find cerberus has brought aboard a well known auto industry ronin wolfgang bernhard as an advisor but mr bernhard chrysler coo from to was on the bridge with mr zetsche not when the company was generating hits but rather when it wasnt cerberus too is taking on serious downside risk chryslers physical assets are essentially worthless because no one else will want them and its marketplace equity is modest at best the dodge and chrysler brands have only slight cachet although jeep remains relatively iconic how long it will remain iconic is questionable the company has been endeavoring to exploit the brand flooding its product line with dubious and slow selling new variants unloading of chrysler is almost certainly a good deal for daimler smart and resourceful as the cerberus principals may be this time they could be significantly over their heads mr schnapp was the longtime leader of the auto industry practice at mercer management consulting
