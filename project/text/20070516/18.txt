business bookshelf the tortoise and the harried trader way of the turtle by curtis m faith mcgraw hill pages &# the mind of a trader is always an interesting thing to explore the traders who excel often talk about the "simplicity" of their strategies to these market wizards a stock chart takes on a mozart like quality singing sweet clear melodies or it resembles a chess problem in the mind of a master all complexity reduced to one perfect move in this way of looking at things trading has a savant like aspect beyond the range of mere mortals curtis faith isnt so sure as he recounts in "the way of the turtle " he was part of a kind of social experiment meant to test the claim back in the early s two legendary chicago traders richard dennis and bill eckhardt began arguing over whether traders are so to speak made or born mr dennis offered to bet the doubtful mr eckhardt that he could train anyone to be a successful trader while at a turtle farm in singapore the two men shook hands on the wager mr dennis reportedly blurted out "were going to raise traders like they raise turtles in singapore " thus in fall "the turtles" came into being mr dennis put ads in major newspapers offering to train willing applicants more than people applied mr dennis culled the group down to all of whom he interviewed he then chose to be his original turtles mr faith was among them a college dropout and computer programmer he had never traded before in his life but he had two things going for him he was smart and he seemed able to manage the emotions and psychological intensities that fill the traders day after two weeks of training most turtles received &# million to manage mr faith received the most &# million the turtles became secretive legends in the marketplace most racked up good returns some spectacular ones others failed mr faith himself did very well eventually he moved on to other entrepreneurial venues but the trading bug never left him more than two decades later he still practices the traders art if that is what it is he is head of research and development for trading box llc a company that specializes in software for trading system analysis and development did mr dennis win his bet most observers believe he did but mr faith calls it a draw the selection process ensured that the turtles had extraordinary virtues before training even began and the results were too mixed to be definitive what strategies did the turtles use mr dennis imposed strict secrecy rules so a good amount of time has had to pass before the ways of the turtle could be shared and now they can although the revelations arent all that momentous mr faith outlines various turtle strategies based on among other things moving averages and trend following he writes in classic trader speak about entry points exit points and breakouts he offers a fair bit of math including donchian trend analysis and monte carlo simulations for the novice such passages will read like hieroglyphics traders too often talk about their systems as if they were close to foolproof but the reality is quite different mr faith understands this tragic fact which may be one reason that he gives so much emphasis to the psychology of trading how much risk can a trader take is a days reversal in a long trend strategy the time to exit or merely the pause that refreshes early in his turtle life mr faith began playing a long breakout in heating oil prices as prices reversed heading downward mr faiths turtle compatriots until then following a similar strategy bailed out mr faith held firm puzzled that people who received the same training would react so differently to a market shift in the end mr faith was correct the market moved again in his favor and he captured big gains before exiting his position but the key to his success was more a tolerance for risk than the magic of a certain system this is one of the lessons of "the way of the turtle " despite the recent rise of computational power and statistical sophistication the mind of the trader has changed little in the past century mr faith wisely refers more than once to edwin lefevres "reminiscences of a stock operator " a thinly disguised biography of the legendary roaring s trader jesse livermore the book conveys the highs and lows that a trader goes through as he works through various systems it shows above all how a trader must believe in his system even when it is going against him mr faith captures this emotional reality in his own chronicle and its perils in an extended epilogue he wistfully recounts the struggles that he has endured since the turtle heyday a company he started fared poorly and the value of his equity holdings diminished rapidly after he left he tinkered with a start up airline he went through a divorce ran out of money and decamped to argentina he says that people wonder whether he is going through a midlife crisis even the dalai lama makes an appearance mr faiths soul searching is hardly inevitable plenty of traders can live without it but it does suggest that whether the trading strategy is mozartian or turtle like emotions often matter the most mr kansas is a former money &amp investing editor at the journal
