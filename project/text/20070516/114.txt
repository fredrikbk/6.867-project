the economy business why taxpayers should take note of chrysler deal american taxpayers should keep a close eye on the health care hot potato being tossed aside by daimlerchrysler ag some day it could end up in their laps daimlers plan to give control of its chrysler subsidiary to cerberus capital management is motivated in no small part by its desire to offload the &# billion in health benefits chrysler eventually will owe to united auto worker retirees thats a big reason why the german company was willing to agree to spend &# million to make the deal happen coincidentally the chrysler announcement came just a few days after the senator and presidential candidate barack obama spoke to the detroit economic club his speech called on the industry to raise fuel efficiency standards but detroits ears perked up when he said the government should be willing to pick up some of the auto companies health care costs in return "weve heard for years that the spiraling cost of health care for retired auto workers constrains manufacturers from investing in more fuel efficient technology " mr obama said "so heres the deal well help to partially defray those health care costs but only if the manufacturers are willing to invest the savings right back into the production of more fuel efficient cars " the obama plan would cover just of health care costs now estimated to account for &# or more of the cost of the average car thats not enough to do troubled car makers in detroit much good but it opens the door and a lot of folks in the industry are hoping that door will open wider if a democrat wins the white house in in washington the business lobby has stepped up its push for action on health care thats largely a reaction to rapidly rising costs health care spending last year ate up of the nations economic activity according to the latest government figures thats up from just five years ago and is projected to be ten years hence business ends up bearing much of the burden "health care costs are the no cost pressure our members face " says the business roundtables john castellani he calls it a critical competitiveness issue "youre getting to a tipping point where you can no longer compete against companies in countries" with government provided health care or with no health care coverage at all there are two ways for business groups to address that problem one is by seeking solutions that lower health care costs overall the other is by shifting costs from business to government mr castellani says his efforts are focused on the former goal but its no secret that the auto companies as well as some other old line manufacturers burdened with heavy retiree health care costs would be happy to settle for the latter neither the leaders of cerberus nor anyone else in detroit seems to think offloading health care costs on the taxpayer is likely to happen soon for now all eyes are on the critical contract talks with the uaw set to begin this summer auto executives are hoping they can persuade the union to agree to transfer the &# billion in health care liabilities that the big three owe retirees into an independent trust fund like the one set up to handle goodyear tire &amp rubber co s health care obligations the companies would pay a reduced amount into the fund maybe to cents on the dollar and in return the union would gain control over the funds and some protection from bankruptcy court but whether the companies and the uaw can agree on such a deal is unclear and even if they do the uaw will likely look to washington for help in making up some of what it loses in the negotiations for taxpayers the idea of taking on the health care costs of retired auto workers is a daunting prospect already outlays for medicare and medicaid are projected to double in the next decade and consume half of all government spending before mr obama and his fellow politicians open the door to increasing health expenditures theyd better figure out how to pay for the ones already on the books see related letter "letters to the editor guess whos getting stuck for auto worker benefits " wsj may
