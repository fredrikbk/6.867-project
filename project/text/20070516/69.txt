japans auto giants steer toward china toyota nissan honda refocus their efforts as u s demand slows tokyo while japanese auto makers are going strong in many parts of the world there is one important market where they have lagged significantly behind rivals in detroit and europe china japans top three auto makers toyota motor corp honda motor co and nissan motor co entered the fast growing chinese market nearly two decades after the market leader by sales volkswagen ag and years after the no car maker general motors corp one reason the japanese companies have been too busy focusing on the lucrative u s market where they can sell more expensive cars at a higher profit margin now as demand for cars slows in the u s and the battle in the global auto market shifts to emerging markets japanese car makers are making a big push to catch up in one of the auto industrys hottest markets they have announced ambitious plans to build local plants launch a range of new models and ramp up dealer networks their goal to boost combined sales by or more this year raising their market share to around in a single year from last year volkswagens market share was around last year while gm had an share according to csm worldwide an auto industry consulting firm honda which in became the first japanese auto maker to sell cars in china is currently the biggest of the three companies with sales of about vehicles last year but it is toyota which entered china in that is growing the fastest and has the most aggressive plans with core new models such as the high volume corolla sedan and the yaris subcompact it has an ambitious goal of boosting sales by about this year to more than vehicles "we have shown our commitment" to china says yoshimi inaba toyotas executive vice president in charge of china operations the potential is huge in the chinese market where passenger car sales rose by more than one million vehicles or last year if this growth keeps up china could surpass the u s as the worlds biggest car market by but japanese auto makers dont have as much brand recognition in china as rivals like gm volkswagen and chery automobile co the biggest chinese auto maker by sales whats more analysts say japanese car makers face the risk that historical anti japanese sentiment might eventually discourage consumers from buying their cars protestors overturned and damaged several japanese model cars during anti japanese protests in shanghai though that didnt translate to a drop in sales toyota at first stumbled in appealing to chinese consumers it exclusively pushed the mass market vios compact car to chinas burgeoning middle class but sales fizzled after an initial marketing blitz because the toyota brand failed to catch on and chinese consumers preferred to stick to brands they recognized toyota then switched to focusing on high end models like the crown sedan hoping to establish an image as an upscale brand which would then trickle down to more budget conscious consumers but despite its efforts toyota still didnt carry the same vaunted high quality image it has elsewhere now toyota and other japanese companies are following a strategy taken by their western competitors attacking the market on both the high end and the low end thats because car buyers in china tend to either be moneyed consumers looking to show off their new wealth or legions of cash strapped middle class drivers gm which entered china in the s through a joint venture emphasizes a mix of high end buick and cadillac models along with its cheaper mass market vehicles volkswagen has its premium audi line as well as inexpensive compacts like the golf and polo toyota plans to roll out in the summer an all new version of its high volume corolla sedan along with the lexus lsl the main model under its high end lexus brand honda says the two main drivers of sales growth in china will be the upscale acura sedans which come with leather seats and all wheel drive technology and are priced at &# and the fit subcompact hatchback priced around &# luxury cars tend to be expensive in china because of various duties involved an acura sedan in the u s costs around &# japanese companies are also spending heavily to boost local production hondas new plant in guangzhou a joint venture set up with guangzhou automobile group co that opened in september will produce accords annually nearly doubling the number of accords produced in china last month toyota through a joint venture with chinese partner first auto works group said it will build a &# million factory in the coastal city of tianjin to produce engines a year for the vios corolla and other models meanwhile the bigger foreign rivals arent sitting idly gm for example through a joint venture with shanghai automotive industry corp plans to boost capacity to a million cars annually by from last year gm has several joint venture operations in china one big challenge for foreign car companies is to establish dealer networks a tricky task in a country with large geography and varied culture whats more the networks often must be built from scratch because chinas car market has grown so rapidly analysts say that may be particularly difficult for nissan which entered china in the last among the three japanese companies and doesnt yet have a firmly established dealer network nissan which has a joint venture with dongfeng motor co has recently launched its cheapest china model yet the livina hatchback which retails for around &# but it lacks the array of fuel efficient compact models that toyota and honda have nissan officials say the company has just gotten started it plans to increase the number of nissan dealerships to by the end of from last year "were going in the right direction but we can still push more " says carlos tavares a nissan executive vice president the company plans to sell models in china this year up from in
