politics &amp economics irans progress on nuclear fuel brings new urgency divisions irans rapid progress toward making nuclear fuel has brought renewed urgency to international efforts to halt the program but divisions over how to persuade tehran appear about to deepen international atomic energy agency chief mohamed elbaradei said inspections of irans uranium enrichment facilities conducted last week made it clear the country has mastered the technology to enrich uranium sooner than expected preventing iran from acquiring the know how to enrich uranium a process that can make fuel for civilian or military purposes has been a central goal of the international communitys efforts to persuade tehran to suspend its enrichment program iran says its program is strictly civilian "keeping them from getting the knowledge has been overtaken by events " mr elbaradei said in an emailed response to a query about the significance of the iranian advance "this is a major change it shows that time is very much on irans side " said a european union diplomat familiar with efforts to relaunch talks with iran which broke down in the diplomat said no action is expected before mr elbaradei delivers a formal report to the united nations security council expected next week thereafter the council will consider whether to extend or deepen sanctions imposed since december "we havent been able to start negotiations because we cant agree with iran on a suspension" of the enrichment program the diplomat added "but the closer the iranians get the harder it will be to get a suspension " mr elbaradei in a new york times interview yesterday said irans progress means the security councils focus currently on getting iran to suspend its program should now be to prevent "industrial scale production" and to get tehran to allow broad inspections but any efforts by security council members to soften the demand for suspension would likely be blocked by the u s and the united kingdom "of course elbaradei offers his own personal perspective from time to time on what the major powers should be offering but i dont think those arguments will prevail " a spokesman for the british foreign office said the spokesman said the sanctions strategy has been successful in reducing foreign investment in iran and promoting some "soul searching" among the nations leadership u s officials said washington wouldnt back off its insistence that iran suspend its enrichment work or face much stiffer international sanctions "we do not agree with the assertion that the world must accept whatever advances iran has made on its nuclear work " said a u s official involved in iran policy "just because you get it doesnt mean you get to keep it " the official added although u s efforts so far have focused on suspension not dismantling equipment evidence iran is making progress on its enrichment program is sure to increase domestic pressure on washington to get tougher on tehran the issue is already a focus of the u s presidential campaign with candidates from both parties repeating that all options must remain on the table including the possibility of a military strike to try to prevent iran from becoming a nuclear power after a visit to iran last week u n nuclear inspectors believe the country will have centrifuges for enriching uranium running within a month another diplomat familiar with the matter said yesterday that would be enough to produce sufficient weapons grade uranium for a nuclear weapon within two years that is also more than double the number of centrifuges iran currently has working at its natanz underground facility the increase suggests iran is making unexpectedly fast progress toward solving the technological puzzles essential to uranium enrichment iran has been under international pressure to suspend the program ever since it was exposed in the iaea hasnt been able to certify that the program is intended for purely civilian use as tehran claims javier solana the european unions foreign policy representative is due to meet irans top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in about two weeks mr solana has been trying unsuccessfully to find a formula to bring iran back to the table while also persuading it to suspend its enrichment program estimates of how long it would take for iran to produce a nuclear bomb vary widely but obtaining fuel is the biggest challenge david albright a former nuclear inspector said in an interview yesterday that he believes iran is about two years from producing a nuclear weapon should it choose to do so mr albright is in close consultation with iaea inspectors the centrifuge hall at natanz will likely be operational in june according to mr albright irans goal would then be to achieve industrial production by the end of this year he said
