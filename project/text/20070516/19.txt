business world necessary skunks into a difficult family business situation comes a takeover offer at once humiliating and hard to pass up that description applies to rupert murdochs bid for dow jones it also applies to the terms of dale earnhardt jr s spurned offer to renew his contract with a racing team now run by his stepmother in both cases sentiment and family tradition joust with hardheaded concern for the future one consequence of the elder earnhardts death was that his wife the estimable teresa inherited his business while dale jr was lofted to such heights of marketability and fan adoration that it became impossible to equitably contain his value in a structure in which he was an employee of his stepmother he asked for of the company in return for re upping a semi hostile takeover and was turned down last week as fellow driver tony stewart put it without dale jr his stepmothers company is "a museum " when rupert murdoch offered over its then share price for dow jones parent of the wall street journal he was saying the papers future is worth a lot more with me running it than with you running it after the crash that killed senior his wife devoted her management energies to cultivating the dale earnhardt legacy and her connection to it but she hasnt been the hands on team owner required for success on the competitive nascar circuit think rick hendrick jack roush or joe gibbs thats not teresa two of whose key employees publicly complained "if shes going to spend four or five weeks straight on that boat of hers shes going to have to let us run the company " the bancroft family trusts have guaranteed the journals independence but havent supplied the risk hungry leadership required to capture our ages vastly expanding opportunities in financial news and information as warren buffett bluntly put it last week "they blew it " at dale earnhardt jr is a skilled racer and fabulously popular with fans and sponsors but hes never won a championship and is in danger of becoming one of those drivers who stay around because of their popularity and marketing value but dont win and are no longer expected to win great newspapers are great because talented ambitious reporters and writers seek them out to work for them not just because the owners have laudable intentions the dow jones legacy has been terrific but what about the future the world will continue to spawn alternatives to its franchise and the journal is in danger of becoming less and less central to the worlds business life and sadly thats regardless of any willingness by the controlling shareholders to become poorer and poorer to protect the journal when junior announced his defection teresa issued a statement in which the words loyalty and family were prominent these are nascar nation values yet throughout the garage area and fandom opinion has run strongly in favor of junior because of his importance to the future of the sport when mr murdoch floated his offer for dow jones the press commentary though coupled with the usual barbs for the man himself was surprisingly supportive the palpable reason is worry for the journals future if it adheres to its present path mr murdochs compromises especially with respect to chinese sensitivities have rightly been criticized but whatever you think of his politics his media efforts have tended in one direction more choice for consumers and hes hardly a villain for offering a handsome price for a newspaper property at the same time theres no getting around the fact that news corp is a very large business empire with financial interests in many lands mostly unrelated to news mr murdoch is years old and what comes next in a company primarily geared to entertainment his soon to be launched fox business channel which presumably would be melded with the journal might not prove a winning venture when a strong proprietor departs the scene such empires have a habit of being broken up mr earnhardt will likely field an offer from hendrick motorsports the superpower of nascar race teams but hendrick already has three credible contenders and one certified legend in jeff gordon adding junior to this stellar cluster might be one solar mass too many especially thanks to pressure from fans the media and possibly nascar itself to fulfill the earnhardt legacy the sentimental favorite is also the sensible favorite richard childress racing junior could one day climb into his fathers old no but not before he and mr childress have won a championship with a number thats his own the young mr earnhardt is said to be working through his options now aided by his sister his chief adviser as for the journal one could think of alternatives to news corp but at this point somebody would have to get on his horse and go looking for them a sale to the washington post comes to mind as highly attractive but the post has made no offer mr murdochs hefty bid was calculated no doubt to deter other bidders it seems to have succeeded this is what you get when you dont tend to your legacy effectively you lose the initiative if dow joness controlling shares believe their proper course is saving the paper from mr murdoch more power to them but doing so might require taking some affirmative steps now to secure the paper a realistic alternative
