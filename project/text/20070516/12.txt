bible curriculum dispute heats up in texas town lori white thinks high school students should study a variety of religions including christianity but the bible curriculum used in odessa texas and a growing number of other schools she says is aimed at instilling faith not knowledge "its a curriculum that proselytizes " says ms white whose son graduated from odessas permian high school last year the text used in odessa high schools developed by the nonprofit national council on bible curriculum in public schools represents as fact that the bible was a "foundational text" in the framing of the u s that the king james bible "remains one of the most loved books in the history of the world " and that "the sun went black" when jesus was crucified critics say that such statements represent the views of some believers not necessarily scholars in recent years many prominent educators have urged u s public schools to teach the bible as part of literature or culture classes contending that students need to understand the books influence on literature history and current events more schools are starting to offer such classes in some cases with a push from their state legislatures georgia last year passed a law providing money to encourage high schools to offer bible electives this month the texas house of representatives almost unanimously approved a bill now in the state senate that would offer training to teachers leading classes on the old and new testaments but the spread of bible instruction is raising questions about the separation of church and state that is particularly true in school districts that have adopted the national council program one of two competing national curricula now available the curriculum sold by the greensboro n c based national council concentrates on the bibles role as literature and as an influence on american history founder elizabeth ridenour says that nearly districts have adopted the national council curriculum since a competing multidenominational curriculum is offered by the bible literacy project a nonprofit group that gathered a board of scholars to write a student text that discusses the bibles books and their influence on shakespeare poetry art and music available for the past year the textbook has mostly received praise from scholars and critics charles stetson the projects founder says it has been adopted by school districts in states john waggoner an odessa real estate appraiser says he helped collect signatures asking for a bible course he also says he is pleased that several members of the national council advisory board are prominent evangelical christians who like him believe in the inerrancy of the bible "we feel like their ideals are along the same lines of ours " he says but since the ector county independent school district which includes odessa adopted the national council curriculum in wrangling over it has continued to heat up "i believe strongly in the separation of church and state " says ms white i dont want my tax dollars spent that way " she and several other parents say they are working with the american civil liberties union to assess their legal options to stop the bible classes and aclu officials acknowledge that litigation is possible the national council has encountered such challenges before in a u s district court judge in fort myers fla halted lee county schools planned new testament course using the national councils curriculum saying that the recounting of the resurrection relied on a religious interpretation last year the nonprofit texas freedom network released a study on bible teaching in the states schools that found that in districts using the national council curriculum "sectarian claims permeated the classrooms " the studys author mark a chancey a professor of biblical studies at southern methodist university in dallas said in an interview that despite changes in a later edition of the national councils teachers text he found that the councils work was "an attempt to promote particular religious views about the bible namely those of some conservative protestants " in addition the national council curriculum states that "most scholars agree" that the bible was "a foundational text in the framing of our nation " but gordon wood a professor of early american history at brown university disputes that "i think it would be a mistake to think that the founders were captivated by religion in any evangelical sense " he says the founders were "not enthusiastic" about organized religion he adds pointing out that thomas jefferson excised references to miracles from his bible ms ridenour the national council president says several scholars lawyers and educators collaborated on the text she declines to name individual authors on the ground that it was a group effort mike johnson a louisiana attorney and board member says the curriculum "meets all tests" of constitutionality "as one of the people who read and gave an editorial viewpoint it does a good job of presenting the bible objectively " he says the current school year is the first in which odessas two high schools have taught the national council curriculum a history elective offered through the social studies department eighty three students in those schools are taking the elective the teacher of the class at permian high is an ordained baptist minister according to mike adkins a spokesman for the ector school district mr adkins says the classes focus on historical fact "were not talking about miracles " he says "were talking about old testament sites located through modern digs do you dispute the bible influenced the founding of the u s " karen hildebrand whose three children graduated from permian says she has talked with aclu officials about legal options "if you want to raise your child in a religious environment you teach him at home " says mrs hildebrand an elder in her presbyterian church
