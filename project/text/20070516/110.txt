the investor group originally from san francisco he has spent most of his career in sales marketing and public relations "they have the same questions that everybody else has because its really incongruous is it not " he insists the nearly six million people who live in metropolitan dallas fort worth will find in winter too that it is easier and cheaper to ski bearfire mountain than to fly

pool " says mr armey who now practices law "wouldnt it be great if there was a place where we could be outside and enjoy ourselves even in august " the technology that makes it possible which is known as snowflex uses water misting systems to create a nonrefrigerated surface think of wet white astroturf with bristles that is slippery enough for skiing but with enough grip for turning a few snowflex slopes are operating in europe including one that is open year round in noeux les mines france it is built on old coal mining slag heaps in an area near lille that isnt naturally conducive to skiing

by about degrees where people are lining up mr aaron says bearfires consultants predict million visits in the first year but that the venture will still be profitable if the numbers come in below that to make a go of year round skiing bearfire also will have to change the mind set of the typical skier who is eager to hit the slopes in november but whose interest wanes with the first whiff of spring "im not convinced that people will have the desire to ski in the warm weather " says william marks an analyst who follows ski resort companies for jmp securities "do they want to go on a ski vacation
