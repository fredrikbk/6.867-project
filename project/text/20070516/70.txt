mass appeal chanticleers and on earth peace new york the mass is a fundamental text of western culture and musical settings of it are among the iconic works of choral literature gregorian chanted masses polyphonic renaissance masses and such landmarks as bachs b minor mass haydns mass in time of war and beethovens missa solemnis reveal how the same text inspired beautiful profoundly expressive music in successive styles throughout history from mozart to berlioz to verdi to britten requiem masses with their element of fear and awe of what awaits us after death proved ideal vehicles for questioning humankinds folly and penchant for self destruction conversely brahms and faure composed requiems offering comfort to troubled spirits the reforms of pope pius x early in the th century banished large scale concert masses for chorus soloists and orchestra from liturgical use in churches this together with the increasing secularity of western culture ironically led to a greater freedom and variety in mass composition works like janaceks immense glagolitic mass with its slavonic text set for chorus and orchestra and alfredo casellas wartime missa solemnis "pro pace" solemn mass "for peace" of perpetuated the concert mass tradition to make a political or cultural statement concomitantly major composers wrote smaller scale works to fit the catholic church reforms among them stravinskys stark russian flavored latin mass for choir soloists and wind ensemble hindemiths latin mass with its bach like polyphony and brittens missa brevis in d for boys voices and organ composed for londons catholic westminster cathedral mass composers also have mixed liturgical and nonliturgical texts deliuss mass for life treats texts selected from nietzsches agnostic prose poem "thus spake zarathustra " brittens war requiem composed for the consecration of the new anglican cathedral at coventry built upon the war bombed ruins of the medieval church combines the requiem text with deeply moving antiwar poetry by wilfred owen composing masses has not just been a roman catholic preoccupation bach was lutheran britten anglican and leonard bernstein whose controversial mass has enjoyed a reappraisal in recent years was a jew nor have mass settings always been sung to the music of one composer as joseph jennings music director of chanticleer the celebrated male vocal ensemble observes "in the past weve done th and th century parody masses in which each movement though written by a different composer is based on the same gregorian chant tune or medieval song tune " inspired by this tradition and by chanticleers continuing program of commissioning new music to complement its vast repertoire ranging from gregorian chant to gospel and pop standards mr jennings commissioned a new mass for unaccompanied male voices to be written by an invited group of five contemporary composers in choosing composers from among those he and the chanticleer singers most admire mr jennings deliberately sought those of divergent cultural and musical backgrounds new york born douglas cuomo turkish american kamran ince israeli american shulamit ran londoner ivan moody and dubliner michael mcglynn "i wanted this to be a mass about todays world " mr jennings explains "and i wanted it to acknowledge that people express their faith in different ways " before attending the april world premiere of "and on earth peace a chanticleer mass" at the metropolitan museum of arts temple of dendur i listened to an advance copy of chanticleers new recording of the work warner classics the mass is both beautiful and deeply moving but most surprising about this "score by committee" is its overall stylistic cohesion and sense of historic continuity in part this is due to mr jennings who has arranged the five contemporary movements in alternation with a series of motets by two great italian renaissance composers carlo gesualdo and andrea gabrieli discussing this with me in new york a few days before the performance mr jennings observed that "given its vast scope composing a mass is equivalent to writing a choral symphony but with five composers involved none had the luxury to oversee the architecture of the whole work so i felt the need to provide a unifying element and also cleanse the audiences ears between the contemporary movements " he says he chose gabrieli and gesualdo "because i love their music and because their styles complement one another gesualdos chromaticism fits well in a modern mass setting and gabrieli writes so wonderfully for choral voices " mr jennings didnt tell the five composers about this plan beforehand and he neither encouraged nor prohibited them from contacting one another while composing their respective movements "they each worked alone in their own sphere " he says "yet there are some interesting overlaps compositional techniques harmonic progressions vocal colors and timbres apparent in the finished movements " for instance mr cuomos striking kyrie and mr inces gloria both exploit enigmatic vocal harmonies as backdrops to chantlike statements of their respective texts "each composer had the option of using or not using the traditional latin text " says mr jennings "as long as it fit within the allotted movement in the mass the respective texts were up to them " thus for his gloria mr ince chose a sufi poem by the th century ottoman mystic mevlana jelalaldin or jelaluddin rumi "everywhere the aroma of god begins to arrive " it climaxes with a strikingly ecumenical passage "moslems and christians and jews raising their hands to the sky their chanting voice in unison begin to arrive " and apart from its sheer choral loveliness it is a sensitive and meaningful word setting israeli born shulamit ran "comes from a very traditional jewish background " says mr jennings "and when she told me that she would have to approach the credo from this perspective i responded that i would not expect anything else " her complex text combines portions of the latin credo with hebrew passages beginning "ani maamin" i believe from the "thirteen principles of faith" by the medieval rabbi moses maimonides midway we also hear the "shma yisroel" hear o israel the central prayer of judaism the prayer that millions of persecuted jews had on their lips as they went to their deaths throughout history from the roman arena and the inquisition to the holocaust in this context it potently underscores the fundamental universality of this declaration mr moodys ravenna sanctus to greek liturgy and mr mcglynns gaelic language "a uain de" agnus dei reflect two further views of the mass the former reflects the composers close association with eastern orthodox ritual he is choir director of the greek orthodox church in lisbon where he lives its bass drone and melismatic vocal lines i e featuring melodic sequences of several notes to a syllable derive from the traditions of orthodox chant mr mcglynn director of the acclaimed irish choir anuna similarly exploits the haunting quality of a droning bass line over which he has fashioned a chantlike melody tinged with the poignant inflection of irish folk song with its gentle backdrop of sustained harmonies "a uain de" offers a truly peaceful conclusion to a work that embraces many different aspects of faith "even using the strictly catholic structure of the mass " says mr jennings "i wanted to keep the boundaries open because the fundamental idea of worship transcends the boundaries that the church can put around it " mr scherer writes about classical music for the journal
