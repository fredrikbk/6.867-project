the daily fix nba hands out suspensions and suns could be eclipsed online edition the key play everyones talking about today happened in an office somewhere yesterday not on the court the nba suspended the phoenix suns amare stoudemire and boris diaw for tonights game against the san antonio spurs because they left the bench the "immediate vicinity of the bench " in nba speak in the wake of mondays flagrant foul by the spurs robert horry on the suns steve nash mr horry drew a two game suspension with the series tied at suns fans are furious their team already undersized compared with the spurs traded their big man and top scorer in mr stoudemire and their second best playmaker in mr diaw for a role player in mr horry albeit one with a deadly eye for clutch three pointers the arizona republics paolo boivin says the league goofed by "quite possibly handing over the series to the team that committed the cheap shot " "the nba likes to play the hard line but the truth is this rule is open to interpretation " she writes " vicinity of their bench can be anything the league wants it to be san antonios bruce bowen and tim duncan werent suspended for running onto the floor earlier in the game after suns swingman james jones unknowingly caused a dunking francisco elson to crash to the floor because it didnt follow an altercation but there was the presumption of an altercation and is it really that different in several sacramento kings players rushed to the aid of doug christie after he was attacked in a tunnel by the los angeles lakers rick fox the nba excused the incident because it felt most players were unclear of what was happening to christie the bottom line the league has the ability to interpret the rules as it chooses " on true hoop henry abbott writes that "it truly seems to reward the spurs for a ridiculous foul but its not hard to understand when you consider how we got here " a decade ago mr abbott writes the nba decided it had to stop fighting and took strong measures to do so the strongest in the rules were changed so that players who left the bench during a fight got suspended "and in part because of that rule the nba no longer has a chronic fighting problem " mr abbott writes "it worked " yes he writes rules get broken "sometimes when theres a really compelling argument but what is the compelling argument here i guess the one that has all of us motivated is because it means so much and because what they did was so harmless all true but thats an impossible standard to maintain consistently in the future who wants to decide whos harmless and who isnt who wants to say which games are really important next time " in the san antonio express news buck harvey says the nba isnt being completely illogical noting that the suns coaches and players were determined to keep messrs stoudemire and diaw out of the fray because they knew what the leagues reaction would be that said he argues that commissioner david stern "allowed the best playoff series of his postseason to be damaged and he didnt do much for what has been one of his finest most respected franchises " but dont assume game will go to the spurs mr harvey warns "anyone who follows the nba knows a basic phenomenon when teams lose a player they seem to gain a temporary edge the ones with the advantage often relax and the ones without their star get tougher " the suns he writes will be "mixing the giddiness of a game breakthrough with the anger of losing two players because of what horry created rarely are these two emotions in play for the same team at the same time " the golden state warriors cinderella story has ended the way too many such stories do theyre returning to their hovel in rags while the utah jazz are free to romp at the ball a while longer utah beat golden state last night to win the series and advance to the western conference finals in the san francisco chronicle jake curtis tries to answer a basic question "how could golden state dominate the dallas mavericks and then lose in five games to the utah jazz " in the san jose mercury news tim kawakami writes that "the warriors were not going to go out quietly meekly or without leaving some bruises surprises and strange memories all the way down to the last rattled out three pointer and gutsy crazy fast break sprint they stayed who they were all the way until the last frantic rush and shouted epithet at the referees the warriors lost how they had won how they ended a season curse how they beat dallas how they lived and died the past six weeks which was right which is how they should be remembered and surely how they will remember it themselves hard fast loud angry fascinating not quite good enough to beat the jazz " in the salt lake tribune kurt kragthorpe writes that "the jazz finally did away with the golden state warriors only after being tied midway through the fourth quarter missing all kinds of free throws kicking the ball all over the court and refusing to take control of the game until the last minute tuesday night at energysolutions arena other than that it was a very convincing performance " but thats not to say mr kragthorpe is counting them out for the next series "during the last seconds when golden state coach don nelson was making the long walk of concession toward the jazz bench nobody in the building was concerned about style only substance the jazz have that in abundance " the chicago bulls showed absolutely nothing in getting blown out by the detroit pistons in hey wait a minute last night the bulls beat the pistons on the road to make their series a affair prompting the chicago tribunes mike downey to crow that "the bulls now lead this series two games to three " "so now we have the official question who are these bulls " writes rick telander in the sun times "i confess im mystified could it be theyre just slow learners but when they figure something out it sticks now the bulls are in this seven game series and if they win thursday at the united center which they should do then dear god how tight and doubting will the once haughty pistons be for a deciding game in the place where their magic is abruptly gone " in the detroit free press mitch albom still thinks the pistons will win but hes beginning to sound a bit like kevin bacon towards the end of "animal house" remain calm all is well the bulls "could have pulled the pistons pants down and not hurt their pride as much " he writes "they shot the lights out then they shot the sockets and the wiring and the fuse box too after three quarters they were still shooting close to and the pressure has shifted to the pistons chicago now has won as many road games in this series as detroit has ben gordon points has awakened from his slumber kirk hinrich has ceased to be intimidated tyrus thomas is aging a year every night and the pistons have been exposed as a team that drops like a failed tech stock when chauncey billups is on the bench before this second round series began everyone expected a tough hard affair and no one would have been surprised at a pistons lead but when it comes after a pistons lead its not surprise its something else concern " tip of the fix cap to reader john falck found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for
