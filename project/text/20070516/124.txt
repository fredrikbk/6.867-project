whats left unsaid at jamestown jamestown va on may english men and boys waded ashore here they then proceeded to decimate a native population that had lived in utter equanimity prior to their arrival and would eventually import a slave labor force to rape the continent of its natural resources all for the ugly motivation of profit at least thats the central theme of the exhibits marking the th anniversary of jamestown the first permanent english settlement in north america theres no denying that those elements are part of the jamestown story but jamestown contributed much more it gave us three of our most important founding principles private property rights representative government and civilian control of the military jamestown also was a strictly for profit venture its eventual success laid the foundation for our capitalist entrepreneurial culture a development that cannot be understated "it was in many ways the most important colony " jamestown historian and author jim horn told me during my visit unfortunately capitalism and the rule of law are given but a polite nod here the overarching storyline is that jamestown brought together three peoples from three different continents the english the native americans and the africans into a new multicultural society and all that it entails the exhibits at jamestown settlement open with a look at life before including a london streetscape the as yet unspoiled american wilderness and the idyll that was pre colonial angola one of the most innovative pieces of storytelling here is a film about life in angola before the portuguese came to trade christianity for elaborate ivory carvings and human cargo in the foreground of the screen are artifacts in traditional display cases as the film talks about a particular artifact and its cultural importance that artifact lights up moving onto were told the usual tale of how the english struggled to survive they battled disease starvation and the sometimes not so friendly indians the myth about capt john smith and pocahontas is dispelled as best we can tell she may or may not have helped smith persuade her father chief powhatan not to slaughter the english and there never was any romance between them she actually married colonist john rolfe had a son and traveled to england to recruit other colonists while there she became ill died and is buried in gravesend it was a hardscrabble life the business venture struggled to turn a profit the settlers who had left high unemployment and little opportunity in england to make their fortunes in a new world failed at almost every turn there were abundant natural resources for timber and glass making but they were doomed by the high cost of shipping the finished goods back to england it wasnt until rolfe experimented with growing tobacco in that the financial fortunes of the company took a turn for the better in the colony exported just pounds of tobacco by the figure had increased fold to pounds "no other commodity but tobacco in the colony " wrote gov john harvey in reflecting the singular focus while the success of tobacco had enormous implications for america and the world the exhibits focus more on what it meant for the indians and africans as tobacco soared so too did the english and slave populations by there were roughly settlers and african slaves here conversely the native population steadily dwindled mostly due to disease and outmigration in there were an estimated indians living nearby by their population had declined to just again these exhibits tell this story well but they are focused too much on the social and cultural interminglings of the three peoples here and the alleged injustices committed by the english far more important are the principles and practices that came out of the founding of jamestown namely industry and trade but because of the curators myopic politically correct focus a summation lumps representative government and english jurisprudence in with "servitude and social justice" and "displacement of indigenous people " theres more than exhibit halls at jamestown settlement replicas of the three ships that brought the english here in are moored on the river theres a replica of the fort as well its here because until about a decade ago most believed that the site of the original fort was in the middle of the james river an excavation in preparation for this years anniversary uncovered the original fort still on dry land historic jamestowne is on nearby jamestown island a few of the original buildings and the fort walls have been reconstructed from archaeological and archival evidence but for the most part this is an active archaeological site which makes it all the more interesting young grad students can be seen sifting dirt and documenting artifacts theres also an archaearium a small museum built over the site of the last active statehouse here it features the usual artifacts such as musket balls pottery and pipes as well as some unusual items theres a combination toothpick and earwax scooper as well as the spatula mundani a long metal rod with a flat scooper at one end and a sharp probe at the other it was created by jamestown surgeon john woodall to treat "severe constipation " a disease that "killeth many " in short these th century collections are impressive especially some of the artifacts found in the past decade its the context in which theyre displayed and the story of jamestown thats told that is disappointing but not all has changed after being preached to for three hours about the many misdeeds of the rampaging english visitors are funneled out through an expansive gift shop on sale there is every knickknack imaginable emblazoned with the jamestown logo theres even a "jamestowne survivor" game if thats not a testament to the fact that capitalism is the enduring legacy of jamestown i dont know what is mr yost is a writer in lake elmo minn
