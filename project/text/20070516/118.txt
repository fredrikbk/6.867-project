theres nothing like a genuine jukebox the jukebox that sits in the conference room just outside my office rolled off the j p seeburg corp assembly line sometime in two years before apple inc ceo and co founder steve jobs was born it was rescued from a warehouse in mexico in the early s after years of neglect restored to near original condition in a shop in northern virginia and joined our family in since which time it has been loved elvis would be happy to hear both tender and sweet all together record players two vintage radios six radio phonograph consoles and one seeburg hfg "select o matic" high fidelity deluxe jukebox are displayed in the three room suite along with a year accumulation of rock n roll memorabilia while others listen to music on an ipod theres nothing like a jukebox and most of the people who have seen and heard the big beauty understand why a jukebox is something you love forever an ipod is something youll discard some day indeed while apple inc may be one of the worlds most successful companies a generation from now both its ipod portable "media player" and itunes music library will probably be forgotten part of the great technological blur known as progress a vintage jukebox on the other hand will still be a work of art a source of passion and a powerful reminder that great american roots music jazz blues doo wop hillbilly r&amp b rock n roll is best enjoyed on a great american sound machine and when it comes to sound even an apple ipod hi fi is no match for a seeburg high fidelity boom box with a inch woofer and five inch tweeter crank it up oh what a night twist and shout seeburg which built some of the most stylish jukeboxes ever made in america was like apple a leading innovator of its time in for example seeburg introduced the ma the first jukebox to offer song choices that is both the a and b sides of different records other jukeboxes at the time offered just to selections seeburg broke new ground again in when it introduced the first all rpm vinyl record jukebox until rca introduced "s" the little vinyl records with the half dollar sized holes in the middle that resemble cds on steroids records were made of hardened shellac which broke chipped and scratched easily the term jukebox first gained currency in the u s in the s borrowed apparently from an old african american word "jook " meaning "to dance " earlier pay per tune record players were called "coin slot phonographs " these were mass produced starting around and played phonograph cylinders a technology developed by thomas edison the cylinders were phased out in the s in favor of gramophone records first the inch shellac disk and later the seven inch vinyl disk which was the jukebox standard until the late s when records gave way to the compact disc the earlier jukeboxes including the classic wurlitzer "bubbler " played rpm shellac records later machines such as mine played vinyl s todays jukeboxes manufactured by deutsche wurlitzer usa rowe international and others mostly play cds there are even ipod compatible models such as the wurlitzer "one more time" special edition but theyre very expensive costing thousands of dollars and most of the commercial venues where jukeboxes used to be so popular drugstore soda fountains ice cream parlors diners roadhouses no longer exist so theyre no longer a part of the common experience as they were in the s and s when rock n roll was young and fun besides calling a machine a jukebox doesnt make it so for example you dont download or "use" a jukebox you play it thats what music should be all about play youre supposed to have fun enjoy dance clap your hands snap your fingers sing along with dion not spend your time surfing the itunes library uploading downloading saving and plugging in when you turn on your jukebox youre turning on perhaps with a little help from a friend when you download to your nano youre performing a task it may be low tech but ill take my seeburg with its elegant arched glass front midcentury industrial hot rod chrome rotating pastel side columns and rich booming sound big and boisterous enough to fill a dance floor and another generation of pounding hearts over any competitor any day of the week mr berkowitz is managing director of a north carolina based public relations firm and remains a teenager at heart he can be reached at herbberkowitzpr bizec rr com
