politics &amp economics how giulianis rise vexes republicans plaudits on mayoral record suggests a potential schism over social economic issues after weeks on the defensive for his liberal if wobbly stand on abortion republican presidential hopeful rudy giuliani awoke monday to good news the conservative club for growth was promoting a mostly fawning report on his economic record as new yorks mayor the giuliani campaign immediately emailed the rave review to the media and potential supporters and did so again yesterday morning last night in a republican debate in south carolina mr giuliani himself highlighted the study but the good news for mr giuliani may suggest a worrisome prospect for republicans more broadly their current front runner has the potential to split the social and economic conservatives who have constituted the republican partys base since ronald reagan united them a quarter century ago "if the party nominates a social liberal like giuliani theres not only the potential but theres an inevitability of a split " says john stemberger president of the florida family policy council a politically active social conservative group "republicans will learn if that happens theyre going to a pay a price for nominating a social liberal" by losing the white house in if social conservatives sit out the election on that some conservatives who focus on economic issues would agree "there is a danger " says former republican rep pat toomey president of the club for growth a hard line antitax group "there has been a very constructive alliance" of social and economic conservatives "and its hard to imagine cobbling together a majority of americans without reaching both but a guy like mayor giuliani might be able to secure the nomination without the support of social conservatives " some party strategists and certainly mr giulianis camp share that view they argue that the former mayors post identification with the third pillar of the republican base national security along with his fiscal record in heavily democratic new york city could persuade conservatives to give him a pass on social issues in the general election they add mr giuliani could be the most electable republican because his support of abortion rights gun control and gay couples civil unions could appeal to independents and moderate republicans many of those voters abandoned the party in last falls elections believing it has become too beholden to the religious right "social conservatives just like everyone else make decisions about who theyre going to vote for based on a basket of issues not a single issue " says jim dyke a senior giuliani adviser they "also care about crime and what he did in new york city" where the crime rate dropped and the economy hummed during his tenure and his leadership after the world trade center attack at the family research council one of the most prominent christian conservative groups president tony perkins isnt buying it saying "it sounds as if the economic side of the family is serving us divorce papers " he says of the economic social and national security conservatives who are the three legs of the republican base "if one is missing you have a two legged stool and try sitting on that " such conservatives bristle that party officials and pundits are patronizing them with admonitions to stifle their moral objections in the interest of an inclusive party and victory in november mr perkins says christian conservatives share with "the conservative family" a belief in economic principles such as low taxes spending and free trade "but we dont share them at the expense of our core social values " and after years in which republicans have drawn people into the party with its stands against abortion and gay marriage "the idea that social conservatives would all of a sudden wake up and say those things dont matter well its just not going to happen " some social conservatives also are troubled by mr giulianis personal story which features three marriages a bitter second divorce and estrangement from his children mr stemberger says that profile suggests "an immoral man " for months mr giuliani tried to reassure religious conservatives with promises to appoint "strict constructionist" federal judges to conservatives a code phrase for judges hostile to abortion rights among other things that worked to persuade some but various giuliani statements such as his vacillation in a debate among presidential hopefuls this month that it would be "ok" if the supreme court struck down the roe v wade ruling legalizing abortion and "ok" if it didnt undercut any headway a speech last week at the houston baptist college signaled a changed strategy mr giuliani unapologetically endorsed abortion rights challenging social conservatives both to be open to his candidacy and perhaps even reward him for honesty "when people of good faith come to different conclusions about this about something so very very personal i believe you have to respect their viewpoint " he said the problem for social conservatives is no republican top tier candidate excites them arizona sen john mccain and former massachusetts gov mitt romney draw suspicion many of these voters like kansas sen sam brownback and former arkansas gov mike huckabee but fear such a dark horse cant win against that backdrop the club for growth report was most welcome in the giuliani camp the club previously issued critical reports on messrs mccain and huckabee and a generally favorable one for mr brownback mr toomey said its romney report will find a "mixed" record the giuliani paper in contrast read like an endorsement mr giuliani cut new york citys taxes spending and regulations privatized services overhauled welfare and espoused private school vouchers the club concluded despite the citys powerful unions media liberal activists and an overwhelmingly democratic council "in the face of such tremendous headwind giulianis fiscal accomplishments are remarkable " it said yet the details of the report provide grist for economic critics as well the club credits mr giuliani for cuts in both a commercial rent tax and a personal income tax surcharge but at other times he opposed the liberal councils bids to repeal both taxes in part because he preferred to spend the revenue on a baseball stadium he opposed a state income tax cut and a national flat tax filed the lawsuit that succeeded in getting a federal line item veto declared unconstitutional opposed the north american free trade agreement and in the clubs words showed "an alarming propensity for doling out corporate welfare to select companies " says mr toomey "the good outweighed the bad "
