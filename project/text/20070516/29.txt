continental shift colonial era ties to africa face a reckoning in france secretive and powerful cell suffers blows as controversies grow on the evening of march french paratroopers reached birao central african republic and dropped near an airstrip captured by rebel militia the paratroopers ambushed the rebels killing several and reclaiming the airport for the government in france neither the public nor parliament was informed of the attack for three weeks coordinating the mission was the "cellule africaine " a three person office nestled behind the elysee frances presidential palace this wasnt the first time the office has been involved in the central african republics internal affairs in france toppled the former colonys self proclaimed emperor and reinstalled his predecessor for the past half century the secretive and powerful "african cell" has overseen frances strategic interests in africa holding sway over a wide swath of former french colonies acting as a general command the cell uses frances military as a hammer to install leaders it deems friendly to french interests in return these countries give french industries first crack at their oil and other natural resources sidestepping traditional diplomatic channels the cell reports only to one person the president but with frances new president nicolas sarkozy preparing to assume office later today the african cells days may be numbered there are accusations the french military bears some responsibility for the genocide of tutsis in rwanda in charges the government strenuously denies theres fierce debate over the french militarys continuing presence in the ivory coast where soldiers were dispatched in when rebels threatened to overthrow president laurent gbagbo the cells close ties to oil giant elf aquitaine where top executives were jailed on corruption charges were a source of embarrassment and a former cell chief is now facing charges related to arms trafficking to angola critics say the cells support of nondemocratic african regimes an artifact of frances colonial past is preventing these nations from making progress to modernity and africa once evidence of imperial grandeur is now viewed by many french as the source of a continuing flood of poor immigrants even african leaders who once had a privileged relationship with paris are beginning to distance themselves "in the s france had the means to keep a tight lid on its former colonies " said mamadou diop chief of staff of gabon president omar bongo "but france and african states cannot ignore that we now live in a globalized world " the conservative leader mr sarkozy who was elected president on may has vowed to reshape frances relationship with its former colonies including doing away with the cells secretive military operations "a large majority of africans dont even identify with the colonial period" that led to the cells creation mr sarkozy said recently "how can we keep doing things the same way " he hasnt detailed any specific plans a shift in frances policy in africa where some million people speak french could have major repercussions on the global stage while some believe the cells demise would foster democracy in these countries helping spark an economic boom in africa that would benefit france but others say that without the cell frances presence in africa would simply disappear already the u s india and china are investing heavily in africa hovering around whats left of french controlled riches on the continent including oil fields uranium mines resorts port concessions cotton groves and air france klm sas rich portfolio of landing rights last november china held a summit in beijing for african leaders in niger global mining companies are challenging frances effective monopoly on uranium production two months ago french state controlled nuclear company areva sa which operates nigers two uranium mines won access to only five out of exploration areas being auctioned with the rest going to chinese british and canadian companies "weve noticed a growing appetite among our competitors " said areva spokesman charles hufnagel frances long history in africa dates back to the th century when france built up a presence there with the slave trade after world war ii france shared control of the continent with belgium portugal and the united kingdom even though african countries began to gain their independence in the s and s france continued to regard africa as its backyard when gen charles de gaulle was elected president in france was at war with algeria where more much needed oil and natural gas reserves had just been discovered that same year gen de gaulle instructed jacques foccart the head of the first "african cell " to keep gabon ivory coast and other sub saharan colonies in check nearly all the african colonies agreed to join a newly created "franco african community " giving paris privileged and sometimes exclusive access to raw materials at the time france was preoccupied with the cold war and countering soviet influence so it readily ignored the lack of democratic institutions and elected leaders in its former colonies in return the countries largely did pariss bidding "the community was like a classroom where pupils had to keep quiet " said martin ziguele prime minister of the central african republic from to and a professor at the political institute of nancy france when the franco african community collapsed because its members sought independence mr foccart nicknamed "mr africa " replaced the rigid structure with a series of defense pacts allowing france to keep military bases on the continent thus guaranteeing that paris could continue to exert control over its former colonies much of the cells efforts were directed at protecting frances economic interests in leon mba gabons first elected president was overthrown the state run oil firm that later became elf aquitaine had already begun production there mr foccart and pierre guillaumat head of the state run oil firm decided that the french military should reinstall mr mba the mission was a success nevertheless the event prompted paris to bolster its grip on gabon so mr foccart as he explained in his memoirs reshuffled gabons constitution to create a vice president position selecting omar bongo for the job when mr mba died in mr bongo became africas youngest head of state at age four decades later he is still president total sa the oil company that now owns elf commands about a third of gabons oil output african countries would often lobby to raise their standing in paris after the election of socialist president francois mitterrand in two gabonese officials arrived at socialist party headquarters with briefcases full of cash a contribution by mr bongo the gabon president "politely but firmly i instructed that the delegation be sent home " recalled former prime minister lionel jospin then socialist party chief in written comments responding to emailed questions "if mr bongo with his own money made payments to french politicians it was out of generosity " said mr diop chief of staff to president bongo "it was not to influence french elections " such situations made some in paris nervous that year frances cooperation minister jean pierre cot vowed to cut financing to african dictatorships and eliminate informal networks but mr cot was deemed too revolutionary and was soon forced to resign mr mitterand restored more power to the african cell in jacques chirac became president determined to have strong influence on africa the conservative leader brought mr foccart "mr africa" out of retirement and returned him to the cell but the conservative mr chirac was soon forced to share power with a socialist government which was eager to curtail frances military intervention in africa during this period frances grip over its former colonies loosened and interventions became erratic by now frances policies in africa were facing scrutiny this time from investigative magistrates who had set their sights on elf the oil company working with the african cell elf had built strongholds in gabon and congo brazzaville and had expanded beyond the former colonies to countries like angola in judges started investigating why elf was providing money often via its gabon unit to a french textile group called bidermann sa the probe and a subsequent trial in france uncovered a maze of elf led offshore companies and a vast system of corruption spreading throughout europe africa and asia while no former cell officials were formally charged the elf trials raised questions about frances conduct on the continent loik le floch prigent who was elf chairman between and and served a prison term after being convicted of abusing company funds said in an interview that elfs founders were trying to ensure the companys african operations were protected from frequent violence on the continent mr le floch prigent now a free lance energy consultant said the system served broader french interests in africa "people saw only the dark side of the mechanism and i turned into the main culprit " he said michel de bonnecorse the current cell chief said such mechanisms are "things of the past " he noted that these days the cells "guideline is to preserve stability " when france closed its eyes on autocratic governments in chad or togo where president gnassingbe eyadema ruled for years until his death in it was to avoid civil war he said "were being pragmatic " not everything the cell deals with these days is life and death mr de bonnecorse added he said part of his job is to help french companies navigate african bureaucracy and provide support to african leaders who need "to get their daughters into a prestigious high school in france " he played down the cells secretive nature saying that while he reports directly to the president "the defense and foreign affairs ministries get a copy of all our memos " earlier this year the cell suffered another blow to its reputation when jean christophe mitterrand son of the late socialist president and head of the cell from to was charged in a case involving the sale of &# million of weapons to angola between and when angola was recovering from three decades of civil war in the case a french arms dealer is suspected of having paid commissions to french politicians and intermediaries as part of the deal mr mitterand who is set to stand trial next year said he received commissions for helping angolas government obtain financing for oil projects not arms the angola probe strained diplomatic relations with france in angola stripped total of a large production block on its territory and soon after handed the operation to chinese oil company sinopec corp mr de bonnecorse said hes tried to lessen the friction "but when i tell angolas president that i cant dismiss the judge he doesnt believe me " mr de bonnecorse said today the investigations are held up as proof that frances policy in africa has to change president elect mr sarkozy has said frances development aid would go only toward democratic regimes and that france would stop using its army to meddle in african politics bolstered by the clear shift in rhetoric some countries see opportunity the u s for example has aggressively turned to african markets for oil last year crude oil supplies from africa topped imports from the middle east and accounted for of u s imports almost double the contribution of last year gabon selected chinese partners to develop an iron mine a project that includes plans for a hydropower plant a rail track and a port terminal whats unclear is what rules africas new visitors will play by mr diop the congo presidents chief of staff said china has a pragmatic approach "when chinese officials come to gabon they leave thorny issues such as corporate governance aside " he said "if we ask for a debt rescheduling and it makes business sense they do it no need to fight no questions asked "
