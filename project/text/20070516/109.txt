tax report whistleblower law scores early success higher rewards attract informants submitting tips the internal revenue service recently received important tips from informants hoping to cash in on a law offering sharply higher rewards in cases involving large amounts of tax cheating and other violations since the law was enacted in december the irs has received about reward claims some involving hundreds of millions of dollars says stephen whitlock head of the irss new whistleblower office under that law informants generally may collect as much as of whatever the irs eventually collects including penalties and interest some reward claims have come from "people who are knowledgeable insiders " mr whitlock says "theyre coming in with big fat piles of paper and they have at least on the surface some credibility about the information theyre bringing to us " congressional advocates hope the new law will help the irs collect significantly larger amounts of back taxes "so far it looks as if the whistleblower program changes were well directed " says iowa sen chuck grassley the senate finance committees ranking republican "its important for people with concrete information about tax fraud to be heard and not treated like skunks at the picnic " among the lawyers who recently have filed reward claims on behalf of whistleblowers is bryan c skarlatos a partner at the new york law firm of kostelanetz &amp fink llp mr skarlatos says he has filed three separate claims in just the past few months two came from individuals alleging large tax underpayments by two separate companies he says the other came from an individual at an investment firm alleging that a publicly traded company underpaid its taxes by more than &# million over several years mr skarlatos says he declines to identify his clients although the law is relatively new its attracting attention many lawyers attended a panel discussion on the subject at a recent meeting of the american bar association tax section in washington some lawyers predict many more reward claims will be filed in coming months as more people learn about the laws details here is a primer on how the law works what to watch out for if youre considering turning someone in and a few of the unanswered questions about the law and the informants program that irs lawyers are struggling with the law generally sets a reward floor of and a cap of of the collected proceeds including penalties and interest smaller rewards may be handed out in certain circumstances such as if a reward is principally based on public information including a court case or the media congress limited the new program to tips involving large amounts of money the law applies to someone with information involving a business or in the case of an individual someone whose gross income exceeds &# for any year in question whatever the case the taxes penalties and interest in dispute must exceed &# million mr whitlock says also the information must be submitted as a statement "under penalties of perjury " mark matthews a former irs deputy commissioner and now a washington lawyer at morgan lewis &amp bockius says the new law "may assist the program by generating some publicity and focusing attention on the most abusive schemes" involving large dollar amounts "one of these days " he says "someone is going to uncork a huge eight or nine digit reward " to file a claim under the law use irs form available on the irs web site at www irs gov "provide as much information as you can about the alleged tax noncompliance " the irss mr whitlock says informants still can file claims for smaller amounts but theyll be limited to the old law under which the reward typically cant exceed of the amount recovered the reward ceiling generally has been &# million in recent years although that ceiling and the percentage may be increased under special agreements another big change under the old law the irs typically wouldnt pay a reward to tipsters who "substantially" participated in the wrongdoing they reported mr matthews says the new law allows the irs to pay rewards to people who were involved but only under certain circumstances mr whitlock says for example tipsters involved with planning and initiating wrongdoing now may get reduced rewards but they would get nothing "if convicted for planning and initiating " he says many questions remain unanswered such as how will irs officials decide how much to pay for tips that produce large amounts of tax collections to what degree will the irs work hand in hand with whistleblowers to help develop cases how will agents do so without violating taxpayer privacy laws what happens if a whistleblower attempts to disclose confidential information such as lawyer client communication to the irs mr whitlock says these and other thorny questions are under study and the irs expects to publish guidance on the subject late this year if youre considering filing a claim be as specific as possible "the most important thing a prospective whistleblower can do is to develop the facts with as much detail as possible and to provide supporting documents whenever possible " says mr skarlatos who takes over next month as head of the civil and criminal tax penalties committee of the american bar association tax section "suspicions and theories that are not supported by facts documents and or first hand conversations are not going to get the irss attention " he adds "the key thing is to make as airtight a case as possible basically you want to do their legwork for them " no matter how strong you think your claim may be dont think a reward is a sure thing and dont expect the irs to deliver one quickly over the past few decades only about of all claims have resulted in rewards according to irs data moreover be prepared for a long wait the irs isnt allowed by law to pay a reward until it actually collects that often takes many years another tricky question is whether to approach the irs on your own or hire a professional to represent you the answer depends on the details of your situation if its a very simple case and the evidence you have is overwhelming you may be able to handle it on your own and thus avoid paying a lawyer but the types of cases that are most likely to attract the irs are "the larger cases which tend to be more complex " mr skarlatos says "in those situations its more likely you will need a lawyer to develop the case " present it to the irs and help you pursue or negotiate a reward briefs the irs received nearly million individual income tax returns as of may up from the prior year it had processed about million up the irs approved million refunds up total refunds &# billion up email taxreport wsj com
