the evening wrap paying the bills online edition congress appears to be no closer to reaching a deal on appropriations for the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan after a series of votes in both houses at the same time lawmakers are girding for a bruising fight over the broader budget the senate rejected by a vote a measure that would have clamped off funding for combat operations in iraq after march since president bush vetoed earlier emergency war funding legislation democrats have been working to assemble a new proposal but compromise has proved to be elusive and the outcome of this mornings vote would indicate that the majority party is more divided than ever on how to proceed nineteen democrats joined with republicans and connecticut independent joseph lieberman to defeat the measure sponsored by wisconsin democrat sen russ feingold however democrats with left leaning vermont independent bernard sanders voted to support the bill and among them were a couple of the partys top presidential hopefuls sen hillary clinton said that she had agreed to support the proposal "because we as a united party must work together with clarity of purpose and mission to begin bringing our troops home and end this war " her chief rival for the nomination sen barack obama said that he would prefer a plan that offers more flexibility but backed the legislation because he wanted "to send a strong statement to the iraqi government the president and my republican colleagues that its long past time to change course " a similar withdrawal proposal in the house last week also split democrats and was also ultimately rejected the white house has said again and again that it would reject any legislation that contains a timeline for withdrawal and it has given no indication that its stance has softened despite mr bushs willingness to discuss benchmarks for measuring the iraqi governments progress senate majority leader harry reid has promised to keep lawmakers in session through the memorial day recess if necessary to craft a new bill indeed one of the few measures that lawmakers agreed on today was one that said the dispute should be resolved in one way or another by the end of the month but the majority leader also said mr bush has to "deal with us" and that congress wont issue him "blank checks " the house passed a bill that would provide the requested war funds in two chunks the first would keep fighting going through july while the second would be voted on after congress reviewed new administration reports on progress in baghdad due july the white house rejected that idea amid all the bickering over the iraq purse strings democratic leaders on the hill were also hammering out an agreement on a budget resolution the accord they reached would add around &# billion to the presidents request for the coming fiscal year which begins on oct democrats project that over the next five years the federal deficit will shrink and shrink until the budget finally swings back to a surplus of &# billion by but their forecast assumes that revenue will continue to grow which may or may not happen depending on economic growth and other variables and also leaves unanswered questions about the future of mr bushs tax cuts which are set to expire after the budget is always a battleground but the fight figures to be notably brutal this year mr bush has already promised to veto spending bills that exceed his requests for individual government agencies for example and republican lawmakers will doubtless have some budget ideas of their own but lawmakers seemed pleased to at least have a start "weve been placed in a deep hole this plan will begin to dig us out " said sen kent conrad the chairman of the senate budget panel said wolfowitz negotiating his resignation embattled world bank president paul wolfowitz was said to be negotiating the terms of his resignation the former no official at the pentagon and an architect of the invasion of iraq was said to be seeking some public acknowledgement of his service at the poverty fighting institution where he attempted to sharpen the focus on corruption and that he and the bank share the blame for recent tension stemming for allegations that he had improperly used his influence in order to secure a job and generous compensation package for companion and longtime bank employee shaha riza mr wolfowitz appeared before the world banks board late yesterday to discuss the controversy and the panel was scheduled to convene this morning to deliberate on his fate that session was delayed at the request of the u s however it was also announced that mr wolfowitz had canceled a planned trip to europe for a world bank development conference the event is scheduled to take place in slovenia

chrysler group to cerberus capital management said he believes consolidation in the auto industry will continue but there was a low likelihood that daimler would be involved in future capital investments at least on the mercedes benz side at the same time future alliances for the auto makers truck business could be a possibility because of higher shipping costs and more localization in products mr zetsche said that after the chrysler deal he would be able to focus all of his energy on daimlers luxury brand and pay more attention to the truck business as for daimler being a possible takeover target after the sale of chrysler mr zetsche said the auto maker was now less attractive because "we leveraged ourselves " he also said management would work hard to ensure the company is not
