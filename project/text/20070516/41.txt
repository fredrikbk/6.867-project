fiscally fit the check is not in the mail a stamp price increase is barely noticed now that the cullens pay most bills online online edition this week the price of a first class u s postage stamp rose to cents from cents there was a time when i dreaded stamp price increases like this one not because higher prices would hurt us financially but because of the inevitable hassle that would ensue first id have to run out and buy a pack of supplemental stamps for the old ones in my wallet id guess at how many supplemental stamps i would need and almost always overestimate in fact it wasnt uncommon to find a few old supplemental stamps disintegrating in my purse when the next stamp price increase was announced but this weeks increase barely registered because i rarely have need for stamps anymore i embraced online bill payment services more than two years ago and now mail just one or two paper bills a month the transition from paying bills by "snail mail" to paying them online has largely freed me from the monthly paper shuffle but there were some costly glitches on the road to paper free bills i first signed up with a company to debit my checking account automatically back about years ago and quickly regretted it a technical glitch caused the company to debit my account daily for a monthly payment i didnt notice for more than a week and by then the company had wiped out my checking account the glitch led to a number of outstanding checks bouncing and i was charged steep bounced check fees that the offending company promised to refund and never did that experience put me off electronic payments for a long time but shortly after we financed our mortgage in our mortgage company encouraged us to sign up for automatic bill payment services i liked the idea of not having to think about paying the bill and protecting ourselves from a missed payment and a dinged credit score if a bill somehow got lost but i was nervous about giving the company access to my checking account fearing another bounced check fiasco instead we set up the payment so that it was debited from one of our savings accounts and my husband directed his companys payroll manager to deposit an additional &# a week from his paycheck into that account this way even another glitch wouldnt leave us risking bouncing checks this systems worked smoothly and today we rarely think about our mortgage payment when we set up the automatic mortgage payment i also considered the merits of signing up for an online bill payment service where one company would have access to my account and make payments to all of the companies i do business with but many were charging fees of as much as &# a month which turned me off since then many banks and bill payment companies have lowered or even done away with fees according to javelin strategy &amp research the median fee for such a service is zero compared to &# in when my bank started offering free electronic bill payment services i decided to give them another try i felt more secure having control over where money gets sent rather than giving a company access to my account still i started small a &# payment every other week to the credit union savings account that automatically funnels monthly payments to our home equity line of credit inputting the credit unions information into the bill payment service was easy though i had to contact our credit union to get routing information it took about minutes to complete and as with our mortgage payment now we dont need to think about it later i signed up our cable cellphone and credit card companies as well automatic bill payment services are time saving and convenient but for some bills you cant just set it and forget it i check my statements online each month to make sure the payments went through its particularly important to make sure the billing address of the company remains correct an address change could result in a payment being bounced back and a late payment fee incurred i also make it a habit to check for changes in payment due dates our gas electric and water providers were harder to manage because i was never sure what the total bill would be each month but now they offer the ability to pay bills online each month and recently the companies that insure our car boat and home also began accepting payments online i now pay all those bills online using my email calendar to remind me when payments need to be made today the only regular bills i still need a stamp for are my towns sewer and garbage collection fees though im hopeful my town will soon allow online payments soon occasionally i need to mail an outstanding doctor bill or some paperwork to an insurance company but not often and so the crumpled first class stamp book youll find in my purse today was purchased in late december i can remember a time when i bought books in threes because i was constantly running out of them in addition to saving money on postage im also spending less on checks four boxes of checks cost about &# and it would take me about two years to go through those boxes now my checkbook is used almost entirely for co payments at the doctors office and lunch tickets at my sons school i dont think ill need more checks for at least five years id expected to benefit from the convenience of paying bills online and save by using fewer stamps checks and envelopes what i didnt realize was just how much time electronic bill payments would free up in addition to reclaiming the hour or so a month id usually spend writing out checks and mailing bills i now dont have to drive minutes round trip to my local division of motor vehicles five times a year to wait in long lines to renew our state vehicle and boat registrations today i get a registration renewal notice in the mail spend five minutes online plugging in our information and pay the registration fee with my credit card a week or so later the registration card shows up in the mail our town also now accepts quarterly property tax payments online saving me from having to drive down to town hall four times a year and deal with a surly tax clerk ive even begun making my state estimated tax payments online saving me from having to remember to fill out and mail tax forms four times a year in fact about the only time ill probably have to worry about the stamp price increase is in early december when we mail about christmas cards to friends and relatives this year mailing those cards will cost &# more due to the stamp price increase for a total of &# an extra buck and change compared with all the money and time ive saved im not going to sweat it do you use online bill payment services what concerns or problems have you had when it comes to paying bills electronically what
