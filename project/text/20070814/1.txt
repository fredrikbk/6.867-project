a cultural conversation with stephen carter he lets his books speak his piece during the summer of stephen carter worked as an intern at what was then the atlanta journal now a law professor at yale mr carter speaks fondly of his time testing the waters of journalism over lunch in the backyard of his suburban connecticut home he tells me that he always "enjoyed the writing" but "wasnt a very skillful interviewer " people would ask him during those months in atlanta if he was "kin to jimmy " referring to the democratic presidential candidate and mr carter with a southern accent that his editors at the journal helped him develop in the hopes that his interviewees might open up to him more would say the two were "not very close " a quarter century later mr carter returned in a sense to his journalistic roots his mystery "the emperor of ocean park" employed a reporters eye for detail to chronicle a world the african american upper class that few of his readers knew much about "new england white " the second in his planned trilogy of thrillers for which knopf paid mr carter over &# million was released last month the first books protagonist was a black law professor at an elite university that seemed a lot like yale the second book revolves around julia carlyle a divinity school dean at the same school and her husband lemaster the universitys president as the novel opens julias ex lover a prominent economics professor has been murdered once again perhaps to mr carters slight dismay the reader is enthralled more by the details of the parallel black society that exists right under white noses than by the books unraveling mystery readers of all colors may take a voyeuristic interest in the clubs where upper class black children can meet and mingle for instance the rich characters their revealing quotations and the elaborate settings for this intrigue make for the kind of stories a newspaper editor would kill for about halfway through "new england white " julia is visited by tonya a fellow member of the ladybugs an exclusive black womens group ostensibly to see if the carlyles plan on attending the annual cotillion in boston of course the family will be there julia explains and shes sorry shes been neglecting her club duties when julia offers that she was unable to make one meeting because she and lemaster were dining at the white house occupied by a republican her friend retorts "oh honey i couldnt go telling the sister ladies that could i our people dont like the president julia " "is that right said julia she had voted for the other guy just as tonya had but women in her family were not quite pushable around i must have missed the directive from blackness central " the man sitting before me tall trim and black with a neat mustache and goatee has probably missed a fair number of such directives over the years in his nonfiction book "gods name in vain" mr carter an evangelical christian and contributor to christianity today notes that despite strong support among african americans for school vouchers school prayer and an anti abortion message "the black community votes consistently for a party that would never take seriously its views on these issues " and he accuses black preachers of issuing "press releases from the liberal wing of that party " in "reflections of an affirmative action baby" mr carter describes the reaction he received after publishing an op ed in this newspaper about the problems of affirmative action "one correspondent informed me that my sarcastic remarks were indicative of the cynicism and insecurity that is typical of a new emerging class of neoconservative black middle class intellectuals " mr carter was never a neoconservative except in the sense that some liberals really didnt like him his nonfiction has made him a fair number of enemies but he says he didnt mind because he could research and footnote everything "with fiction i dont have that protection part of what makes fiction more nerve racking for me is that i make up the story so what a lot of writers see as the freedom of fiction i see as the risk " reading his novels youd never know mr carter felt so constrained he hits his targets mercilessly but he doesnt much want to continue his attacks during our conversation when i suggest that we could discuss the new novels politics for instance he immediately demurs "there are people in the world who are willing to talk about any subject at any time and fill you with their opinions i tend to have opinions about things i have studied as a scholar and if i havent studied them as a scholar then i dont think its my job to talk about them " mr carter continues to pull his punches perhaps so as not to offend any potential readers who dont know about his day jobs to take a small example he names the carlyle family cat rainbow coalition which this reader anyway took as a kind of trivialization of a certain civil rights leaders initiative a leader who mr carter has criticized before but no mr carter insists he just thought the felines name was "cute " and if he meant anything larger it was an expression by the family of "solidarity with black activism " mr carter has always distanced himself somewhat from conservatives like shelby steele and thomas sowell who dont tend to think that "solidarity with black activism" is beneficial to individual blacks "the valuable side of racial solidarity" that mr carter described in "reflections" is still something he insists upon in his novels and his life "i do think that my wife and i as black parents thought it was important that our children not grow up just among white children we had a sense of not wanting our children to lose a sense of where they came from " the black characters in "new england white" almost without exception express some opinion on this question of solidarity mr carter doesnt say so explicitly but he seems to most identify with the approach that lemaster embodies a highly educated wealthy man and frequent churchgoer lemaster also likes listening to rap music when hes alone in his car and is a member of an exclusive black mens club solidarity doesnt always mean "standing on the front lines of a protest march " mr carter tells me about lemaster for other characters in the novel that is the only kind of solidarity early in the story julia is walking toward the towns beach with her husbands liberal cousin astrid who earlier told her that the ladybugs are so devoted to their club "because it lets them express solidarity with the community without actually having to do anything about it they can leave the striving for justice to those they have left behind " the two women are stopped by the beachs lifeguard with the words "residents only " the incident is made all the worse for julia because astrids "half smile suggested that the contretemps was proving her point " astrid is one of the more minor characters in "new england white " but mr carter fills her dialogue with liberal shibboleths over thanksgiving dinner she gives thanks to god that a voucher initiative is defeated for instance meanwhile julias mother mona has become so fed up with the current "regime" in washington that she has left for france the author is reluctant to criticize "i think its fair to say that there are people who will read this novel and say mona is right " he is no less willing to explain the motivations of the novels academics whom he maintains are "shameless exaggerations of campus types" though anyone who has spent time on campus recently might find them surprisingly realistic there is for instance the economics professor in an "open" relationship with his wife who "is not even sure there is a rational case to be made for traditional marriage any more " mr carter who in his life as a christian intellectual would have no trouble mounting a spirited defense of such old fashioned arrangements tells me "its not that by his own lights hes amoral its that he would find most of what others would call immorality to be inefficient interference with the pursuit of happiness " more so even than the other academics the divinity school professors in the novel come in for a satirical swipe mr carter gives them the last names of famous physicists since presumably none of them believe in anything but science after one such professor expresses her "fervent hope that god would soon expose the religious right as the irreligious wrong " lemaster tells julia that the problem with such people "is that they want a god small enough to fit in their hip pockets to be pulled out only when necessary to gain a secular advantage " the carlyles by contrast attend a schismatic episcopal church one that has split from the main church because of its liberal stances on homosexuality for instance without the cover of fiction or nonfiction mr carter will pose his implicit criticism of university religion only as a question "if youre going to teach at a divinity school is it helpful or hurtful for you yourself to be of strong religious conviction " if you want the answer youll have to read the book ms riley is the journals deputy taste editor
