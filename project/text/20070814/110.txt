charter operator and negotiating for a plane and pilots fractional ownership in which companies sell a share of an airplane opened up the private jet world by making planes easier to buy and schedule that was followed by jet card programs in which you can buy as little as hours of flying for about &# reducing the cost further now charter brokers are bringing the cost down even more by making it simpler to hire planes for single trips called "on demand" charters on a pay as you go basis no buying into an airplane or prebuying hours of flying time several firms are simplifying the process by collecting bids from charter companies for interested fliers and making arrangements from car service to onboard catering at the same time the private jet worlds two main safety rating agencies are making it possible for consumers to check charter companies and individual pilots to make sure their flight has aviations equivalent of a good housekeeping seal of approval "anyone who has flown with frequency starts to realize that all these planes arent the same " says greg johnson chief executive of onesky jets in manchester n h explaining why such ratings are especially important for private jet clients a one time charter is still more expensive than first class airline tickets but it can be affordable to many people without ceo salaries or trust funds who might want to splurge once or twice a year on a special trip a typical new york to florida one way flight costs &# to &# for a six passenger jet depending mostly on whether the plane goes home empty or not if the charter company doesnt find another customer for the flight home you pay for that trip too john mckey a retired advertising executive charters jets twice a year to move between his homes in boston and florida to avoid "the appalling process now of going through commercial airlines " leaving from bedford mass and flying directly to vero beach fla saves a couple hours of driving and since his wife has to travel with wheelchair assistance the level of service the couple gets with a private plane is highly prized "its not inexpensive but it is easy to do " said mr mckey a client of onesky a fast growing three year old company that arranges on demand charters and has its own command center to track flights and make customer arrangements he pays about &# to &# for each to hour flight he and his wife invite friends to fill the other seats on their trips another company blue star jets is similar to onesky you tell them where you want to go and a broker offers several options on different airplanes virgin

us airways counter to long security lines to lost luggage " for do it yourselfers safety concerns weigh heavily on the charter decision how do you know that the plane you hire is well maintained and

private jet safety firms they audit charter companies and check out pilots from conducting criminal background checks to figuring out how many hours of experience each pilot has in the cockpit of a particular type of airplane corporations have used arg us and wyvern for many years to make sure that jets chartered for executives were as safe as possible now both companies are making it easier for consumers to get the same safety checks arg us offers a simple "tripcheq" that rates a particular flight with a green yellow or red light based on the record of the operator and the experience of the pilots www aviationresearch com "we see more and more consumers using the system " said kathy tyler director of sales at arg us "they want to make sure the good the bad and the ugly are known " you can buy a tripcheq for &# or ask the broker you use or charter operator you hire to provide it of charter trips arg us checked in the past year failed to meet its standards in most cases the pilots failed to meet the firms strict experience requirements in order to get a green light rating the two pilots must have combined time in that type of airplane of hours among other criteria familiarity with the airplane makes a difference in crash statistics wyvern is currently offering free of charge a beta version of its new pilot &amp aircraft safety survey or pass reports www wyvernltd com with pass reports you can specify safety criteria you want or use wyverns recommended standards once formally launched the company will probably charge &# for each pass report says bonney pelley wyverns
