after rove strategy choices loom republicans could chart different political course once the architect leaves washington karl roves departure from the white house leaves republicans without their best strategist in a generation raising the question of whether the party next year will continue his hardball strategy of playing to the conservative base and picking off just enough independent voters to win elections for president bush mr roves resignation effective at the end of this month all but certainly signals the end of whatever hopes he still had of winning major political victories in congress still mr rove said the president is "going to use every lever hes got command over right up to noon on jan " friends and foes alike said the power and success of mr bushs longtime political adviser and white house deputy chief of staff often were exaggerated but mr rove is credited with playing a big role in adapting conservatism to the post cold war era with the mantra of "compassionate conservative" at a time when republicans national security trump card had been devalued he then revived security as a useful political weapon for his party after the sept terrorist attacks in the u s unusually mr rove shaped the bush record in both politics and policy as one of the few modern campaign strategists to continue with a major role in governing at the white house he also was the white houses and the national partys link to republican officialdom down to the level of county chairmen his departure could add to the demoralization in republican ranks the white house plans to divide many of mr roves responsibilities among a few key aides including senior adviser ed gillespie a recent addition who is a former chairman of the republican national committee it is thought the white house wont recruit from outside to replace mr rove whatever mr roves own liabilities in addressing republican concerns local officials found it heartening to have the man perceived as a political "genius" at the top looking for a way out of the mess at the same time one national republican insider said "the party is considerably freer today than it was yesterday " mr roves plans were revealed early yesterday in an interview with the wall street journal editorial page the eventual presidential nominee likely will have to separate himself from the increasingly unpopular president bush to the extent mr rove isnt in the white house casting a shadow that becomes easier republicans with several campaigns said yesterday in the past if a republican congressman or senator strayed from the white house line typically as they ran for re election mr rove often would call a local republican official or contributor to pressure the lawmaker back into the fold democrats have thrived on demonizing mr rove presidential hopeful barack obama who has styled himself as the candidate who can bridge the divides left by the bush administration hailed the partys bete noire in a statement yesterday saying "karl rove was an architect of a political strategy that has left the country more divided the special interests more powerful and the american people more shut out from their government than at any time in memory " in a telephone interview from air force one as he flew with the president to texas mr rove dismissed the widely held image of himself as a political divider "i love the myth that the nature of politics as practiced by us is focusing on a narrow group " he said in fact he said "its been taking the energy of those in the base and building on it and expanding it outward " he is glad democrats have taken the notion seriously however because "its gotten people saying we should be focusing on the base of our party like moveon org and the pink ladies " mr rove said the latter a reference to a womens antiwar group called code pink another aspect of the rove teams legacy has been its reliance on sophisticated technological tools such as microtargeting which relies on consumer and voting databases to build individual profiles of tens of millions of people then narrowly targets direct mail phone and other pitches that has increased in importance with democrats too mr rove said some former bush advisers and even occasionally current ones have said they have become disillusioned to some degree both by the credit he got and a sense that mr rove overdid the polarizing politics "i always have had a problem with the coverage of karl its always looking at the bush universe through the prism of karl karl was an important guy but he wasnt the only one" important to the bush successes said past political director terry nelson who resigned as campaign manager for arizona sen john mccains presidential bid "no successful campaign or white house rests on one guy " whatever his role mr roves winning streak ended in amid the increasing unpopularity of mr bush and his iraq war policies as well as republican excesses and democrats took back control of congress after years mr roves aim of ushering in a majority republican party parallel to the william mckinley era at the turn of the last century had been dashed the partys popularity is at its lowest point in the two decade history of the wall street journal nbc news polls a piece of that majority party building effort incorporating the rising hispanic population into party ranks has boomeranged the republican base has rebelled against illegal immigration and the bush administrations perceived lack of enforcement with a virulence that has alienated many hispanics mr roves last big political defeat came earlier this summer on immigration reform he and mr bush unsuccessfully tried to move republicans to take a more moderate stance but instead the white house found itself increasingly pushed aside if mr rove was mr bushs political "architect " as the president called him his design was a strategy that came to seem better aimed for winning elections than for governing and winning big agenda items those items notably the doomed second term priority of overhauling social security require a broad political consensus and compromise which would aggravate the political base and wasnt the bush rove style mr roves own effectiveness in mr bushs second term was diminished as he got consumed in the legal and political investigations swirling around the white house he was the target of an investigation into the administrations leaking of the identity of valerie plame then an agent of the central intelligence agency though he was never charged the white house said he paid his criminal legal bills in full more recently mr roves hardball tactics drew political controversy when it was revealed the white house helped engineer the firings of a number of u s attorneys last year several committees are seeking mr roves testimony senate judiciary chair patrick leahy of vermont said mr roves departure wont end the pursuit "now that he is leaving the white house while under subpoena i continue to ask what mr rove and others at the white house are so desperate to hide " he said in a statement mr rove said he plans to spend his days writing a book about the bush presidency
