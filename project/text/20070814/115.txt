the two income tax trap non business bankruptcy filings in the united states quintupled during the s and s to over million annually by from in to address the problem of soaring bankruptcy filings during this period of unprecedented prosperity two years ago congress enacted comprehensive bipartisan bankruptcy reform legislation the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of tightened bankruptcy laws to weed out chronic problems of fraud and abuse and to restore public confidence in the integrity of the bankruptcy system since that time bankruptcy filings have plummeted to about half of their prior levels and reports indicate that the law is having few unintended consequences of interfering with the needs of legitimate good faith filers the reasons for the rapid rise in filings as well as for bapcpas effectiveness remain unclear the most plausible explanation for the rise seems to be a change in legal rules social norms and the economics of consumer credit that increased the advantages of filing for bankruptcy at least some of these factors were reversed by bapcpa scholars on the left however have argued the recent drop is temporary and that rising bankruptcies will result from new stresses on american households such as those posed by rising health care costs and higher mortgage payments for increasingly expensive homes these new expenses strain the family budget leaving less discretionary income available to save and to meet other household expenses and forcing mothers into the workforce despite the apparent prosperity of american families over the past several decades and the presence of two regular incomes american households on this view are in a more precarious situation than ever before the argument is developed in the book "the two income trap why middle class mothers and fathers are going broke " by harvard law school professor elizabeth warren and her daughter amelia tyagi in fact using their own numbers it is evident that they have overlooked the most important contributor to the purported household budget crunch taxes ms warren and ms tyagi compare two middle class families an average family in the s versus the s all dollar values are inflation adjusted the typical s family is headed by a working father and a stay at home mother with two children the fathers income is &# out of which came &# in mortgage payments &# a year on car expenses &# on health insurance and income taxes "which claim of the fathers income " leaving &# or about &# per month in "discretionary income" for all other expenses such as food clothing utilities and savings the typical s family has two working parents and a higher income of &# an increase of over the s family but their expenses have also risen the mortgage payment increases to &# the additional car raises the family obligation to &# and more expensive health insurance premiums cost &# a new expense of full time daycare so the mother can work is estimated at &# mothers income bumps the family into a higher tax bracket so that "the government takes of the familys money " in the end despite the dramatic increase in family income the family is left with &# in "discretionary income " less than the earlier generation the authors present no explanation for why they present only the tax data in their two examples as percentages instead of dollars nor do they ever present the actual dollar value for taxes anywhere in the book so to conduct an "apples to apples" comparison of all expenses i converted the tax obligations in the example from percentages to actual dollars in fact for the typical s family paying of its income in taxes works out to be &# and for the s family paying of its income is &# although income only rose and expenditures for the mortgage car and health insurance rose by even less than that the tax bill increased by &# a whopping increase the percentage of family income dedicated to health insurance mortgage and automobiles actually declined between the two periods during this period the figures used by ms warren and ms tyagi indicate that annual mortgage obligations increased by &# automobile obligations by &# and health insurance payments by &# a total increase of &# those increases are not trivial but they are swamped by the increase in tax obligations to put this in perspective the increase in tax obligations is over three times as large as the increase in the mortgage payments and almost double the increase in the mortgage and automobile payments combined even the new expenditure on child care is about a quarter less than the increase in taxes overall the typical family in the s pays substantially more in taxes than the combined expenses of their mortgage automobile and health insurance and the change in the tax obligation between the two periods is substantially greater than the change in mortgage automobile expenses and health insurance costs combined this suggests that the most important change in the balance sheets of middle class households over the past three decades is a dramatically higher tax burden caused by the progressive nature of the american tax system in turn it follows that the most effective way of alleviating the household budget crunch would be to adopt lower and flatter tax rates that would reduce the governments take another possibility advocated by prof edward j mccaffery of the university of southern california law school would eliminate the "secondary earner bias" in the tax system which causes all of the wifes income to effectively be taxed at a much higher marginal tax rate than the husbands any of these reforms seem sensible lower and flatter marginal tax rates generally are not advocated by those who dominate the american legal academy today but for those who want to consider serious strategies for preventing bankruptcies less money in uncle sams pockets may mean more money in ours mr zywicki
