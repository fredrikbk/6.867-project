why chinas communist party congress could shake up companies and stocks beijing wrangling among chinas political elite in the coming months ahead of a pivotal communist party meeting could leave some foreign investors scratching their heads about their china portfolios the communist party congress an event held every five years at which key leadership appointments and policies are unveiled is likely to create uncertainty in the management of some chinese state controlled companies analysts say as the heads of those companies are ultimately appointed by the party the congress could lead to management shuffling or policy changes that affect the firms those changes or speculation that they could come might lead to increased volatility in the share prices of the affected companies especially because there is often little transparency for investors over those decisions but analysts say that in general investors shouldnt be too alarmed "the stock market could fluctuate a bit when all kinds of new information announcements and policies could be released " says xu wei an analyst with tx investment consulting co in shanghai investors may want to "watch over the stock market for a bit" and "make new decisions about their shares when everything is clear " but because overall government policy is usually stable it "wont have big impact on the stock market" in the long run he says the congress is expected to be held this autumn although no exact date has been announced its primary focus is on broader party policies but the potential ramifications for business are a reminder of the way national politics continue to affect how china inc is run since the last meeting in november many more of chinas big state firms have become public companies meaning that any related changes

received new chairmen dispatched from regulatory agencies moves analysts see as catalysts for speeding up preparations for initial public offerings china everbright bank is majority owned by state controlled conglomerate china everbright group and its china everbright ltd arm which is listed in hong kong "pretty much all the heads of the large state owned banks will rotate in the next few months " predicts victor shih a professor of chinese politics at northwestern university in illinois "those remaining will be the exception rather than the rule " while public listings have led to some improvements in corporate governance such as the creation of corporate boards with some outside directors disclosure of such changes is often slow and unclear in the case of china everbright bank the governments appointment of tang shuangning as chairman was announced to bank staff in mid june reports of his appointment quickly began filtering out in the media everbright ltd which owns of the bank rose on june the day after hong kong media reported mr tangs appointment no official word came from the listed company until a july statement to the hong kong stock exchange in some cases slow or
