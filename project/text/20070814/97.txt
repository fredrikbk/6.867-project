roves brain one of our biggest arguments with karl rove was over the bush administrations first term steel tariffs we opposed them and in one editorial calling for their repeal we scored "secretary of state rove" for letting politics trump u s interests mr rove never gave any quarter and when trade promotion authority passed congress in by he tracked us down to read a list of members who had voted aye they all belonged to the steel caucus the episode captures the essential rove the political strategist whose larger purpose was always to advance president bushs policy goals in this case he judged that congress would never give mr bush free trade expansion power without evidence first of tough trade enforcement we think congress would have done so anyway and that the steel tariffs and farm bill hurt americas trade leadership in the world but right or wrong mr rove has always been as much policy wonk as political operative and always loyal to the presidents agenda this truth is hard for many partisans to accept on both the left and right as yesterdays reaction to mr roves resignation announcement shows democrats either rejoiced that the evil "bushs brain" is gone or blamed him as barack obama did as "an architect of a political strategy that has left the country more divided " the former is a way of diminishing mr bush while the latter is highly selective history mr bushs campaign strategy was explicitly to be "a uniter not a divider " the contested election outcome made the bush presidency polarizing from the start however and some democrats have never considered him legitimate the debate over iraq and mr bushs response to the war on terror has compounded the rancor mr rove is hardly any more "divisive" than any other political strategist has everyone forgotten james carville or harold ickes the difference is that mr roves remarkable run of success first in texas then nationwide from has caused many on the political left to assume he must be cheating otherwise how could anyone vote for these texas yahoos the events of september and iraq have made this predominantly a war presidency and that fact has also colored mr roves record for better or worse for the better it provided the political capital to retake the senate in pass the bush tax cuts that spurred the economy and frame the bush doctrine mr rove was especially vital to the first two and as he argues much of that policy toward terrorism is likely to be adopted by future presidents of either party with his recent "invade pakistan" riff mr obama has himself signed on to the view that countries should not be allowed to harbor terrorists for the worse the trouble in iraq sapped mr bushs public support early in his second term and diminished his ability to pass major domestic reform social security was the most notable casualty followed this year by the collapse of immigration reform republicans suffered major congressional losses last year though in this messrs bush and rove arent much different than eisenhower in lbj in or reagan in our own sense is that the biggest gop liability last year was corruption in congress not iraq as on steel tariffs weve had our differences with this white houses political policy calculations especially in the first term mr bush refused to discipline republican spending excesses and caved to gop demands to water down medicare reform he also failed to protect the constitutional right to free speech by signing campaign finance "reform " and he was too willing to toss school choice over the side while compromising on no child left behind among other things on the other hand this presidency has not squandered its mandate trying to play "mini ball " as mr rove puts it social security and immigration reform are important for the country and wed argue as well for the political interests of the republican party they were worth the effort the same people complaining that mr bush gave too little heed to public opinion spent the s complaining that bill clinton did nothing without consulting a poll this is an especially controversial position to take now on immigration and its a notable irony that some of mr roves most vitriolic critics yesterday were on the restrictionist right we know how he feels mr rove believes that a gop that alienates hispanic voters will soon be a minority party and in this he is surely right president bush won of the hispanic vote in and a decline to bob doles percentage of below in would make it hard for any republican president candidate to win in new mexico or colorado and perhaps even arizona and nevada until tom tancredo wins a statewide race well assume mr rove is a better judge of coalition building mr rove is no merlin or rasputin as much as liberals and some reporters want to believe it he is above all a george bush man his rare mastery of history demographics and policy made him a formidable political force and we suspect it is his success far more than his methods that infuriates his critics
