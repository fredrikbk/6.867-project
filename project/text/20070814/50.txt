had it up to here despite risk some say quitting is way to go the last straw for brokerage firm account manager anne marie mcclaran came three months ago and didnt seem like the end of the road moment it became she was trying to complete three different projects while being barraged by phone calls and emails then one of her co workers asked her nicely for help normally she would have been happy to provide it but not that day "i just wanted to turn around and take a swing at him and i wanted to yell and scream at the top of my lungs and i wanted to hurl my computer and my phone through the window " ms mcclaran says she had thought about quitting before but fear had held her back still after years on the job she had migraines and neck aches and was frequently irritable "it doesnt do me any good to have a secure future if i dont have any future " she says so even though she had no savings account cushion she walked into her bosss office and quit everyone knows that the best way to leave an old job is to start a new one but there can come a point when no job no matter how financially necessary is better than the last one and despite all the good advice about lining up new work stockpiling emergency funds and avoiding rash decisions some people do discover that the devil they dont know is better than the one they do its hard to predict your breaking point particularly when work oriented platitudes can cause self doubt technically speaking there probably is another possibility to exhaust maybe youve given your work situation only a "pretty good shot" as opposed to your best maybe your efforts amounted to merely for many people theres no flashing sign that says "turning point" ahead just plenty of bootstraps that need pulling up and yourself that needs dusting off thats why even terrible office events are sometimes only the second to last straw "i have never in my life done the best i could do " says tim orr an ad executive who spent six years in a job he couldnt stand before ultimately becoming self employed "i know full well i could always have tried just a little bit harder " a noncompete clause prevented him from working for another local agency so he spent a great deal of time trying to improve his job situation he even read books on psychological disorders in an effort to decode his boss it also doesnt help that the line is fine between perseverance and banging your head against a wall over the years jerry slaske an account manager reached what he thought was the end of his rope a number of times but "i always came to the conclusion that im not leaving because of something someone else did or said " he says "some might call it being indecisive " complicating the decision are several variables a mortgage kids and a paltry bank balance can mean a last straw has been preceded by many others a windfall inheritance or cash flush spouse on the other hand can mean there was never even a first straw but those who do get to their wits end say they are grateful for the clarifying moment despite the financial pickle accompanying it kathy mccurdy a location manager for a production company has been out of work since shortly after her boss exploded at a colleague because of some borders on a set of photographs ms mccurdy half expected allen funt or ashton kutcher to appear and announce the hissy fit was just a prank but when they didnt she decided she had to leave the clearest last straw is when management presents you with one one of john westropps former managers demanded that he accomplish many tasks under an unrealistic deadline setting him up for failure effectively he says he was asked "to sequence a dna sample from my left arm within hours " in a subsequent "dysfunctional" work environment he was the only one in his department laid off for "budgetary issues " despite the companys &# billion in annual revenue "it was fairly doubtful that my salary of &# per year was dragging down the operation " he says still he hid his glee from his boss "i ended up practically consoling him " he says one upside of throwing in the towel can be the support of colleagues who are often awed that someone is fed up enough to resign soon after attorney lisa ebert disclosed to former supervisors that she was pregnant they suddenly found her work product unsatisfactory ultimately threatening to withhold a paycheck she told her boss that was illegal "im leaving now " she said "and the next time you hear from me it will be through my attorney " she eventually won a settlement and the envy of her colleagues "its a luxury to even have a last straw " she says "the lack of choice is the most horrible imprisonment " perseverance worked for a while for ms mcclaran the account manager at the brokerage firm but after she quit she says she felt as though she was "floating " and all her stress related symptoms vanished her last day is aug she hasnt landed a new job but the jump at least for the moment was worth it "the fear of quitting " she says "is always way worse than the reality " email me at jared sandberg wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj com forums to see past columns please go to
