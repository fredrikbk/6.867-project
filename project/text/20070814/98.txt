rule change ticks off some traders for most people ticks are something that crop up at summer camp this season ticks of a different stripe are causing wall street traders to break out in a rash the markets have been in turmoil in recent weeks as the fallout from soaring defaults on riskier home mortgage loans spread since hitting a record in late july the dow jones industrial average has fallen more than and people looking to sell their holdings especially bonds have often had trouble finding buyers another factor some traders say is causing turmoil an arcane rule change referred to as the "downtick" rule that kicked into effect in july that makes it easier for investors to bet on stock price declines before july investors typically had to wait until a stock was actually rising to bet on its downfall lots of selling can feed off itself prompting nervous investors to sell more which adds to volatility often heavily shorted stocks can be particularly volatile the old rule generally prohibited the shorting of a stock while its price was falling or experiencing a "downtick" in trader slang the rule was instituted after the market crash in order to discourage avalanches of short sales to push a particular stock or even the broader market precipitously lower in a traditional short sale investors borrow shares and sell them betting the price will fall and that they will be able to buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender short sellers are sometimes blamed for big rallies as well as stock declines during one recent july rally in intel corp shares some investors blamed the move on a frantic exit by short sellers who had thrown in the towel on their bets at the new york stock exchange traders pointed to the downtick rule on july when the dow jones industrial average sank points or to finish at but instead of complaining about the federal reserve the housing market or hedge funds one trader directed his ire at the fact that the s rule was recently revoked "appeal the repeal " he said walking across the floor with a handheld computer gary lahey a former chairman of the chicago board options exchange says its hard to quantify the added volatility given all the turmoil of late but there is no question it has had an impact "youre going to get more volatility because its easier to whack a stock " says mr lahey who nevertheless favors the rule change on the new york stock exchange seaport securities broker theodore weisberg agrees "they quietly changed the ground rules " says mr weisberg "theres no question its been an aphrodisiac for volatility " while short selling has been rising since early this year on the new york stock exchange some traders say the recent volatility has been caused by investors selling the stocks and bonds they own not establishing new short positions because of the rule change says jamie selway an executive at brokerage firm white cap trading still the chicago board options exchanges volatility benchmark known as the vix has risen since july when the rules governing bets on stock price declines or "short sales " were revised the vix gauge which measures the expected price volatility in blue chip stocks over the next month stands near a four year high after slipping a bit yesterday in recent years though proponents of abolishing the downtick rule argued that it had become obsolete in an era of electronic trading and new investment products that offer alternative ways to bet on stock declines for example an array of publicly traded options and futures contracts which can be used to bet on a price decline for shares prior to a set expiration date emerged in the last years outside the purview of the old short sales rule which applies only to stocks the sec spent two years looking at possibly scrapping the rule and decided that the move would have little impact on volatility and investors should be able to buy and sell when they want the sec voted in mid june to do away with the rule altogether in another sign that volatility has increased since july the average range for the dow jones industrial average the difference between its daily high and low level has increased to about points a day from points in the first six months of the year but ingrid werner a professor of finance at ohio state university that has studied the impact of the rule change says repealing of restrictions on new short sales should only have an impact on price movements over periods less than a half hour not the entire day "the repeal of the rule has nothing to do with the volatility we see on a day to day basis " she says the sec change is part of a broader set of rules changes that effect traders known as short sellers who bet stocks will fall some of the new rules will actually make it harder for them to complete a trade strategist howard simons of bianco research in chicago says the old short sale rules reflected investors traditional bias that stocks rise in value "i mean there was never any rule that said you could only buy" when the stock of a price was falling "so why did we need the opposite for shorts " says mr simons kara scannell contributed to this article
