energy gas gives oil giants a foot in middle easts door some places offer relative stability surging economies since the s major oil companies have been shut out of oil production in much of the middle east now the doors to foreign investment are opening again this time for natural gas last month the massive dolphin pipeline started moving gas from qatar to the united arab emirates where it will be used to generate electricity and feed a growing industrial base occidental petroleum corp based in los angeles and frances total sa own a quarter of the project each and booked substantial reserves the rest is owned by the u a e s national oil company meanwhile companies ranging from royal dutch shell plc russias oao lukoil holdings italys eni spa and china petroleum &amp chemical corp or sinopec are involved in consortia drilling for gas in saudi arabias rub al khali or empty quarter in the kingdoms vast interior earlier this year britains bp plc signed a gas exploration deal in oman for two large fields that have sat undeveloped because of their complexity since their discovery a decade ago several western companies are jockeying to participate in a &# billion project in the u a e to tap sour gas or gas with a lot of sulfur that has to be removed near abu dhabi companies on the short list include exxon mobil corp anglo dutch shell total bp conocophillips and occidental the growing trend gives big western energy companies opportunities to deploy their abundant cash and technology in a hydrocarbon rich region even as access to the worlds new reserves of oil and gas gets tougher longer term it could burnish their reputation with middle eastern companies and governments should their oil industries ever open up it also gives the western companies a toehold in a region growing by leaps and bounds economically and where countries that produce a lot of energy are increasingly consuming more as well another attraction is that many middle east nations have proven to be relatively stable despite war in iraq growing tensions with iran and the threat of terrorism governments there havent shown the nationalistic pushes seen in russia or venezuela and many have shown they can keep the peace "personally i think investing in the middle east is a hell of a lot safer than africa " says ray irani chairman and chief executive of occidental "in my opinion the political stability is a lot more certain in the middle east and the financial stability is there their honoring of contracts is exceptional " dr irani also says western oil companies cant afford to avoid the region "that is where the oil and gas" are he says about two of every three barrels of oil yet to be pumped from the ground are in the middle east he says he said last month on an earnings conference call that he was confident that the company would announce major new middle east projects before the end of the year the need for natural gas as a fuel for electricity there is increasing as is the desire to build more gas intensive industrial facilities such as petrochemical plants bringing on these gas projects in a timely fashion is an economic necessity for some countries says leila benali an associate director of cambridge energy research associates who focuses on the middle east and north africa thus countries such as the u a e qatar saudi arabia iran and bahrain some of which have shunned outside involvement since the s are seeking foreign partners to expedite production gas prices in the region are rising improving energy company returns in the early part of this decade gas sold for about &# a million british thermal units in the persian gulf mrs benali says today it can fetch between &# and &# a million btus still below european and u s prices qatar kicked off the trend in the late s when it decided to invite in foreign companies to help it develop the huge north field beneath the persian gulf and export it in the form of liquefied natural gas exxon and shell have helped design and build a massive qatar gas export program which increased that tiny nations gas output from billion cubic feet in to trillion cubic feet a decade later turning it into a global energy exporter exxon mobil the worlds largest non state controlled oil company by market value has benefited from its links with qatar earlier this year exxon reported that more than one third of its total reserves or the equivalent of billion barrels of oil that is economically and technically feasible to extract from the ground were in the middle east and asia five years ago the company had less than one sixth of its global reserves in the region outside of the middle east and asia exxons reserves have fallen significantly while the company doesnt break out its reserves locations more specifically it has acknowledged that a large chunk of the growth has come in qatar a wave of nationalization and appropriations swept across the middle east in the s western oil company concessions were reclaimed by national oil companies forcing exxon and others to relinquish valuable properties booted from the region with the globes largest oil reserves the western oil companies developed major discoveries in alaska the north sea and elsewhere but in recent years getting access to reserves has become a critical issue for western oil companies many reserves are now either off limits because of government policies or situated in nations with unstable political and fiscal regimes making long term investments difficult moreover a recent trend has been for oil rich countries to change contracts to increase the take for government coffers as problems have mounted elsewhere the middle east has begun to look like an attractive place for investment again "in the u a e or qatar there is less political risk than going to russia or venezuela where people have lost their assets " says amy myers jaffe associate director of the energy program at rice university in houston
