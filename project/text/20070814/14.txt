behind one effort to tap into indias water market kaikaluru india after draining this towns pool of drinking water recently cleaners found drowned rats and bloated lizards but at least as is common at other storage tanks across this parched land in eastern india there were no dead monkeys kaikalurus drinking water filtered through sand from a nearby pond is amber in color and alive with microbes even so a survey of the towns residents showed that half the people still prefer it to a sanitized version dispensed at a new store operated by a tiny orange county calif company waterhealth international inc "the old water is free " explains dhana lakshmi a year old mother and local resident daily she walks past waterhealths store to a community tap rather than pay less than half a penny for the companys five gallon jug of purified water ms lakshmi says her family of five earns about rupees a day or about cents per person most families that size go through about five gallons of water a day holdouts like ms lakshmi highlight the difficulty of diving into the potentially massive but messy business of selling clean water to poor people many have tried to help developing nations with their water problems few have come up with a way to profit from the effort but waterhealth led by its ghanaian born chief executive tralance addy believes it can do both mr addy the sixth of children used to wait in line at the village water tap when he was growing up in west africa today hes quickly expanding waterhealths business in india and other countries while eyeing big markets such as china and mexico "it doesnt surprise me that people would pay for clean water " says mr addy who retired in after more than two decades at johnson &amp johnson and is now a citizen of both ghana and the u s "it surprises me that people thought that they wouldnt " whether or not waterhealth succeeds in india the company could provide clues as to how nations tackle a prime public health concern contaminated water about indians die every year from diarrhea far more than in any other country according to the united nations human development report while the report notes other factors can cause the diarrhea "low levels of spending on water and sanitation surely contribute " despite one of the worlds fastest growing economies and a cutting edge technology sector india still struggles to distribute clean water in rural areas cow dung pesticides and human waste mix together in irrigation canals and seep into ground water last month indian prime minister manmohan singh acknowledged government failures to stem water borne diseases in asia about million people dont have access to safe drinking water or of the regions total population according to figures from the asia development bank the problems in developing countries have attracted those who see huge commercial potential in cleaning up water ge water &amp process technologies a unit of general electric co currently does about &# million in sales in india mostly catering to the clean water needs of industrial customers such as power plants but ge would like drinking water to help drive the business "well beyond &# million annually in the very near future " according to steve fludder a company vice president steps to overhaul water supply have met resistance though in for example a world bank proposal to hand over limited management of the new delhi municipal water board to a contractor provoked an outcry public interest groups alleged irregularities during a bidding process among consulting firms for the projects plan the world banks india country chief michael carter denied any wrongdoing the bank later backed away from the project "the right idea is to have the community control the water " said arvind kejriwal of parivaran an indian citizens group that opposed the world bank plan "the world bank is trying to promote privatization thats not the best model " many past efforts to provide purification equipment and train personnel for free havent worked says gangji reddy project director for chaitanya an indian organization that works on natural resource management issues poorly trained and sporadically paid technicians fail to maintain equipment leaving the door open for farmers who sell access to clean water at exorbitant prices waterhealth aims to step between the profiteers and nonprofit programs unlike much bigger multinationals waterhealth is also willing to stay small and rural even as its business grows in the state of andhra pradesh waterhealth currently operates about stores mostly through joint ventures with local governments an indian organization naandi foundation supports the venture by educating locals about the health benefits of clean water the company also operates in the philippines and ghana the joint venture model grew out of waterhealths earlier troubles of relying on sales of equipment to customers in other countries many of whom failed to maintain it after years battling insolvency waterhealth emerged from bankruptcy in thanks to mr addys orange county calif venture capital firm plebys international he took control of the company for &# million since restructuring waterhealth has attracted several big backers they include dow venture capital a unit of dow chemical co which has acquired about of the company for &# million international finance corp an arm of the world bank has kicked in &# million mr addy declines to provide sales and profit figures for the privately held company but one question is how waterhealth will be able to make enough money by selling water so cheaply in kaikaluru despite naandis survey showing that half the town prefers the community tap signs of the businesss potential are surfacing a summer morning crowd forms in front of waterhealths four taps mr addy shows how water at the store is filtered through a series of tanks before entering a plastic chamber inside a lamp administers a lethal dose of ultra violet light to remaining bacteria and viruses in a village outside kaikaluru a local leader laments that dirty water has driven up medical costs and caused kids to miss school mr addy listens but later says the village isnt big enough to support a waterhealth store maybe later the company might sell it smaller scale equipment its developing "you can have a soft heart in this business " he says "but you need a hard head "
