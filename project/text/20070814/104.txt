the daily fix answer to white sox woes isnt jenkss march to online edition on july bobby jenks blew his fifth game of the season and saw his season era rise to with their closer struggling the chicago white sox fell to games under and games out of first place since then mr jenks has been flawless hes tied a major league record by getting straight outs the equivalent of a perfect game and a half and saved eight games and the white sox are well theyre nine games under and games out of first place the cleveland indians and detroit tigers have been even worse in the interim not that thats much comfort that may help explain why hasnt yet received the notice of another recent baseball number another factor is the closers refusal to speak to the press until the streak is done so the columnists are writing about him without speaking to him "bobby jenks still only has gone from baseball survivor to savior surely the subject of a tv movie if the story werent so sappy " dave van dyck writes in the chicago tribune "he has been refined from reject put on waivers by the angels to record setter having tied jim barrs mark of straight batters retired all this has happened in a span of three years and he stopped along the way to pitch the final out of the world series " mr barr a former starting pitcher for the san francisco giants says he doesnt mind if mr jenks breaks his record a record that at the time he had no idea hed set "barr knew only that he had thrown two straight shutouts and that he hadnt let anybody on in awhile when bernie carbo doubled with two outs in the seventh inning " gwen knapp writes in the san francisco chronicle "then cardinals broadcaster jack buck invited the right hander onto the postgame radio show saying i think you broke a major league record barr was more confused than elated " phil rizzuto the new york yankees shortstop throughout the dynasties of the s and s that produced seven championships died this morning at "rizzuto was the common bond that linked generations of yankees players and fans beginning with his rookie season of and ending with his final year behind the microphone in " bob herzog writes in newsday "no yankee has ever had a longer day to day association with the club " mr herzog adds "rizzuto the announcer became more popular than rizzuto the player ever was he read fan mail and gave birthday greetings on the air he digressed when the games were boring often talking about non baseball topics in a hilarious manner " the fix will have more tributes to the hall of famer tomorrow lance armstrongs former cycling team is disbanding the u s based tailwind team just dropped by sponsor discovery channel had been hunting for a new sponsor after last months completion of the drug addled tour de france won by tailwind rider alberto contador then abruptly it quit the effort team spokesmen assured journalists the lack of sponsorship didnt fuel their decision in fact they said they thought cycling ills made it disingenuous to ask for sponsorship money andrew hood of the cycling site velonews provides some context "the sponsor hunt came in the midst of complicated challenges facing the sport " mr hood writes "teams such as t mobile slipstream and csc have introduced strict internal anti doping testing programs to assure to sponsors and fans their riders are racing clean other teams havent adopted the same strategy and theres been a bitter feud between the bigger european teams over which direction the future of the sport should take discovery channel hastily withdrew from the aigcp association of pro teams before the tour over the growing rift tailwinds decision to give up the hunt for sponsor comes on the heels of endorsements from european sponsors to stay with the sport t mobile gerolsteiner and milram have all reconfirmed their commitments to their respective contract agreements despite the battering the sport is taking in germany " tailwind co owned by armstrong can close its accounts with eight victories in the last nine tours and a clean drug testing record "although the team and armstrong have long been suspected of doping doubts that have dogged its most recent tour winner alberto contador its riders have never failed a drug test while in the jerseys of discovery channel or its predecessor u s postal service " samuel abt writes in the international herald tribune "a handful of its alumni including stars like tyler hamilton roberto heras and floyd landis have failed the tests with their next teams " bbc sports martin gough laments that discovery riders have reached the end of the road "they have provided a refreshing challenge to the continental hegemony improving methodology and tactics and putting a few noses out of joint along the way " mr gough writes "armstrong was responsible for the sport breaking into the consciousness of the american public bringing about a major tv deal and attracting thousands of his compatriots to alpine slopes each year " soccer detractors often cite the sports low scores and frequent ties it doesnt need to be this way paul gardner writes in the new york sun goalkeepers were written into the rules in the s and have expanded their role ever since among their vices according to mr gardner yelling at their own players sending high goal kicks that slow down the game and playing such a crucial role in the blight that is penalty kicks "the overall picture of the goalkeeper in the modern game is of a player who has simply gotten too big for his boots " mr gardner writes "certainly he is bigger than keepers used to be but the size of the goal has remained unchanged and the defenders in front of him are better organized than those of past years his dominant and negative influence on the game is an absurdity in a sport whose defining characteristic is a ban on the use of hands " des moines register columnist sean keeler immersed himself in the dirt for the knoxville nationals working in the pit crew for sprint car driver danny smith mr keeler mostly spends his time scraping and scrubbing and watching the smith crew members in action "when they converse they dont have to say much " mr keeler writes
