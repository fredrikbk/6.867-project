video surge divides web watchers pessimists say file swapping is creating traffic jam but optimists and a cisco report call fears overblown researchers have long warned that rapid increases in internet usage could strain the capacity of the data lines and gear that make up the network severely slowing traffic and even knocking out service for years theyve been wrong as internet access providers and telecom carriers have added routers and other hardware to keep ahead of demand and the data carrying capacity of the internet pipes has greatly expanded thanks to technical advances but could the doomsayers be right this time it depends on whom you ask prompting the latest concerns is the rapid growth of bandwidth hungry applications like online video file sharing programs and internet telephone service transmitting a minute of video can require times the bandwidth of audio or more depending on the quality already peer to peer video swapping most of it illegal is estimated to represent in the range of more than one third of all internet traffic this year u s internet video sites alone transmit more data per month than was carried over the entire u s internet backbone monthly in according to network gear maker cisco systems inc "one of the key possibilities for is that the internet could be approaching its capacity " analysts at deloitte touche tohmatsu wrote in a january report "our belief is well start to see some brownouts or service slowdowns or service issues " says phil asmundson the national managing partner leading deloitte &amp touche usas telecommunications practice but some analysts and internet companies such as google inc play down the idea that theres an impending crunch pointing to the forecasters poor track record of predicting such problems there are also political implications to the debate as part of the "network neutrality" scuffle in washington telecommunications companies say internet companies should help foot the bill for more data lines and equipment if theyre sending lots of video traffic at high speed to consumers one issue causing alarm is that access providers often dont have the gear in place to provide the bandwidth they promise to dsl or cable internet customers they practice oversubscription in the way airlines overbook planes with the expectation some people will fail to show up cable companies are particularly susceptible because their network design shares bandwidth among neighbors allowing a few internet users to degrade service by using more than their fair share some warn that new applications from start ups and media companies using peer to peer technology to transmit tv shows online could increase any strain if they prove popular telephone companies face another challenge many own networks that are a hodgepodge of older equipment much of which is inefficient at handling new forms of traffic like video there are some other potentially critical spots such as the points where data traffic from undersea lines and other big data pipes converge deloitte &amp touches mr asmundson says major internet hubs could struggle with the increases still many say fears of significant strain are overblown eve griliches telecom analyst at research firm idc says five years ago analysts and engineers voiced concerns but the result was a surge of innovation "it feels like we are hyping again " she says "when we did this before we found intelligent ways to handle problems with bandwidth " some of that innovation is now coming from network equipment makers such as cisco systems the san jose calif company is expected to release new research findings today that predict internet infrastructure capacity will keep up with traffic for the foreseeable future cisco and others are producing new gear aimed at better managing internet traffic by prioritizing which bits of data are transmitted across the network that contrasts with older equipment which fulfilled a more basic task of moving vast amounts of data between countries and cities in its research cisco says consumer video will be responsible for a significant portion of the internet based traffic increases from to with video streaming and downloads increasing from of all consumer internet traffic last year to in but the traffic generally isnt enough to overwhelm service providers cisco concludes googles youtube the most popular u s video sharing site in terms of the number of views represents only about of north american consumer internet traffic it estimates network operators and access providers are "staying ahead of the curve " says paul bosco vice president for video and broadband initiatives at cisco high quality video delivered over the internet to play on tv sets is a major wild card if consumers begin downloading massive amounts of high definition movies and tv shows that could start clogging the so called last mile connections to homes and the large size of such video files means that jams can occur even if not many people are accessing them about hours of high definition video represent as much traffic as one million email messages vinton cerf googles chief internet evangelist says changes in usage will help address the issue "i believe people will get quite comfortable saying i want the following movies to watch and there will be systems online that will take care of scheduling and downloading and putting it on your hard drive " he says most involved in the debate acknowledge the perils of any predictions robert metcalfe a venture capitalist at polaris venture partners who helped build the early internet as an engineer in a magazine column warned of a "catastrophic collapse" of the internet in he vowed to eat his words if it didnt come to pass there were some service outages but mr metcalfe eventually conceded he was wrong at a conference he put his column in a blender with liquid and slurped it down in front of the audience today mr metcalfe thinks online video traffic could cause slowdowns in internet service for consumers but that could lead them to use online video less resulting in a sort of equilibrium "ive been talking about the next big internet thing the video internet for years now " he says "see some of my predictions do come true "
