business technology talking tech street smart google boosts map features the internet has changed everything including a casual stroll down the street something that for increasingly large parts of the country you now dont need to get out of bed to do google maps has a new feature called street view which contains block by block photographs that you can view one after another just as though you were going for a walk the service debuted in may and last week expanded to two more cities stephen chau product manager for street view gives a tour of the new way to take tours q what exactly is street view a in the past weve shown aerial imagery in google maps this is an extension of that street view allows users to view and navigate with degree street level imagery this allows users to understand an area in a way they couldnt possibly before q how does it work a click the street view button in the upper right hand corner of google maps and youll see camera icons in the cities where we have coverage san francisco los angeles san diego houston denver las vegas miami orlando and new york zoom in and youll see blue highlights over roads where we have imagery available click on any of these blue streaks and you will be looking at a view of that location you can rotate degrees and move from one panorama to another youre virtually moving down the street q it sounds cool but is there any practical use for it a users are finding very interesting uses for this imagery for example you can augment driving directions with images previewing the route before you actually drive it if google maps is telling me to make a right hand turn at an intersection i can preview the intersection to see what it looks like or if i am going to meet someone i can zoom into a particular location for example a park bench and say "lets meet here " people are also using it for visual search i recently moved to a new neighborhood in san francisco and so i walk by neighborhoods that im not familiar with its very common to walk by a restaurant i want to check out only to forget the name of the restaurant by the time i get home but now i go back and virtually walk up and down the street to find the restaurants name q how do you take the pictures a we have vehicles with custom equipment on top and we drive down public roads the imagery is coming from two sources in san francisco and san diego where we have high resolution imagery the images are taken by google we are also licensing imagery from a third party provider immersive media q how many pictures do you take on each block a an average measurement of the spacing between our pictures is about meters feet q what about the privacy concerns that some people have expressed a the images are those taken from public roads so its not unlike what you would see walking down the street on any given day that being said there is an easily accessible way for users to flag imagery that they think may be inappropriate objectionable imagery for example nudity is one case if you find a picture of yourself and you would like that image removed we will remove it we understand that users are concerned about some of these images and we take privacy seriously
