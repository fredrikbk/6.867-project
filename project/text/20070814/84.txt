politics &amp economics in liberia an army unsullied by past u s helps african nation build military without ties to atrocities of its civil war careysburg liberia new army recruits here have to pass a literacy test an aptitude test a drug test and an hiv test and then there is the war crimes test after years of civil war liberia is getting a military built from scratch as soon as enlistees sign up their photos go on posters to be distributed around the west african nation to determine if they took part in the atrocities that marked the bloody conflict with former president charles taylor in the dock in the hague for alleged war crimes and a new elected president ellen johnson sirleaf firmly in place the u s is helping rebuild liberia with which it has long had close ties as a start washington has pledged to vet recruit train equip and house a man military a project estimated to cost about &# million including the rehabilitation of three military bases officials believe having a well trained professional army will be a stabilizing and unifying influence to help avoid violence one way to do this is to bar those who took part in the excesses of the last war "these are potential recruits " the enlistment posters say "if you know that any of these people were involved in human rights violations or criminal activity call the investigation hotline " "were not going to spend u s taxpayer money on someone who may be a war criminal or violator of human rights " says u s army maj chris wyatt chief of the office of defense cooperation at the u s embassy in monrovia the capital the u s took a similar approach in such places as haiti and el salvador trying to weed out recruits guilty of human rights violations the old army was hopelessly tainted by cronyism and factionalism mixed in among the soldiers were some of liberias former militia fighters infamous for hacking shooting raping and pillaging their way through liberia from to both the new authorities and their u s advisers thought it prudent to start all over the u s finished demobilizing the old army last year offering severance payments of &# to &# based on rank and length of service not everyone was happy with the arrangement in april demobilized soldiers upset over back pay assaulted the ministry of national defense headquarters armed with machetes and molotov cocktails to fend off the attack defense minister brownie samukai called in nigerian peacekeepers attached to the united nations troops still stationed here after the war now outside the ministry building the nigerians park two low slung white armored personnel carriers marked "u n " in big black letters early this year mr samukai also dismantled his entire ministry forty of the civilian officials in fact were ghosts dead or imaginary bureaucrats whose salaries were being funneled to someone else the remaining staff members were given severance packages and allowed to reapply for their old jobs u s military contractor dyncorp international inc is in charge of vetting army applicants ranking them by merit and providing basic training ultimately each recruit must get final approval from a three member review panel that includes maj wyatt the first class of graduated from boot camp in november but the u s was slow to come up with the promised funding and not until last month was the next group of invited to report for training by then they had been waiting for so long to be called off the priority list that about a quarter declined forcing dyncorp to dig deeper down the rankings "its no secret that the process has been slow " mr samukai says it is typical these days for the u s to farm out foreign armies training to contractors and the minister has nothing but praise for the american sergeants who train his men but he accuses dyncorp of wasting money congress appropriated to help liberia in particular he criticizes the company for spending &# to renovate a rented building it used as an office and residence a dyncorp spokeswoman said she couldnt confirm the cost of the renovation but to save money the u s state department has ordered dyncorp to give up the lease and move to one of the refurbished military bases maj wyatt said mr samukai also complains that he feels sidelined from the formation of an army that as defense minister he is supposed to oversee neither the state department nor dyncorp will let him see the companys contract for instance and the u s insists that instead of talking directly to dyncorp managers he go through maj wyatt on all matters related to the training "we dont know what the terms of the contract are so theres no way i can evaluate how theyre performing " mr samukai says adding "im tired of asking" for a copy maj wyatt says he would happily field any questions the minister might have but he isnt at liberty either to give mr samukai a copy of the dyncorp contract or to allow direct communication between the ministry and the company those says maj wyatt are the rules dyncorp runs boot camp in careysburg about an hour outside monrovia the contractor has refurbished a large training hall installed living quarters with bunk beds put up an obstacle course set up rifle and rocket propelled grenade ranges and created a hand grenade training area across the way are dummies made of old tires for bayonet drills "we teach them how to parry how to slash how to lunge " says training director spike roberts a year old former u s marine sergeant major the drill instructors are former u s army and marine corps sergeants who teach the recruits everything from combat tactics to how to take a shower head first and work your way down on their second day at boot camp the recruits put on black shorts gray t shirts and new balance running shoes line up at wooden tables and are issued a duffle full of new gear "why are you scratching your face if youre supposed to be at attention " julian jaramillo a former u s marine sergeant demands of one hapless recruit if he thinks the classs attention is wandering mr jaramillo screams "eyeballs " the recruits respond "yes sir " and fix their bewildered gaze on him it is the same spittle in the face treatment u s recruits get "you wouldnt be able to tell the difference between someone who comes out of fort jackson or fort campbell from someone who comes out of here " mr roberts says recruit venus dean a year old university of liberia graduate had wanted to be a social worker but she sees the army as another way to help her country recover from its trauma "i love liberia and i want to make a change for my country " she says she also admits her enlistment was strongly influenced by seeing the demi moore movie "g i jane " one of her boot camp classmates year old karmoh duke freeman served years in the old army he was mustered out as a captain during the purge and now wants back in "the fabric of the army went down the drain " he says "the new structure will work well have the merit system " the fact that every soldier must pass basic training and start out as a private means that for now liberias is a strangely leaderless army the only general is a nigerian two star who wears a liberian flag on one shoulder and a nigerian flag on the other there are no colonels majors or captains but those will come later when the recruits prove themselves and qualify for officer training programs based on their performance nine recruits from the first graduating class have been selected to be lieutenants and five of them have been sent to the u s for instruction
