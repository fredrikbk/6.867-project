do pills have a place in cancer prevention nci decision to cancel trial of breast cancer drug ignites controversy over priorities a major study of a drug that could reduce a womans risk for breast cancer has been canceled by the national cancer institute raising questions about the future of using pills to prevent the disease the trial called stellar which stands for study to evaluate letrozole and raloxifene was to be the third in a series of landmark breast cancer prevention trials conducted by the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project a well regarded research group that gets most of its funding from the nci the nsabp based in pittsburgh has enrolled more than women and men in clinical trials involving breast and colorectal cancer and its studies in the past have had a significant impact on the course of breast cancer treatment the stellar study would have answered questions about letrozole a drug made by novartis ag that is already approved to treat breast cancer but is also believed to lower risk for the disease by more than based on a statistical analysis of the drugs impact in cancer treatment letrozole may offer better protection for high risk women and less severe or different side effects than other prevention drugs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene the study was to be funded with &# million from the nci a &# million grant from novartis and free drugs from both novartis and raloxifene maker eli lilly &amp co but the ncis director john niederhuber has said that the agencys funds would be better spent identifying genetic and other markers to determine women at highest risk for the disease rather than focusing on giving preventive pills to a broader group of women including healthy ones who may never need them the nci press office declined a request to interview dr niederhuber the agency instead provided copies of letters sent to the trial investigators and pennsylvania sen arlen specter who had inquired about the study explaining dr niederhubers views one concern of the nci is that these drugs cause serious side effects tamoxifen the only drug currently approved to prevent breast cancer also increases uterine cancer risk another drug raloxifene is currently approved to treat osteoporosis and may soon win food and drug administration approval for breast cancer prevention the drug has far fewer side effects than tamoxifen but can still cause hot flashes and blood clots in a letter to sen specter dr niederhuber said that the evidence suggests healthy women dont want to take on the risks of breast cancer prevention drugs previous studies of breast cancer prevention drugs yielded "valuable information " he wrote but "failed to change the practice of breast cancer prevention among women and their health care providers perhaps because of the side effects of these drugs " study investigators have appealed the trials cancellation to national institutes of health director elias zerhouni the final decision could have a significant impact on research into breast cancer prevention drugs thats because its unlikely other investigators will invest the time or resources to propose other studies on chemoprevention drugs if the nci decision is upheld researchers say supporters of the stellar trial say the canceled research would have yielded valuable blood and other samples from nearly high risk women further aiding the effort to identify markers for breast cancer it also would have answered key questions about the benefits and risks of letrozole and raloxifene to help women make more informed decisions nsabp chairman norman wolmark says that many women at high risk for breast cancer would willingly take on other health risks like osteoporosis which can be treated if it will lower their risk for cancer "were so passionate in our belief this is an extremely useful trial that will benefit women " says dr wolmark who is also chairman of oncology at the drexel university school of medicine "we think an injustice has been done to women by canceling the trial " in its appeal letter to nih director zerhouni the nsabp said that the cancer institutes director was "acting unilaterally" and that the decision to cancel the trial "represents a dangerous and unjustified departure" from the agencys traditional review process the appeal was "highly unusual" because the nsabp has a nearly year relationship with the nci which is the primary source of its funding says kirsten goldberg editor and publisher of the washington based cancer letter which tracks cancer research and funding drug firms typically provide free drugs or additional funding for nsabp trials the nsabp has had a notable impact on breast cancer treatment for instance the groups research led to the standard use of lumpectomy instead of radical mastectomy and its star trial study of tamoxifen and raloxifene showed that the drugs can lower risk of breast cancer among high risk women by or more that study led to a july fda committee recommendation that raloxifene sold now as the bone drug evista be approved for breast cancer prevention the stellar trial has been in the works since fall and had won approval from the ncis division of cancer prevention and the agencys executive committee but as the study was about to begin dr niederhuber stopped it saying the agency wanted to review it further in june the nci said it wouldnt fund the study after hearing reports from an expert panel convened by dr niederhuber the medical journal lancet noted in a recent editorial that it was "troubling" that the nci director stepped in to halt a trial that had been given "high marks" by seven nci committees including its top executive committee "an independent investigation into how the decision was made and whether it was made fairly is warranted " the lancet wrote the nci declined to comment about the lancet editorial "ultimately dr niederhuber got the best scientific advice and acted on it " said an nci spokesman in an email "he feels nci now needs to move to a position of leadership in prevention for the next decade utilizing genomics whole genome scans rapid sequencing and sub cellular imaging the challenge is to accurately determine risk and match the many considerations about interventions with that risk in other words we need to find markers and match risk with the appropriate level of intervention patients are often not willing to trade healthy lives for side effects associated with interventions unless they are convinced they know the risk " the national breast cancer coalition says it supports the ncis decision to focus on studies to develop better ways of predicting who is at risk for breast cancer "we are very concerned about the approach of treating healthy women with drugs that are toxic in order to reduce the risk for very few who benefit " says carolina hinestrosa nbcc executive vice president if the stellar trial doesnt go forward its unlikely letrozole will ever be approved for breast cancer prevention because such a study is simply too expensive for the private sector "we want to quantify the benefit and quantify the risk so women can make objective choices about their own care " says nsabp associate chairman lawrence wickerham "without this trial that sort of information wont be available " study aims the "stellar" study canceled by the national cancer institute in june was designed to study the drugs raloxifene and letrozole for the prevention of breast cancer in high risk but healthy postmenopausal women compare the side effects and benefits of both medications
