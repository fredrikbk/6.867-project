mont in his off hours he invests with borrowed money shorts stocks and has taken a complex options position called a "short strangle" on wheat he has been trying to bulletproof his portfolio against sudden market declines using investment tools usually associated with hedge funds and banks but rather than protecting his &# million or so in holdings the year old physician says he left it vulnerable "things that should have protected me werent working " dr abbott says of the market in recent weeks "everything was seeming to go down " a growing number of nonprofessional investors have sought protection from market drops such as the dow jones industrial averages fall during the bear market of to wall streets financial engineers have devised a wealth of products to help main street investors diversify or hedge like the pros as a result many ordinary investors have shifted toward foreign stocks and currencies or "market neutral" funds that are supposed to be steadier than ordinary mutual funds theyre dabbling in commodities futures and short selling an investment bet that pays off if shares decline now these small investors are facing the same problems as wall street pros many of the hedges arent working as they expected in the past month the market has been behaving in ways even seasoned players have been at a loss to explain first the sagging housing market

mutual fund trade association traditionally u s investors almost always have put much more money into u s stock funds the yen for foreign investment has also been stimulated by a host of new exchange

individuals tended to limit themselves to stocks and bonds stocks to provide capital gains and bonds for steady income but the stock craze of the s and the advent of online investing changed that for many people now amateur investors can easily trade not only u s stocks but also options futures and etfs like most investors in the s ed chambless a retired airline pilot and a former marine officer had much of his money in u s stocks the powerful bull market made it seem unnecessary even foolish to invest heavily abroad but the long bear market took a big bite out of his familys savings and made him wary after he sold his atlanta home and some other property in augusta ga in mr chambless invested the proceeds from those sales more internationally and in a wider variety of more sophisticated investments to protect against another sell off around that time he attended an extravagant investment trade event in las vegas the money show aimed at individual investors he was impressed with a presentation about growing global demand for commodities "with china and india coming on line theyre going to need a lot of stuff " the year old now in denton texas recalls thinking mr chambless bought a natural resources mutual fund and another that tracked commodities he added a precious metals fund and scooped up some individual mining stocks like newmont mining corp and northgate minerals corp and the russian energy company yukos worried that u s government spending would be a long term drag on the dollar he bought certificates of deposit for the australian and new zealand dollars he also invested in a japanese real estate investment trust "i try obviously to be diversified " he says his record has been one of slow but steady appreciation his &# savings from is around &# million today over the past four weeks hes seen his portfolio reduced by &# he believes hes positioned to ride out this current market slide though he wishes hed have kept a bit more of his money in cash with so many investments to track now hes not sure which ones tumbled the most during the recent turmoil "thats something i probably ought to know " mr chambless says "right now it seems like everything is sort of going down " barron segar who works in atlanta for a nonprofit group says he has been shocked at the losses in an investment that he thought would be a conservative way to hedge against risk to help stabilize his portfolio mr segar says he put about of his portfolio into tfs market neutral fund market neutral funds buy stocks and also engage in short selling in an effort to show gains in both up and down markets mr segar chose the tfs fund as an alternative to a bond mutual fund in the late s he had about of his portfolio in conservative investments such as bond funds and cash but as bond yields fell in recent years he looked for alternatives the tfs fund is down for the three months through aug the decline has made mr segar rethink his decision and he has withdrawn some money "this fund has done worse than my aggressive growth fund " mr segar says richard gates a co manager of the fund says in the markets recent turmoil both the funds regular stock investments and short positions were hit simultaneously he points to the funds long term track record up an average annualized since inception in september according to the tfs web site financial planner reed rinderknecht says that in the past to months investors have asked questions about everything from etfs to the short and long funds they read about in electronic newsletters or on brokerage web sites "we see people shooting themselves in the foot all the time " says mr rinderknecht a partner at foster group a fee only financial planning firm in west des moines iowa that specializes in broadly diversified long term investments "a little information can be deadly because people know just enough to get themselves in trouble " pitfalls abound even for experts short selling is considered riskier than standard stock investing because it involves borrowing stock and selling it the broker that lends the stock can demand its return before the investor has made a profit if a stock rises more than the short investor can lose more than of his investment which isnt possible with a simple stock purchase whats more stocks generally rise when the economy is growing so a short seller must act at just the right time something even experts have trouble doing commodities options and futures are risky meanwhile because those markets can swing sharply and because the trading accounts involved often use borrowed money foreign stock markets particularly those of developing countries can be more volatile than u s markets investors can also find it be challenging to obtain information about them james hayden of

with the rest in five mutual funds not all of the investors are bleeding for his part dr abbott of great falls figures that his portfolio is still up about overall for the year thanks mostly to bond holdings even so he says he may have gotten in too deep until last year he invested in ordinary stocks as well as stock and bond mutual funds and dabbled modestly in more arcane investments he made a big push to diversify last year after the summers market volatility "it made me want to smooth things out a bit performance wise " dr abbott says now investing online through six accounts he has been trading in and out of funds with names such as the ultrashort qqq proshares etf which aims to move twice as much as and in the opposite direction to large nasdaq stocks he owns the american century
