the patent reform act infringes on innovation in his july commentary "patent nonsense " bruce sewell general counsel of intel paints a dire picture of the united states patent system in broad strokes with little supporting data as he posits the patent reform act of as the solution for all of the problems of "innovation " mr sewell describes our patent system as being "outpaced by the swift evolution of technology and commerce " it is interesting to note that the biotechnology pharmaceutical and medical devices industries centers of tremendous breakthrough invention all oppose this so called "reform" measure major universities including the presidents of every big ten university and the university of california system also oppose this bill the national venture capital association no stranger to innovative technologies has said the current legislation "could put in jeopardy the existing supports necessary for entrepreneurial risk " in fact this reform bill is the brainchild of a small group of very large computer technology companies including microsoft intel and oracle it is not coincidental that each of these companies has been a defendant in an antitrust suit they rely upon market power to maintain their dominant positions and are serial patent infringers the patent reform act is "almost everything an infringer could ever want " says phil johnson chief patent attorney for johnson &amp johnson the value of intellectual property in the u s has been estimated at &# trillion more than the gross domestic product of any other country if congress grants an open season on patents here what message will be sent to china and other countries where piracy of intellectual property runs rampant david p vandagriff vice president intellectual property helius inc lindon utah i just wish patent "reformers" like bruce sewell would stop representing the "swinging method" patent as the poster child of patent abuse isnt there a more concrete serious and systemic problem to which reformers can point they probably can and i wish they would we can conclude that the handful of &# million plus damage awards mr sewell alludes to are attributable to the real worth of the case and not the questionable validity of the patents being litigated in those cases infringers and remember a court has already determined they are infringers selling hundreds of millions or billions in infringing products will naturally pay higher damages than in earlier times we can and should modernize the patent law and conform it more closely to the best features of other industrialized countries patent systems that might include some form of opposition proceeding but it seems a disservice to spin this as a need for "reform" as if the entire system has run amok the pharma and biotech industries have a polar opposite view to that of the electronics and information systems industries on this topic james f mckeown falls church va
