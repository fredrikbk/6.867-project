steels latest hot spot the u s strong demand transportation costs spur capacity additions the global steel industry is on the hunt for homes for a new generation of steel mills low cost places like ukraine russia brazil and india stand to benefit from investments to satisfy the worlds growing appetite for steel also set to benefit the u s this month big construction machinery is felling trees and leveling the earth outside mobile ala to make way for a acre stainless and carbon steel mill being built by germanys thyssenkrupp ag the &# billion mill which is expected to be up and running by will make and process million tons of steel making it the largest new steel facility built in the u s in the past four decades according to the american iron and steel institute a trade group next month another new steel mill severcorr a minimill operator outside columbus miss will start melting its own steel for the first time severcorr a joint venture between russian steelmaker oao severstal and a team of american steel executives aims to produce million tons annually indian steelmaker essar steel holdings ltd a unit of essar global ltd announced in april that it plans to build a new integrated steel mill just outside duluth minn the company which just purchased some iron ore deposits in the region says that it will use that iron ore to make million tons of steel slab by "the u s is a great place to build steel mills " says peter marcus of world steel dynamics a research group this latest wave of steel investment by both foreign and domestic companies represents a long term bet on the health of the u s steel market and its manufacturing sector as a whole it also carries potential benefits for everybody from appliance makers to auto companies which have seen their bottom lines pressured by surging steel prices and might welcome more supplies growing steel consumption from rapidly developing countries like china and india has upended the world market dynamic in past years amid a world wide steelmaking glut the worlds steelmakers would send excess supplies to the u s where steel typically fetched higher prices hurting domestic manufacturers today the worlds steelmakers have a greater array of customers willing to pay more for steel of various qualities rising transportation and fuel costs also have spurred many foreign steelmakers to look for other markets the u s has for decades been able to produce about or so of the steel americans demand traditionally the slack was made up with imports but the keys to attracting foreign steel were low transportation costs and consistently higher prices relative to the rest of the world but thats all changed now says aldo mazzaferro steel analyst for goldman sachs "this is one of the few times where steel prices outside the u s are higher than in the u s " he says "it is cyclical but it has lasted this way longer than anyone thought " hot rolled and cold rolled steel is generally fetching about &# to &# or so more a ton in western europe than in the u s according to world steel dynamics couple that with transportation costs which have more than doubled in the past decade to about &# &# a ton from &# a ton and it makes shipping steel to the u s less attractive meanwhile building in the u s has advantages beyond lower transportation costs as u s manufacturing has become more sophisticated and customized steel customers are demanding more technically challenging products that fetch higher profit margins some of the coming capacity additions come from integrated steel mills the traditional type that often use steelmaking ingredients like iron ore and coal two minerals easily found in the u s other developed nations like germany which has high labor costs or japan which has high energy costs are seen as bad bets for new steel mills says mr marcus of world steel dynamics severcorrs chief executive officer john correnti said business is good in the u s because business is good in europe china and japan as long as steel demand globally remains strong the u s will be a good place to build and sell steel he says severcorrs project involves a mini mill which is powered by electricity rather than coal and often depends on scrap steel as a raw material the severcorr minimill hopes to break the lock that integrated steel mills have in the automotive grade steel market steel used in exposed car parts needs to have a high iron content to make it durable strong and more resistant to warping it is a lucrative market often offering a to premium in prices currently minimills are unable to make that kind of steel car makers use steel from integrated steel mills mostly in the midwest and also import some severcorr built its mill in the southeast where about four million of the million autos assembled in north america annually are put together according to harbour consulting a detroit firm that tracks automobile manufacturing mr correnti says that once running his mill will have a transportation price advantage over the midwest and foreign mills the thyssenkrupp mill under construction in alabama was also conceived to compete with imports and midwest mills it is partly a minimill that will make carbon steel and partly a stainless steel mill that will process slabs from thyssenkrupps operations in brazil stainless steel is used in the manufacturing of appliances and autos thyssenkrupp the second largest steel producer by production in europe behind mittal steel co is trying to capture high end stainless steel customers in the u s where it is now a small player "we want to get a share of this market we see tremendous growth opportunities here " says christian koening spokesman for thyssenkrupps u s operations the company says it is banking on u s stainless growth rates of about annually through
