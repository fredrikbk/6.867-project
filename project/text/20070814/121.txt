u s takes look at hedge funds and a tax perk offshore affiliates lend like banks but exploit murky area of the law u s lawmakers are examining yet another tax perk enjoyed by hedge funds many of these funds lend money like banks but unlike traditional lenders often dont pay u s taxes on the profits hedge funds which control liquid pools of capital with little regulatory oversight are a growing presence in the lending business they increasingly take part in lending syndicates with traditional banks often indirectly and also make direct loans frequently to riskier or smaller companies that may have difficulty obtaining traditional financing indeed the additional liquidity provided by hedge funds has helped contribute to the boom of easy credit that is now coming to a halt but many hedge funds have found clever ways to avoid paying u s corporate income taxes on the profits from this business they do this by using offshore affiliates and transactions designed to take advantage of a murky area in the tax law that differentiates between lending and investing activities while some tax lawyers contend that these types of transactions are proper others argue that many variants are legally dubious and that tax laws should be changed to clarify what is permissible it isnt clear how much the current tax treatment of hedge fund lending could be costing the u s treasury but it is likely in the billions of dollars the senate finance committee is examining whether the current tax treatment is correct and whether the law needs to be changed according to a senate tax aide also the internal revenue service and treasury department seem to be taking notice the issue of taxes paid by foreign entities engaged in lending was raised last year for the first time in the agencys "priority guidance plan " which sets out new topics that the irs and treasury department believe require attention it was included again in this years plan released yesterday inclusion in the plan doesnt necessarily indicate that the irs or treasury plans to take any enforcement or regulatory action on a topic the senate examination is part of a broader look by congress into the taxes paid by hedge funds and private equity firms under current law private equity firms pay no taxes only the partners owe taxes congress now is considering bills that would tax publicly traded financial services partnerships at the same rate paid by corporations lawmakers also are looking at "carried interest " the bulk of the compensation received by private equity fund managers and are considering a bill to tax it at ordinary income rates of as much as compared with its current treatment at the capital gains rate of the structures used by hedge funds to avoid u s taxes on lending activities take a variety of forms but here is how one common structure works under american tax law a foreign company with employees in the u s that makes loans in the u s generally owes federal corporate income taxes on the profits but the law also says that if a foreign company is merely a passive investor or trader as opposed to being actively engaged in a "trade or business" it doesnt owe any taxes on that income so after making a loan many domestic hedge funds wait between and days a so called seasoning period then sell the loan to an offshore sister fund as a result the continuing profits from the loan are converted from taxable lending income onshore into tax free investment income offshore by letting several months pass before transferring the loan offshore which gives rise to the term "season and sell " the hedge funds contend that the offshore fund isnt involved in the actual business of making a loan even if the onshore fund and offshore fund are managed by the same people according to people that have worked on such deals the use of such a structure allows foreign investors and other nontaxable investors in the offshore fund like universities pension plans and endowments to reap the benefit of investment returns that are boosted by avoiding the u s corporate income tax in addition congress is examining the increasing role of hedge funds in loan syndication deals where banks make a loan and then sell off slices of it to offload the risk hedge funds and other nontraditional investors bought up &# billion or of noninvestment grade syndicated loans in the first half of up from of such deals in according to standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data often offshore hedge funds purchase slices of the loans shortly after the syndication deal is completed generally waiting hours before taking over responsibility for their slice of the loan by waiting that time period the funds argue that they arent actually lenders but merely foreign investors or traders purchasing loans in the secondary market and thus not taxable collateralized loan obligations or clos also take part in such syndicated loan deals this way often with the same tax benefit the issue of when offshore income should be taxed could be particularly contentious for another reason if tax authorities determine that the lending business is taxable by the u s it could draw all of the offshore funds income into the u s tax system many tax professionals complain the law in this area is vague so some essentially make up rules as they go along
