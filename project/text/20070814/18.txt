another big recall may hit mattel latest incident from china involves cars magnet toys more pressure on factories mattel inc is close to announcing its second big recall of chinese made toys in as many weeks according to people familiar with the matter expanding a mounting crisis for the toy maker that could grow even more problematic as the holiday shopping season approaches mattel earlier recalled more than a million toys including ones based on characters from sesame street and nickelodeon that may have been tainted with lead paint now people briefed on the matter say it will recall possibly hundreds of thousands of more items one of the recalled items is a die cast car that may contain lead paint other items involve toys with magnets that can be harmful to children if swallowed the items involved in the new recall may come from different factories than the plant that made toys involved in the first recall according to these people the magnet related recall is expected to involve several years worth of the affected toy a person familiar with the matter said mattel didnt return calls seeking comment the consumer product safety commission had no comment magnet issues surfaced recently in another toy recall in the cpsc issued a similar recall for million "magnetix" sets a toy produced by rose art industries inc of livingston n j the sets consisted of tiny magnets that if swallowed by an infant bonded together in the stomach and caused fatal intestinal perforation in at least one instance the cpsc documented incidents involving the magnets including one death and four serious injuries a month old boy died after he swallowed pieces that twisted his small intestine and created a blockage "the possibility of a new recall has been discussed within the industry since last week " said chris byrne an independent toy analyst based in new york the emergence of a second recall is bad news for mattel which has so far weathered the bad news with little damage to its share price the company announced a &# million charge to its second quarter earnings related to the first recall but more bad news is likely to hurt as parents begin to think about toys for the coming holiday season news of the second recall which was previously reported by the associated press comes as an owner of a chinese toy factory at the center of the recall earlier this month reportedly committed suicide just days after mattel identified his company as the manufacturer while it is unclear whether cheung shu hungs suicide is linked to the recall the incident is likely to be seen as a tragic symbol of the mounting pressure chinese manufacturers face to improve their operations in the wake of recent high profile product recalls mr cheung an owner of hong kong based lee der industrial co killed himself saturday at his factorys warehouse in chinas southern guangdong province according to an official at the public security bureau in guangzhou last week china announced that lee ders factory was prohibited from exporting products and was under investigation chinese manufacturers often suffer serious fallout when problems emerge that endanger their relationship with big customers those customers pull orders and factories are often forced to cut jobs this year huang xing light manufacturing came under siege when labor activists accused it of underpaying and mistreating employees the shenzhen factory which made disney souvenirs for a japanese company under a license agreement with walt disney co was forced to shut down after it lost most of its business the sudden reaction catches some chinese partners unused to the international spotlight by surprise said m eric johnson a professor at dartmouths tuck school of business who conducts research on chinese factories factory owners "suddenly realize theyve stepped on a third rail " he said "next theyre losing face badly in the government business structure theyre shamed to everybody and then suddenly its like game over for these guys " in the case of the mattel recall pressure had built on all of the el segundo calif toy companys chinese partners to give some guarantee that another damaging incident wouldnt occur on the heels of the current one after the recall was announced the company flew a delegation to china to meet with manufacturers said a mattel spokesperson last week factory owners were asked to gather in a room where jim walter mattels senior vice president of world wide quality assurance reiterated basic safety standards the attendees were required to sign a new safety contract "they needed to reaffirm what they had agreed to in previous years " said the spokesperson while in china senior mattel executives also met with chinese government officials to discuss the recall according to a person in the industry who has been in contact with mattel employees mattel employees said chinese officials were upset that the american companys toy recall had disgraced the name of china according to the person in the past mattel has had difficulty getting factory owners to fall in line according to reports from the new york based international center for corporate accountability an audit conducted by the center of mattel factories in for example reported that manufacturers had balked in responding to mattels orders to reduce overtime and reimburse workers for job related medical expenses prof johnson at dartmouth has witnessed similar tensions in a case study he visited a planned facility in guangzhou that would produce matchbox cars for mattel mattel he said had difficulty in persuading its chinese partner to build employee housing a requirement the partner had deemed unnecessary he said buyers may be able to thoroughly enforce outside standards in china only by having their own people working and living at facilities not by simply conducting the periodic audits that many smaller toy makers have come to rely on meanwhile chinese suppliers and the companies that supply them face price pressure to keep their own costs competitive a factor that manufacturers say encourages them to cut corners such as by using less expensive lead paint rather than a product that meets international safety standards executives at lee der a longtime mattel supplier told chinese government officials last week it may have been cheated by its own paint supplier an employee at lee ders office in hong kong declined to comment yesterday on mr cheungs death news of mr cheungs suicide was reported in southern metropolis daily a chinese newspaper it is unclear what other companies used lee der to manufacture their products hasbro inc of pawtucket r i one of the worlds largest toy and game manufacturers at one point sourced at least one product from lee der but has since stopped a spokesperson for hasbro said without providing details mr cheung owned a stake in lee der industrial co when it was incorporated in hong kong in september according to hong kong government records his business partner at the time chiu kwei tsun owned the other stake it was unclear if they were still working together mr chiu couldnt be reached for comment mr cheungs family was unavailable for comment mattel said in a statement on mr cheungs death yesterday it was "saddened to hear about this tragic news "
