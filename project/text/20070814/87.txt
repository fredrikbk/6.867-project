politics &amp economics recent india floods spotlight myriad challenges disaster stirs calls for transparency help for rural poor new delhi south asias recent floods have brought death destruction and another reminder of indias struggle to build and maintain reliable infrastructure the disaster highlights how a slow footed bureaucracy has often disappointed the countrys millions of rural poor even as the national economy booms relief officials in northern bihar and uttar pradesh two of the worst hit states in india are blaming mother nature for the havoc rivers that flow through their states from himalayan peaks in nepal became dangerously swollen from unexpectedly heavy monsoon rain they say forcing breaches in embankments that marooned thousands of villages and required emergency relief for millions of people "its really bad unprecedented " says manoj srivastava secretary of bihars disaster management office "people years old say theyve never seen such rain " but critics say such explanations dodge responsibility for preparing for rains that after all arrive every summer they argue the bigger problem is chronic neglect of critical infrastructure rivers werent properly dredged cracked embankments werent repaired and roads were built with inadequate drainage systems the monsoons exposed a bureaucracy loathe to admit its errors according to himanshu thakkar of the south asia network on dams rivers &amp people a safety advocacy group in new delhi "if the government was transparent and accountable officials wouldnt be making the same mistakes " he says even governments in the most advanced countries struggle to respond to disasters as the u s federal emergency management agency showed two years ago in its handling of hurricane katrina and indias neighbors pakistan bangladesh and nepal are now trying to cope with urgent food and medical needs following flooding in their countries in india the floods have struck a nerve in part because they have underscored the continued vulnerability of the rural poor an estimated million people have been affected either driven from their homes or had family members killed and more than people have been killed according to government disaster management officials for all the recent strides in technology and services indias farm sector continues to dominate the national economy about one fifth of the countrys economic output comes from agriculture and about two thirds of indias one billion or so people still live in the countryside the floods immediate economic impact may be difficult to measure chetan ahya an economist for morgan stanley in mumbai estimates that about of areas with crops have seen excessive levels of rainfall probably enough to affect overall yields but not enough to slow growth significantly but in an economy growing overall by a year rural growth is already lagging at about a year leaving many farmers increasingly vulnerable to economic shocks unlike china india lacks a huge manufacturing sector to absorb those looking to leave the countryside india has also made little progress on a number of basics such as child immunization reducing malnutrition and providing safe drinking water in a report the world bank said that while it was upbeat about indias economy it was concerned "that the basic institutions" in indias government were failing "especially for those at the bottom " "why is it that every year we know that floods are coming but people are still dying " asks p v unnikrishnan asia humanitarian coordinator for action aid international an organization involved in the relief effort "investment in preparedness is not clearly understood by politicians " the ministry of home affairs which runs a disaster management institute recently introduced "specialized response teams" to improve the speed and effectiveness of those officials and emergency workers on the ground to many the answer to the nations problems including improved flood prevention begins at the bottom including making sure that local areas have sufficient funds from the central government but the most pressing concern is that money available isnt misspent or when it is that those responsible are caught and punished according to naresh saxena a retired government official in uttar pradesh and now a member of national advisory council an indian body that helps the government formulate policy "there are acute problems in local administration " he says one commonly cited problem is the rapid rotation of civil servants many serve in their posts only a year or two before moving onto a different place or job hardly enough time to develop a deep knowledge of local problems much less an approach to solving them says mr saxena another challenge is getting indias politicians to focus on making sure existing infrastructure is safe not merely trying to win new contracts for roads and bridges in their constituencies according to mr thakkar of the south asia network on dams rivers &amp people last month a breach at the jawant sagar dam in indias western rajasthan state forced the evacuation of thousands of villagers in indias auditor general had pointed to defects in the dam but said that the money granted under a word bank funded "dams safety project" had been spent on noncritical items such as new lights a footbridge and a road the report said then earlier this month part of a dam in central madhya pradesh state peeled away during the monsoon rains a k joshi principal secretary for the madhya pradesh water resources department said the dam had been singled out for "special maintenance" prior to the incident he said there were sandbags plugging the damaged area and that it posed no threat maintenance is now being carried out he added "weve treated the situation very seriously " said mr joshi "we cant afford to be complacent " thats the message at least some politicians are now trying to send in the wake of the floods after inspecting one breached embankment in uttar pradesh state newly elected chief minister mayawatti who goes by a single name suspended the engineer in charge of monitoring the area umesh sinha relief commissioner for uttar pradesh says the breach came late in the evening after the engineer had gone home but he also acknowledges that recent state elections may have distracted some from doing necessary inspection work "maybe there was a relaxation " he says vibhuti agarwal contributed to this article
