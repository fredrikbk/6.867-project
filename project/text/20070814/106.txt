the fdas deadly track record last week the full d c circuit court of appeals reversed an earlier decision by its own three judge panel and ruled against a dying patients right to pursue life by taking invesitgational but as yet fda unapproved drugs the case was filed in by the abigail alliance for better access to developmental drugs and the washington legal foundation we argued that terminal patients with no options left but death have a constitutional right to such therapy in the care of a qualified physician the alliance began pushing for access to investigational drugs for terminal patients after its founding in mid upon the death of abigail burroughs who was denied an investigational drug erbitux that an early trial showed might have helped her she and her doctor were right but she never got the drug over the past five years the alliance has pushed for access to exceptionally promising investigational cancer drugs which have subsequently been approved by the fda and now represent standard care at the time we began our advocacy each of the drugs had cleared at least preliminary phase testing and in some cases more advanced phase or phase trials in other words they obviously worked for some patients gleevec set a tragic standard for loss of life at the hands of fda bureaucrats coming out of phase i testing in it was known beyond any reasonable doubt to be safe and effective the alliance started requesting access to the drug for chronic myelogenous leukemia cml patients in june by the time fda approved gleevec in march approximately patients had been denied access to the drug many died waiting more than of the small number of patients who got gleevec in clinical trials before the drug was approved are alive today eloxatin for advanced colorectal cancer was summarily rejected by the fda in march despite its being approved in at least other countries in january we started to ask the fda to allow patients access the agency delayed approval until august in between about americans died without ever getting the drug erbitux for the treatment of colorectal and head and neck cancers was rejected by fda in december when the agency refused to review the sponsors application the alliance had begun asking the fda to allow patient access to the drug six months earlier the fda delayed approval until february almost people with colorectal and head and neck cancer died waiting the alliance began working for access to revlimid for multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome in june patients had to wait until december for fda approval nearly patients with these terminal cancers died without ever getting revlimid the alliance asked that patients get access to velcade in june curiously the fda points to this drug as proof it can work fast but they didnt approve it until may at the time trial results suggested that only about of multiple myeloma patients should get the drug since shown to be too low but even with that limitation about patients died without ever getting velcade beginning in june we started pushing the fda to make nexavar and sutent both highly promising drugs for kidney cancer available the agency eventually approved nexavar in december and sutent in january but that was only after evidence of efficacy so compelling emerged for nexavar that the trial demanded by the fda in which dying kidney cancer patients seeking the drug were being given no other choice except certain death from their cancer but to agree to a chance of being blindly randomized to a sugar pill was stopped by bayer for ethical reasons and the placebo patients allowed to get the drug the sponsor seeking approval for sutent was given a similar option by fda if it wanted its drug approved about kidney cancer patients died waiting for both drugs the alliance began its push for availability of avastin for multiple cancers in june fda finally approved this obviously effective cancer drug in february it is now approved for colorectal and lung cancers and being successfully used off label for several more almost patients with lung and colon cancer died without ever getting avastin tarceva is used for patients with lung cancer we began pushing for its availability in june the fda approved the drug in november in the interim people with lung cancer died tarceva also extends the effectiveness of an existing drug for pancreatic cancer and about patients died from that disease during the fdas delay in june we started pushing for availability and approval of bexxar for non hodgkins lymphoma fda after rejecting and delaying this highly effective drug repeatedly over several years finally approved it under intense pressure from oncologists in june about died during the delay without ever getting the chance to try the drug the fdas regulatory hatchet job on bexxar prior to its approval has caused the drug to be dramatically underused extending the damage done by the agencys intransigence and incompetence in june we began our efforts to gain access to alimta for lung cancer patients fda didnt approve it until february in the interim approximately lung cancer patients died without the chance of trying this drug to see if it would control their disease or extend their life the alliance started working for access to tykerb for breast cancer in june but the fda didnt approve the drug until march about of breast cancers include the biomarker predictive of benefit from tykerb nearly women who had this marker died from their cancer waiting for tykerb they would according to the fda have each lived an average of eight months longer long enough perhaps to see a child graduate from college or get married or to meet a new grandchild in sum these drugs had they been available to people denied entry to clinical trials might have helped more than one million mothers fathers sons and daughters live longer better lives we have actually underestimated the number of "life years" lost at more than because we have not included other safe and effective uses of these drugs that the fda has yet to approve recently it was decided that provenge another drug we have been trying to get for years will be kept away from prostate cancer sufferers for up to three more years the reason for the delay a small but aggressive club of fda advisers hand picked by the director of the agencys office of oncology drug products dr richard pazdur think the statistics are not yet perfect enough recently the fda responded to our lawsuit by proposing "new" regulations governing access to investigational drugs they propose to change nothing the american cancer society reports that some cancer patients die annually making the number of cancer deaths from to about million over that same period the fda reports granting individual access to an investigational drug to not more than people per year for all diseases and drugs a pathetic even cruel pittance a few thousand more patients managed to gain access by enrolling in relatively small clinical trials or exceedingly rare expanded access programs the other plus million cancer patients not to mention millions more with other diseases were abandoned to die denied access to progress by their own fda when they needed it most we will appeal the decision in abigail alliance v eschenbach to the supreme court and agree with only one thing in the majority opinion congress should pass our pending legislation called the access act now it should be added to the fda reauthorization bill headed for a vote in september this is massive human tragedy made even worse by the fact that it didnt and doesnt have to be this way looking at fda automatons and the d c circuit court brings to mind t s eliots question "where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge "
