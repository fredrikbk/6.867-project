the preacher and the presidents the preacher and the presidents by nancy gibbs and michael duffy center street pages &# during a half century of preaching the gospel billy graham has addressed in person million people in countries in "the preacher and the presidents " nancy gibbs and michael duffy speculate that such numbers may surpass those of all other religious figures in history amid so much traveling and outreach mr graham also found time to counsel american presidents from harry truman to george w bush whenever the presidents called hed be there and sometimes he would do the calling it wasnt just token counseling either according to ms gibbs and mr duffy presidents truman is the only exception became mr grahams friends usually his close friends mr grahams relations with richard nixon although "ardent " were the "most wounding" to the evangelist mr graham stuck by nixon during his travails and supported him publicly nixon he said was "every inch a most christian gentleman" only to see eventually that his faith in nixons character was misplaced mr graham says that his friendship with ronald reagan was his closest among the presidents he has known but it is clear from ms gibbs and mr duffys account that george h w bush comes a close second mr graham knew other members of the bush family as well including mr bushs mother as for mr bushs son the current president he credits mr graham with having changed his life a stroll on the beach in maine in helped to plant a "mustard seed in his soul " it may seem odd to secular liberals but bill clinton knew mr graham and liked him mr clinton even attended three graham crusades the first in when a clinton aide made a snide remark about mr graham during the preparations for the second inaugural in mr clinton rebuked him at the inaugural itself mr graham offered the prayer and what did the preacher and the presidents talk about certainly spiritual matters eisenhower asked about how a person can be sure when he dies that he going to heaven a question that also preoccupied lyndon johnson and reagan asked about the second coming but the relationships went beyond the discussion of theology they became as ms gibbs and mr duffy put it "an unspoken covenant of private counsel and public support " the presidents were drawn to mr graham because they saw him to be "as transformational in his realm as they were in that of the state " he was their peer they admired him and being politicians they used him john kennedy went golfing with mr graham before his inauguration to calm protestants who were nervous about the prospect of a catholic president johnson got mr graham to explain to conservative baptists that the war on poverty was scripturally sound reagan asked mr graham to persuade pro israel evangelicals of the merits of selling awacs to saudi arabia as for the evangelist he liked being with presidents in part because he was fascinated by politics too fascinated his wife kept telling him mr graham mentioned to truman that he followed "political trends carefully" and proposed advising him "on my findings among the people " truman spurned mr grahams offer but later presidents did not on his white house visits mr graham who grew up in a democratic family and became a moderate republican talked about strategy and campaigns as well as scripture not surprisingly the presidents also proved useful to mr graham in the s he was a leader of the nascent neo evangelical movement and his visible presidential friendships helped to bring the movement into the mainstream his white house connections also enabled him to visit places that no preacher had ever visited before the soviet union north korea eastern europe during the cold war "if i had not been a friend of the presidents " mr graham told the authors "in most of these places they wouldnt have invited me to see them it was a way of the lord using presidents for me to reach other people for christ " whatever the political reciprocities ms gibbs and mr duffy note mr graham always sought to "spread the gospel of redeeming love" in the oval office just as he did on his populous crusades he gave himself over to each white house congregation of one "he loved them he forgave them and he tried to be there for them no matter what " still a larger strategy was at work according to ms gibbs and mr duffy mr graham believed that if you have serious christians in the white house you can "influence many more people through them " they formulate mr grahams conception of ministry this way "install christ in the oval office and on capitol hill and the nations problems would take care of themselves " the authors say that mr graham still holds this belief which raises a question or two that ms gibbs and mr duffy do not pursue in their otherwise shrewd analysis and absorbing narrative is such a trickle down model of ministry theologically correct was it the right way to advance the kingdom of god as mr graham believed and practically speaking have the nations problems been solved even in part because a christian occupied the white house and took counseling from mr graham himself admirers of mr graham perhaps even some who walked to the front at one of his crusades may be forgiven for doubting whether the great commission in matthews gospel "make disciples of all men" is best pursued through the oval office mr eastland is publisher of the weekly standard
