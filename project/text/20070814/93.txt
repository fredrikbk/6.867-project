rumble down under radio listeners in sydney last week were treated to some good ole aussie plain talk on the war on terror "its not all negative and nobody pretends that its easy " prime minister john howard told talk show host ray hadley "pulling out will guarantee a descent into civil war and chaos and a victory for terrorism and were totally opposed to that " and what of the much maligned president bush while hes "under pressure at home " mr howard retorted "hes not a person who succumbs easily to pressure and hes right " mr howard could just as easily have been describing himself a man whos been fighting political trench warfare since the s the year old prime minister is dug into what he dubs "the toughest election i have had in the last decade or more " after years in power at the helm of the ruling conservative liberal party the straight talking john howard may finally be on the outs and australia leaning left polls show mr howard trailing his challenger the labor partys kevin rudd by around percentage points with an election expected to be called in late october or early november the so called "howard battlers " the blue collar workers who swung the election decisively for the conservatives are now seen as swing votes particularly in queensland and tasmania a few decades ago an australian election wouldnt have mattered outside asia where canberra occasionally intervened to put out fires in pacific island spats and kept tabs on indonesia since taking office in however mr howard has carved out a global role for his country proving himself a pragmatic and powerful ally in the war on terror australian troops are deployed in more hot spots than at any point in the countrys history including in iraq and afghanistan back at home hes kept australias economic engines purring the federal government is wholly debt free and unemployment is at a year low this is still a fresh vision of australia a nation where "tall poppies" get cut down a popular phrase for compatriots who succeed too much and need to get taken down a notch talk to most aussies and theyll tell you theyre just a middling size nation thats largely dependent on mining resources in fact they have the worlds th largest economy boast some of asias most sophisticated services companies and a top notch military mr howard has had such a successful run that most political pundits attribute his polling numbers not to policy blunders but first to fatigue and second to labor having finally found an electable challenger in good aussie style mr rudd also comes in for his share of ribbing one comedian asked earlier this year "do we want a prime minister named kevin " its hard to overestimate the fatigue factor mr howard is the second longest serving prime minister in australias history his core team foreign minister alexander downer and treasurer peter costello has been in place since its easy too to get complacent when the majority of aussies now own their own homes have stocks in their investment portfolios and watch the war on terror from a comfortable geographic distance after a few leadership debacles the labor party found mr rudd a year old fresh face he styles himself a new left "economic conservative" who would keep the budget balanced he spouts the odd non sequitur hed "keep interest rates low" while "preserving central bank independence" and panders to the trade unions threatening to roll back the liberals program of flexible work contracts but other than that mr rudd largely echoes mr howards free trade conservative economic management something the prime minister acknowledges with relish "i think its a bit of a risk electing a bloke who doesnt have a plan of his own " mr howard told radio host mr hadley its on the "fear issues" such as climate change job security and foreign policy where labor wants to distinguish itself and where the election if mr rudd wins could impact the u s and its allies the opposition leader wants a phased withdrawal of australian troops from iraq playing to local fears that the war on terror has "made australia a target " he advocates humanitarian aid for and dialogue between opposing factions unsurprising positions for a man who spent seven years as a foreign service bureaucrat before entering politics under a rudd government australia would maintain its close u s alliance he says but plump for a stronger united nations and nurture its relationship with china mr rudd also supports ratifying the kyoto treaty mr howard has responded by rounding up his troops and getting prepped for a grass roots tussle that includes a dash of populist politics most notably a wash of money for projects in key constituencies it hasnt however stopped him from pushing ahead with controversial national reforms in june after the release of a report of sexual abuse in aboriginal lands he announced the governments most ambitious reform of policy toward its native population since the s mr rudd supported it mr howards strengths lie in his record of economic growth and foreign policy successes mr rudds strengths lie in distracting voters from that record and focusing them on peripheral issues but as long as mr rudd doesnt make any major gaffes the thinking goes australians are ready for a change or are they as an aussie friend once told me of mr howard "every time his critics give him the kiss of death it amounts to mouth to mouth resuscitation he revives and bounces back with incredible force " mr howard has a long way to bounce in a short period of time but dont count him out just yet ms kissel is editor of the wall street journal asias editorial page bret stephens is on vacation his column will return in two weeks
