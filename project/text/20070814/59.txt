instructors who boldly tout their success rate and their own images they pay to have their faces plastered throughout the city on foot high billboards and the sides of double decker buses theyre also known for buying ads that take up the entire front page of newspapers space more commonly filled by banks and property developers one local television station is even preparing to launch a fictional drama series based on the lives of the tutor gods the tutors wont say exactly how much they make but typically a popular tutor might teach students in a single lesson each paying as much as &# to be

along with whomever their kids choose assured by the promise of better grades a low score in hong kongs public exams which cover a range of subjects can put the brakes on a students college aspirations garret leung credits multiple tutors for helping him land a perfect score on a recent public exam making him one of only hong kong students to do so in "the tutors may not actually help you speak better english " he says "but your scores will certainly be better " rosa wong says shes put off by the "deification" of the tutors "in my heart i dont agree with these practices " she says but that didnt stop her from enrolling her year old daughter sarah in classes with four different tutor gods she decided on the best ones after watching sample lesson videos on youtube "when everyone else takes their classes and your children dont " says ms wong "youre afraid they wont be as competitive " besides she says these tutors are great at "tipping" or predicting exam questions an important edge that could determine her daughters future sometimes the tipping seems to be a little too accurate a few tutors have been known to guess questions that appeared in nearly identical form on the actual tests this spring a legislator here called for a formal investigation into any possible ties between tutors and testing officials mr ngs company called modern education is one of the dominant players in the field mr ng better known here as "ken sir " this spring told students to practice writing essays about fashion designers during the public exam that followed students cracked open the tests english section to find a request for a word essay on the question "would you like to work with a famous fashion designer " mr ng says his prediction was based on experience in the field hes proud of his tipping prowess and now hypes it in his marketing materials "i know all the tricks " says the year old tutor that includes attracting top talent ranging from attorneys to fashion models in one instance mr ng says he lured one english tutor stella cheng away from a lucrative gig at a prominent law firm on a recent summer day over one hundred students watched rapt as one

happens mr fan has a side career rapping with local pop singers like many tutors he goes by a stage name k oten which he uses both in classrooms and recording studios hong kongs rank and file schoolteachers can find the tutor obsession hugely frustrating rosita louie who has taught english at a local government funded public school for years remembers exploding at two of her students who
