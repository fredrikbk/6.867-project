out to pasture why deere is weeding out dealers even as farms boom some veteran retailers feel betrayed by shift we are not a family moline ill for more than a century deere &amp co has relied on dealers to sell its iconic john deere tractors and other farm equipment deere dealers like to brag that they "bleed green " the companys trademark color but even as the farm boom helps deere harvest record profits dozens of north american dealerships are getting sent out to pasture including some that have passed through families for generations chief executive robert lane says times have changed in an age when tractors use satellites to track the location of every seed he says dealers must match the sophistication and size of agribusiness customers "for years we talked about deere as a family " says mr lane a former banker "the fact is we are not a family what we are is a high performance team if someone is not pulling their weight youre not on the high performance team anymore " deeres overhaul is one answer to a challenge faced by many large businesses that distribute their products through independent retailers these retailers are supposed to know the local turf and market the product more effectively than a big corporation could but if the retailers are too small scale their inefficiencies could outweigh the advantages to some deere dealers the transition feels like a betrayal raymond warren spent years working his way up from salesman to owner of a dealership in wakefield va in late mr warren says he began receiving letters emails and visits from deere officials almost monthly urging him either to bulk up by acquiring another dealer or cash out deere declined to comment on individual cases he finally sold to another dealer in deere has "no feeling of remorse whatsoever or compassion for the dealer who has made them what they are today " says mr warren one of his former customers paul rogers jr agrees when mr rogers wanted to start his cotton harvest early last september his deere dealer was out of spindle grease for his cotton picker "i got mad and told them what they could do with their spindle grease when they had it in " says the farmer "when you own multiple stores you dont give the same service as when you rely on a single store for your livelihood " the year old mr lane who took the drivers seat at deere seven years ago fears small dealers dont have the wherewithal to hire enough skilled staff or track parts inventories also deere is trying to wean itself from years of overproduction at its factories and it needs dealers who can manage inventory well by contract dealers have to meet deeres performance targets or face losing their right to sell deere products if someone wants to transfer his dealership to a child or anyone else deere must approve with the help of a strong u s farm economy deere has done well under mr lane despite a recent dip the companys stock price is nearly double the level of two years ago it has doubled its dividend in the past three years deere expects net income of &# billion in the year ending oct thats slightly above the previous year excluding its discontinued health care business and well above &# million four years ago sales are expected to top &# billion this year compared with &# billion four years ago the sales figure doesnt include revenue from financial operations kip tom president of tom farms llc in leesburg ind says he is pleased with deeres changes mr tom owns or rents acres growing corn soybean and tomatoes all of his tractors are deere machines and he says he counts on the dealer to keep them running a dealer has to have "a good set of business skills when youre managing a customer like us " he says deeres consolidation drive is "just basically sorting out the stronger ones " in general a big company has ample motive to consolidate its distributors it needs fewer managers to oversee distribution and spends less time chasing bad debts from marginal operators also giving dealers bigger territories reduces the chance that theyll engage in price wars thats especially important today when customers whether car buyers or farmers can compare prices on the internet says adam j fein a consultant in philadelphia deere had dealer locations in the u s and canada as of last year down from the it counted in deere says the number of owners has shrunk at an even faster pace as more owners take control of multiple locations although it declines to give owner numbers few manufacturers are more deeply rooted in the american soul than deere founded in by a blacksmith who devised a new type of plow that revolutionized midwest farming over the decades dealers sprouted throughout the country reaching more than in the s the number began to decline in the s and s as mechanized farm equipment spread and service became a bigger part of the business the traveling salesmen of an earlier era faded out in favor of dealers who could fix what they sold today big dealership groups may ring up more than &# million in annual sales and even small dealers bring in &# million to &# million mr lane inherited a company accustomed to big profit swings based on how the agricultural economy was faring like detroits big three car makers deere tended to pump out more product than its customers wanted forcing dealers to discount to clear surplus inventory in weak times mr lane tells a story of taking his then year old son to a chevrolet dealership in davenport iowa years ago shopping for a suburban mr lane noted the dealership had eight of that model on the lot he told his son he would reject eight offers by the salesman before agreeing to a deal sure enough the salesman kept lowering his price "hes got a lot to sell here so hes really hungry " mr lane recalls telling the boy that was the kind of situation mr lane wanted deere to avoid he told his executives to find ways to boost profitability one step was to streamline manufacturing plants so they could respond more quickly to changes in demand as the executives looked for inefficiencies they also began to focus on dealers who were having trouble meeting profit and customer loyalty targets at a series of meetings in louisville ky in the summer of deeres brass told dealers they should plan on a future in which they would either be a buyer or a seller tim tyndall who at the time owned a deere store in salisbury md recalls attending a farm equipment auction that fall several dealers half jokingly went around the circle asking who would be shark and who would be bait "everybody said well im a shark " he says mr tyndall ended up becoming neither he later merged his store with a dozen or so others to form a conglomerate deere has also tried to force some dealers to sell deere products exclusively which can be tough on smaller dealers a dealer association has threatened to take its concerns to state attorneys general over the exclusivity issue separately at least two dealers have sued the company over its drive to force them to expand or sell out deeres main competitors agco corp of duluth ga and cnh global nv which is majority owned by fiat group spa of italy are also pursuing dealer consolidation but industry observers say deeres push has been more aggressive technology is a key reason size matters says deere on some of todays tractors farmers neednt even touch the steering wheel the machines turn themselves to ensure that no patch of soil is covered twice their computers can be programmed to track soil temperature and control fertilizer spraying owen palm who co owns five stores in western nebraska thinks the main advantage of getting bigger is that he can afford to hire more skilled managers and technicians "if you have a single store or even a couple of stores you dont have the volume to justify hiring the type of people you really need " he says mr palm has bought equipment and assets from three dealerships over the past nine years as their owners retired and deere refused to let someone else take over mr palm says his bigger stores offer better service than the shuttered dealers although some customers complain they now have to travel as much as an hour to reach their nearest dealer drew eggers farms about acres of mint winter wheat and corn in southwestern idaho last october during winter wheat planting season the mechanical arm that raises and lowers his planter broke his dealer didnt have the part but a sister store miles away owned by the same operator did mr eggers says he received the part the next morning and quickly had his machine back in service consolidation hasnt always lowered costs as mr tyndall in maryland found out when he joined with other dealers to create atlantic tractor llc employee benefit costs went up as atlantic unified its benefits package under the more generous terms some dealers had offered to underscore the benefits of the merger it offered customers next day delivery of out of stock parts that required overnight trucking runs costing &# a year says mr tyndall atlantics total return on sales a measure of profitability closely watched at deere was less than last year that compares with about at each of the half dozen individual dealers before the merger says gregg rebar atlantics chief operations officer he believes atlantic will eventually get back to that level farm equipment accounts for about half of deeres total sales but the company also has a significant business selling machines such as &# weed trimmers and &# riding lawn mowers to consumers and commercial landscapers some dealers carry multiple deere franchises and sell both to farmers and consumers here too deere has sought to consolidate its dealers seeing its customers migrating to home improvement stores such as home depot or lowes deere has added those retailers to its lineup which left it with too many lawn and garden outlets dotted across the u s many dealers who have lost their deere outlets are bitter jerry marx spent most of his life working in deere dealerships he and his wife judy had hoped to pass their store in princeton ind to their children but mr marx says a deere official told them in august that other dealers in the region were growing larger and would eventually drive them out of business deere wouldnt allow the marxes children to take over the dealership the marxes gave up their deere dealership in january and the store has struggled trying to sell other brands of tractors and lawn mowers "the whole thing is just like a nightmare " mr marx says mr lane allows that not all dealers are happy with the consolidation "it really isnt about us liking or not liking" dealers he says "we explain whats going to happen and they can make choices some may say well thats not what grandfather had in mind but thats what im going to do "
