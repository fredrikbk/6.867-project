eyes on the road good news bad news at buick models get safer says j d power then get dumped what do the buick regal buick lesabre buick park avenue and buick rainier have in common besides being buicks they all scored among the top three in their class in j d power &amp associates survey of vehicle dependability for and all are out of production this is another one of those good news bad news stories for detroits struggling auto makers first the good news for the first time general motors corp s buick brand tied toyota motor corp s lexus brand for the top spot in the vehicle dependability study which surveys owners of three year old vehicles and compiles their reported problems into scores and rankings lexus has been alone at the no spot in this survey for years gms cadillac brand and ford motor co s mercury brand scooted in at three and four respectively ahead of no honda motor co and no toyota the spread between lexus and buick and toyota was problems per vehicles toyota and lexus didnt suffer a meltdown by any means lexus models placed first in five segments more than any other brand toyota brand models placed first in four segments including large pickup trucks the last stronghold of the detroit auto giants but buicks catching lexus in long term reliability is an important achievement gm can use to further its case that it has left behind its quality sins of the past now the bad news buick will face a challenge to get the most out of this coup in part because of detroits tendency to dump nameplates in response to poor sales or a weak brand image consider the buick century and buick regal in the j d power study they placed nos and among midsize cars beating the segments highly regarded best sellers the toyota camry and honda accord as j d power notes a reputation for good long term reliability usually translates into a concrete benefit for consumers in the form of higher resale value on average three year old vehicles retain about of their initial transaction price j d power says but cars with good reliability reputations can hang on to as much as percentage points more of their value after three years according to j d power data which is something customers remember brands such as lexus toyota and honda that manage their marketing strategies with resale value in mind have tended to gain share even as overall sales have declined what j d powers new survey suggests is that anyone looking for a reliable three year old used vehicle now might consider adding the buick century and regal to their lists too bad for century owners that j d powers data suggest the discontinued century currently doesnt get many lookers its holding just of its new price well below the industry average beyond that how will the good scores for the century and regal help the new buick that has taken their place in the midsize segment can you even name it answer below george hoffer an economist at virginia commonwealth university who studies automotive sales and marketing trends in detail says in a draft paper that detroits impulse to conjure up new names for a car could be one reason why detroit brands keep losing share despite the evidence that the best of detroits new models have achieved parity with toyota and honda the quality image leaders for the industry the century and the regal names died in large part because they were associated with buicks image as either an old persons car or a rental car as buick sales have declined gm has pared back the number of buick models to fit the brands shrinking share and tried to reposition buick as a less pretentious version of lexus with cars that are dignified ultra quiet and highly reliable vehicles such as the stylish buick enclave crossover wagon built to attract would be buyers of the lexus rx models reflect this strategy fords new chief executive alan mulally earlier this year decided that detroits formula for atoning for past sins consign the offending vehicle name to the memory hole and spend millions to launch a new name is nuts thats why ford will this fall revive the ford taurus and mercury sable names the sable by the way placed third in the latest j d power study among midsize cars not that "were no " is the strongest advertising pitch buick plans to do its best to promote the j d power tie with lexus says spokesman dave darovitz "perception lags reality now that perception has caught up with reality we are just now starting to get credit " he says it would be easier if gm hadnt let cars like the regal and century slide so far that killing off the names seemed like a good idea chalk it up as another legacy cost for detroit to overcome answer the new midsize buick is the lacrosse send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
