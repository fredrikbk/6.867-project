a little bit miserly in the way theyve dealt with this " said malcolm barr a united kingdom economist with j p morgan in london much of the difference is philosophical economists said despite real technical differences among the ways the federal reserve the european central bank and the bank of england operate mr king has made clear his dislike for bailouts warning repeatedly that investors
