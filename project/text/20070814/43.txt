global economy german auto makers rev up u s output bmw and mercedes seek hedge against weak dollar giving the south an economic boost as detroits struggling auto makers slash jobs major european auto makers are moving to expand u s operations illustrating how the auto industrys globalization isnt just a one way street for the u s economy german auto makers are accelerating plans to ramp up u s production and add jobs as a hedge against the dollars persistent weakness against the euro which has battered profits on vehicles exported from europe in spartanburg s c bmw ag is gearing up to boost production capacity at its only u s factory to more than vehicles a year from bmw already builds the z sports car and x suv there and it plans to add the x and x suvs as well the company says the expansion is intended to help shield its bottom line from currency fluctuations that reduced its earnings by &# million separately volkswagen ag which stopped building cars in the u s nearly years ago is mulling the idea of starting again as part of a broader turnaround of its money losing north american business the company has lost more than billion euros &# billion in the region over the past five years its only factory in north america in puebla mexico is operating at near full capacity churning out cars this year and the company currently has to import from europe several of the models it sells in the u s "we clearly have to consider a new production location in north america " stefan jacoby recently named chief executive of volkswagen of america inc told journalists and analysts on a conference call last month in vance ala daimlerchrysler ag is setting production records at its year old mercedes benz factory thanks to a &# million expansion employment at the factory has doubled since to people as production has grown to vehicles annually more than twice the plants original capacity although the expansion began when the dollar was stronger than the euro "given how the exchange rate has developed it was the right decision" to expand there says a daimler spokesman the european auto makers moves could accelerate a shift in the balance of power in the u s auto sector that has been under way for more than years a combination of productivity improvements and shifting of parts production to lower wage countries has cut the total number of jobs supported by the u s auto industry by to from just over million in according to bureau of labor statistics data compiled by sean mcalinden an economist with the center for automotive research in ann arbor mich since general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler llc have closed north american assembly plants in the same period asian and european car makers have opened north american assembly plants total u s vehicle production has grown to million a year in from million in according to harbour consulting of troy mich at the assembly plant level unionized workers have taken the brunt of job losses during the past years losing out to lower cost nonunion operations run by overseas auto makers thats a central issue as detroits three auto makers and the united auto workers bargain over a new national contract this summer making cars in the u s where costs and revenue are in dollars provides a natural hedge for european auto makers looking to insulate themselves from unfavorable exchange rates although exchange rates can be unpredictable companies such as mercedes benz say they see a strong euro as a more long term phenomenon bmw and mercedes sell the bulk of their u s made vehicles in the u s but also export american made models to other markets including europe mercedes exports vehicles from vance to countries led by germany italy france and the united kingdom bmw exports about of the vehicles made in south carolina to more than markets both companies are increasing exports to europe from the u s most notably suvs one of the fastest growing segments of the western european car market in recent years because expanding a factory can cost hundreds of millions of dollars german car makers normally prefer to offset the strong euro by raising prices but because of competition in the u s most companies even those with relatively affluent customers say they cant afford that option "we have been extremely cautious with price adjustments in recent years " says peter schwarzenbauer chief executive of porsche ags u s business during the late s and early s porsche raised prices as often as three times a year in response to a weak dollar porsches u s sales slid from cars in to in other car makers are recalibrating their product plans in germany mercedes benz officials cite the dollars weakness as key to their decision not to bring the brands small b class model to the u s company officials say the profit margins on the vehicle would have been too low to justify exporting it to the u s currency shifts are also affecting asian automakers though in different ways in south korea hyundai motor co and kia motors corp hit by a strong won have accelerated their overseas expansion plans kia last year broke ground on its first u s factory the plant in georgia is about miles from hyundais first u s factory in alabama japans toyota motor corp and its luxury brand lexus are looking at increasing production in japan rivals of lexus and toyota which have been steadily increasing market share in the u s contend that an undervalued yen is unfairly aiding the japanese brands so far the shift in german car makers production is mainly benefiting southern u s towns such as vance not the upper midwestern states hard hit by cutbacks at gm ford and chrysler mercedes located its first u s factory in vance a decade ago in part because of alabamas nonunion right to work environment in the spartanburg area bmws presence and the suppliers that followed have created more than jobs bmws operations arent unionized vances population has grown to about from residents mayor keith mahaffey said his town has gone from a sleepy place where residents left their doors unlocked and windows open to a more fast paced town where people now lock up when they leave home but he said the overall affect of mercedess presence has been a boon for the area with mercedes and its suppliers creating more than jobs in alabama "vance was just a small farming community before mercedes came along " mr mahaffey said "its caused us to relook at how we live and has made us more worldly " the expansion of german car makers in the southern u s is helping lure some of their traditional suppliers from germany including vst keller gmbh of schopfheim the company which treats stamping dies used to make steel parts for cars opened its first plant outside germany in pell city ala in the autumn in large part to be within a few hours distance of bmw a longtime client in germany "we must follow the work " says uwe horschig the companys general manager for european sales the company has since landed contracts with nissan motor co in tennessee and honda motor co in alabama the shift in investment by german companies toward the u s is also creating losers elsewhere canadian auto supplier magna international inc has lost the bmw x and the chrysler c sedan which have been produced in magnas affiliate in graz austria the chrysler c will be shifted to a chrysler plant in canada with the x accounting for roughly of magna steyrs production volume graz local officials are waiting to learn how magna will compensate for the loss magna says it is continuing to have discussions with other auto makers to help offset the loss of the bmw and chrysler models "i cannot deny it bmws decision does hurt " says siegfried nagl grazs mayor "but i am convinced we will catch up again soon we are always working on new products at magna " john d stoll in detroit and almut schoenfeld in berlin contributed to this article
