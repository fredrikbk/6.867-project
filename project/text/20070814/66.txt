more women take flight in airline operations chicago when cindy szadokierski first moved from customer service at united airlines to a management job on the operations side in she often found herself the only woman in meetings discussing the nuts and bolts of running an airline "it truly was a mans world " she says today that still happens from time to time but instead of being a nervous newcomer shes usually the one running the meeting as vice president in charge of uniteds largest hub here at ohare international airport ms szadokierski oversees ground workers eight miles of baggage belts and flights a day she is among a growing band of women across the airline industry who are breaking ground by taking over high profile officer positions running big hubs heading airport ground operations leading aircraft maintenance and managing airline operation control centers for at least a decade women have been steadily moving into airline staff jobs in the fields of government media and human relations law and finance and oversight of flight attendants but operations running the gamut from dispatchers to ramp workers to safety and de icing until recently remained largely off limits the shift is partly due to the airlines lessening dependence on the military for recruits and a wave of retirements by men as the industry has gone through a series of bankruptcies "there was a time when nearly all our pilots and mechanics came out of the military and there werent many women in the military " says jeffrey brundage senior vice president of human resources at amr corp s american airlines "we werent as enlightened but the male dominance was by circumstance not intention " michael bell co leader of the aviation aerospace and defense practice for executive recruiters spencer stuart says the airlines are making progress but too slowly and oddly the rise of women in operations brings a whole new glass ceiling "ceos used to come from operations " mr bell says "that was always the case " but in recent years u s airline chief executives have tended to come from finance law or marketing for the women who finally are ascending in operations he says "im not sure it gets them out of the ghetto " last year northwest promoted crystal knotek who started as a reservations agent years ago to senior vice president customer service and airport operations at american peggy sterling who started as a "stewardess" her word in has run that carriers giant hubs in chicago and dallas and for the past four years has been the airlines vice president of safety security and

a woman in the job of vice president of ground operations not to mention a female chief financial officer and a woman president colleen barrett the highest ranking female in the u s industry at this time of extreme airline cost cutting the women tend to bring a much needed focus on customer service an area in which they normally worked at the start of their careers that is often lacking in operations pete mcdonald chief operating officer of united parent ual corp says they have made "a huge difference" at his company for instance he says "we had serious issues with operations at ohare so we put the best brightest most communicative person" in the job in ms szadokierskis case that means livening up a daily meeting on that mornings flight departures by breaking out a stuffed toy chicken when the statistics are good she starts up the toy and it does the "chicken dance" on the conference table if the numbers are great she insists that everybody in the room get up and dance united where of the employees are women now has eight female vice presidents among its overall and three old friends are in hard core operating roles besides ms szadokierski there is joanne calabrese

has attracted catcalls from mechanics and removed pornography from break room walls "whats this nonsense " she briskly asked the workers ms szadokierski her business card comes with a pronouncer "shad ah ker skee" says her favorite times now are her weekly afternoon walkabouts on the ohare ramp and her weekly morning jaunts through the terminal aside from escaping meetings these outings help her engage employees and "hear about issues i wouldnt have known about " she says "ohare is big its a monster " on a high speed walk through the check in area on a recent morning she greets employees and passengers high fives the sky caps out on the curb and darts into a red carpet club for a quick look later she pops her head into a basement classroom where a dozen new customer service agents are being trained she quizzes them on three letter airport codes and passport rules then cheerfully tells them to smile and bend with their knees not their backs "i started as a res agent " she says "my story will tell you the skys the limit at our company "
