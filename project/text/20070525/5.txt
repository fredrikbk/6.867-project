biodiverse myspace online encyclopedia to name all species science is built on names for botanists zoologists and other life scientists the right name gives every creature an identity and a proper place in the world the family cat is felus silvestris catus the rose ringed parakeet it stalks psittacula krameri formal rules of nomenclature are the hidden scaffolding of science in crucial ways however our vintage system of classification teeters on its foundations shaken by insights from genetics and evolution that alter how we look at life the world may be home to million species of plants bacteria and animals researchers estimate yet only million of them have been identified so when biodiversity experts this month announced a plan to pool knowledge of every species on a single web site it served to highlight how little we know of life and how much there still is to inventory harvard biologist e o wilson and his colleagues launched the new online encyclopedia of life with &# million from the macarthur foundation and the sloan foundation over the next decade they intend to create a web page for every species known and named "we are going for nothing less than the complete mapping of the worlds biodiversity " dr wilson said the creation of this wiki of the world coincides with the th anniversary this month of the birth of carl linnaeus the swedish naturalist who laid the foundation of scientific naming far from a shy man he wrote five autobiographies prof linnaeus was an inadvertent innovator he initially conceived his naming system to index library books not life forms said botanist robbin moran at the new york botanical garden inspired he arranged life in a terse creationist hierarchy of kingdoms classes and lesser orders subdivided into ranks of genus and species in this taxonomy a common dog is animalia chordata vertebrata mammalia carnivora canidae canis domesticus the full name locates a dog precisely in nature "god creates linnaeus arranges " as he put it he also liked to even the score he named a noxious weed after a german botanist he disliked and the entire toad family after a french rival names we still use today the ark of earth is more crowded than he ever knew he classified species of animals and species of plants the online zoobank a registry of official animal names launched last year lists scientific names of the species discovered so far about new technical names of organisms are proposed every year to the international commissions of taxonomy surprises never end last week a new species of sea anemone turned up it dwells only in the carcass of a dead whale names of course can deceive a growing understanding of the genes that unite and divide all living things is revealing unsuspected diversity and reordering family relationships scientists recently discovered that the california slender salamander is not one species but while the eastern slimy salamander turns out to be species even experts might be expected to miss subtle distinctions between mudpuppies but biologists were nonplused to discover that the majestic african elephant is not a single iconic species but two the lotus is not a cousin of the water lily but a kind of sycamore termites snug so long in their own scientific family are actually a kind of cockroach and therefore must be formally demoted and renamed to better distinguish species researchers at the university of guelph in canada in invented a genetic identifier modeled on commercial bar codes using a dna bar code scientists in february discovered new species of birds and six new species of bats by re examining old specimens they also determined that seagulls considered eight separate species were in genetic truth all birds of a feather researchers so far have collected bar codes for species by relying on variations in a single gene however these reformers could make as many mistakes as they correct taxonomists contend "there is no bar code on a beetles butt " said david maddison at the tree of life project "nature is not that simple " all in all naming is an essence of human nature dolphins can whistle a signature to identify themselves biologists at the university of st andrews reported last year but only people are label conscious "the origins of language are tied to naming " said smithsonian curator kevin de queiroz who is working on classification reforms "it probably was the first thing people did " yet species are disappearing faster than researchers can discover and classify them half of all plants and animals may become extinct by the end of the century "here it is years after linnaeus and we still have not figured out the best way to name things " said yale botanist michael donoghue "we are working on it " we may not know the value of biodiversity but we can price a name in the wildlife conservation society auctioned off the right to name a new monkey species in bolivia a casino near montreal paid &# to name
