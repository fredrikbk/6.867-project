the daily fix second verse same as the first pistons top cavaliers online edition in game of the nbas eastern conference finals the cleveland cavaliers lebron james rejected a drive to the basket and passed to donyell marshall who missed the three the cavs lost to the detroit pistons in last nights game mr james missed a spinning shot in the lane with just under eight seconds left and a whole lot of rip hamilton all over him the only foul called was on cavs coach mike brown who got a t for protesting the lack of a foul on mr james the cavs lost to the detroit pistons in the cleveland plain dealer bill livingston mixes acceptance and anger "you dont get that call not on this floor not in that clock situation maybe you should but that is not the way games have ever been called let the players decide it is the referees motto decide what sumo wrestling in short pants instead of those loincloth thingies goat roping and bulldogging like in the rodeo basketball is not much of a game if the only way to stop great players is to mug them " on espn com chris sheridan gets his bob dole on wondering "wheres the outrage " mr brown he says "did his team a disservice by trying to take the high road by refraining from criticizing the officials in the interview room afterward " mr sheridan fumes that "the non call was so egregious id expect jimmy clark bernie fryer and mark wunderlich to be told by the league office that they can watch the rest of the playoffs from joey crawfords man cave since they dont deserve to be working at this stage of the postseason if theyre too scared to call a foul on the biggest play of the game " in the akron beacon journal terry pluto looks at the cavs dreadful performances in third quarters they were outscored by the pistons in that frame last night and in game "even more disturbing this pattern was part of the six game series with the new jersey nets where the cavs won the third quarter only once " mr pluto writes "thats once in six games against the nets thats none in two games against the pistons that means in eight playoff games the cavs have been outscored in the third quarter in seven of them since most of these playoff games are in the point range the cavs looking flat and slow in the third quarter is changing the course of the games " the pistons might well hope for less deja vu from now on last year they took a series lead on the cavs saw cleveland take the next three and then righted themselves to advance in the detroit free press drew sharp is nervous "theyre winning yet this series nonetheless feels like its slipping away " he writes fretting that "if the pistons dont squeeze clevelands throat in game they still might lose this series they need chauncey billups they need chris webber " the nbas draft lottery wasnt a good day for espn coms bill simmons his dad or his posse of boston pals the celtics had a chance at kevin durant or greg oden the one two phenom punch in this years draft instead they wound up with the fifth pick "for all intent and purpose professional basketball had just been murdered in the city of boston " mr simmons writes before surveying years of bad decisions and bad luck "anyone who remembers the good old days when the garden was rocking when we were always in the hunt when you honestly believed that wed win every close game because someone was looking out for us when everyone else feared us cant come to grips with whats happened " he writes "were like one of those child actors who peaked at made a ton of money had everyone kissing their ass for a few years and then everything went to crap well you know what happens to famous child actors who become irrelevant they go crazy they go off the deep end they chain smoke they do drugs they get arrested they look like hell they disgrace themselves on the surreal life or celebrity fit club because theyre so desperate to be famous again basically every celtics fan older than the age of has turned into macaulay culkin " speaking of the draft the fix wishes michael wilbon of the washington post luck in wading through emails screaming about east coast bias "what good is having rookie phenoms greg oden and kevin durant join the league even if theyre good quickly if nobody sees them almost all their home games would begin after oclock in the east and in the midwest which is pretty much the reason few people east of the rockies knew a thing about the golden state warriors until their playoff series with the mavericks " mr wilbon writes that "the teams along the stretch of i from boston to washington an area i refer to as the cradle of basketball have been out of the big action for so long the league risks seeing the fans of those cities gradually tune out those teams along the i corridor play to only oh million people or so potentially " elijah dukes of the tampa bay devil rays is a promising year old outfielder he also appears to have some pretty serious personal issues his wife nishea gilbert has asked a court for protection against him twice in the last month a voice mail message reportedly from mr dukes says "you dead dawg i aint even expletive your kids too " that message ms gilbert says was followed by a picture of a gun sent as a text message the st petersburg times has compiled a long list of domestic problems involving mr dukes who has at least five children by four women and when he was saw his father draw a year sentence for second degree murder mr dukes has been benched while the rays try to figure out what to do next the tampa tribunes martin fennelly doesnt want to wait "i say dukes should sit throughout the fact finding and be traded sooner rather than later for whatever whomever " he writes "the rays from owner stuart sternberg to team president matt silverman to vice president andrew friedman know that has to happen before something else happens something bad they insist their hands are tied when it comes to suspending dukes what with the players union what with him not being arrested this time maybe so but they must see their way to zero tolerance its time its past time " but amid the urgency mr fennelly finds room for sympathy "i cant imagine his years my dad didnt go behind the walls for murder i was never abandoned i always had plenty of people to trust sadness is never far away when i consider dukes life " blogging was rarely as much fun as when anne ursu alias batgirl was chronicling the ups and downs of the minnesota twins sometimes with legos other times with nothing but her own considerable gifts as a writer ms ursu is discontinuing her blog to spend time with her baby son offering a farewell to her readers "remember that its only a game but its the best game on earth and its our privilege to watch it and do batgirl a favor when your favorite player strikes out with the bases loaded or muffs a bunt or walks a guy in and the crowd around you boos i want you to stand up and shout at the top of your lungs heart bursting with unconditional love thats my boyfriend " the fix like so many others will miss her found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com
