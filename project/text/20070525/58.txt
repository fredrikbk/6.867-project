lifting the veil on tax risk new accounting rule lays bare a firms liability if transaction is later disallowed by the irs hundreds of companies could be on the hook to the internal revenue service and other authorities for tens of billions of dollars in back taxes due to transactions they believe could be challenged newly required regulatory disclosures show investors are getting a first peek into one aspect of the world of corporate taxes thanks to a new accounting rule that took effect in january the rule known as fin forces companies to better disclose how much they have set aside or reserved for financial reporting purposes to pay governments in case tax saving transactions are successfully challenged by taxing authorities in the past companies had to reveal little information about transactions that could face some risk in an audit by the irs or other government entities now companies are being required to disclose the amount they have put into tax reserves along with other potentially challengeable amounts related to past tax benefits these sums are being disclosed as a liability for "unrecognized tax benefits" in quarterly q reports filed with the securities and exchange commission most of the first such disclosures have been filed in the past few weeks a pair of new research papers one by a group of accounting professors and the other by a pair of tax analysts at credit suisse group examine the new tax information laying out how much money could be at stake the large companies studied by credit suisse reported a combined &# billion in such tax liabilities to be sure these arent necessarily related to aggressive tax transactions also extra payments and refunds are part of the normal back and forth between corporations and tax authorities as of jan the company that could be on the hook for the biggest amount is merck &amp co which had a potential tax liability of &# billion according to credit suisse tax and accounting analysts david zion and amit varshney other companies with big potential exposure measured on an absolute basis include general electric co at&amp t inc j p morgan chase &amp co pfizer inc exxon mobil corp bank of america corp wells fargo &amp co citigroup inc and verizon communications inc according to credit suisse here is what the disclosures mean say a company saves &# million on its taxes as a result of a tax credit a tax shelter or some other transaction however the company is not completely sure that those savings will withstand scrutiny if it gets audited so for financial accounting purposes it sets aside &# million of those tax savings in a reserve there is no requirement the actual cash be set aside on its income statement the company gets only a benefit of &# million or &# million minus the &# million set in reserve until now there was generally no way to know about the existence of that transaction or reserve but the new accounting rule establishes fresh guidelines for creating such reserves and also requires companies to disclose them as liabilities for "unrecognized tax benefits " the category is so named because it represents the portion of the tax benefits realized on a companys tax return that hasnt been recognized in its financial reporting this new category also includes other things besides reserves including tax positions in which the timing of the benefit may be challenged such as a depreciation related deduction for investors those "unrecognized tax benefits" can be significant because they provide a quantitative measure of the amount the company thinks might be at risk in cash if the irs or another tax authority challenges it and prevails credit suisses analysts note that taking tax positions that could be subject to a challenge by the government can help a companys cash flow in the short term but puts the firm at risk of having to make big payouts later "the question for investors " they wrote "is are you willing to pay for companies to take on this type of risk " mercks reserve has dropped by about one third since the start of the year to &# billion the reason in february merck announced a net &# billion settlement with the irs part of that payment stemmed from a bermuda tax shelter used by merck that was the subject of a page one article in the wall street journal last year in a statement a merck spokeswoman said "based on mercks particular business situation and the time period covered the companys tax reserves are reasonable " pharmaceutical companies like merck often get big tax benefits from "transfer pricing" the methods companies use to allocate costs and revenue between different tax jurisdictions merck is in the middle of a &# billion transfer pricing dispute with the canada revenue agency according to its sec filings and a person familiar with the matter the new disclosures arent perfect for one the amount a company reserves against a tax benefit comes from a subjective management estimate different companies could reserve different amounts for the same transaction plus a new tax bill in one jurisdiction could trigger a new tax deduction or credit elsewhere but it isnt always clear if the number disclosed by some companies is a net or a gross figure several companies including at&amp t j p morgan citigroup and ge include significant amounts in their total unrecognized tax benefits that would be partially offset by deductions arising from the new payments or are related to timing the absolute number contained in the reserve also doesnt tell the full story about future tax risk mr zion compared the newly disclosed tax liability with other metrics like companies average cash flow or their total liabilities based on that analysis mr zion found the companies most at risk if they get hit with a big demand for back taxes are pmc sierra inc altera corp general motors corp and merck the unrecognized tax benefit at pmc sierra for example is equivalent to about years worth of its typical cash flow from operations according to credit suisse a pmc sierra spokesman didnt return phone messages a coming study by four accounting professors jennifer blouin of the university of pennsylvania cristi gleason of the university of iowa and the university of texas lillian mills and stephanie sikes examined the newly disclosed tax liabilities at large companies and compared those with their book assets mercks total unrecognized tax benefit topped the list under that analysis too with an amount equal to of its assets by contrast ges total unrecognized tax benefit was a similar size but it represented about of its total assets ges reported &# billion liability doesnt include &# billion in accrued interest and penalties an exxon mobil spokesman said its unrecognized tax benefit of &# billion represented a fraction of last years tax bill of about &# billion
