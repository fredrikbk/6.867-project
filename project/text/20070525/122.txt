weekend journal the weekend adviser my place in history devised by me its a new history channel documentary but is it also an infomercial on memorial day the channel will air "star wars the legacy revealed " a documentary about the historical references and cultural impact of the film series in it camille paglia compares the tale to "hamlet " tom brokaw says future generations will be "enthralled " and newt gingrich suggests that even george washington "would have found in star wars a great deal that he would have agreed with " the channel is heavily marketing the show with billboards promoting it in major cities but viewers who watch through the closing credits may notice that "legacy" was produced "in association" with lucasfilm translation "star wars" creator george lucas conceived the idea for the documentary his company lucasfilm commissioned the filmmaker and the company had a measure of influence over its content "the legacy revealed" reflects an increasingly prevalent practice in arts and entertainment programming airing shows conceived produced or paid for in part by their subjects who often stand to reap promotional benefits from the broadcast for programmers such as pbs national geographic channel or history channel which contend for emmy and peabody documentary awards relationships with their subjects can represent a balancing act between independence and financial viability "any studio can commission any film it wants but it comes down to a loud and clear flagging of whos paying for it " says jon else a documentary filmmaker and a journalism professor at the university of california at berkeley bob steele a journalism ethics specialist at the poynter institute in st petersburg fla says a credit at the films end may be insufficient "something that comes at a point when few people are watching may not be the most ideal of disclosures " one big impetus to involve the subject of a program copyright owners are reluctant to license large chunks of their work to outsiders without being involved in for example pbs aired a bob dylan documentary in which mr dylans film production company owns a copyright stake some producers also have a very limited budget for arts programming "everything we do we have to figure out how were going to pay for it " says david horn series producer of pbss "great performances " on june his series is airing an ella fitzgerald tribute listing as co producers two companies releasing anniversary cds around the same time john wilson head of pbss tv programming says the public broadcaster allows such relationships for performance and artist biography programs but the producer must maintain editorial control and the display of commercial products is usually prohibited "i want to be able to watch it and think it wasnt a long gratuitous plug for a new cd coming out " he says lucasfilm conceived its documentary as part its th anniversary celebration of the first "star wars" movie it also ties in with a convention in los angeles this weekend a new video driven web site and a coffee table book on the making of that film history channel says it isnt hiding and indeed is proud of lucasfilms involvement in the documentary the company appears in its end credits and mr lucas spoke on tape at a channel event for advertisers this month "were not going to put anything on our air that does not hold up to the integrity and accuracy and credibility that our audience has come to expect from us " says nancy dubuc the channels general manager filmmaker kevin burns whom lucasfilm hired to make the documentary has made several tv programs for history and its corporate partner a&amp e including another "star wars" documentary "empire of dreams " which was also produced with lucasfilm and appears on the original trilogys dvd box set for "legacy " he says lucasfilm and history channel had equal input "but we werent pressured to do anything " he says "its not like
