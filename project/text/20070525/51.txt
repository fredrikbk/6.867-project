journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources mining what will we do when gallium runs out indium gallium and hafnium are some of the least known elements on the periodic table but new scientist warns that reserves of these low profile minerals and others like them might soon be exhausted thanks to the demand for flat screens and other high tech goods scientists who have tried to estimate how long the worlds mineral supply can meet global demand have made some gloomy predictions armin reller a materials chemist at the university of augsburg in germany estimates that in years the world will run out of indium used for making liquid crystal displays for flat screen television sets and computer monitors he also predicts that the world will run out of zinc by and hafnium an increasingly important part of computer chips by researchers worry that a supply crunch in some metals and minerals could kill off promising new technologies rene kleijn a chemist at leiden university in the netherlands says that a new design for solar panels that would make them twice as efficient as most current panels might not get built for lack of gallium and indium estimates of reserves vary widely and scientists say it is difficult in some cases to accurately forecast demand says new scientists david cohen whats more it is possible that demand for some metals will plateau tom graedel a professor of industrial ecology at yale university found that per capita consumption of iron leveled off around suggesting that at some point people in technologically advanced societies might only need so much of any one metal but prof graedel notes that this hasnt been the case with copper a crucial component of wiring and computer chips he predicts that by global demand for copper might outstrip mineable supplies if the most dire predictions are true recycling of rare metals will be the only way to manufacture some gadgets and machines as demand grows in the developing world mr kleijn says that a lot of copper could be freed up by replacing cities copper pipes with plastic ones hazel prichard a geologist at the university of cardiff in the united kingdom also is developing ways to extract platinum a vital component in catalytic converters and fuel cells from the dust and grime of city streets apparently urban grit contains parts per million of platinum new scientist may immigration north carolina shows risks of guest worker programs north carolinas reliance on agricultural guest workers offers a lesson in what can go wrong when government attempts to legalize temporary immigrant labor as a landmark senate bill proposes says time magazines nathan thornburgh the state imports more legal farm workers than any other allowing them to work for short periods when demand for labor is at its highest once the work is completed the workers are required to return to their home country usually mexico from christmas tree farms to crab plants the companies and immigrants signed on to the guest worker program are straining under spiraling costs and the programs rigidity mr thornburgh says garland fulcher who has a crabmeat distribution and repackaging business says more than of the guest workers he hired in left to live elsewhere in the u s once their visas expired in mexico u s consulates are struggling to process paperwork and interview potential guest workers causing delays that can be disastrous to farmers come harvest time under the senate bill guest worker paperwork would be simplified while guest worker programs might seem like a reasonable compromise between completely closed and porous borders north carolinas experience reveals the programs constraints too mr thornburgh says "once you rely on a guest worker program you have a huge amount of reliance on government bureaucracy " says university of california berkeley labor economist david card mr thornburgh says the root problem is that immigrant workers brought temporarily to work on the land always will be tempted to stay permanently legally or not so that they can work in higher paying jobs the only way to stop that he says is to pay far higher wages for farm work if americans arent prepared to pay more for food the only alternative mr thornburgh says would be to become a net importer of food from lower wage countries time june environment a citys voters get a whiff of emission cutting costs new york city might be getting hybrid taxis but that is just a lettuce leaf on the compost heap compared with a plan by berkeley calif to cut emissions by six months after berkeley voters passed a measure calling for huge cuts in greenhouse gases by city officials have put forth a sketch of what residents would have to do to meet their goal some of the steps are fairly mundane cloth shopping bags will be de rigeur for example but other steps would be more life changing residents would need to avoid driving to work and buy locally grown food while landlords would be required to give tenants free bus passes shared cars would be available on every block builders will only be permitted to use recycled and green materials "it will challenge people and it will be difficult " said cisco devries chief of staff to mayor tom bates "but if berkeleys niche isnt leadership on this issue then what is it " san francisco
