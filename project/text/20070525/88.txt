the evening wrap sadr surfaces online edition muqtada al sadr who for months was out of sight if not out of mind resurfaced in iraq today leaving washington to wonder whether the influential shiite clerics return indicates more trouble ahead or possibly a turning point in iraqs long and disjointed road back to stability though his followers had insisted that he was simply hiding in iraq mr sadr is believed to have scampered off to iran early this year to avoid being swept up in the security crackdown that was then being prepared by american forces why the year old firebrand chose this particular moment to emerge from wherever he was tucked away isnt exactly clear but perhaps it isnt surprising for one mr sadrs main shiite adversary supreme islamic council of iraq leader abdul aziz al hakim recently learned that he has lung cancer and has since packed off to iran for treatment but perhaps more significantly mr sadr returned to the public view less than hours after the u s congress passed a new war spending package that while scrubbing the pullout timelines that president bush refused to accept lays out a series of benchmarks that the iraqi government must meet in order to ensure washingtons continued economic support the to do list includes passage of an oil revenue sharing law that is seen as crucial to advancing the national reconciliation process and on which iraqs legislature has been unable to make much progress washington received word of mr sadrs return tentatively gordon johndroe a white house spokesman said the administration hopes the cleric will play "a positive role inside iraq" and that he "has an opportunity to be a part of the political reconciliation process well see if he and his followers participate " if mr sadrs words today are any indication he is in no rush to cozy up to the americans "no no for satan no no for america no no for the occupation no no for israel " he chanted with thousands of his followers at a prayer service in the shiite holy city of kufa "we demand the withdrawal of the occupation forces or the creation of a timetable for such a withdrawal " he said "i call upon the iraqi government not to extend the occupation even for a single day " mr sadr has repeatedly called for american forces to depart iraq and he pulled his supporters out of the maliki government last month when the prime minister refused to call for establishing a timeline for withdrawal earlier this week mr maliki said he had selected new ministers but was unable to get them approved when there werent enough legislators on hand for a quorum baghdads flailing creates a clear opening for mr sadr who would likely seek to strengthen iraqs ties with neighboring iran and who according to aides believes that the maliki government is nearing collapse because of its failure to provide the countrys citizens with basic services and security the cleric would clearly be a leading candidate to fill any void left by the breakdown of the government or a drawdown in u s forces mr sadr commands a large militia the mahdi army which he ordered off the streets at the start of the security push in february in order to avoid bloody losses in fighting with u s and iraqi government troops still militiamen and iraqi forces have had their battles mr sadr condemned such fighting today arguing that it only "served the interests of the occupiers " at nearly the same moment the mahdi army suffered a deep blow as its young commander in basra wissam al waili died in a battle with british forces stocks end week on up note traders filed bleak

association of realtors said sales of existing homes slipped in april to the sleepiest pace in four years and the number of homes lingering on the market ballooned by more than it would be hard to imagine a more thorough contrast to yesterdays report on new home sales which surged more than about the only convergence between the twin reports came in their prices components the median price of a new home plunged though numerous economists said one factor probably was a shift in the sales toward cheaper houses especially in the south however there was nothing in todays report to suggest that

&# in april the ninth month in a row in which prices have fizzled drew matus an economist at lehman brothers said that in year over year terms the sales reports showed similar weakness and that "fears of a full blown housing recovery are a bit premature " the realtors group was quick to pin some of the blame for the weak report on the subprime mortgage meltdown according to the federal reserves last poll of senior loan officers lenders have tightened their standards for chancier home loans meanwhile buyers of more sound means appear to be waiting things out "uncertainty surrounding the

stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital some economists had noted recently that mortgage applications were turning up but ian shepherdson of high frequency economics said that todays report exposes the weakness of that data that is they dont show how many applications are actually approved "people making multiple mortgage applications are lifting the numbers giving a misleading
