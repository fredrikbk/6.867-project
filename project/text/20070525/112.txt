weekend journal taste de gustibus strike up the band having immersed myself in latin culture for more years than i care to admit i thought i had heard every rendition of tito puentes "oye como va" that could impress me that was until the st josephs elementary school band from bathgate avenue in the bronx delivered its own interpretation at its annual spring benefit earlier this month every number that the students performed at the concert was solid but it was the grand finale featuring the mambo greats classic that made me want to get up and dance and i wasnt alone by the time the band wrapped it up the whole place was swaying carlos santana eat your heart out i thought as the audience erupted in applause after the performance the students mingled with the crowd in their neat school uniforms every one of them a portrait of grace and good manners the next day at my desk i was still tapping the cha cha cha with a pencil and found myself contemplating the sheer joy that had filled that school hall it dawned on me that what had made my heart sing wasnt the trumpets or the flutes it was the sound of children from one of the roughest neighborhoods in new york beating the odds st josephs is a run of the mill four story structure of yellow brick like so many buildings in its neighborhood it has heavy wire mesh covering the windows at street level but whats on the inside of that ordinary schoolhouse makes it special for the hispanic african american and west indian students who attend kindergarten through eighth grade it is a place of safety structure and promise in a dangerous and disorderly world the school band which is mandatory for all students from fifth to eighth grade reflects the discipline and sense of accomplishment that are synonymous with st josephs student body eighty percent of the children at the school are from single parent homes or live with their grandparents live in section housing and for of them english is not their first language most come from new yorks notorious south bronx where the citys schools seem to devour the innocent "the public schools in this area arent good " the mother of a third grader on scholarship was quoted as saying in st josephs december newsletter "the kids there grow up too fast i wanted my son to go to a catholic school " no wonder only of new yorks public school students graduate in four years but the number is for st josephs students high graduation rates are a constant at most catholic schools but st josephs is unique even within the parochial system it is the only area catholic school that has an "open enrollment policy " accepting "any child regardless of faith academic ability or emotional stability " this is not as some advocates of the government run public system would have you believe a school that is skimming the cream of the crop new yorks catholic schools have always been a beacon of hope for the poor but its been a long time since they were staffed by nuns who taught as part of their religious vocation today the schools must rely on lay teachers who understandably expect both salaries and benefits about of students receive financial aid and the full tuition of &# per student still falls short of the &# annual cost to give one child a basic education add to this any necessary capital improvements as well as remedial assistance art music physical education and the after school enrichment programs and the bills begin to mount so how is it that st josephs is flourishing and even expanding the answer in a large part lies with the generosity of private donors who have been tapped through an "adopt a school" program of the archdiocese "adoption" here means that individuals commit to a school they begin to see as their own each adopted school also has its own advisory board whose members become personally involved with the students visiting classes and sponsoring and chaperoning excursions thirty six new york archdiocese elementary schools have been adopted and the director of the patrons program says that the bulk of the financial support comes from senior level wall street executives high net worth individuals not only give generously but also open their rolodexes and talk to friends who can help the school with either professional time or money one school was adopted by floor traders from bear stearns who pooled their charitable giving st josephs has been blessed by a single wealthy benefactor an anonymous hedge fund manager this white knight has given nearly &# over the past three years to help fund the renovation of the buildings fourth floor that allowed the school to add new students last year "adopt a school" participants gave &# million in and provided countless hours of pro bono work thats a lot of charity but spend one evening with the st josephs school band and its pretty clear why new yorkers do it in a town that often seems all about money few investments yield such a high rate of return ms ogrady is the journals
