weekend journal review television a vanished life the movies hbo makes are generally so good that i had high hopes for "bury my heart at wounded knee" sunday p m et some of those hopes were not disappointed exquisitely filmed the film captures the natural beauty of a landscape and a people creating a visual record for future generations of a vanished time that would otherwise be unimaginable yet even hbo cant get its arms around the subject and the result sometimes strays into movie of the week territory its mainly the tiny details and nuances for instance in the characterization of sioux chief sitting bull that lift the movie out of the realm of cardboard some skimpiness was inevitable there was no way a two hour movie could reflect the huge sweep of dee alexander browns account of the u s governments brutal subjugation of native americans in the second half of the th century the film necessarily narrows the focus and concentrates on the plight of the sioux and the infamous massacre of more than lakota men women and children near south dakotas pine ridge reservation on dec that effectively ended the so called indian wars even then though it has to whip through three decades of events add to that problem the ample face time for aidan quinn as sen henry dawes and sidebar stories involving other more obscure white folks and theres less space than there might be for the indian story not that the whites are heroes here even sen dawes who passed for a friend of the indians in his day and probably sincerely believed that assimilation was their only chance of survival ultimately contributed to their demise in fact "wounded knee" has few traditional brutes it becomes clear that in some sense the indians worst enemies were those officials including people who knew their language and respected them who sought to save them by foisting on them a culture of dependency the loss of life depicted in the movie whether through diseases such as whooping cough or in the panic and confusion that led to the killings at wounded knee is very sad yet the most affecting scenes are much smaller ones that depict a more existential loss among the living former warriors queuing up for food and blankets on the pine ridge reservation ration cards hanging around their necks or the corral on the reservation where former hunters were allowed to kill their meat the "traditional" way by shooting at penned cows for the depiction of soul destroying destitution nothing in the movie is more powerful than the sight of a simmering pot of mice the only meal now for people who once thrived on buffalo these are the images that will linger in the mind far longer than the stock scenes involving mr quinn and most other historical characters who are put through rather predictable paces here an exception is sitting bull played by august schellenberg a quebec actor of mohawk descent as "wounded knee" opens he is the victorious leader of little big horn and a lone holdout against other famous chiefs who subsequently made peace with the u s government starvation eventually drives him from exile in canada to reservation life in south dakota where his authority is further eroded by the u s introduced concept of equality among men to the mockery of the sioux he once led sitting bull also stars briefly in wild bill codys traveling show but he never fully submits to reservation rules and dies a hero to his people once more although we dont hear much from mr schellenbergs lips about what sitting bull was thinking through all this his performance carries the whole film with his face alone and the tiniest movements of his body he shows us a man struggling against his nature to adapt to circumstances beyond his control the story of what happened to americas indians usually is painted on a big canvas mr schellenberg suggests that a much deeper understanding can be conveyed on a smaller one the starter wife" is a sitcom about divorce that unfolds in miniseries form over six hours usa beginning thursday p m and then continuing every thursday in june from p m debra messing of "will and grace" fame stars as molly kagan the rejected wife of a movie

lifestyle throw in a gay decorator a new girlfriend whos a security guard at the colony gatehouse a suicide and various neighborhood crimes and molly hardly has a moment to miss her old life in other words its pure fluff usa and sponsor ponds have tacked on a lot of anti aging promotions and web site references to the plight of all women who are facing starting over in truth few if any real women are likely to have the luck that molly does in "the starter wife " the only serious note here comes from mr mantegna who adds dramatic heft to an otherwise goofy romp its summer though and theres no shame in seeking out diverting light entertainment the discovery channels "man v wild" is a gem worth seeking out if you havent already stumbled across it fridays p m and a new season begins june each week bear grylls a former soldier in britains sas special air service commandos gets dropped into a jungle desert swamp or some other remote and inhospitable terrain and shows us how to survive and

necessary we too might be able to survive in the wild one thrill of each episode in fact is wondering if the affable host himself will make it out intact
