weekend journal the united states of wine the race to become the next napa valley is on hannah karp on wine tourisms surprising new destinations winemakers in missouri are excited about norton a grape they call the "cabernet of the midwest " one wyoming vineyard is making a robust red from the valiant grape its supposed to pair well with bison even in iowa where demand for ethanol has caused a boom in corn prices some farmers are replanting fields with grapevines the remarkable expansion of wineries to unlikely places has now touched all states including alaska its also reached the point where some of these regions are vying for napa like status among the emerging hotspots texas and idaho its not all novelty wines made from local produce either in arizona a state better known for chimichangas than chardonnay serious winemakers are producing some surprisingly good whites to separate the amateur efforts from the labels worth shipping home we visited dozens of tasting rooms across the country we came across lots of interesting choices including a &# cabernet made from grapes grown miles northwest of chicago and an arizona red that its maker suggests pairing with "scorpion tarantula and rattlesnake meat" elgin winerys &# tombstone red some were truly awful but others could hold their own against established california brands one expert taster raved about a &# cabernet blend from plum creek winery in colorado last year wine tourists spent &# billion sniffing swirling and spitting in buckets across the u s the figure includes travel costs lodging and tours but not wine purchases there are wineries in the country outside of california washington oregon and new york according to the u s alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau and many of them are new in texas wineries opened in up one third in just one year says industry tracking firm wines and vines last year colorado went from wineries to north carolina added last year including rock of ages winery in hurdle mills which grows varietals from syrah to sangiovese last week the winery inaugurated its annual cork and pork festival further off the path montanas wineries grow lesser known varietals like marechal foch and leon millot the grapes may be imported from other states some of louisianas six wineries get their grapes from the texas panhandle or they may not appear in the wine at all most of maines five wineries focus on "vineless" wines using apples and blueberries while alaska with five wineries is home to tipple made from local salmonberries birch sap and dandelions still many states are producing more "serious" stuff often from the same grapes grown in france or california wine spectator magazine which uses a point scale has awarded wines from texas virginia and pennsylvania ratings of and or "outstanding " in chicago charlie trotters serves an illinois cabernet sauvignon alongside bottles from other states including minnesota kentucky and kansas states are pushing wine tourism hard to boost the local economy the texas wine industry contributes more than &# billion a year to the states economy and supports about jobs for texans according to a texas wine and grape growers association report in north carolina a study found that the states wineries were attracting tourists annually and generating &# million a year to draw in travelers dollars states like indiana and minnesota have recently launched official wine trail routes maryland will introduce its first in june beyond marketing floridas department of agriculture is reimbursing growers &# an acre to start their own vineyards other subsidies are helping over the past five years the usdas agricultural development agency has awarded more than &# million in grants and loans to states to help develop their wine industries growers can make good profits in iowa an acre of grapes can yield more than &# a year about times more than an acre of corn even with the recent boom in ethanol demand says michael white a viticulture specialist at iowa state university but startup costs are steep it takes five years before grapes are in full production and many farmers who do make the switch are not prepared for the intensity of labor required in the midwest where grapes are harvested manually one acre of grapes requires about hours of labor per year while corn only requires about an hour and a half per acre brian cochran owner of the six year old dakota hills winery in knox n d used to be a dairy farmer but gave it up because it was too physically demanding his is one of three wineries in north dakota which has the lowest rate of wine consumption of any state now he makes wine from plants like jostaberries and rhubarb as well as from estate grown grapes like elvira and fontenac mr cochran says hes turning a profit on par with what he was making in dairy but adds "this turned out to be pretty demanding too " visitors to these emerging destinations run the gamut rhode island is marketing its wine trail to group tour operators and making sure that wineries have space for buses to park in front texas which grows traditional french grapes like cabernet sauvignon and merlot has attracted more serious connoisseurs some of whom are searching for the next great undiscovered label and in already touristy spots like florida arizona and hawaii tasting rooms are crowded with vacationers who want for a break from the sun or just an excuse to start drinking before noon the personalities behind the wineries vary as well we met owners who had left or retired from careers in criminal law technology and medicine to pursue a passion for wine back in new york we tasted more than two dozen bottles from our travels with a panel that included ralph hersom owner of ralphs wine and spirits in rye n y and former wine director at manhattans le cirque we tasted blind throwing in a few california wines to see how theyd compare here are highlights from the trip colorado the scene wild horses rebel vintners what they grow riesling gewurztraminer syrah colorados mile long grand valley a four hour drive west from denver is the anti napa tastings are free hotels arent deluxe and in palisade colo where most of the wineries are clustered we found only one restaurant open for dinner there tourists can pedal between tasting rooms that sell religious figurines fudge and honey mead farther afield debeque canyon and canyon wind cellars both on the banks of the colorado river make full bodied reds winemaker jeff carr of garfield estates says he picked grand valley as the antithesis of californias commercialization and crowds when we pulled in a "closed" sign was hanging outside the year old barn turned winery though the tasting room was open "were hard to find by design " says mr carr who started the winery in with a colleague from netscape after both sold stock options on our visit we sampled a limited edition of "lagniappe blanc " a dry table wine made from muscat grapes which are used for dessert wines in new york our expert taster said the garfield estates fume blanc lacked the grassy citrusy tastes of its base grape sauvignon blanc mr hersom called it light and incomplete "little more than flavored water " he said mr carr says the fume blanc style may have been different from what mr hersom was expecting but he detected smoky notes and "old world style" in a bottle of plum creek winerys grand mesa &# a blend of cabernet cabernet franc and merlot "id sell that " he said tennessee the scene sweet southern hospitality sweeter wine what they grow concord mmmm welchs and giant muscadine tennessee might be better known for its whiskey but over the past five years a slew of winemakers have started experimenting with california and european varietals country singer kix brooks of brooks and dunn is opening a winery called arrington vineyards next month in arrington tenn just south of nashville where hell be selling dry california style wines to appeal to residents in one of the wealthiest counties in the country "im from louisiana so ive been drinking for a long time " he says but he adds he only got into wine years ago after he started going out west he discovered lafite rothschild when tim mcgraw and faith hill gave him several bottles for christmas a few years ago but with alcohol sales still prohibited in many counties lynchburg moore county home to the jack daniels distillery is dry vintners say many tennesseans prefer sweeter blends on our trip which began in nashville and looped through the gorgeous cumberland plateau the states self proclaimed golf capital we visited wineries and watched fellow tasters skip the dry stuff popular choices include sweet wine made from golf ball sized muscadine grapes orange flavored theme wines for anti florida football fans theres holly ridges gator hater and drinks from concord grapes which one producer called "communion juice with a kick " explains curtis wallin owner of holly ridge vineyards in livingston tenn "i dont care much for sweet wines but i do like the way they ring the cash register " after a palate cleansing interlude of pulled pork we pulled into sumner crest a winery behind a shell station assistant manager jimmie jacobs pointed us toward her best seller a blackberry wine she assured us wouldnt be too sweet because it was made with tart berries it was in fact less syrupy than the colorado cherry wine but our tasters said they could find better use for blackberries said one "id rather have mine in pie " connecticut the scene napa without the traffic what they grow chardonnay and vidal blanc maybe the wine trail is one of connecticuts best kept secrets or maybe we were the only ones crazy enough to sprint around the state tasting wine in the stormy weather last month either way we were happy to have the tasting rooms and hiking trails around lake waramaug to ourselves the states wineries are divided into eastern and western trails while the wine board doesnt recommend cramming each trail into one day we discovered that its possible thanks to bright blue wine trail signs off of every exit ramp and a comprehensive guide offered at every winery with directions and recommended lodgings starting on the eastern trail just east of new haven conn our first stop was bishops orchards whose offerings include an apple pear blend called happily impeared but chardonnay is what the state grows best and most wineries have started making versions aged in stainless steel and oak the state also produces a range of citrusy white varietals like vidal blanc many of which go well with the local shellfish sold at bare bones seafood shacks or upscale oyster bars when it comes to reds many vintners make their wines with out of state grapes a practice common around the country as new wineries wait for their own vines to mature in north stonington conn the five year old jonathan edwards winery makes zinfandels and syrahs with juice from napa we were more intrigued by jonathan edwardss "cult wine" its estate grown gewurztraminer has amassed such a following that this years batch of cases was sold out at &# per bottle before it was released earlier this month we tasted last years vintage and while we thought it was a good drier style gewurtzraminer we didnt see what all the fuss was about illinois the scene wine in the burbs what they grow norton disease resistant chambourcin lynfred winery which was founded in and is illinoiss largest and longest continually operating winery looks a lot like a european chateau with stained glass windows chandeliers and four luxurious suites for overnight guests the view from the balcony not vineyards but a busy intersection just off the freeway minutes from chicago ohare "if only they could pick it up and move it somewhere else " says year old diane shurtleff of wheaton ill a recent visitor who works for a christian book publisher we felt the same about the entire northern illinois wine trail created last year which leads visitors to some lovely tasting rooms but requires hours of driving through industrial parks and bleak prairie roads two of the northern regions more classic looking vineyards galena vineyards in galena and the four year old massbach ridge in nearby elizabeth both on a scenic stretch of the mississippi river are three hours by car from chicago the new wine trails proximity to chicago is a blessing for locals but a disappointment for those hoping for a weekend escape the last stop on the trail two year old coopers hawk winery and restaurant in orland park ill was a mob scene on a recent friday night at least a dozen people were angling for spots at the long tasting room bar in front eight tastings cost &# and there was a minute wait for a table for two at the bistro first timer mamie tolbert a year old teacher in chicago had come with three friends for a birthday celebration after their first taste a generous pour of sauvignon blanc made with grapes from california two of the women winced "this tastes like cologne " ms tolbert says our expert had a similar response when he tried a bottle wed brought back from valentino vineyards in long grove ill owned by former racecar driver rudy valentino di tommaso he described his ventura as a robust unfiltered dry white made from a canadian grape of the same name "it goes great with a bratwurst " he says adding its popular with beer drinkers mr hersom however took one sniff inspected the wines "funky golden color " and declared it "flawed" oxidized like sherry and tough to swallow mr di tommaso says the ventura doesnt travel well and would have fared better had we let it settle for several weeks and then decanted it arizona the scene red rocks winemaking rock stars what they grow syrah merlot cabernet our expert was sure it was from california a textbook chardonnay with a nice nose and a long palate he said it would be a possible contender for a double gold medal in competition it was actually from alcantara vineyards a brand new winery near a trailer park on the outskirts of small town cottonwood ariz to our surprise arizona wines topped nearly every category in our tasting beating even the california ringers page springss &# vino de la familia blanca made from arizona grown malvasia bianca trumped the &# conundrum a white from california grown the same year the rancho rossa syrah we bought at cave creek wines a four year old wine store and tasting room in a strip mall miles north of downtown phoenix was the best of the reds we tried big and complex with explosive fruit two wines from echo canyon in sedona ariz a syrah and a big jammy red blend called "triad" were close behind we were lucky to find them the wine industry in northern arizona centers around sedona a high altitude area with dramatic temperature swings and rich volcanic soils wineries are sprouting up so quickly that tourist boards and mapmakers havent kept up and neither alcantara vineyards nor page springs cellars were on the arizona wine growers associations online wine trail map but seek and ye shall find jon marcus vintner at the hard to find echo canyon says hell open a bottle for anyone who braves the treacherous two mile dirt road to his acre estate which he says neighbors the property of sen john mccain another of the regions elusive wines is being made by maynard james keenan the lead singer of rock band tool mr keenan doesnt have his own tasting room but his label called caduceus is sold at page springs cellars where vintner eric glomsky helps him produce it mr keenan describes one of the wines as tasting like "cherries from the planet krypton " when we visited page springs had been sold out of the wine for months bottles are back on the shelves now for &# and &# for many wine tourists the thrill is in the chase last month dan and judi kvachuk were driving along page springs road south of sedona when they stumbled on a winery called javelina leap owner rod snapp is just getting it up and running hes still waiting for his vines to mature and his open air tasting room is open only on weekends but he invited the retired salt lake city couple inside for a weekday cellar tour mr snapp opened a bottle of zinfandel he makes from grapes grown in paso robles calif and the threesome emerged an hour and a half later having finished the bottle "we didnt want to leave " ms kvachuk says
