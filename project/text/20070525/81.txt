states paycheck protection law is flawed washington gov christine gregoire and washington education association wea union officials certainly deserve criticism for their last ditch effort to tamper with the pending davenport v wea supreme court case but your may editorial "paycheck protection end run" grossly inflated the impact of the underlying washington law at issue in the case while well meaning washingtons so called "paycheck protection" law has not reduced the mandatory dues union officials collect from employees for political activism because it contains fundamental flaws the law is merely a campaign finance regulation that governs a tiny percentage of union political activity at the state level so union officials simply adjusted their accounting methods tweaked their spending practices and continued business as usual in fact analyses of the teachers unions finances shortly after the "paycheck protection" law took effect showed that union officials spent more dues money on politics the spending has continued to increase ever since fortunately the pending davenport case goes beyond simply defending this hollow law national right to work foundation attorneys brought davenport on behalf of nonunion teachers and are asking the high court to clarify that employees who resign from union membership are inherently "dissenters" against paying for union activities this simple clarification would free one million nonunion workers in america of the union requirement to object affirmatively every single year simply to reclaim hundreds of dollars deducted from their paychecks with their "emergency" amendment which itself happens to be unconstitutional gov gregoire and her union benefactors hope to give the supreme court an excuse not to rule but their concern is not that the "paycheck protection" law had ever drained the unions political coffers their real fear is a ruling that strengthens the first amendment protections available to americas employees forced to pay union dues stefan gleason vice president national right to work legal defense foundation springfield va see related letter "letters to the editor paycheck protection laws slashed pac contributions" wsj june
