weekend journal tastings how to make wine and cookouts a perfect match going beyond beer at summer barbecues rule no simplicity everybody into the pool its finally time to get out of the house and into a big glass of refreshing hot weather wine what wines are perfect with cookouts and other summertime entertaining heres a short list but first lets talk a little about how to serve them consider for a minute why so many people drink beer at summer events its refreshing and thirst quenching to be sure but its also easy and unfussy put the beer on ice open the bottle or can and drink its a beverage not a talking point theres no reason wine cant be enjoyed just as simply more fine wines are being packaged with screw tops so you might want to look for those when you are shopping the aisle of new zealand wines for instance is filled with them whether its a red or a white just put it on ice in the tub with the beer if youd like it warmer when you take it out it will warm up quickly enough once its poured but you also might find that you like it with a little chill and dont fret about the glasses yes wine is better in real glasses but wed rather have a glass of wine in a plastic cup than no wine at all wed urge you to look at the alcohol content of any wine you buy for warm weather entertaining we dont know about you but we find that alcohol and sun are a bad combination for us and these days even the simplest merlots and chardonnays can sometimes have alcohol contents of or more but wed avoid merlot and chardonnay anyway because so many these days are ponderous and sweet just what we dont want for summertime what do we want here are some ideas malbec from argentina whats a more popular summertime food than barbecued meat and with barbecued meat ribs burgers steaks you name it there are few tastier wines than malbec its a red wine that tastes like ripe blackberries bursting with fruit with some smoke and black pepper most important the best have a bright acidity that keeps them from being too heavy for summer just a few good names to look for are alamos bodega catena zapata altos las hormigas bodega norton catena finca flichman and navarro correas beaujolais one of the many great things about beaujolais is that it pairs with just about any kind of food so whether youre grilling salmon or serving spare ribs or barbecued chicken it works beaujolais can also be served at all temperatures be sure to buy or beaujolais but not nouveau and wed concentrate on the cru wines from villages such as fleurie for our recent column on beaujolais drop us a note at wine wsj com riesling finally more and more people are discovering that riesling isnt the sweet simple wine of their youth but is instead light delightful mouth watering and oh so easy to drink germany is the classic home of riesling look for riesling kabinett on the label and youll be fine but more good riesling is being made in the u s too especially in northern states such as michigan and new york riesling is also somewhat trendy at the moment so serving this wine at your gathering will show your good taste pair it with curried chicken salad with grapes fruit salads veal or chicken or pork with cream sauces waldorf salad pork chops spicy foods like thai cuisine or sates on skewers with peanut sauce sauvignon blanc from chile good sauvignon blanc is coming from all over the world these days new zealand is a good choice too but its hard to beat the value of chiles crisp lovely sauvignon blanc in fact when we were asked this month to provide the wine for a parents event at our girls high school we brought a case of concha y toro "casillero del diablo" sauvignon blanc that cost us just &# a bottle with a case discount the parents loved it and even though many of them are well off they loved it even more when they found out about the price this is why rich people are rich we figure among many other good names are anakena la playa miguel torres morande and santa rita be sure to get or ideally if you see it these pair well with grilled or fried seafood pork chops peel and eat shrimp and spicy dishes in general if you prefer to stick with an american sauvignon blanc and missed our last column drop us a note at wine wsj com and well send it along vinho verde this wine from portugal is especially good on sunny days because its so refreshing vinho verde is almost colorless with some spritz that adds to the fun of it it is very light in taste and in alcohol often around compared with for many wines it has great acidity and hints of citrus sometimes peaches and flowers its a food friendly wine good with three cheese pizza and seafood prepared any way among good names to look for are arca nova casal garcia famega gazela and portal do fidalgo white bordeaux there are some pretty serious gatherings during the summer too of course if we were to throw a dinner party at our house in the hamptons for instance wed serve white bordeaux ok we dont have a house in the hamptons but if we did its one of the worlds more elegant white wines made from sauvignon blanc and semillon look for pessac leognan on the label thats a particularly good region and it will be hard to go wrong this will likely be more expensive than the other wines on this list but the wine has a stature that makes it worth the cost these go well with chicken or veal or anything in a cream sauce stuffed or grilled mushrooms grilled baked or fried seafood even oysters on the half shell and chilled lobster we havent included any sparkling wines on this list because some people might think theyre too fussy and formal but it might be fun to serve something bubbly if you do look for cava from spain or prosecco from italy which is light and lovely and slightly spritzy we have one more idea for warm weather but its such a hot topic that it requires an entire column so check back next week welcome to summer its time for our semiannual reminder of who we are and what this column is about we have been enjoying and studying wine together since we never wrote about the subject until when weekend journal began and we were asked to create a weekly wine column at the time john was page one editor of the journal and dottie was news editor for urban affairs we became full time wine writers in in addition to this column we write "wine notes" in the pursuits section of the journals weekend edition and a monthly column on wine for smartmoney magazine we are the authors of four books on wine our older daughter media will attend barnard college in the fall our younger daughter zoe is a junior in high school and beginning her college search now we buy the wines we taste for this column from retail shelves all over the u s the journal pays for the wine which we taste blind unless noted otherwise we dont accept free wine and we attend only events that are open to the public in our blind tastings we are trying to get an overall sense of whether a particular kind of wine is a good value at this time for instance based on our tastings we believe that generally american pinot noir is a reliable value right now while new zealand pinot noir is not as reliable a value more broadly our column focuses on wine enjoyment as a lifestyle to us wine is not a liquid to be judged and quantified in a vacuum the index that often runs with this column is not a "buying guide " its impossible to know what wines you might find so any list of what to buy or not to buy wont generally be useful in most cases rather in our list we hope to give you an overall idea of what these wines taste like at their best and how much they cost if the descriptions move you to want to try that kind of wine you should ask a wine merchant for an example of the wine that has those characteristics we are often asked where we get ideas for columns many of them are based on the season right now for instance many people are wondering about what wines to drink at outdoor events while champagne is a hot topic at the end of the year many ideas however come from readers because we correspond with thousands of readers every year we get insight into what people really want to know about wine as opposed to what wine writers think they want to know we never would have guessed for instance that questions about wine related headaches would be so very common for our column about headaches to make a comment or to ask a question drop us a note at wine wsj com were unable to respond to all letters but we do our best
