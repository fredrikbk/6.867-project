not your fathers pay why wages today are weaker american men in their s today are worse off than their fathers generation a reversal from just a decade ago when sons generally were better off than their fathers a new study finds the study the first in a series on economic mobility undertaken by several prominent think tanks also says the typical american familys income has lagged far behind productivity growth since a departure from most of the post world war ii period the findings suggest "the up escalator that has historically ensured that each generation would do better than the last may not be working very well " says the study which is scheduled for release today the study was written principally by john morton of the pew charitable trusts which is leading the series called the economic mobility project and isabel sawhill of the brookings institution other participating think tanks are the heritage foundation american enterprise institute and the urban institute in the median income for a man in his s which is a good predictor of his lifetime earnings was &# the study says less than for men in their s in their fathers generation adjusted for inflation just a decade ago median income for men in their s was &# higher than years earlier the median is the midpoint half of men earn more half earn less ms sawhill said she isnt sure why mens wages have stagnated "it seems theres been some slowdown in economic growth its possible that the movement of women into the labor force has affected male earnings and its possible that men are not working as hard as they used to " the study suggests that absolute mobility the rate at which an entire generations lot improves relative to previous generations has declined in recent years but within a particular generation individuals can still get ahead if relative mobility the rate at which the rich and poor trade places remains high poor fathers for example may have rich sons and vice versa to determine whether relative mobility is high would require studying specific parents and their children rather than broad categories mr morton said the group will tackle that in a later analysis the report also found that between and productivity or output per hour and median family income adjusted for inflation both roughly doubled between and productivity rose while income rose between and productivity rose while median income fell challenging "the notion that a rising tide will lift all boats " the report says ms sawhill said several factors could explain the divergence a growing share of income going to the highest paid workers or to profits an increased share of labor compensation going toward benefits such as health care or a decline in the number of wage earners or hours worked in the typical family bill beach of the heritage foundation said increased immigration could also have pulled down median wages since most immigrants at first earn less than native born workers but he said their incomes may also move up more rapidly in subsequent years see related letter "letters to the editor mens median incomes still rising each decade" wsj june
