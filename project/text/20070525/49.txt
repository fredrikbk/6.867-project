about the gorilla except for the handful of people who are trying to keep it a secret the gorilla is what south dakotans are calling a huge multibillion dollar manufacturing operation that a highly secretive backer wants to build in this remote southeast corner of the state what locals know is this since august or september three real estate agents representing an unidentified company have been negotiating with farmers to acquire options to buy swaths of land now used mostly to raise corn and soybeans the mystery has turned some residents into sleuths they swap tidbits about the gorilla after sunday services at the lutheran church on tree lined main street or while waiting in line for chili dogs at ollies drive inn others have taken to the internet following leads that trail off at multinational companies texas consulting firms and mysterious out of town executives "there have been so many stories " says barb bernard years old who agreed with her husband to sell options on their acres "we have no idea what it is " residents are amazed that in this small midwestern town details havent leaked out at least three locals board members of the elk point economic development corp which is funded by local businesses as well as the city know about the initiative but have signed nondisclosure agreements south dakota gov mike rounds knows the suitor as do members of the states economic development office hints have emerged farmers say real estate agents have told them the gorilla may encompass acres roughly square miles and bring permanent well paying jobs some construction workers would be needed over three years total price for the plant the real estate agents say &# billion to &# billion a hefty sum in a state whose economic output was &# billion locals speculate the land will be used for an oil refinery or maybe a new toyota plant landowner tim irwin says he successfully started a rumor that itll be an adult toy manufacturer "i dont care what it is " says scott bruning the year old football coach at elk point jefferson high school "as long as it brings me four kids who are about foot and pounds " the sioux city journal just down the missouri river in sioux city iowa is running a contest called "the big guess " offering a flat screen tv to the reader who correctly predicts the nature of the project about people have entered elk points local newspaper the weekly southern union county leader courier has shed less light its publisher bruce odson is one of the development board members he says his dual role hasnt affected coverage "we dont cover rumors " said mr odson jim cody the owner of the town steakhouse spent much of the past six months at home with a lung hernia and used his time to dig deeper each time he heard a clue he hit the internet with his six year old gateway computer to check it out "it could be an oil refinery and a petrochemical plant " says mr cody to explain his theory he sketches a map on a white notepad showing how the company behind the gorilla has bought land options in two separate sites in elk point one plot near the missouri river and another larger site close to interstate then he slides a glossy conocophillips corporate publication across the table and points to a page detailing an oil refinery in roxana ill "i went on google " he says and looked at a satellite image of the refinery "it looks just like elk point " a conocophillips spokesman said he was unaware of the company pursuing a project in south dakota mr cody compares notes with fellow sleuth john w curry an year old world war ii veteran on a recent morning mr curry dropped by mr codys western themed restaurant codys homestead and unfurled a wrinkled map of union county population that shows each section of farmland mr curry pointed to about a dozen plots hed colored with green or yellow markers "those are the people that have sold options " he said "the black and blue are ones i think will sell " tensions are rising some residents worry about changes to their placid town and others fear the worst that the project could entail a process that carries potential health or environmental risks such as a nuclear power plant several residents have formed a grass roots anti gorilla group called the citizens for union county committee it is calling for residents not to sell land unless the projects specifics are unveiled member burdette hanson whos been farming since he was says he has rebuffed offers on more than acres of his familys land potentially disrupting the project "im not for sale " he declared over strawberry pie and iced tea at the home of friend dale harkness whos fighting the project with him "you cant buy happiness " gov rounds says the suitor has promised there would be "no adverse environmental impact" to the state he declined to provide specific details about the project saying that the company wants to remain anonymous because its in a competitive industry other states he says may also be under consideration if the project moves ahead it would need to clear a planning and zoning approval process in union county and pass muster with environmental and other agencies of the state government according to a spokesman for the governor the governors office confirmed that it furnished the gorilla name an homage both to the projects size and in honor of a handful of yard art gorilla statues visible along interstate near town occasionally companies acquire land secretly while planning a major project in the s for instance walt disney co famously used phony corporate names while snapping up land in florida that later became walt disney world and in many such cases the projects never move forward companies frequently buy land options only to scrap them later options buyers promise small sums up front in exchange for the right at a later date to buy property at a set price in elk point one landowner who took the option deal described receiving a payment of &# per acre with promises of &# next year and &# for the next few years after that until the land is sold or the option expires landowners say while the three real estate brokers offer broad outlines of the project they say they dont know the specifics "i have no knowledge of what the facility is " says one of the brokers chuck molstad of canton s d several landowners say theyve been told the company would employ a technology or process not currently used in the u s that may point to a new type of fuel creation such as a plant that converts coal into a liquid fuel that can be put into regular diesel engines a process in use in several countries such a facility could generate electricity and produce ultraclean diesel jet or other fuels in the past few weeks messrs cody and curry stumbled onto some tantalizing new evidence they got word that a man named richard e white is the "r e white" whose signature is on land option papers filed at the courthouse mr cody searched the web and found a detailed biography of a richard e white of findlay ohio whos a former senior executive at marathon oil corp mr white who played on indiana universitys national championship mens basketball team retired in from marathon where his work included real estate transactions "we think he could be involved " says mr cody "but we dont have dna " across town jason quam took up the gorilla hunt last month deciding that if he knew the buyers identity and finances he would have a stronger negotiating position his parents andrew and judith quam have been talking to the buyers about agreeing to an option to sell acres at a price of &# an acre about twice what farmland had been fetching in recent years jason says hes also trying to get more for a acre plot he owns last week he had a breakthrough after hours of digging online the younger mr quam downloaded from the web site for hancock county ohio a mortgage document signed by a mr white for a home in findlay the signature "r e white" matched the signature on the elk point documents mr quam says theres little doubt a major energy company is behind the gorilla and mr white is consulting for it mr white didnt respond to repeated calls to his home for comment paul weeditz a marathon spokesman says the company is not involved in the project for now mr quam is holding out for a better offer "im playing hardball " he
