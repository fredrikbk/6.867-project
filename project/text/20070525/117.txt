jogged and picnicked on the sprawling grounds of the acre thoms estate with the permission of the owner so when a developers plan to build a gated community on the property became public opposition was fierce "there hasnt been the sense that this is my land stay off " says susan sihler a clinical social worker who lives nearby and attended a raucous hearing on the matter last february worried that too much open green space is being fenced off inside exclusive gated enclaves communities are stepping up measures to curb such developments in waco texas voters this month defeated a proposal to sell public park land to a developer who wanted to build a gated complex there officials in boulder city nev who have watched such developments engulf nearby las vegas and henderson have banned them outright a similar measure is under consideration in asheville last year a los angeles man filed suit against a gated project in canyon lake calif charging it illegally prevented him from boating on a publicly accessible lake the development claims is private property gated developments have faced opposition since they started to gain popularity in the s with critics calling them divisive and a threat to a communitys social fabric the new round of protests comes as the amount of open space in the united states is shrinking approximately million acres of open space were lost to development from through about acres a day according to an analysis by the u s department of agricultures forest service the pace of loss particularly due to residential development is quickening the forest service says at the same time the number of gated communities across the country although still relatively small is growing some million americans lived in gated communities in up since according to the latest american housing survey by the u s census bureau in some areas particularly in the sunbelt most new development is behind gates gated communities have their defenders who argue that some actually protect natural wildlife habitats in a number of areas officials have leveraged givebacks from developers requiring or cajoling them to set aside vast amounts of greenery in return for permission to build the sort of compromise championed by wildlife organizations the developers of santa lucia preserve a square mile gated community near carmel calif for instance agreed to leave nine tenths of the tract vacant under a conservation easement in exchange for the right to sell lots to builders municipal managers coping with tight budgets often have mixed feelings amenities such as hiking trails and gardens inside a gated development funded by the homeowners association do serve the needs of the people who live there if not the community at large as a result some officials informally include such private park like land when they assess the amount of green space and other recreational facilities needed in their growing municipalities the rule of thumb is about acres of green space per citizens such calculations come as monies for public park development are decreasing the land and water conservation fund a federal program that provides matching funds for parkland development was cut from to the bush administrations proposed budget for the fund for fiscal year eliminates grants to states for local park projects developers are touting their efforts to be good stewards the company behind the cliffs at keowee falls in lake keowee s c brought in about boulders each weighing more than a ton to stabilize the muddy banks of falls creek which runs through the communitys golf course at a cost of &# million the lake club a gated community in bradenton fla that opened in january and will eventually have homes and condos ranging in price from &# million to &# million is on acres dotted with lakes nature preserves and walking trails with concrete pavers designed to limit soil erosion sondra guffey a spokeswoman for the company says the lush development was carved out of "ugly flat tomato fields" at a cost of more than &# million "this wouldnt have happened without us " she says of course gates also translate into higher asking prices on average developers get more for homes in gated communities according to the national association of home builders some citizens are mobilizing to protect what public green space they have in january angry waco residents at a hearing urged officials of the texas city not to sell six acres of viking park a acre neighborhood recreation space to a developer who wanted to build a home gated community the developer hack branch had promised &# to the city to fix up the rest of the park adding such features as a gazebo barbecue area and bike trails at the city meeting viking supporters argued that privatizing a third of the park wasnt worth these goodies and that the city would eventually add them itself rusty black wacos municipal services director says the city already has more than acres of open space "more than ample" to serve its population of but the recreational demands people are making of public parkland have increased exponentially in the past three decades he says and stretched budgets just cant keep up without the sale he says residents will have to wait as long as years to get the upgrades voters werent persuaded on may they defeated the sale of the land established years ago to support the construction of the hoover dam boulder city nev encompasses more than square miles of desert landscape punctuated by locust and pine trees about of which is a protected tortoise preserve twenty five miles from las vegas the population is still small about people but expanding quickly due to an influx of retirees and other outsiders in april after some of these residents asked if they could wall off their newly built neighborhoods local officials responded by passing an ordinance prohibiting gated developments "we didnt want to divide the city " mayor bob ferraro says asheville n c residents expressed similar concerns at the public hearing in february this hillside town best known for biltmore its famous victorian chateau and a lively bluegrass scene has been discovered by outsiders in the last decade and the population is exploding "were facing the largest building boom since the s " councilwoman robin cape says kathi petersen a spokeswoman for developer kent smith says he was surprised by the vehemence of the opposition to his plans for thoms estate which he is developing in a joint venture with the lands owner "hes never had that kind of negative reaction before " she says mr smith resubmitted his proposal to allow bicyclists and pedestrians at all times and block automobile access only at night the council approved the plan but the gated community may be the last in asheville on june the council will consider an amendment to ban new ones not all such communities are fortresses some leave their gates unlocked while others have railroad crossing style gates at the entry that anyone can duck under and security can be spotty since many of the developments are vast and guarded at only one or two entry points often critics say the people who are most likely to be deterred by imposing gates arent criminals but rather homeowners who live nearby retired teacher bill paul used to ramble along the land thats now colliers reserve a acre riverfront country club in naples fla now he only glimpses its palm trees and lakes through tall wrought iron gates "i liked it so much better when everything was open " he says similarly james anderson an aerospace company program manager used to bike on a section of the potomac river near his home in leesburg va before it became river creek a community protected by serpentine stone walls and iron gates he now enters only when hes invited by a friend "you cant go in without being noticed " he says "i wouldnt even try it " some online forums hint that trespassing attempts are common in one heavytrash com two anonymous bloggers traded posts about park la brea a acre california gated community with palm fringed streets and community gardens one bragged "while there is limited vehicle access any pedestrian can enter park la brea hrs day " but another countered "the comment about pedestrian access to park la brea is a lie ive tried a couple of times to get through there and it doesnt work " many communities are going to great lengths to exclude outsiders the custom homes on shorebird island in redwood city calif have private docks and lagoons and are surrounded by a moat visitors can get in only through a guarded gate the acres in lost tree village in north palm beach fla which has lakes fringed with mangroves and an oceanfront beach club are patrolled by guards in golf carts accompanied by dogs homeowners in gated complexes argue that if theyve paid to build and maintain their green space and amenities they should have exclusive right to use them and in general courts agree but things are not always clear cut some lawsuits hinge on the fact that gates block access to trails that have long been used to access public parkland or to lakes that receive taxpayer funds mark bolanos made no effort to conceal himself when he went fishing on canyon lake in california last august the year old police officer claims the acre lake miles south of los angeles is open to all under state law because it is partly supported by public tax dollars members of the adjacent gated community also called canyon lake who pay about &# a year to the municipal water district for exclusive surface rights to the lake disagree "its confiscation of private property " says peter racobs an attorney for the association to make his point mr bolanos walked to the lake through federal lands next door launched a rubber raft and started fishing right off the communitys shoreline ordered off the lake by a security guard mr bolanos eventually agreed to leave when a deputy sherriff arrived and threatened him with arrest with the help of an attorney whos handling the case pro bono mr bolanos filed suit in los angeles superior court last fall claiming he was unlawfully barred from the lake the case is pending says mr bolanos who has already spent &# out of his own pocket for court costs and fees "if i dont do something now what will my young son be able to use when he grows up " compromises have been reached in some disputes a year ago two groups canyonback alliance and save our mountains filed suit against the developer of mountaingate another community outside los angeles the suit claimed that gates and fences topped by concertina wire blocked trails to wilderness areas that had been publicly used since the s in july the suit was dropped after the developer agreed to spend about &# to build a two mile trail along the perimeter of the community so bikers and hikers can gain access to the public lands tom freeman the attorney who represented the plaintiffs said that while theres nothing wrong with people wanting to live in natural beauty "the problem is when they want to take it all for themselves "
