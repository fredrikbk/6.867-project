weekend journal hollywood report at hairspray gets a third do movie musical faces spotty record of genre a year to woo travolta after starring in the most successful movie musical of all time "grease " john travolta spent almost years turning down offers to make a singing and dancing comeback he finally caved in last year when the director of a new movie musical version of john waterss offbeat "hairspray" suggested he play a woman "that way you wont be competing with danny zuko " adam shankman told mr travolta referring to his leather clad character in "grease " the timing was fortuitous mr travoltas decision to return to movie musicals this summer coincides with a revival of the genre not seen since the days of "mary poppins " after "chicago" burst onto the scene in studios have displayed a big appetite for musicals despite a box office track record that has hit a few sour notes this september will see the arrival of "across the universe " a romantic musical that uses beatles songs to tell the story "sweeney todd " starring johnny depp will hit movie theaters this christmas "chicago" director rob marshall is working on an adaptation of "nine " the broadway musical about a film director facing a midlife crisis a movie of the abba fueled "mamma mia " starts production this summer and studio executives are elbowing each other to land two other current broadway hits "spring awakening" and "jersey boys " "this decade there will be more movie musicals than at any time since the s " says bill condon who wrote the screenplay for "chicago" and directed last years "dreamgirls" movie yet a handful of duds since "chicago" underscores the fact that adapting broadway shows remains tricky "rent " "the producers" and "the phantom of the opera" all thrived on broadway but stumbled badly in the u s when adapted for the silver screen with a &# million budget "hairspray" doesnt come without some risk for its backer new line cinema although the studio believes it will be mitigated by a generation spanning cast and a timeless story new line co chairman michael lynne says some recent movie musicals didnt work because they "were too slavish to the broadway musical itself " he says the key is to "reinvent" the material to make it more cinematic with that in mind the new "hairspray" has taken its time in fact it took so long that the production lost its original directors two principals from the broadway show who had to leave for prior commitments new line kicked off the saga years ago with a movie by mr waters a director who at the time was best known for cult comedies like "pink flamingos" and "polyester " which starred the late plus size transvestite divine "hairspray" tells mr waterss fictional tale of heavy teenager tracy turnblad originally played by ricki lake who fights for racial integration after landing a spot on an "american bandstand" like tv show in the s "hairspray" made a limp debut at the box office but developed a following on home video with young fans singing along to the catchy tunes more than a decade later new line made a version for broadway and this time it became an instant hit the success prompted new line to start plotting another movie "chicago" was a big factor in that decision the film version of the broadway hit reminded hollywood that audiences could relate to song and dance movies one off movie hits like "grease" had made a huge splash but the genre had cooled since the s after a new wave of filmmaking arrived and the artificial conventions of musicals no longer seemed to have appeal "audiences wanted something more real " says mr condon "chicago" pulled in audiences with an a list cast and an approach that avoided the rigid "break into song" style of traditional musicals something that some of the big name movie musicals that followed didnt do the failure of those films showed that there were indeed new rules for the modern musical and mr lynne says filmmakers began to think more carefully about how they approached the genre "across the universe " for instance spent much of the past year being tweaked after executives behind the movie felt it needed more work much to the chagrin of director and broadway veteran julie taymor according to people involved with the project jennifer todd the movies co producer says the filmmakers now have a version that pleases everyone mr lynnes team took its time holding out for a strong script and an a list cast after a lengthy search for a new director new line ultimately settled on mr shankman a choreographer whose directing expertise lay in comedies like "cheaper by the dozen " mr shankmans first stop was mr waters over lunch in mr waterss native baltimore the quirky director who has played only a minor role in the new movie had some simple advice "do your own thing " recalls mr shankman he also urged mr shankman to pick a fat girl to play the main character tracy and not just hollywood fat after a national search mr shankman found his unlikely tracy nikki blonsky a cold stone creamery ice cream counter girl with no professional acting experience as "chicago" had shown audiences for the modern movie musical care a lot about casting the producers spent more than a year persuading mr travolta to play edna turnblad tracys hefty mother michelle pfeiffer who as an aspiring star had played the lead in "grease " also came on board as the villainous tv station manager and queen latifah signed on as motormouth maybelle who hosts the fictional tv stations dance show for black teens at the time walt disney co s "high school musical" had become a huge hit among kids and mr shankman cast one of its stars zac efron as tracys beau in reinventing the material the producers said there were certain rules they followed marc shaiman the composer co lyricist and executive producer says the stage version could get by with "energy and imagery " "in the movie its all about storytelling you need to get to the crux as fast as you can " he says co producer craig zadan adds they had to be ruthless about the songs "you cant shoehorn music in unless it supports the story " he says that meant cutting and tweaking a show stopping ballad by motormouth maybelle became a civil rights march anthem "its thrilling to hear a great performer sing center stage but in a movie there needs to be more movement " says co producer neil meron who was an executive producer of "chicago" with mr zadan the team added four new songs to support the story but they later cut one a solo by tracy because they felt it was repetitive one challenge is the context of the songs "hairspray" has various "break into song" moments in everyday situations the movie opens for instance with tracy singing and dancing her way to school by contrast the "chicago" team set its musical numbers in a fantasy vaudeville world mr shankman says he never wanted to be apologetic about "hairspray" being a musical although he opted against passers by joining in the singing in the opening number like "grease" and "high school musical " "hairspray" may also have more latitude as a comedy
