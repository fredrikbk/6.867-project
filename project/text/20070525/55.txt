mission possible if theres a smarter guy in washington right now than sen chuck schumer republicans havent noticed the new york democrat is doggedly working to dismantle whats left of the bush presidency with barely an ounce of pushback from the other side mr schumer was the instigator of the democrats probe into the firing of eight u s attorneys although note that the question of who fired which prosecutor is already yesterdays news the attorneys mess was just an opening a hook that is now allowing mr schumer to escalate into an assault on the wider administration as well as presidential authority over key programs such as wiretapping the ultimate goal surround the bush presidency in a mist of incompetence and corruption force attorney general alberto gonzales to go get a special prosecutor appointed to examine the many supposed misdeeds and then sit back and ride the steady drip drip of negative bush headlines all the way to more senate seats and the oval office lucky for mr schumer who leads his partys election effort as head of the democratic senatorial campaign committee most of his gop counterparts are blankly sitting by nothing exemplified the schumer strategy better than last weeks staged testimony of former deputy attorney general james comey democrats entitled the hearing "part iv" of their investigation into whether the department of justice was "politicizing the hiring and firing of u s attorneys " curiously mr comey was the sole witness and more curiously mr schumer appeared to be running the show in place of judiciary chairman pat leahy yet all became clear when mr schumer explained that his real concern wasnt so much this ole piddling attorneys thing as it was that "law and order take a back seat to the political needs of the presidents party " he then invited mr comey to spend the hearing talking not about prosecutors but about "an incident from the time that mr gonzales served as white house counsel " that incident involved the visit of mr gonzales and chief of staff andy card to then attorney general john ashcroft in the intensive care unit of the hospital they wanted mr ashcroft to sign off on the nsas wiretapping authority which mr comey as acting ag had declined to do the ashcroft in his hospital bed story is in fact prehistoric news leaked all the way back in mr comeys added value was to pad it with a few breathless details about siren filled races through d c and orders to fbi agents that he not be allowed to be removed from mr ashcrofts hospital room tom clancy couldnt have spun a better yarn and the washington press corps much to mr schumers satisfaction slurped it up dutifully writing stories suggesting mr gonzales was some white house heavy whose job it was to rough up hospital invalids and forcibly institute legally suspect programs alberto the knife mr schumer had cooked up this dramatic event with mr comey a week in advance though that should come as little surprise it was the senator who signed off on mr comeys appointment as u s attorney for the southern district of new york where the two men would have forged a relationship mr comey is himself one of those self styled boy scouts who hasnt in the past been averse to inflicting damage on the president who appointed him it was mr comey as deputy attorney general who named his buddy patrick fitzgerald to investigate the valerie plame leak mr comey then checked out and the result was the scooter libby conviction whatever the motivations the event has allowed mr schumer to keep rolling upwards toward pennsylvania avenue he has since explained that in light of mr comeys testimony it is imperative to find out just who in the white house sent mr gonzales to the hospital mr bush mr cheney mr cheneys chief of staff expect that new investigation to last months democrats are calling for a vote of no confidence in the attorney general which they hope will finally force a resignation should he go you can bet theyll claim this is reason enough for his successor to appoint a special prosecutor to look into everything mr gonzales touched "torture memos " guantanamo as a bonus the affair has given democrats cover to further attempt to hamstring the presidents surveillance powers the only guy who seems wise to this game is pennsylvania republican arlen specter while it didnt get much notice mr specter had his own questions for mr comey and ultimately got the former dojer to admit that in fact no one had pressured him to change his views on the wiretapping program that president bush had instead told mr comey to do what he thought was right and that the program had gone ahead legally in short this was a straightforward policy dispute between serious bush officials one that an aggrieved mr comey and a politically motivated mr schumer had nonetheless managed to spin into the stuff of scandal sen specter while hardly a cheerleader for mr gonzales also took care to draw a line between a narrow investigation into whether there had been "chicanery" in the attorney firings none has been shown and broader attacks on presidential authority this places him nearly alone among his gop colleagues the majority of senate republicans are of the view that anything to do with mr gonzales is too politically messy to touch and that its easier to pretend none of this is happening mr specter was the lone republican even to show up for the comey hearing theyd do well to wake up congressional republicans have been dealt a tough hand the white house and in particular the justice department have handled the attorneys affair abysmally mr gonzales has come across as an absentee leader top officials have offered lame and conflicting explanations of what happened and the justice department blithely turned over documents that assured months of congressional digging jumping into this mess wont be fun but if republicans dont engage soon mr schumer will be free to expand this probe until it engulfs the presidency and the wider party in the process stripping both of their ability to defend and continue key wartime programs the gop lost the recent congressional elections in part because democrats painted them as incapable and ethically suspect mr schumer led that effort in the senate and knows it can work are they going to let him do it again
