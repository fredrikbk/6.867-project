weekend journal the wealth report flip that yacht rich buyers sell unfinished boats reaping millions in profits terry taylor a florida car dealer has purchased five yachts since but dont expect to see him anchoring off the coast of cannes this week mr taylor is boatless having sold all of his yachts to other buyers for huge profits "i wouldnt feel too bad for terry " jokes felix sabates a partner in trinity yachts of gulfport miss which built mr taylors boats "hes probably made more money off those boats than we did " mr taylor is part of a new breed of wealthy boat buyers yacht flippers who sell their costly purchases often without taking them on a single cruise with demand for large yachts far outstripping supply the market for half finished or recently completed boats is soaring some buyers are selling their boats months before theyre ready for millions more than they agreed to pay others are auctioning off their slots on yacht builder waiting lines todays new rich being entrepreneurial cant resist the lure of the deal even when it comes to the multimillion dollar toys they are buying for their own pleasure yacht flippers are the superrich cousins of the real estate flippers of the housing boom just as speculators bought florida condos only to sell them often unfinished months later which worked fine until prices fell yacht flippers are banking on rising prices to buoy their investments "the risk i guess is that the yacht market collapses " says billy smith a partner in trinity "but with all the wealth thats being created there are no signs that that will happen " that may be true today but the yacht building industry has a history of ups and downs that in some ways mirrors the real estate market still flippers are a tiny minority of yacht buyers and their wealth should allow most of them to hold on to their boats if no buyers emerge this year the number of yachts under construction that were larger than feet long soared to world wide up from according to showboats international magazine american yacht builders have been especially swamped since the falling dollar has made their boats cheaper compared to their european competitors even though builders are expanding furiously their production lines are backed up for years customers ordering one of trinitys &# million footers today have to wait at least three years for delivery christensen a vancouver wash based builder says the wait time for its two models at feet and feet is now about years westport of westport wash which builds more standardized yachts has a delivery period of about months or less like ferrari and gulfstream which have waiting lists for their top cars and jets some yacht makers dont like to admit that their customers are profiting at the companys expense "thats not how we operate " says philip purcell of westport whose boats start at feet long "im not saying it doesnt happen or that we can prevent it im just saying thats not what our customers are about " but others say the practice is becoming more widespread since most of the new rich have more money than time theyre willing to pay big premiums to have their boats ready for this summers season heres how it works a buyer orders say one of christensens foot yachts for &# million but just before delivery another buyer comes along and offers him &# million for the boat the seller can then commission another footer which may have gone up only slightly in price to say &# million or he uses the profit to upgrade to a larger model christensen and trinity say their customers can now sell a &# million boat in production for a profit of &# million to &# million "todays buyers want instant gratification " mr sabates says he knows firsthand the cuban american entrepreneur who made his first fortune distributing teddy ruxpin and cabbage patch kids dolls and now owns a nascar team and other companies was a big yacht flipper himself he bought and sold more than boats in the late s and early s he says earning more than &# million he bought so many boats from trinity that it made him a partner he recently gave up flipping since he says it wasnt in the interests of the boat yard still trinity itself has tried to get into the act by buying out some of its customers for resale "none of them would take our offer " mr sabates says "theyre not stupid " henry luken a chattanooga tenn entrepreneur who founded a long distance phone company bought two yachts from christensen but sold them both shortly after they were finished now hes building a third that "i swear im going to keep or my family will kill me " he declines to say what he made on the transactions in mr taylor bought a foot finished boat from trinity and at the same time placed an order for a foot boat called analise he sold analise while it was being built and ordered another footer that was sold during construction mr taylor ordered two more boats one feet and another feet the footer was sold in early shortly after it was delivered he sold the footer this year although at least he got to use it for two years mr taylor declined to comment another trinity client rick hendrick the motorsports tycoon and car dealer owner has ordered three boats from trinity but hasnt received any of them his first one a footer was sold just two months before delivery for a multimillion dollar profit he commissioned a second boat which was sold months into construction his third boat is still being built but mr sabates says mr hendrick who declined to comment wont go boatless this summer "he has a foot boat that he bought from me " mr sabates says "so we all made out pretty well "
