theyre the law five months ago democrats took over congress supposedly to rescue it from a republican "culture of corruption " now they sound like george raft in "im the law " "its time to put on your long pants and grow up " californias george miller declared on tuesday after democrats declined to enforce ethics rules on one of their own by long pants mr miller apparently meant that grown ups should get with the program of committee potentate jack murtha in case you missed it mr murtha had some words last week with michigans mike rogers a republican who had proposed striking a &# million "earmark" funding a national drug intelligence center in mr murthas district federal audits had found the center to be ineffective and duplicative but when mr rogers proposed sending that &# million somewhere else mr murtha was unamused "i hope you dont have any earmarks in the defense appropriations bills " mr murtha told him "because they are gone and you will not get any earmarks now and forever " this sort of threat was supposed to have gone out with tom delay as the new democratic majority banned the bullying in their ethics workbook as rule but faced with the choice between reprimanding him or reneging on their election mantras house democrats opted to back jack the no reprimand vote broke along party lines with a mere two democrats saying the issue "deserved debate or a referral to the ethics committee " mr murtha is a cardinal on the appropriations committee a position from which he can easily reward and punish members who dont support his pork barrel agenda his job just got easier too thanks to appropriations chairman david obey on tuesday mr obey announced he will hold back earmarks in appropriations bills until they get to the conference report that means less transparency and sunshine for the earmarking process but too bad "i dont give a damn if people criticize me or not " mr obey said the practice of "airdropping" earmarks into conference reports was a huge issue in the last congress when democrats complained fiercely about last minute drop ins the senate earmarking bill had a provision to help take care of this but the legislation stalled in the house in the meantime the procedure now being organized by mr obey will ensure that frisky house backbenchers cant pick on special projects like oh say a &# million boondoggle in pennsylvania mr obey says hes just doing whats best for the committee what a mensch as the chairman knows the change means less airtime for the earmarks and makes them harder to shoot down on the house floor where they have at least been up for discussion in recent years public outrage at projects like the famous bridge to nowhere has proven to be the best weapon against pork barrel extravagance but now that theyre all grown up democrats want to enjoy the spending prerogatives of the majority earmarks for everyone
