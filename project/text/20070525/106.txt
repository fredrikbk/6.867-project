weekend journal review film depp floats plot walks plank in messy pirates digital crabs astonish paris glows delightfully in uplifting angel a stumbling out of the theater after "pirates of the caribbean at worlds end" had run its storm tossed semi coherent course i reflected on the movie it might have been the very first shot of a hangmans noose is followed by what promises to be a musical about capital punishment in the th century among a group of prisoners waiting to die is a grim faced little boy who like the hero of "oliver " relieves his anxiety not to mention the discomfort of his rope wrapped neck by bursting into song when other prisoners take up the boys plaintive melody a british officer rushes off to tell his superior cryptically "theyve started to sing sir " to which the superior replies with equally cryptic pithiness "finally " now nothing in this bleak sequence has any bearing on the rest of the film the whole thing is there simply to illustrate the point that civil rights have been suspended and all pirates are to be hanged but i cared about that little boy i liked his courage wondered what he had done to deserve such a fate and would have preferred his presumably brief life story to the cruel and unusual punishment of a ponderous pirate saga minutes long with more doldrums than "the rime of the ancient mariner " those doldrums are relieved from time to time by spectacular effects an international pirate convocation at a blighted bali hai called shipwreck cove white rocks turning into crabs crabs by the digital thousands covering a ships deck a climactic sea battle fought on the rim of a ship sucking maelstrom still the most affecting effect is one of the simplest bill nighys octopus pussed davy jones wiping away a single tear with the tip of a tentacle jack sparrow is less of a presence than before though johnny depp remains the saving grace of the series whether hes weaving woozily long after the deck beneath him has ceased to pitch or flouncing around as if managing an invisible hoop skirt keith richards supposedly the inspiration for mr depps characterization is there in the leathery flesh but very briefly and to no effect we might just as well be watching a coarsely carved puppet chow yun fat does a turgid turn as a chinese pirate captain geoffrey rush is back as barbosa and a good thing too because his diamond drill voice is one of the few that can cut through the movies clamor and keira knightleys elizabeth swann and orlando blooms will turner go through the tortures of the damned in their search for love if the story is about nothing else its about betrayal the story is about other things of course but the plots absurd complications defy and discourage description to learn more you could peruse the movies

stones in their mouths this is followed by a pullback that loses the men then finds them again as with a cosmic eye on the rocky face of a mountainside agnes godard did the dazzling cinematography the place is sicily in the time of europes tidal emigration to the new world and the stones in the mouths are traditions of an ancient culture that the men will leave behind after countless films in which immigration plays a central role one of the earliest was charlie chaplins silent classic "the immigrant" while one of the best jan troells "the emigrants " has never migrated to dvd youd think the canon was essentially complete yet this visionary work adds to it by combining harsh realities with magic realist fantasies the immigrant family consists of a widower farmer salvatore a formidable performance by vincenzo amato his two sons and his elderly mother salvatore dreams of an america that produces giant vegetables and a california where he can swim in a river of milk the movies title is ironic for the door invoked by emma lazaruss poem may be golden but reaching it is a hellish experience for salvatore and his fellow passengers in steerage and getting through it is a soul searing trial in what amounts to a polemic against inhuman treatment the film shows u s immigration officers as instruments of a dunderheaded policy based on eugenics the films most intriguing element a shipboard romance with a mysterious englishwoman played by charlotte gainsbourg is its least convincing one some of its images and situations though are unforgettable long before a white river fills
