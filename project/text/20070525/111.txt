weekend journal sports by the numbers whats ailing womens tennis when the french open starts up this weekend the womens side of the draw will look a bit different than it has lately and for one big reason most of the top players are playing and are at least moderately healthy over the last four seasons injuries and poor health have been big stories in womens tennis since the u s open knee injuries kept serena williams out of five slams a viral infection combined with a variety of leg injuries sidelined justine henin for much of and and a stomach ailment caused her to retire in the middle of the australian open final kim clijsters missed eight slams since with wrist injuries while martina hingis who will miss this years french open with a hip injury has been injured so often that shes missed slams since and actually announced what turned out to be a temporary retirement amelie mauresmo skipped two slams during that period with rib and knee injuries this is all the more surprising when you compare the womens draw to the mens the men are on the court a lot longer often playing best of five sets in the majors while women play best of three the average mens match at last years u s open from the quarterfinals on was minutes while the average womens match was over in minutes but the injury epidemic isnt a problem in the mens game among top active players with more than one slam win only marat safin has missed more than one major due to injury why so many injuries for the women look at the only active former no to not miss a slam due to injury maria sharapova the big difference between her and the women mentioned above is that at shes several years younger than they are most of the players with a history of injuries moved to the games top level as teenagers reaching the late rounds of nearly every tournament while playing a power game that made them hit virtually every ball as hard as possible men tend to not play nearly as much top level tennis in their teens as tenniss young female champs hit their s they found that tenniss long season can take its toll will the future pose similar problems for ms sharapova shes avoided major injury so far but missed two tournaments earlier this year with a shoulder injury and in her australian open final against serena williams her first serve percentage was just and she hit twice as many double faults as aces in a loss in a loss to ms williams in the fourth round of the sony ericsson open she double faulted eight times without an ace who should be the favorite at roland garros ms henin has won there the last two years while serena williams has won only once at roland garros shes also won seven of the slams shes played in since and is vs ms henin and vs ms sharapova if she can get to the finals fit and healthy shell be tough to beat on the final weekend venus williams with a chronic wrist injury and ms mauresmo recovering from appendicitis could be upset victims and teenage stars ana ivanovic and nicole vaidisova pulled out of french open tune ups with injuries this could give some of the draws sleepers a break svetlana kuznetsova has shown signs of regaining the form the helped her capture the u s open while italian open champ jelena jankovic and dinara safina will try to break through in a slam still it all adds up to a volatile and intriguing mix with the games top contenders both healthy and hungry for the first time in years given recent history enjoy it while it lasts
