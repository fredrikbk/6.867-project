wall street gets bearish about itself earnings downgrade made on bear stearns may not be the last investors were rattled yesterday when a goldman sachs group inc analyst slashed his second quarter earnings estimates for bear stearns cos driving shares of the wall street firm down more than but they may also want to look more closely at the firm that issued the research and its other rivals which could be in for earnings disappointments themselves for most brokerage firms the second quarter ends next week the firms have been on fire in recent years in many cases posting record profits quarter after quarter recently profits have been buoyed by robust merger and acquisition activity where firms rake in big fees for advising companies on strategic moves yet this quarter was marked by the continued weakness in the mortgage market a profit center for the street notably the appetite for products tied to risky or subprime mortgages has waned adding to the misery the investors who are buying these securities are demanding better terms which cut into firm profits some business leaders also believe that the current boom in commodities trading which has juiced results at firms like goldman and morgan stanley in recent quarters may have peaked these concerns are being reflected privately by senior executives at some firms as they prepare to release second quarter earnings in mid june they predict that while firms will still report healthy profits they will likely be down from the first quarter and in some cases firms may actually miss current estimates say people familiar with their thinking this would be unusual as wall street firms are renowned for handily beating analysts forecasts "nobodys seeing any cracks right now " says anton schutz who manages the burnham financial funds from mendon capital in rochester n y "but when those cracks happen the dam bursts " mr schutz who has been bearish on brokerage stocks since he sold his stake in morgan stanley six months ago believes that the current euphoria cant last "theyre good companies " he says of the securities firms "but the gravy train has got to slow down " the pain this quarter wont be felt evenly though most every street firm trades mortgages bear has so far been singled out by the goldman analyst and others because it is a major player in mortgage securitization or the packaging of mortgages so they can be sold to big investors and the issuance of new mortgages as a result some analysts are raising questions about whether consensus earnings for bears second quarter which thomson financial

unlike competitors morgan and lehman whose stock underwriting business has actually experienced modest growth bears is down significantly a spokeswoman for bear declined to comment but in a recent
