crack in the door cautiously an aging japan warms to foreign workers loopholes open up jobs in farms and factories friction in toyota city akehama japan four years ago when a group of farmers in this remote village first brought in young filipinos to work in their citrus fields neighbors rebuffed the idea of hiring foreigners "they said these men shouldnt be hired even if they worked for free " recalls motosa katayama a ninth generation farmer with a weather beaten face but they soon saw the logic the filipinos performed strenuous tasks such as pruning branches and pulling weeds becoming indispensable to the elderly farmers since then akehama a village with just households has hosted a total of workers from the philippines and vietnam "people began to realize it was so much better to have someone with you" on the field says mr katayama japan long known for its resistance to mass immigration is gradually starting to use more foreigners known as gaikokujin roudousha in japanese to solve its labor shortage they are taking up jobs in rural areas where industries such as agriculture and textiles are struggling big companies are filling their factories with foreigners to assemble auto parts and flat panel tvs in cities foreign workers serve meals at restaurants and stock shelves at grocery stores the census found japan had foreign workers or of its working population up from and a decade earlier that is still a far cry from the u s which has million foreign born workers or of the labor force nonetheless for japan its a big change resistance to allowing in foreign workers runs strong in this island nation where virtually everyone speaks japanese and shares a similar ethnic and cultural background from to japan banned nearly all foreigners from entering the country the only major immigration in modern times came before and during world war ii when several million koreans came to japan at the time korea was a japanese colony even today many japanese believe that the countrys relatively homogenous population and common values contribute to a low crime rate and economic strength but as the country is swept by drastic changes in its population and economy japanese are shaking off some of their traditional views in a government public opinion survey of respondents said japan should accept unskilled foreign workers either unconditionally or if certain conditions are met only said they were opposed to the idea under any circumstance the foreign workers currently dont present an economic threat because they tend to do jobs that japanese workers dont want such as agriculture and construction work and many are dotted around the country in small rural communities which are cut off from mainstream society whats more in a country where the public is strongly aware of demographic trends many see foreign workers as inevitable in the long run because of the falling birth rate japans working age population peaked in and is now falling demographers forecast that the number of working age japanese aged to will drop by from million in the drop will be especially sharp over the next few years as people born during japans baby boom turn the official retirement age at many companies the japanese government has kept a tight grip on foreigners and their activities while officially keeping the door closed it has permitted numerous loopholes that enable hundreds of thousands of foreigners to come and work in japan every year mostly on a temporary basis a strategy that some call a "backdoor policy " the young men in akehama for example arent technically employed as workers they are among "trainees" brought to japan under a three year government approved program that is supposed to teach them skills that they will take back to their countries some trainees are paid just &# an hour around half the lowest of japans minimum wages which vary by region in addition some foreigners with student visas are allowed to work part time and most do so at low wage jobs in convenience stores and fast food restaurants and about descendants of japanese who emigrated to south america more than years ago now live and work in japan granted visas as relatives of japanese citizens this quiet backdoor policy could backfire if the number of foreigners swells quickly or workers start competing for more mainstream blue collar jobs already the media has played up a rise in crime committed by foreigners serious offenses by foreigners such as robbery and rape are up over the past years although the absolute number of such crimes remains low at least one high profile politician shintaro ishihara governor of the tokyo metropolitan region has made a name for himself with verbal attacks on foreigners saying foreigners "are carrying out extremely heinous crimes " in a sign that many japanese welcome his outspoken style he was elected to a third four year term on april the japan association of corporate executives a powerful business lobby that supports allowing more foreign workers in japan projected that by foreigners would exceed of japans working age population the current level in france and nearly five times the current level "by not calling these people workers and leaving things vague in a typical asian fashion the japanese government retains tremendous control over the situation for now " says bui chi trung a sociology professor from vietnam at aichi shukutoku university near nagoya but without a clearer definition of the role of foreigners in the work force he says the issue may lead to social instability "japan may pay dearly for this policy " he says the first big opening for foreign workers came in the booming late s when japan allowed tens of thousands of iranians to come on tourist visas after which they stayed on illegally to work when the economy slowed the government made iranian visitors meet the tighter entry requirements already required for people from most developing nations a more significant experiment involved latin americans of japanese descent in the government made it clear that most descendants of japanese emigrants in particular the children and grandchildren of those who left to work as farmers in brazil during the first half of the th century were free to work in japan for as long as they wished officially the reason was unrelated to a labor shortage "it was just a natural thing to take back the descendants of japanese people who had left a while ago and now wanted to come back " says saori fujita an immigration policy planner at the ministry of justice as japans auto industry thrived and developed a labor shortage in the early s the large brazilian community around toyota city became a vital part of the labor force aisin seiki co which supplies toyota motor corp with parts such as transmissions employs about brazilians among its factory workers the company has found it hard to recruit new japanese workers who increasingly shun factory jobs most brazilian workers are hired on a contract basis which means they can be laid off more easily in a downturn or if aisin decides to move more production overseas "aisin was taking on fewer new employees" during japans long downturn in the s says ryuichiro yamada a human resources personnel manager in this decade "when business boomed we didnt have enough people " because many of the brazilians dont speak japanese well they generally do routine tasks that require less explanation such as preparing products for shipment aisin employs interpreters and has translated essential notices and manuals into portuguese though most brazilians intended to stay just a few years to make quick money many are deciding to remain in japan that means japan is acquiring its first foreign language community since it brought over koreans to work in factories during world war ii a public housing complex in toyota city called homi estate was built in the s to house workers at toyotas parts suppliers now of the roughly residents are south american predominantly brazilian a japanese supermarket on the estate closed down last year and a shopping center owned by a brazilian took over the premises japanese residents complained at first about the loud music young brazilians played and the motorbikes they allegedly stole but they eventually realized the brazilians were there to stay and made an effort to educate them in japan style living "you have to talk to them one to one " says kinuyo miyagawa a long term homi resident who is active in the local residents association she explained japans elaborate process of putting out the trash on particular days for different categories such as burnables and items for recycling more recently foreign workers have expanded to include fruit pickers scallop packers and garment factory workers they support struggling businesses in rural japan where the population is declining rapidly as young people move to cities most of these workers have arrived under the government sponsored trainee system originally created to allow big companies to train their overseas staffers in japan and gradually expanded to include small companies with a labor shortage last year japan brought in trainees twice the number in the trainees initially receive a one year visa and they can extend their stay for an additional two years most choose to do so once their three years are up they cant get a trainee visa again the garment factories in ehime prefecture in western japan known for its towel and garment manufacturing in the s have been clobbered by cheap imports from the rest of asia they keep going thanks to some trainees from china who work at of these factories all of them small companies with a few dozen employees where they sew skirts blouses and school uniforms the trainees are paid a little over &# a month employers say they cost about the same as japanese workers after paying for their room and board training and travel expenses still with so few japanese workers willing to join the industry factory owners even charter flights from china to bring them over the local industry association is now demanding that the government allow foreign workers to come in more freely "we want the government to do away with this nonsense and create a system where people who want to come back are allowed to do so " says kohji murakami chairman of the association "we need foreign workers and we need them right now " of course problems inevitably arise trainees cant change employers and during their first year are not protected by japanese labor laws last september a year old chinese trainee on a pig farm near tokyo boycotted work after a pay dispute a representative of the staffing agency that brought him to japan arrived at the farm to send him back to china the trainee then stabbed him to death according to a police spokeswoman in december a chinese woman trainee in her thirties filed a civil suit against the host organization that brought her to japan and its representative the woman alleged she was raped many times by the head of the host organization who had a key to her dormitory room the organization fully admitted the allegations and settled out of court in february the government says it is planning to revise the system including possibly allowing trainees to stay longer than the current three year maximum officials have yet to agree on the details many young workers are eager to come to japan attracted by wages that are higher than they are back home rimando sitam a filipino who has worked on an akehama citrus farm for two years has a college degree in teaching but couldnt find work at home the year old sends home much of his monthly salary of &# that covers more than half the living expenses of his parents and six siblings who live on a small vegetable farm "so many farmers want to be trainees in japan because we have no work in the philippines " says mr sitam "i want to stay here much longer or come back again if i can " when his training period in japan ends mr sitam is hoping to find a factory job in south korea mr katayama the citrus farmer likes the trainee system as its helped keep his farm in business for the past few years a powerful typhoon destroyed much of the orange crop in akehama seven years ago wiping out many neighboring farms mr katayama and a few of his neighbors bought some of the land so they could expand after failing to recruit young japanese workers the akehama citrus farmers decided to try foreign workers following the example of farmers in a nearby town they recently set up their own recruiting agency to bring over new trainees most come from benguet a province in northern luzon in the philippines where farms are struggling to compete with imports of chinese vegetables akehama currently hosts eight trainees two vietnamese women and six filipinos shipbuilding companies in a nearby town also employ some filipino trainees "american farmers use mexican workers to run their farms " says mr katayama "so we said why couldnt we japanese farmers use foreigners too "
