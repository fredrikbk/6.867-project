losing fuel pipeline thefts cripple iraqi oil production u s army traces cause to network of thieves insurgents smugglers kirkuk iraq in a desolate stretch of desert near this northern city a pool of gooey crude oil was spreading by the side of the road on a february night a u s military patrol followed the oil to an exposed underground pipeline three square holes pierced its thick steel skin a hose led from the pipeline to a pump next to a pickup truck which had a makeshift tank mounted on its bed according to u s soldiers two men had just finished siphoning off the crude from the holes which were cut with a power tool the men were detained operations like this used to puzzle iraqi and american security forces theft of petroleum products was nothing new but crude oil isnt usually attractive to thieves because it has little practical value until its refined into fuel "for the first couple of months it bothered us why are they tapping into the crude line what are they doing with it " recalls lt col jack pritchard commander of a u s army artillery battalion that arrived here in september with the mission to improve pipeline security after months of investigation col pritchard and his team uncovered the answer the operations were part of a sophisticated network of savvy thieves unruly desert tribes bomb planting insurgents corrupt security forces cross border smugglers and operators of small domestic refineries at those refineries u s officers believe raw oil is turned into fuel and sold on the black market where its used in vehicles and to power home generators this loose confederation has all but crippled production in iraqs northern oil fields even as the political future of this ethnically mixed city and its underground riches hangs in the balance in the second half of last year one stretch of pipelines connecting kirkuk with the turkish mediterranean port of ceyhan the main outlet for iraqs northern oil exports pumped oil for only days the rest of the time the pipes sat idle leaking crude through dozens of holes drilled along their mile run through the iraqi desert one pipeline has been broken into times so far this year according to u s military officials the holes help explain why four years after the u s invasion iraq hasnt been able to match its prewar crude production levels of million barrels a day this year iraq is averaging million barrels mostly from southern oil fields that havent suffered the unrelenting sabotage seen in the north kirkuk currently produces barrels of oil a day but under normal conditions it could produce an additional barrels a day at current market prices that would bring iraq up to &# million of revenue a day projected over an entire year this additional income would amount to about one fifth of iraqs current annual budget of &# billion a british controlled company discovered oil in kirkuk in hitting a live well that gushed crude and flooded the nearby countryside ever since oil has affected the fortunes of this ancient city historically populated by ethnic kurds turkomans and arabs saddam husseins baath party tried to drive out the kurds and replace them with arabs in a decades long campaign to cement arab control over this strategic region and its oil since the kurds who claim kirkuk as their capital have pushed aggressively to reverse the trend many kurds have moved back and tried to get arabs to leave the city is supposed to hold a referendum this year on whether it should join with the autonomous kurdish region to the north which could ultimately give the kurds control of the oil arabs oppose the move fearing discrimination and the loss of a major source of national revenue while both arabs and kurds deny they are motivated by oil an estimated billion barrels of crude beneath kirkuk make it a lucrative prize total iraqi oil reserves are estimated to be billion barrels kirkuks active wells are scattered over three major oil fields within a short drive of the city a series of pipelines runs from here toward a big refinery in the town of bayji about miles south some deposit oil at the refinery for conversion into fuel for the iraqi market others turn north and carry crude to the turkish border the pipelines run through sunni arab land and authorities believe that members of that group are behind most of the thefts the first priority of col pritchards artillery battalion was to secure that mile leg of pipelines between kirkuk and bayji along the main desert road code named route cherry by the americans of particular concern was a secluded area where the road curves around a salt marsh in a spot called the cherry hump the underground pipelines here dip to a low elevation point where residual crude gathers by force of gravity in late winter and early spring u s troops scooped up thieves here by the humvee load often after unmanned airborne drones observed pipeline sabotage some detainees told u s and iraqi investigators they were using the crude to seal their rooftops or to burn in stoves to heat their homes other operations are more sophisticated earlier this year u s soldiers stumbled on a remote desert redoubt where several pumps generators and tanks were arrayed behind a hill intelligence reports indicated that crude stolen from the pipeline would be brought here and collected for trucks to pick up at night says sgt first class jonathan dufriend an intelligence officer at the u s army artillery battalion when u s forces tried to reach the abandoned site again the trail to it was booby trapped with roadside bombs the crude transfer site fit into a broader pattern revealed by arrested thieves many spoke of delivering the stolen oil to middlemen on farms where trucks would arrive after enough crude was accumulated often referred to as "chicken farms" by the detainees these collection points are so well hidden that col pritchards men have had a hard time pinpointing their location the trucks often smeared with black splotches from hasty loading take crude to neighboring countries such as syria and to small refineries within iraq u s and iraqi officials say though exactly how this is done remains a mystery "there is always a market for crude oil all around iraq " says manaa abdullah the year old director general of the state owned northern oil co the americans recently arrested a syrian truck driver with a suspicious load of crude whose origin and destination he couldnt clearly explain other smuggler trucks impounded on the desert roads carry fraudulent paperwork describing their load as asphalt an oil derivative that is difficult to tell from crude that makes it harder to identify illegal trucks at the busy cross border checkpoints or to prosecute the drivers in the iraqi courts international smuggling of crude was perfected under mr hussein who sought to bypass export quotas imposed under the united nations oil for food program by orchestrating illicit exports to turkey jordan syria and across the persian gulf u s officials believe that modern day smugglers may be taking advantage of the old networks there are also clandestine refineries in northern iraq with the capacity to produce very small amounts of low grade fuel mr abdullah and his u s colleagues suspect these outfits which though not very sophisticated require some technical expertise to set up account for some demand for the crude stolen from the pipeline sgt dufriend the u s intelligence officer compares these refineries to back country liquor distillers during prohibition "if you cant get alcohol but you know how to make it you become popular " he says although the large bayji refinery has ramped up production recently recurrent fuel shortages are sustaining a booming black market some of the pipeline tapping at the cherry hump unfolded with the complicity of iraqi soldiers charged with protecting the pipeline according to interviews with iraqi and u s officers "the insurgents do it sometimes my soldiers do it " says col sadra al din commander of the third battalion of the iraqi armys strategic infrastructure brigade col al din smoked nervously in the iraqi brigade headquarters a villa formerly owned by ali hassan al majid a hussein acolyte known as "chemical ali " an ethnic kurd from kirkuk col al din is viewed as an outsider by his sunni arab charges earlier this year he survived a bomb explosion in his office and another time he was shot in the back both incidents appear to be inside jobs according to u s officers the northern oil co has found itself at the center of the ethnic tensions of its employees only a few hundred are kurds "of course theres discrimination at the oil company " says hasib flamez a year old kurdish soldier who was guarding a crew repairing a punctured pipeline on a recent day "arabs think oil is only for them but its for all of iraq " in the early s the flamez family was told to get out of kirkuk and their house was taken over by arabs he says a few feet away farez mohammed a year old sunni arab repairman surveyed a pool of oil bubbling out of a broken pipeline this spill was caused by corrosion not theft and the workers were here to scoop out the muck and place a rubber clamp over a tiny hole his hands blackened by crude mr mohammed says he was born in kirkuk as was his father now it is arabs who are pressured to leave and sell their homes he suspects the kurds have designs on kirkuks oil "the oil doesnt belong to the kurds it belongs to all of iraq " he says mr abdullah the northern oil director has been hiring kurds though he admits only or so have come to work being an oil worker here has become increasingly dangerous pipeline repair crews have been hit by roadside bombs and shot at sunni insurgents have been dropping leaflets in kirkuk telling all government employees including oil company workers to quit or face a bloodbath last summer adil al qazaz northern oils director general at the time went to baghdad to visit the oil ministry after his meeting he was snatched by gunmen on the street never to be seen again "we were invited to go to baghdad together and i feel guilty about not going " says mr abdullah who was mr al qazazs deputy at the time he has avoided moving into his missing colleagues office "i keep getting calls from his family have you heard anything " among the iraqi security forces the strategic infrastructure battalions have one of the strangest histories in the aftermath of the u s invasion northern oil tapped the sunni arab tribes to protect the pipelines running through their turf mr hussein used a similar system mixing intimidation and rewards to secure cooperation of the tribal sheiks after the oil company started direct payments to the sheiks who would in turn distribute the money to the tribal guards essentially the tribes were being paid to refrain from attacks on the pipeline last year the iraqi government decided to integrate the tribal guards into the regular army they were issued uniforms assigned new commanders like col al din and paid directly by the ministry of defense robbed of the purse strings the sheiks were marginalized "because of the sudden gush of money to the soldiers tribal leaders have no influence " says mr abdullah the oil company director he is universally addressed as sheik manaa because of his own position in the obeidi tribe dominant in the area but tribal bonds still encouraged the newly minted soldiers to help or at least turn a blind eye to pipeline drillers who often come from the same village or from the same family "tribal loyalty is stronger than national loyalty " says col pritchard several soldiers have been arrested stealing crude in mid april an american patrol caught an out of uniform soldier planting a roadside bomb near the cherry hump mr abdullah has tried to enlist local sheiks to help him stop the drilling since col pritchards artillery battalion arrived the drilling along route cherry has dropped off significantly but the smugglers have moved on to a more secluded area further north the focus of a new security push thats just getting underway the drillers feel so comfortable there that u s forces have found pipeline holes with spigots and valves sami othman the tough talking kurdish chief of the oil protection force in kirkuk has just hired new guards that he plans to deploy there all of this has allowed mr abdullah to start exporting again he sent crude to turkey three times in may but then several new holes in the pipeline stopped oil flow again recently he learned of a possible case of pipeline sabotage near route cherry and passed the tip to col pritchards battalion that night several humvees drove around the desert looking for smugglers but found nothing still mr abdullah preferred to wait longer to make sure the pipeline was intact "weve borne it for so long we can bear it another day " he says
