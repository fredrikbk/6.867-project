weekend journal review books youre blocking my view cape wind by wendy williams &amp robert whitcomb publicaffairs pages &# behind much of the modern environmental movement lies the "do as i say not as i do" sensibility of an aristocracy its not surprising when a bunch of enviro aristos line up opposition to a new road or a shopping mall or some other development that offends them but there is something delicious about such obstructionists raising environmental concerns almost all of them bogus to try to prevent a wind farm one of the cleanest sources of electricity we have from being built in sight of their summer homes thats what happened on cape cod where energy entrepreneur jim gordon has been trying for almost six years to put large wind turbines each feet high on horseshoe shoal in the federal waters of nantucket sound at maximum capacity the wind farm would provide up to megawatts of non polluting electricity to the new england grid with varying wind speeds taken into account cape wind would provide the annual equivalent of of the electricity used on cape cod and the islands of nantucket and marthas vineyard the site is about five miles from the shoreline compound of sen edward m kennedy d mass nine miles from marthas vineyard and miles from nantucket remarkably the folks who can afford to summer in these places and who are accustomed to getting their way seem to have lost the fight their friends in congress overplayed their hand and provoked a turf war with the senate energy committee whose leaders blocked the energy bill until it lost the riders that would have killed the cape wind project but no victory buzzers have sounded yet that bill gave regulation of offshore wind farms to the minerals management service which announced last month that its own environmental report on cape wind would be delayed until late summer a bad sign perhaps not a spokesman for the wind farm project said that it would still be possible for cape wind to make its target of going online by late wendy williams an environmental journalist whose cape cod residence gave her a front row seat at the debate and robert whitcomb editorial page editor of the providence journal almost gleefully lay out this story in "cape wind money celebrity class politics and the battle for our energy future on nantucket sound " its a ripe subject populated with the sorts of people who would be among the first to count themselves as friends of the earth but the last to accept an environmentally friendly energy source if it meant the slightest cloud on their ocean views they include the kennedys edward and robert f jr mitt romney members of the mellon clan yachtsman bill koch and historian david mccullough my only criticism of "cape wind" is that it needs an index or a list of dramatis personae and fewer pages on personae who arent too dramatis like the philanthropist who financed the summer camp attended by the cape wind champion mr gordon as a boy for four years spectators at the wind farm debate were subjected to blowhard rhetoric like that of mr mccullough who at a corps of engineers hearing in called the intrusion on the "hallowed ground" of nantucket sound "outrageous " he said it was "a preservation issue its not an environmental issue " on his way out he complained "this is visual pollution " which sounds environmental to me for mr romney governor of massachusetts whose mantra could be summarized "i support renewable energy but " the nantucket sound was "a national treasure " sen kennedy presented the spectacle of working hard behind the scenes to sabotage the wind farm while publicly castigating the bush administration for its alleged failure to push environmental technology when he finally addressed cape wind on the senate floor sen kennedy could do no better than to blubber untruths claiming that the project was "exempt from all of the protections" normally afforded to environmentally friendly endeavors at least the senator appeared to be trying to make a logical case his nephew robert kennedy jr who works as an environmental lawyer "verged on the incoherent " ms williams and mr whitcomb write its hard to dispute that "kennedys facts were preposterous and his level of discourse disgraceful " he asserted in a national public radio show that the wind project would result in a property tax increase on the cape apparently to make up for a supposed decrease in shoreline property values hurting the less affluent "a claim listeners could make little sense of " the authors say he also alleged that the "industrial site" would force recreational fishermen to go to the waters off new jersey "why he picked new jersey " remark ms williams and mr whitcomb "was never quite clear " they cite research indicating that wind farms actually improve fishing grounds because the base of the turbines act as artificial reefs most real environmentalists and year round cape residents were not fooled the conservation law foundation new englands most potent environmental litigant supported jim gordons effort to build cape wind greenpeace mounted some eye catching demonstrations against the opponents targeting sen kennedy in particular the environmental group invaded a washington book signing for the senators "america back on track " handing out leaflets touting a fake kennedy title "how i killed americas first offshore wind farm " and greenpeace produced a television ad depicting a giant sen kennedy standing knee deep in the ocean playing whack a mole with wind turbines that kept popping up in the surf wind farms on land can be trouble their noise disturbs close neighbors they can kill large numbers of birds and they arent profitable without tax breaks but theres a lot of energy in wind the energy department estimates that harnessing all the winds off u s shores would produce megawatts which is more than of americas current generation capacity the problem is that we can capture only a small fraction of that amount good sites are hard to find as ms williams and mr whitcomb report horseshoe shoal is an almost ideal site with the turbines so far offshore there would be no noise where people live and considerably fewer than birds a year might be killed the wind near nantucket blows a lot briskly even with the turbines spinning overhead shallow draft vessels could still use the area the towers would be at least feet apart cape winds power would also mean fewer tons of carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere annually the real outrage here is the agonizing delay in gaining approval for cape wind all too typical alas of how things work or dont in massachusetts a not in my backyard campaign ought to target something at least potentially unpleasant but the "visual pollution" that so angered mr mccullough would be minuscule from sen kennedys compound five miles away a foot tower appears about as tall as the thumbnail at the end of your outstretched arm it makes you wonder how cape winds opponents would react if a developer planned a pharmaceutical factory in say hyannis civil disobedience perhaps exquisitely catered of course mr darst is a former deputy
