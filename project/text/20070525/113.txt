weekend journal taste houses of worship church merger putins acquisition last week on the christian feast of the ascension leaders of the emigre russian orthodox church outside russia agreed to re establish "canonical communion" with the russian orthodox moscow patriarchate thousands stood in line to attend the celebration at moscows cathedral of christ the savior but this was clearly an event of more than religious significance the attendees were a veritable whos who of russian political life including moscow mayor yuri luzhkov and president vladimir putin the mergers architect news media world wide described the event as a step in overcoming russias tragic history the new york times called the merger "the symbolic end of russias civil war " but the reality is far more complicated not only are there theological and moral issues at stake but there is also the suspicion among some that mr putin is building new networks of influence by using the church to reach out to russian emigre communities all over the world while lower ranking clergy at the ceremony stressed the spiritual aspects of the merger patriarch aleksy ii emphasized other factors he gave short shrift to god but thanked president putin indeed it was mr putin who first made overtures to the church abroad in september when he met with its leadership during a visit to new york the church merger is only the most recent of his successful attempts to appropriate symbols of russias prerevolutionary and anticommunist past along with soviet ones the "repatriating" of the danilov monastery bells from harvard university and the bodies of the white russian gen anton denikin from jackson n j and the dowager empress maria feodorovna from copenhagen have gone hand in hand with reintroducing the old soviet anthem and the red armys flag mr putin is thus the first modern russian leader to incorporate all aspects of russias "usable past" in claiming his legitimacy the russian orthodox church in all its forms is a key component of that past now the russian government is being heavily criticized for its authoritarian behavior mr putin needs friends anywhere he can find them having a ready made network of parishes and monasteries in the u s alone and over a million church members in countries will offer russia greater influence abroad this is particularly true because according to the terms of the agreement moscow regains control over bishops appointments and the right to open or close all parishes less clear cut are the moral issues the merger raises particularly for the american based church abroad from the time when russia became communist and atheist after the church abroad had sought to be the free voice of russian orthodoxy world wide its independence was authorized by the courageous patriarch tikhon in who resisted communist domination but in the soviet government imprisoned the independent bishops and transferred leadership of the russian church to metropolitan sergii stragorodsky who infamously declared that the soviet unions "joys and successes are our joys and successes and its sorrows are our sorrows " from that moment the official bishops inside of russia did not utter a word of public protest to anything the state did even though the country was drenched in the blood of tens of millions of people many of whom were believers and thousands of whom were clergy instead the leadership took to referring to stalin as "the wise god appointed leader of our great union " in when the ruthless extermination of the faithful was at a fever pitch sergii announced "there never has been religious persecution in the u s s r nor is there now " todays moscow patriarchate is the as yet unrepentant inheritor of this legacy rather than distancing himself from sergiis appeasement patriarch aleksy wrote a lengthy foreword to a biography praising the "heroic path" taken by sergii and viciously castigating the critics of this appeasement including dissenting orthodox groups in russia and abroad he has blessed the construction of a memorial complex in honor of sergii complete with a square a museum and a monument in alexy wrote a congratulatory epistle to the president of vietnam on the occasion of years since the communist victory in the vietnam war calling it a "glorious anniversary " similar letters were sent to the leaders of north korea and cuba as long as the church abroad existed as an independent entity it implicitly challenged the authority of moscow to speak for the russian church it consistently denounced the collaboration of the church with the communist party called for a more positive valuation of russias prerevolutionary and anticommunist past and served as a hopeful beacon to orthodox christians in russia seeking an alternative many in the church abroad wonder how this merger went through at all the process was secretive and there has even been speculation that some american businessmen with russian ties helped to push it along but now having accepted moscows authority the former church abroad faces many questions can its leaders press moscow to reject the churchs tradition of collaborating with both the kremlin and the kgb can they hold on to the church properties they have maintained for the past years will the moscow church dispatch pro kremlin clergy to promote political aims and above all can the leaders of the church abroad stem the tide of defection from the disappointed faithful that has already begun these problems may be averted if the russian church abroad uses its new status to actively engage moscow but last weeks glad handing suggests that it is the kremlin rather than heaven that is smiling on this union ms kizenko is an associate professor of history at the state university of
