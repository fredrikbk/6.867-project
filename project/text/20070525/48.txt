how u s pact pressures chinese carriers as accord adds flights u s airlines couriers have the upper hand hong kong of all the airlines and cargo carriers poised to cash in on the promised new access to chinas sizzling aviation market chinese players are likely to be the last in line an agreement reached this week between washington and beijing to add air routes and more than double the number of flights between the u s and china is welcome news for american carriers which have long clamored for greater penetration of one of the worlds fastest growing markets demand is expected to keep fares high and china figures into the strategies of u s airlines trying to reduce dependence on domestic routes express delivery companies stand to gain most from the deal which one fedex corp executive says will bring his company "virtually unfettered access" to china beginning in chinas big state run carriers in contrast lack the commercial independence and flexibility of their american rivals and have found profits elusive on their u s routes the new pact portends even more price pressure and tougher times ahead for them the expected increase in flights from the u s also could add to chinas considerable air traffic jams and flight delays the system already is facing potential strains from the olympics in beijing next summer a government led effort to consolidate chinas airlines in created three dominant carriers and several smaller regional players de facto flag carrier air china ltd based in beijing is financially the strongest of chinas biggest three followed by china southern airlines co with headquarters in the southern city of guangzhou china eastern airlines corp is the weakest the carrier based in shanghai is in advanced talks to sell a stake of up to to market leader singapore airlines shares in all three chinese carriers are publicly traded and the airlines have substantial commercial freedom however beijing retains ultimate control and imposes some awkward requirements the government requires for example chinese airlines to buy jet fuel from designated suppliers and at fixed prices that often are higher than international market prices beijing also purchases aircraft in bulk and allocates them to individual airlines even if the airlines dont want them in addition their international networks are smaller and less convenient than those of their main american rivals and u s business travelers tend to avoid the chinese carriers when flying to asia "theyre still not making profits on their u s flights so theres not much incentive for them to increase their flight frequencies " says karen chan of credit suisse in hong kong ms chan estimates that the yields or revenue per seat a common industry measure that chinese airlines earn on trans pacific routes are to lower on average than for their u s rivals she says chinese carriers arent even using up their full quota of daily flights the threat of intensifying competition will pressure chinese airlines to squeeze operating costs and improve service it will "put pepper on their tail " says peter harbison of the centre for asia pacific aviation a consulting firm based in sydney australia but "for the u s routes we cannot make money " a china eastern executive says "we cannot see any room to reduce costs " chinese aviation authorities maintain that more flights between the u s and china shouldnt pose a problem for the countrys aviation system however the military controls chinas skies and air space available to commercial aircraft is tightly controlled china also has been slow in some cases to adopt modern air traffic management procedures unlike many countries china generally requires that jetliners fly with a cushion of feet between them and the planes above and below them authorities had planned to halve this safety cushion to feet by august which would bring china more in line with air standards elsewhere and could effectively double the number of planes in the air but it has had to delay the change until november the new agreement announced wednesday in washington will phase in additional daily u s airline flights between the u s and china to in five years from today it also will open the skies to as many as three new passenger airlines and as many as three new air cargo carriers between now and china is one of the biggest plums in global aviation plane maker airbus a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co predicts chinas domestic passenger market will grow by a year on average from now until at the same time outbound travel by chinese taking overseas business trips and vacations will add to the demand ual corp s united airlines which flies five times daily to chinese cities calls china "a very important market" and says it looks forward "to evaluating new service opportunities" in the country the other u s airlines flying to china are amr corp s american airlines northwest airlines corp and continental airlines inc delta air lines inc and us airways group inc are seeking approval to start service delta the biggest u s carrier by passenger traffic without nonstop service to china aims to boost its overall links to asia as part of its postbankruptcy strategy of focusing on broadening its global network the airline based in atlanta has applied to begin flying to shanghai james m whitehurst deltas chief operating officer in an interview said the agreement "in sheer odds of the number of slots available will greatly improve our chances of serving beijing " the routes the airline manages to win in china he added "will impact our fleet order decisions and what other markets we fly to " the biggest winners from the liberalization of sino american aviation appear to be express delivery companies such as united parcel service inc and fedex chinas market for express deliveries is expanding by an average a year the fastest in asia according to consulting firm booz allen hamilton the market valued at &# billion in will grow to &# billion this year the firm estimates paulo prada in atlanta contributed to this article
