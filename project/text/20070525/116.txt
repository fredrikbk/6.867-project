weekend journal the drivers seat jaguar xkr one cool cat that could use a diet the jaguar xk has been on sale in the u s for just over a year and its success at least by jaguars standards is undeniable writers for car enthusiast magazines have adored the sleek coupe while more importantly civilians who encounter the new xk on the road tend to swivel their heads and stare if not precipitate near collisions in their attempts to gain better vantage jaguar dealers in the u s have been moving roughly of the cars each month making the xk jaguars best selling model so far this year while this may sound like good news if youre a ford shareholder nothing could be further from the truth jaguars struggling corporate parent never intended that a &# plus sports car should be outselling the lower priced and supposedly higher volume sedans that make up the rest of jaguars lineup take a look at that miserable trio however and its easy to see why their sales are moribund the big xj sedan is a nice enough car but its traditional styling has effectively masked the technological and performance improvements that accompanied an expensive redesign the s type and x type are even older models and more to the point neither has ever offered a compelling or even competitive sales pitch to prospective buyers while the xks roughly sales per annum in the u s represent not even a drop in fords leaky bucket its significant that a sports car is now topping the charts at jaguar for years the various powers that be at ford headquarters in dearborn mich have been mucking about trying and failing to figure out what this once revered british brand should or could mean here in the nifty the answer should be plainly obvious jaguar once built the worlds most beautiful sports cars and that must again serve it as a raison detre certainly the xk stems from this philosophy rather than the rival notion that a jag should be all about the wood and leather conservatism of the xj sedan lets hope that those who slapped a leaping jaguar hood ornament on a ford mondeo to create the x type are no longer employed in the auto business yet even the glamorous xk suffers from something of a lack of focus a fact that was made clearer when i drove its top of the line incarnation the xkr introduced in december the xkr lays claim to its position at the pinnacle of the jaguar range thanks to a supercharged liter v making horsepower these extra ponies are augmented with bigger wheels and brakes better bolstered seats and a revised front grille that bears less resemblance to the old ford taurus than the standard xks upping the ante has a commensurate effect on the price with the xkr coupe starting at &# and the convertible version fetching &# undeniably better looking faster and sportier than the standard version the xkr is incredibly fun to drive provided youre aiming the car straight ahead when you punch the throttle the thrill rush provided by its pound feet of torque augmented by the supercharger is more akin to an american muscle car than anything laying claim to british ancestry the vehicles enormity only furthers that resemblance if jaguar had seriously applied itself the xk could have lost some weight in its transformation to xkr but alas the opposite is the case its extra or so pounds do nothing to prevent the xkr coupe from running mph in a very respectable seconds yet they similarly do nothing to help the computerized suspension turn the car into a nimble sort of cat the transmission is the same six speed automatic with paddle shifters located next to the steering wheel found in the standard xk which earns jaguar serious sports car demerits at least until you actually try it out aficionados may never fall completely out of love with slick manual gearboxes but when shift it yourself transmissions eventually disappear and they will this new generation of automatics will make for a wonderful second marriage paddle activated gear changes in the xkr happen quickly though its more than satisfying to simply leave the shift lever in sport mode and let the car match revs for you as fearsome and delightful a powertrain as the xkr employs the car itself is just too big and too heavy the coupe tips the scales at a pounds and the convertibles flirts dangerously close to two tons which is perhaps to be expected in a car that is inches long and inches wide by comparison a chevrolet corvette a hulking beast of a sports car itself is over a foot shorter almost nine inches narrower and weighs some pounds less despite having a nearly identical sized cockpit that the jaguar employs a sophisticated and lightweight all aluminum body yet still weighs nearly pounds seems to be the kind of patently ridiculous engineering for which the british have long been known a further example this mph sports car has a "feature" called asl for "automatic speed limiter" thats part of its cruise control system it does just what youd think limit how fast the car can go regardless of any further application of the gas pedal there is no room for this sort of conflicted thinking in a pure sports car which is why those of us who would like to see jaguar reach back to rediscover the ethos of the e type cant take the xk seriously the e type the firms last true sports car was eventually compromised by some of the same questionable engineering choices that weigh down todays model a "+" seating arrangement that puts a useless back seat in a car that should by all rights be a two seater the use of a bigger and heavier engine to achieve greater performance at the expense of handling and an increased emphasis on luxury content despite its flaws the new xk still comes closer to resembling what we imagine a true jaguar to be than anything else to brandish the marquee in more than three decades imperfect yes though its portent at least gives hope to the faithful contact me at jeff sabatini wsj com
