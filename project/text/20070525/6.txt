board didnt bend rules in pulitzer for music we appreciate the interest of critic terry teachout in the pulitzer prize for music and our efforts to broaden its scope however in his april leisure &amp arts article "sightings jazz wins a pulitzer did ornette coleman deserve his prize " he erroneously stated that the pulitzer prizes "stretched the rules well past the breaking point" this year in awarding the music prize to jazz composer ornette coleman mr teachout based his complaint on an outdated definition for the prize indeed he cited a definition that has not existed since moreover the revised definition was further changed in and that has governed the prize since then the pre definition read "for distinguished musical composition of significant dimension by an american that has had its first performance in the united states during the year " the post definition read "for a distinguished musical composition by an american that has had its first performance or recording in the united states during the year " dropping the term "significant dimension" and adding "recording" were important changes furthermore the guidelines that accompanied the revised definition no longer required the submission of a score rather the guidelines said a score was "strongly urged " all those changes the board believes provided sufficient latitude for improvisational work such as mr colemans so while mr teachout is entitled to his opinions on the wisdom of the award to mr coleman it is wholly inaccurate to say the pulitzer board bent its rules when it bestowed the prize sig gissler administrator pulitzer prizes new york
