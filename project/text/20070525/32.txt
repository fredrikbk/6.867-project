get your worldviews all decided chase all your cares away arthur c brookss commentary "politics of happiness" editorial page may is evidence that worldviews may color your interpretation of statistics let me first reveal that i consider myself extremely conservative before i reinterpret the good professors stats what i see in the numbers is that self identified conservatives are happier people compared with liberals the power players in the middle sometimes called moderates who dont know what to think are the least happy of all ill wager that how people "feel" isnt related to their political views anyway im also quite certain that the temperature difference between liberals and conservatives is related more to our respective views on the current global warming phenomena vs what we really think of each other and guess what the evidence shows that conservatives give more to charities by far because liberals expect the government to take from everyone except the poor of course for liberal favorite causes is that evidence they care also there are stats to support the fact that conservatives have more kids that may not prove we love our family more only that liberals are probably having fewer babies and more abortions to save the world from overpopulation before we burn up from all that co we blow out in the course of living maybe the solution is to stop breathing now that really is extreme jim drake kaneohe hawaii according to a poll by the national opinion research center in "extremely liberal" and "extremely conservative" people are on average happier than those who classify themselves as just "liberal" and "conservative " mr brooks struggled to come up with a reason for this higher level of happiness among the extremists and as he describes them verbal polluters as one of the very happy people on the very conservative side i hope i will not fall into the category of a "polluter" with my comments as i offer a reason that may help mr brooks understand why im exceedingly happy and those in the middle are not the bible states that "a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind " james the verse is speaking specifically to people who although they profess belief in god put themselves above or in the place of god this double mindedness results in the person not receiving the benefits accorded his or her faith james writes that "such people should not expect to receive anything from the lord " being unsettled in political and social opinion results in the same instability and unfulfillment imagine the adult who knows its wrong to destroy an innocent human life and yet will support the destruction of embryos under certain circumstances rather than knowing firmly where he stands this individual has different minds at different times can someone who willfully violates his conscience be truly happy how much happier am i in the belief that human life reflects the image of god and that it can only be taken under the circumstances outlined in his word a friend of mine is equally as happy in her belief that god does not exist and that using frozen embryos in research to potentially enhance her life and that of her children is justified our opinions are in harmony with our beliefs for most being tossed about in the sea results in sea sickness for those in the political middle vacillating between contrary views results in less happiness suzanne hassert wheaton ill see related letter "letters to the editor moderates bravely face lifes messy complications" wsj may
