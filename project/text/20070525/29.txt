does the fed matter does the federal reserve really matter the question seems bizarre but consider this curious fact consumer spending grew at a healthy rate of in real terms in the first quarter despite the drop in overall gdp growth to many on wall street find this a paradox how can it be that consumer spending has been growing consistently at an unreduced rate in the past couple of years while gdp growth fluctuates quarter to quarter shouldnt they rise and fall together yet in fact consumption has always moved more consistently from one period to another than gdp the relationship of this seeming paradox to the feds relevance is this it has been hiking interest rates between mid and mid meanwhile looking for the slowdown in consumer spending and some relief from inflationary pressures that it assumes will result so far the lack of such a slowdown has put the fed in a kind of no mans land to hike or not to hike maybe it doesnt matter as much as has been assumed a review of the data for the last years provides a basis for doubting that the feds interest rate policy will produce the desired slowdown in real consumer spending thats because there has been a profound shift in the way the fed relates to the economy the impact of interest rate movements on the growth of both gdp and consumer spending is easy to measure and it was once very pronounced the accompanying chart shows that in the first years following world war ii it took only basis points of increase in short term interest rates to reduce real consumer spending by nearly allowing for a time lag of one to two years but the analysis also shows that the impact diminished during the period and weakened further during the period in the most recent year period the data suggest that the feds ability to influence consumer spending has essentially vanished when we repeat this exercise for real gdp industrial production employment and many other gauges of the overall economy we find a similar pattern of disappearing effect why in the past the fed was able to use various monetary mechanisms including interest rate pricing to curb access to the credit markets this would induce an economic slowdown as the business sector was forced to postpone growth and lay off employees sometimes it was more than enough to create a recession but as the private sector economy has grown it has become more resilient as a result of the globalization and increasing depth and reach of financial markets interest rate policy has become less and less effective at curbing the flow of capital there has also been a kind of learning effect as the business sector has gotten used to coping with credit market uncertainties and the shock effect of interest rate surprises has lessened the inception of the euro dollar market in the s one of the first manifestations of globalization in the financial markets was followed by the junk bond revolution in the s and the venture capital boom in the s ready access to both equity and debt capital from a proliferating number of sources means that businesses are no longer forced to curtail their activities when the fed impeded the banking systems ability to provide credit and since businesses thus no longer needed to lay off employees employees no longer needed to cut back on their spending not only has the feds ability to slow consumer spending all but disappeared the amplitude of business cycle fluctuations has also been easing in the last couple of decades in our view the feds loss of power is not a bad thing historically its interest rate manipulations have done more harm than good destabilizing rather than stabilizing the economy every recession since has been attributable in large part to the credit squeeze produced by interest rate hikes in attempting to "cool off" an "overheated" economy the feds rate hikes in the past have killed off economic activity and inflicted pain on many sectors of society to stop the spread of a disease inflation by killing the patient the economy is not a very productive way to proceed another factor that continues to propel consumer spending is the household sectors ready access to capital in the form of home equity recent turmoil in the subprime mortgage market reflects an inevitable shakeout in an industry that had grown too far too fast while it is unfortunate that there are buyers who have been hurt by some very aggressive lending practices they comprise a very small portion of all homeowners and their woes will provide a cautionary tale henceforth despite this highly publicized difficulty homeownership has never been easier or more widespread across income levels many more families own their own homes than at any time in the past this stake in homeownership can finance continued growth in consumer spending especially if housing prices continue to rise which in most areas of the country is still the case its been widely reported in the past year that "median" home prices have been falling and more bearish news about housing prices is reported every month but these data have been widely misinterpreted the "median" home price is not the price of the median home it is the median of the prices in any particular housing market of the homes that sellers were fortunate enough to sell in a market blighted by widespread doubt and pessimism on the part of both buyers and sellers what has been called a buyers strike widely disseminated predictions that the so called housing "bubble" would collapse have deterred many home buyers particularly those more interested in investment than simple shelter motives when we consider instead the price of the "median home " we find that indices of home prices on a quality adjusted basis such as that published by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight were still showing no decline through the end of last year merely a sharp deceleration in the gains a reduction in the gain realized upon the sale of a home is not the same as a loss the so called housing bubble has been just another manifestation of the general inflationary boom in tangible assets given the continuing inflationary climate reflected in escalating prices in commodities and commercial real estate markets that promptly reflect the depreciation of the dollar relative to gold it would be highly anomalous if housing prices were to fall when we measure the price of homes in terms of an unstable unit such as the dollar we are looking at only nominal gains not real gains measured in terms of a stable measure of value such as gold "real" house prices have been stable or declining throughout the last decade the data are telling us that consumer spending is continuing to grow without showing any sign of weakness this is a happy conclusion in spite of the heartburn it is giving to the fed it shows that nothing very bad is happening to the economy as long as consumers experience stability or net gains in the equity value of their homes and as long as unemployment remains low in the face of fed tightening consumers will have no difficulty maintaining the steadily rising stream of spending that is the underpinning of a healthy economy mr ranson and ms russell are principals of h c wainwright &amp co economics
