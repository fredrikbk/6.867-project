de lamour olney theatre center olney sandy spring road olney md &# &# closes june new haven conn at the moment the least frequently revived of anton chekhovs four major plays seems to be "uncle vanya " long wharf theatres new version is the first important american production to have come to my attention since i started writing this column four years ago fortunately it was worth the wait gordon edelstein the companys artistic director has given "uncle vanya" an exceptionally fine staging well cast well designed well lit and well translated this lovely production conveys chekhovs special flavor with unostentatious grace like so many of chekhovs plays and stories "uncle vanya" is a tale of regret thats made more poignant by being partly played for laughs the characters are a group of melancholy russians mired in the quicksand of country life whose dull routine is turned upside down by the arrival of a retired professor from st petersburg william biff mcguire and his younger wife elisabeth waterston their coming awakens astrov marco barricelli sonya jennifer dundas and vanya mark blum to the terrible fact that they have thrown away their youth and each in turn makes a futile effort to break free and start anew "uncle vanya" has been translated and adapted many times most recently by brian friel and david mamet unfazed by precedent mr edelstein has done it over again in an attractively casual style that sits well on the tongue vanyas searing last act confession is a particularly choice example of mr edelsteins approach "i dread each day i want a different life i want to wake up on a bright and beautiful morning and begin a new life with my past gone like smoke " his similarly plain spoken staging keeps the plays comic and tragic elements in perfect equipoise the laughs come right on schedule but so does the heartbreak no less convincing is michael yeargans "our town" like set which appears at first glance to consist of little more than nine chairs and a leafless tree not only does this wide open space suggest the loneliness of astrov sonya and vanya but it gives the members of mr edelsteins cast room to stretch their wings and take flight ms dundas who appeared in the broadway premiere of tom stoppards "arcadia" and the kennedy center revival of "the glass menagerie " is the evenings most valuable player she is by turns childlike breathless and radiant and the simple pathos with which she delivered her curtain speech filled my eyes with tears "all we can do is live our lives well live out the long march of days and endless nights and bear whatever the fates have in store well work without rest for others now and for the rest of our days and when our time comes well go without a sound " sound designer daniel baker presumably deserves credit for using the minimalist music of arvo part and steve reich to accompany this visually spare production give that man a bonus new york patrick hamilton wrote plays and novels about very creepy people most of which are better remembered as movies "gaslight " the tale of a thoroughly nasty victorian husband who tries to drive his terrified wife insane opened on broadway in ran for performances and was then sold to hollywood alas george cukors film version which starred charles boyer and ingrid bergman was so successful that hamiltons original play is now rarely performed save by amateurs and small regional companies i didnt see the pearl theatre companys off broadway revival so i made a point of catching the irish repertory theatres new production which is as usual with that superlative troupe a knockout one reason why this "gaslight" shines so brightly is that charlotte moore has staged it without a trace of irony yes its a mustache twirling melodrama but if you put together a high quality cast and persuade them to play it absolutely straight what seems implausible on paper will become alarmingly believable in the moment thats what ms moore and her players have done and the results speak for themselves david staller laura odeh brian murray and laoisa sexton all give model performances and james morgan the designer has miraculously contrived to squeeze a dark heavily brocaded victorian drawing room onto the irish reps thumbnail sized stage without breaking anything if your spine needs a tingle this is the place to get it olney md now that so many affluent city dwellers are decamping for the suburbs and exurbs who will keep them amused the olney theatre center located more or less midway between baltimore and washington is an ancient summer stock house it started life in as a roller rink that used to be somewhere in the middle of nowhere then a suburb grew up around it and the company retrofitted itself as a sprawlingly attractive three stage complex that presents an ambitious year round schedule of straight plays and musicals i came out to olney to see georges feydeaus " rue de lamour " a seven door farce three doors in the first act four in the second whose subject matter is as usual with feydeau adultery american farces are about money english farces about class french farces about sex modern productions of classic french farces rarely leave well enough alone and john going has directed " rue de lamour" in an eyebrow waggling style that wasnt wholly to my liking farce is funniest when its chaos beset participants keep the straightest of faces but mr goings energetic cast slams doors and jumps in and out of bed with more than enough gusto to keep the comic ball rolling and james wolks nifty sets look like a pair of toulouse lautrec posters come to life i very much look forward to seeing how the olney theatre center handles heavier fare mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts
