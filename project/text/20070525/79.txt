some doctors quit injecting drugs over costs like many americans who rely on medications that are injected or infused leonida mattioli an year old new york area anemia patient on medicare used to get his injections from his doctor but this year he has had to get them at a hospital because his doctor can no longer afford to supply the drugs mr mattioli says he liked the old way better at his doctors office he had "a feeling of being helped " he says in the hospital "theres a feeling of waiting its not as convenient and you dont feel as comfortable " mr mattiolis doctor is one of thousands of small practitioners who are getting out of the business of administering drugs for conditions ranging from anemia and cancer to arthritis and infections forcing hundreds of thousands of patients to get the drugs elsewhere it is an unintended consequence of a change in the way medicare reimburses doctors for a class of drugs that are most often injected or infused the change is hurting small medical practices in particular because most of them dont buy enough of any one drug to get the big rebates or discounts that drug companies offer to large customers making matters worse medicare now reimburses doctors based on a drugs average sales price and the big rebates to large customers have driven down medicare reimbursements especially for expensive antianemia drugs edward ambinder one of two doctors in a new york oncology practice says he loses money on antianemia drugs he pays &# for one unit dose of procrit he says and medicare reimburses him only &# competitor drugs also leave him with a loss "i think theres got to be some fair way to reimburse physicians so that theres not a penalty in using some of the drugs we need for our patients " says the doctor who is also a professor of medicine at mount sinai school of medicine and president of the new york state society of medical oncologists and hematologists some doctors are pushing back by lobbying to change the system of average sales prices the advocacy group community oncology alliance is a major proponent of the community cancer care preservation act a bill introduced in february that seeks changes including excluding some discounts when calculating the average sales price the heavy price discounting started right before medicares new reimbursement policy took effect as amgen inc and johnson &amp johnsons ortho biotech unit battled to solidify the market shares of drugs that treat anemia in cancer and kidney failure patients amgen promotes its antianemia drug aranesp by packaging it and attractive rebates with the cancer support drug neulasta an amgen spokesman says the discounts are available for volume users who dont purchase other amgen products ortho biotech offers aggressive discounts on volume sales of its competing procrit over the past two years the average sales prices for both aranesp and procrit have dropped medicare reimbursement for a microgram dose of aranesp was &# in january down from &# two years earlier when the medicare change was made according to the center for medicare &amp medicaid services the government agency that administers federally funded health programs meanwhile reimbursement for a unit dose of procrit dropped to &# from &# the increased competition between drug companies comes as government scrutiny of drug marketing is growing earlier this week the new york attorney general requested marketing and sales material from amgen and ortho biotech about their antianemia drugs ortho biotech says its subpoena requested documents related to sales marketing medical education and clinical trials of procrit in a securities and exchange commission filing amgen reported that its subpoena also asked for documents related to pricing and contracting both companies say they are cooperating with the requests they also defend their rebates "the federal government expressly permits rebates and discounts " an ortho biotech spokeswoman says "the federal reimbursement system and related federal regulations encourage companies to provide discounts and rebates to customers in a competitive environment " says an amgen spokesman "amgen firmly supports oncologists decisions regarding patient needs and our physician contracts are designed to ensure access to our products " he adds that "amgens product discounts and rebates are fully reported to the government and lower costs to patients physicians and medicare " doctors who buy their drugs in higher volumes can still afford to treat medicare patients in their offices frederick schnell part of the five doctor central georgia cancer care group and president of the alliance seeking corrections to the reimbursement rules buys enough aranesp and neulasta to get a rebate from amgen that provides a profit after medicare reimbursement of about &# a dose last year his practice made about &# from aranesp rebates he says which pay for the practices square feet of office space employees and large pharmacy "community oncologists dont ask for rebates " says dr schnell "theyre simply part of the system " the pricing also affects what drugs some doctors offer seymour cohen with the four doctor group oncology consultants in new york says he hardly ever uses aranesp because of the way amgen bundles it with neulasta and because he isnt taking advantage of the bundling he uses neulasta only when he absolutely has to "if someones life is on the line ive got to lose &# " he says in addition some hospitals and doctors used to waive the medicare co pays for patients who couldnt afford them but now theyre less likely to be able to afford to do so and instead are becoming more aggressive about collecting squeezing patients financially for patients who require expensive intravenous treatments such as certain cancer patients the co pays can balloon to thousands of dollars medicares acting administrator leslie v norwalk says that doctors can enroll in a government program called the competitive acquisition program it allows doctors to order drugs directly from a vendor which then bills medicare and doctors are paid only to administer the drugs dr schnell says that most of the oncology community views the medicare assistance program "as impractical and unworkable " in part because it requires a lot of uncompensated administrative work but medicare defends the program "like any program we learn as we go forward and as we go along well make enhancements for greater improvements " says herb kuhn medicares acting deputy director centocor a j&amp j unit that makes an infused anti inflammatory drug called remicade has also run afoul of doctors with a new incentive based discount program in after medicare changed its reimbursement system centocor introduced much deeper discounts for physicians who bought more of the drug leading a physician group the american college of rheumatology to complain centocor says it responded by adjusting the tiered system but it is still getting complaints from doctors about a more recent price increase some doctors who treat infectious diseases especially with iv immunoglobulin to boost a patients immune system are also sending medicare patients to the hospital for drug infusions larry martinelli the managing partner in a two person infectious disease practice in lubbock texas stopped administering ivig to medicare patients last year the cost of the drug went up to &# a gram he says and he could get only &# a gram as reimbursement "do the math it gets real ugly real quick " he says john carreyrou contributed to this
